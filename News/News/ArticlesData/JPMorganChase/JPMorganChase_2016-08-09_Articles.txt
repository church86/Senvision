One year later, the renminbi, as the currency is also known, appears set to slide, but markets aren't taking fright. On August 11, 2015, China shifted the market mechanism for setting the yuan's daily fix against the dollar, saying it would set the spot rate based on the previous day's close, theoretically allowing market forces to play a greater role in its direction. China's policy makers allow the yuan to move within a 2 percent band around the daily fix and fixings in the past had been a bit more arbitrary. The central bank also set the reference rate 1.9 percent below the previous day's fix, marking the steepest one-day decline in at least 20 years. The move revived concerns over the health of China's economy, the world's second-largest, and sparked fears of a "currency war." Chinese equities, which had already tumbled amid excessive margin buying, plummeted further and dragged most other risky assets along with them. "The world went into this crazy panic about it, which was quite extraordinary because we'd watched the yen and the euro depreciate quite rapidly in 2014 and people came out with all these theories about why China was much more significant," Adrian Mowat, chief Asian and emerging market equity strategist at JPMorgan, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. "Now, I think we've got much more mature currency markets and they recognize the fact that renminbi, like every other currency, should move up and down and we shouldn't be overly dramatic about the impact of it," he said. Mowat expected that after the currency's around 7 percent decline over the past year, it likely has another 1-2 percent more to go this year. The new policy on the fix wasn't the only change for the renminbi. In December, China introduced a new exchange rate index that valued the yuan against a basket of 13 trade-weighted currencies, which was read at the time as the country preparing for a stronger dollar as the U.S. Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates. Analysts said at the time that by focusing attention on the currency's value against a broader range of currencies, China should be able to allow the yuan to gradually fall against the dollar without sparking market unease. But it still set off yet another round of fund outflows from the mainland. Capital outflows, which had picked up after the stock market tumble and the hefty devaluation, continued after the introduction of the index. China suffered almost $700 billion worth of capital flight in 2015, according to the Institute of International Finance. Beijing logged $100 billion per month in average currency outflow during November, December and January but the pace of outflows had tapered off in more recent months, with net foreign exchange sales by commercial banks at $23.7 billion in April, down from $36.4 billion in March, Reuters reported. The surge in outflows late in 2015 sparked market concerns that China's foreign reserves weren't sufficient to stabilize the currency. In July, reserves fell to $3.20 trillion, off a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014, according to Reuters. The decline over the previous month was however, more modest at $4.10 billion. China's foreign reserves had fallen by a record $513 billion last year, according to Reuters. There have been some clear changes to how the yuan trades since the policy adjustment that have provided a semblance of stability. Volatility has also ebbed somewhat due to efforts by the central bank to discourage speculators from betting on further declines in the yuan, particularly in Hong Kong, the hub for trading offshore yuan. For instance, the central bank aggressively purchased yuan in Hong Kong earlier this year to reduce the amount of spare renminbi in the banking system, effectively making it more expensive to borrow the currency. The currency has begun to track broader dollar movements better than prior to the fixing reform last year, noted Patrick Bennett, a strategist at CIBC Capital Markets. But analysts had noted that the fixing didn't always closely track the currency basket. show chapters China's currency war?    Wednesday, 10 Aug 2016 | 12:45 PM ET | 02:55 "That type of market movement has been sought and is welcome by monetary authorities, even if there is still a degree of disbelief at the transparency of the fixing process," Bennett said in a note last week. He noted that People's Bank of China (PBOC) official have said they would keep the exchange rate "basically stable" at an equilibrium level, but "that doesn't say in equilibrium with what, and we firmly believe the yuan will depreciate further in coming months as China continues its push to export more capital and more product." Others were less concerned with the yuan's weakness than in how the policy changes affected the market's view of Chinese policy makers. The yuan may have weakened amid the policy turmoil, but that hasn't affected China's economy much, Julian Evans-Pritchard and Chang Liu, economists at Capital Economics, said in a note last week. "There were few signs a year ago that a strong renminbi had been undermining Chinese competitiveness," the economists noted. Since then, the weaker yuan hasn't stoked inflation and any gains in export competitiveness were small compared with other emerging market currencies, they noted. But the two added that the launch of the new policy was "botched," leaving open the risk of further blunders ahead. "In both cases, it was the markets' distrust of the PBOC's intentions rather than the changes themselves which caused depreciation pressure to surge," the duo said. "A year on, investors appear slightly more relaxed about movements in the renminbi, but we suspect that they remain as wary as ever about trusting Chinese policymakers to keep their word."

(MICHAELA REHLE/REUTERS) Debt is fuelling the most stock buybacks since 2001 Add to ... LU WANG Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, Aug. 09, 2016 5:04PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Aug. 09, 2016 7:36PM EDT Comments AA As earnings stagnate, U.S. companies looking to charge up their stock returns with repurchases are turning to debt markets like no time since the dot-com bubble. Led by Apple Inc. and CBS Corp., S&P 500 constituents have rushed to sell bonds to finance the repurchases of their own stock. The proportion of buybacks funded by debt rose above 30 per cent in June for the first time since 2001, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bloomberg show. The willingness to borrow shows how loath chief executives are to give up what has been the most consistent source of demand for equities the last few years. Though more company cash flow is used on capital investments than investors probably think, the data highlight one of the many hazards for bulls should the earnings recession lengthen or borrowing costs rise. “It tells a lot of things about how cheap capital is and where the investment opportunities are,” said Matthew McGeary, a Stowe, Vermont-based fund manager with Eagle Asset Management, which oversees about $31-billion (U.S.). “Companies are still struggling to find growth and buying back shares is a good way to grow per-share earnings. But you should think about the sustainability of this strategy.” Using proceeds from debt sales to send cash to stockholders is getting more popular as five quarters of profit declines contributed to a financing deficit that JPMorgan analysts say will last for the rest of the year. Should the U.S. Federal Reserve raise interest rates for a second time, stock repurchases may become the first casualty as borrowing costs go up. Buybacks are already slowing amid the worst profit slump since the global financial crisis and as the S&P 500 sits near a record high. After snapping up trillions of dollars of their own stock in a five-year shopping binge that dwarfed every other buyer in the equity market, companies such as IBM Corp. have put on the brakes, with total announced repurchases falling 18 per cent in 2016 from the average pace in the last three years. Bucking the trend of deceleration, debt-funded buybacks are on the rise. About $157-billion of repurchases were backed by new debt issuance in the 12 months through June, 8 per cent higher from a year earlier. Last month, Apple sold $7-billion in bonds in its third undertaking this year to add debt for shareholder return and CBS raised $700-million from a debt offering with part of the proceeds intended for buybacks. One reason it’s happening is that cash flow from operations isn’t enough to cover outlays from plant upgrades to acquisitions. While $425-billion of internal funds were generated in the second quarter, that was about $35-billion short of what was needed for things such as capital spending and dividends, data compiled by JPMorgan show. At $151-billion, fixed investment remained the largest use of funds. The rush to borrow amid falling bond yields have pushed debt to 32 per cent of total assets at non-financial firms in the S&P 500, the highest level since 2008. The increase in leverage means further cuts in buybacks are likely should rates go higher, according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, an equity strategist with JPMorgan. Unlike dividends that tend to be consistent, companies are less reluctant to put buybacks on hold. The influence of corporate buybacks on share performance has shown signs of waning. Since peaking in February, 2015, an S&P 500 index of companies repurchasing the most shares has lost 5.6 per cent, compared with a 1.4-per-cent gain in the equal-weight index of the benchmark gauge. “Companies have massively loaded balance sheet. When higher rates start kicking in, that’s basically going to be additional headwinds,” Mr. Lakos-Bujas said by phone. “Buybacks have supported equity prices a lot in this cycle and could be less of a tailwind.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail What will the new S&P Buyback Index tell us?

 A hot finance startup led by a former JPMorgan high-flier has put together a dream team of hires Tina Wadhwa Aug. 2, 2016, 11:48 AM 9,642 facebook linkedin twitter email print Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters on stage at Money2020. Business Insider/Oscar Williams-Grut Digital Asset Holdings, the buzzy blockchain startup run by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters, has assembled a dream team of new hires. The firm is building out its senior team with eight high-profile hires spread across New York, London, and Frankfurt. Among the new hires are: Carol Mathis has joined as CFO. She previously served as COO and CFO at RBS. Josh Varsano joined as chief human resources officer. He previously worked as the global head of human of resources for Point72 Asset Management and as HR managing director at JPMorgan Chase. Kelly Mathieson was hired as product manager. She is a former head of JPMorgan's global collateral management and securities clearing business. Andrew Pisano, who previously built out blockchain strategy at CME Group's Digitization Group, joined as business development director. Gavin Wells, who will be based in London, also joined the DAH team as head of Europe. Wells spent 15 years as a managing director at Citi and most recently delivered the first clearing service for foreign exchange at LCH Clearnet. Gordon Weir has joined as head of delivery. He previously served as head of development transformation across global technology and operations at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Martin Korbmacher has been hired as strategic advisor to help scale Digital Asset Holding's growth and service across European markets. Korbmacher was the former head of investment banking for Germany and Austria at Credit Suisse and will be based in Frankfurt. Digital Asset Holdings aims to use blockchain technology to make the settlement of transactions quicker. Blockchain has the potential to allow a digital asset to be securely and seamlessly transferred from one party to another, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries and shortening settlement time to seconds. This could greatly reduce costs and risk, and create new revenue opportunities by making markets more efficient. Masters joined the startup in March 2015 as CEO. She had previously worked at JPMorgan, where she held several senior positions including head of global commodities, CFO of JPMorgan's investment bank, and head of global credit portfolio and credit policy and strategy. Earlier this year, Digital Asset Holdings announced that it was opening a London office to support its clients and increase its presence in the UK and European markets. The startup is also building out an Australia office following the selection by the Australia Securities Exchange to help replace its existing clearing and settlement system with a blockchain solution. The ASX will decide whether to go through with the change by mid-2017. NOW WATCH: Here's how much $100 is worth in every state Loading video...

Think tanks are non-profit policy research establishments with tax-exempt status, as they are assumed to be doing work to advance the public good, not cater to private interests. Traditional lobbying of the federal government is likewise regulated to promote transparency. When the rules become too onerous, or the public image of a corporation is stained by its overt solicitations for policy change, think tanks become a useful corporate device, the New York Times has found, in a Sunday report jointly researched with the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR). In one instance, drone manufacturer and military contractor General Atomics sought the services of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). With the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in a slump in 2013, fewer drones were being sold to the US military. The California-based maker of Predator drones needed to find customers abroad, but weapons trade restrictions at the time prohibited their export. Following a donation of tens of thousands of dollars to CSIS – a small sum compared to other donors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Times reported – the think tank not only completed a study on drone policy and export in 2014, but actually arranged secret meetings in its office headquarters with officials from the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and the State Department as well as the secretary of defense. General Atomics now had prime access to policymakers in the think tank space to advance its business goals. The State Department then released new trade rules in February 2015, encouraging fewer limits on the export of drones, leading to a deal between General Atomics and the United Arab Emirates. The sale of unarmed drones to a non-NATO country was the first of its kind, according to the Times. The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning powerhouse in Washington, had “thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence,” with for-profit businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, the biggest of the big US banks, the Times-NECIR report said. Offering “donation benefits” in its memos, Brookings appeared to “blur the lines” between offering neutral research and corporate public relations, according to the report. Called a “university without students,” Brookings was named “Top think tank in the world” in a 2015 report by the University of Pennsylvania. Founded in 1916, the think tank operates on an average annual income of $107.5 million, according to TheBestSchools.org, which lists it as number 7 of the 50 most influential think tanks in the US. The Times-NECIR report said that dollar figure represents a doubling in the tank’s budget in the last decade. According to the report, JPMorgan made a tax-deductible donation of $15.5 million 2011 to Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, the largest sum of money ever received by the institution from a private company. However, what came out of that gift was a brand new project dubbed the Global Cities Initiative. It even had a logo including the line “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase,” a corporate rebranding tactic some argue. The project encouraged both local economic growth and international trade, of which JPMorgan would have a major stake in through its business loan programs. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” a July 2011 internal Brookings document read, according to the Times-NECIR report. The appearance of quid-pro-quo was not lost on those at Brookings. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” read a 2013 Brookings memo referring to a dinner with JPMorgan executives, the Times reported. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” Based on the documents obtained via an open records request, the report appears to reflect an open secret on Capitol Hill. In September 2015, Brookings lost Robert Litan as a senior fellow economist, after he was accused of withholding information showing a conflict of interest in his own research against financial reform related to retirement advising, the International Business Times reported. The pressure came came from Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who called Litan “an industry player seeking a specific conclusion.” Warren spoke to the New York Times for its recent report, regarding the consequences of special interested-peddled research when it reaches congressional chambers. “[Corporations] take a lot of money, because they got plenty of money to spend. They put it into a think tank, with a few strings attached, and the think tank comes up with the research that just so happens to advance the interests of the corporation,” Warren said, adding, “That then means, right here in the Senate, we can make bad decisions … not decisions that favor the American people.” Brookings executive vice president Martin S. Indyk denies the implied allegations. “We do not compromise our integrity,” Indyk told the New York Times. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact,” adding that Brookings recently disallowed any corporation or corporate-supported entity from contributing anonymously.

It can still take days for a check to go through, a relative eternity that banking regulators worry is impeding commerce and economic growth. The slowness has led many to new mobile services, like PayPal’s Venmo or Square Cash, which make it possible to pay a friend instantly with just a phone. Now, the banks are catching up.  Wells Fargo has joined JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bank in allowing customers to send money in seconds to one another’s bank accounts using just a phone number or email address. Customers of the biggest banks can now use their mobile phones, say, to send money instantly to a child in college who needs cash. “We pay attention to what customers are asking for, and we are doing all the things we need to stay competitive,’’ said Brett Pitts, who leads digital initiatives at Wells Fargo. The stakes are high: Banks are under broad pressure both from the Federal Reserve, which has a “faster payments committee” aimed at requiring immediate improvements, and from tech companies like PayPal and Apple, whose Apple Pay service was a bright spot in its earnings recent report. American bank executives fear that they could lose ground to plucky payment companies like Venmo, a popular choice among millennials who want to pay each other, and send emoji-filled messages to their friends. The banks worry that if they do not respond with their own instant payment offerings, they will be relegated to performing less-profitable back-office functions for hip new payment companies, which make their money primarily by charging small fees to customers who pay by credit card rather than directly from a bank account. The person-to-person payment market is valuable because it allows financial companies to gain the first point of contact with a consumer and then try to sell them other products like loans. Analysts predict that the new payments network could be extended to connect consumers with merchants, providing a potentially lucrative source of fees for banks. “It’s like owning a toll road: You are going to get paid by everybody that uses it,” said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm. MasterCard and Visa, which have a tight grip on payments made with credit and debit cards, are also trying to gain a foothold in these new networks. Last month, MasterCard acquired a majority stake in VocaLink, the company that operates a mobile and internet payment network in the United Kingdom and is helping to develop a broader system in the U.S. Visa recently announced a broad partnership with PayPal that will make both of their offerings more instantaneous. Instant person-to-person payment is something people in many other countries have been able to do for years, and the absence of the service in the United States has been a marker of the relative backwardness of American banks. The banks began developing the system being introduced this year in 2011, when Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo created a network called clearXchange. That system has allowed bank customers to send each other money using just an email address or cellphone number, but transactions were not instant until this year. In addition to payments technology the nation’s largest banks are rolling out this summer, banks in an industry group called the Clearing House are developing a broader network that will allow businesses and governments to make large instant payments. A fast and efficient payment network also has implications for the economy. Federal officials and analysts say the current lag time between when a payment is sent and when the money is cleared to spend can hinder businesses from balancing their books and managing their supplies. The lag also puts the United States at a disadvantage compared with, say, Europe, where banks are far ahead in making payments instantaneous. The banks now face a challenge to make their real-time technology easy enough to lure customers away from startups like Venmo. With Venmo, a user can send money to anyone simply by tapping into the app and entering a phone number or email address. By contrast, customers of JPMorgan Chase, for example, must log into their Chase app using their password, then navigate through a series of somewhat clunky tabs to initiate a transaction with QuickPay.  © 2016 El Paso Inc..

Because it's not just small fry debt collectors involved in this outlandish shakedown of innocent borrowers, but such Wall Street powerhouses as JPMorgan Chase and Citibank. (Image: financialjuneteenth.com) Some corporations engage in such abusive consumer rip-offs that they're just plain evil. But then there are some profiteers that dig even deeper into the dark void of their corporate souls to achieve the ultimate status: TRULY EVIL. Consider the gang of debt collection firms that are thugglishly and lawlessly rampaging across the country ruthlessly abusing consumer rights and common decency. Susan Macharia, a California administrative employee, is one of thousands of middle-income and low-wage workers each year who get robbed by these relentless money grabbers. Out of the blue, she got a rude call in January from a collector demanding she pay $10,000 for a credit card debt she ran up in 2003. Only, Ms. Macharia had no such debt. In fact, as she told the New York Times, she didn't even have a credit card until 2013. Yet, the collection agency declared that it had a copy of a 2006 court judgement for non-payment filed against her, addressed to her California residence — so, pay up, or else! But wait, she lived in Atlanta in 2006, not California. Nonetheless, ignoring facts, the callous collection outfit got a court to rubber stamp an order to let the creditor garnish Macharia's paycheck, effectively stealing $800 a month from her. "I couldn't sleep," she told the Times, "and I lost so much weight because I couldn't eat. There was so much stress. And I knew I hadn't done it!" Luckily, however, a group named Public Law Center took her case, went straight to the company she supposedly owed, and showed its executives the obvious errors in the collection agency's debtor file. Embarrassed, the company called off its attack dogs and returned the money it had taken from her paychecks. Few are so fortunate, however. This collection firm and hundreds like it are still marauding across the land, with some 3,000 people a month filing formal complaints that they're being hounded mercilessly for debts they do not owe. It amounts to legalized highway robbery. Speaking of robbery, Donnie Trump thinks we should elect him and his fellow Republicans, as they claim to be the law 'n order party. So, why would they try to kill the sheriff and unleash thousands robbers to run wild across America? The sheriff they want to kill is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the robbers are these disgusting, unethical debt collectors like the one Susan Marcharia encountered. These thieves that Donnie & Gang are out to help are the nationwide web of corporate debt collectors who pay pennies on the dollar to buy huge data bases of overdue bills — then hound the borrower to pay up. They are the hired hit men of credit card giants, Wall Street mortgage packagers, and other corporate creditors — and they profit from weak regulations that let them bully, harass, rob, and run roughshod over tens of thousands of consumers every year with illegal tactics — including people who've already paid off their debt or never even incurred it. Every year, the debt collection firms routinely abuse the law and overload our courts by rotely filing hundreds of thousands of lawsuits against debtors. Masses of these suits are backed only by flimsy, out-of-date, erroneous, forged, or non-existent evidence. Collectors don't care about the evidence, for their intent is not to win in court, but to frighten or bamboozle barrowers into paying money they don't owe. To its credit, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently sided with the victims of this corporate thievery, proposing new rules to stop the outlandish abuse. The Trumpist Republicans have responded with outrage — not at the corporate outlaws, but at the sheriff! Their 2016 party platform advocates for abolishing the consumer bureau, calling it a "rogue agency" for daring to stand up to the real rogues that're openly robbing workaday Americans. Why is the GOP so shamefully-soft on crime? Because it's not just small fry debt collectors involved in this outlandish shakedown of innocent borrowers, but such Wall Street powerhouses as JPMorgan Chase and Citibank — which are also generous political donors to Republican candidates.

Retake All-Time Highs? JPM is close to record highs, but where it goes beyond that is a tough call By Dan Burrows, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 9, 2016, 11:32 am EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Just Hit Another Bump in the Road Recent Posts: Twitter Inc. (TWTR) Stock Set to End 2016 with a Whimper Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock’s Rebound Underscores the Buy Case General Electric Company (GE) Stock Hasn’t Looked This Healthy in a While View All Posts Shares in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) jumped on last week’s blowout jobs report and now investors have to feel good about JPM stock’s chance to reclaim record levels soon. At $66 and change, JPM stock isn’t that far off its all-time closing high. Nine months ago, it was knocking on the door of $69 a share. That represents less than 5% in additional upside after Friday’s move of 2.7%. The technicals are favorable, the market is setting new records session after session and the news flow continues to support a Federal Reserve rate hike sooner than later. But beyond that milestone, JPM could very well be priced to disappoint. A number of Wall Street analysts certainly think so. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz on Monday cut his rating on JPMorgan to neutral. The market will enjoy a September rate hike if it does indeed come to pass, but the analyst says it’s going to take more than that. The 7 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now After all, banks need a sustained cycle of tightening that creates a steeper yield curve. A one-off rate hike isn’t going to cut it. Horowitz has a target price of $65 on JPMorgan stock, which implies there’s downside ahead. Overestimating JPM Stock? A neutral view on JPM stock isn’t exactly a popular view, Horowitz acknowledges. From his note to clients: “JPMorgan is probably one of the most consensus longs on the buy side and sell side (76% of the 38 analyst ratings are Buy), which we believe is reflective of a strong management team that has been able to weather the tough macro and regulatory environment better than peers. So in the context of a group that we view as fairly valued at 10.3% cost of equity… and our view that JPMorgan forward EPS estimates are about 2% too high for 2017 and 2018, we no longer see significant near term upside (15% over one year) to warrant a Buy.” But it is wise for investors in bank stocks to curb their enthusiasm about the next Fed rate increase. Yes, this will begin to relieve some pressure on banks’ net interest margins, but short-term rates are still going to be sitting at pitiful levels. The central bank is hardly opening the spigot. After the immediate celebratory upside of a rate hike, JPM stock will face fundamentals that haven’t changed all that much. Whether that sets it up for underperformance remains to be seen, but there are other big bank stocks offering better bets. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

I’m here to help you manage your money, find a job and pay off student loans — all the real-world stuff no one taught us how to do in college. Send your questions about postgrad life to askbrianna@nerdwallet.com. This week’s question: “I need money and I’m thinking about driving for Lyft or Uber, or working for another app that lets me set my own hours. Is that a good idea?” With the release of every cheekily named on-demand app comes a new way for 20- and 30-somethings to make money on the side. Got a car? Drive for Lyft or Uber. Got a couple of hours to kill? Deliver cookies or cold medicine for Postmates. Got a knack for assembling furniture? Make money doing it with TaskRabbit. (Also, there’s an Ikea wardrobe in my apartment with your name on it.) The explosion of the “gig economy” — the collection of online platforms that let workers sell their services directly to consumers on their own schedules — has lowered the barrier to entry for workers who need money quickly. The flexibility a gig affords can help you make extra money to pay off your student loans early, for instance, or to pay bills during gaps between jobs. That’s how most workers use online platforms now. But the larger story of the move toward temporary work worries me. I’m not cool with the idea that my generation must cobble together multiple jobs at odd hours without enjoying a 401(k) match or paid sick time. Gigs aren’t replacements for full-time jobs with benefits, and it’s worth considering what we give up if, increasingly, they’re our only options. Gigs small but growing Today, the gig economy isn’t all that big. Between 2012 and 2015, just 0.4% of adults earned income consistently each month using online labor platforms like Uber, the JPMorgan Chase Institute found. Most gig workers supplemented lost income during periods of low earnings or when they were between jobs. As of September 2015, more than 80 percent of workers who used online labor platforms made less than 25% of their total income from that work. But over the three years JPMorgan Chase performed its study, the percentage of adults who earned money regularly from online gigs grew tenfold. And the growth of gigs extends beyond online platforms. In March, researchers at Harvard and Princeton found that from 2005 to 2015, the percentage of workers in “alternative work arrangements,” defined as online and offline temporary, on-call, freelance and contract work, went up 50%, to 15.8% of all workers. That accounts for all the net employment growth in the U.S. economy in that time. More flexibility, less money The problem is that temporary, contract and other “contingent workers” earn less overall than employees in standard work arrangements, the Government Accountability Office reported last year. They’re more likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance. They’re two-thirds less likely to have a retirement plan at work. Olivia West, a singer-songwriter and mother of two based in Nashville, Tennessee, drives for Lyft to help pay the bills. She says she makes $250 to $450, before taxes, driving 25 to 50 hours a week between shows. “Per hour I make a lot more singing than I do driving, but those gigs are harder to find,” she says. “The driving app is always there, filling the need.” She used to clean houses to make extra money, but that paid less and was more physically demanding than driving for Lyft. She only just started a savings account for emergencies, and car maintenance and gas eat into her earnings. She’s not saving for retirement. Do-it-yourself benefits When you work for yourself, it’s up to you to find health care (made easier by the Affordable Care Act) and save for retirement beyond what Social Security will provide. In addition, you don’t have access to unemployment insurance if you’re laid off. “These are things you’re going to have to kind of hack yourself when you’re working as your own boss,” says Katie Bryan, communications director for America Saves, a campaign run by the Consumer Federation of America. That means setting up automatic transfers each month to a savings account for emergencies — aim to save $500 to start — and for the taxes you might be on the hook for. Save for retirement now in an individual account like a Roth IRA to take advantage of compound earnings over time, or set up a free myRA starter account, newly available through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. You can transfer your money to a higher-earning account later. In the meantime, lawsuits continue over whether gig economy participants should be classified as employees or as independent contractors. Some proposals, like this one from the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project, argue they should be considered an entirely separate class of worker so they get certain traditional benefits. “I would like to see workers who are involved in the gig economy receive some of the same protections that traditional employees receive and coverage under some of the same laws,” says Alan Krueger, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and co-author of the Hamilton Project proposal. Until that happens, set up an online savings account; there’s no paid sick time if you need some of that Postmates cold medicine for yourself. Brianna McGurran is a staff writer at NerdWallet.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Cucinella went after Sean Stewart on cross-examination, repeatedly asking about lies as she sought to discredit the Yale University-educated 35-year-old, who was making nearly $1 million annually before his arrest last year. She wanted to know if Stewart lied to JPMorgan Chase & Co., where he was a vice president, when the company confronted him in 2011 over stock trades carried out by his father before two public companies merged. He said he did. She wanted to know if he persuaded his brother to lie about his nightlife so his wife wouldn't get angry at him. He said he did. She asked if his father lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission. He said he did. VIDEOS TOP JOBS And she wanted to know if he lied when he promised to obey his bail conditions rather than drain money from an account put up as collateral. He said he did. "I was shocked at the time," Stewart said. "I had done nothing wrong." Later, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah McCallum took her turn during closing arguments to dissect Stewart's claims that he had no idea his father would trade on information he divulged as part of his tight relationship with his parents. She noted that Stewart's father frequently bought stock or options in companies involved in five mergers or acquisitions soon after communicating with him and often after a major development in the deals. "Five times the defendant handed his father tomorrow's news today," McCallum said, explaining how advanced knowledge of a merger would allow an investor to score a 20 percent gain or more on the day the deal is announced. The prosecutor said his testimony over two days revealed "a story totally at odds with the evidence in this case." She added: "The problem is the defendant's story is false." As an example, she described Stewart's lies to protect himself and his father when JPMorgan lawyers asked if his father learned about a merger from anything he said. "The defendant told this forest of lies, and the devil was in the details," she told jurors. A month after the interview, Stewart went to work for Perella Weinberg Partners LP, turning down a promotion JPMorgan had offered for him to stay. During a closing argument, defense lawyer Martin Cohen repeated the defense assertion that Stewart's father, Robert Stewart, who has pleaded guilty and been sentenced to a year of home detention, was to blame. "What he did is so horrible it's hard to understand," Cohen said. When Sean Stewart testified earlier Monday, he blamed his father, saying he'd "made some terrible mistakes" and his actions had "resulted in the loss of my career and reputation."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident After unusual election, lawmakers draft pile of bills seeking to make changes BYU basketball: Title belt at stake as Cougs get rematch with Valparaiso Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

S&P 500 2,201.96 -0.98 (-0.04%) Dow 30 19,065.34 41.47 (0.22%) US stocks close lower as oil falls nearly 2.5 percent; energy lags Fred Imbert CNBCAugust 10, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Getty Images. Stocks fell as the recent rally in equities eased and investors digested falling oil prices, as well as quarterly results from retail firms.More Stocks closed lower on Wednesday as the recent rally in equities eased and investors digested falling oil prices, as well as quarterly results from retail firms. The benchmark S&P 500 closed 6 point lower, as energy — the biggest laggard — dropped approximately 1.4 percent. "It looks like a normal, healthy pullback," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at Sarhan Capital. "Even under the surface, ... we see orderly selling." "At this point in time, investors are looking for a reason to sell, and they can't find it," he said. "As long as these pullbacks are short, the bulls remain in control." The Dow Jones industrial average dropped about 40 points lower, with ExxonMobil contributing the most losses. "I think the market is generally complacent, so any bit of news will move the market one way or the other," said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial. "Last year, it was similar. Volumes were low, the market was complacent, and then we got the big news from China." The Nasdaq composite underperformed, closing about 0.4 percent lower, as Apple fell 0.7 percent and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) dropped nearly 2 percent. Oil futures seesawed Wednesday, with U.S. crude (New York Mercantile Exchange: @CL.1) 2.48 percent lower, at $41.71 lower after the Energy Information Administration's weekly inventories data release. The data showed U.S. commercial crude inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels to a total of 523.6 million last week. Analysts expected the EIA to cite a drawdown of about 1 million barrels each in both domestic crude and gasoline inventories. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. said a build in inventories may pressure oil prices, but the knock-on effect on equities should not be small. "The world is awash in oil, but it's not because the economy is faltering," he said. Before the bell, Michael Kors (KORS) posted quarterly results that beat expectations on both lines, but the stock was down 2.5 percent. Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren (RL) shares popped more than 9 percent after its earnings came in sharply above expectations. "The one think that we've found with the consumer ... is people have really over-estimated the impact of lower energy prices for the consumer," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. Kohl's, Macy's and Nordstrom are scheduled to post results on Thursday. U.S. stocks have traded in a tight range recently, while the CBOE Volatility index (VIX) (^VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, has held near one-year lows. On Wednesday, the Vix traded 7 percent higher, near 12.5. "Barring a shock, I think the market is going to be pretty quiet over the next few weeks," JPMorgan's Kelly said. "I think we'll be relatively flat for a while for two reasons. First, Earnings season is mostly over, and that created positive support for stocks. Second, economic news ... is expected to be mixed," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "Overall, we're looking at a flat market for a while as investors reassess [the recent rally]." That said, the S&P and the Nasdaq notched all-time intraday highs Tuesday. "Stretched valuations have made it difficult for value managers to put money to work. The economic data remains mixed as evidenced by yesterday's lousy Productivity report," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Wednesday note to clients. "The bulls have had their way with the bears after the broader indices bottomed in the immediate aftermath of United Kingdom's referendum pertaining to its status within the European Union. Although a significant amount of long term uncertainty surrounds Brexit, the fears associated with the shocking result on June 23 seems comical in hindsight," Klein said. On the data front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) report showed an increase to 5.624 million job openings in June. U.S. Treasurys advanced, with the two-year note yield falling to about 0.7 percent, while the benchmark 10-year yield held around 1.51 percent. The Treasury Department sold $23 billion worth of 10-year notes at a high yield of 1.503. The auction saw weak demand. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, with the euro rising to $1.117 and the yen falling to 101.3.

In Asia, the Shanghai composite fell 0.23 percent, while the Nikkei 2225 dropped 0.18 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average (Dow Jones Global Indexes: .DJI) closed 37.39 points lower, or 0.2 percent, at 18,495.66, with ExxonMobil leading decliners and Wal -Mart the top advancer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 6.25 point, or 0.29 percent, to end at 2,175.49, with energy leading six sectors lower and consumer staples leading advancers. The Nasdaq composite (^IXIC) closed 20.90 points lower, or 0.4 percent, at 5,204.58. Decliners were a step ahead of advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 749.35 million and a composite volume of 3.181 billion at the close. Gold futures for December delivery settled $5.20 higher at $1,351.90 per ounce. —Reuters contributed to this report. On tap this week: *Planner subject to change.

Blackstone affiliates offered 42.4 million shares in a secondary offering, and issued the remaining 455,585 shares to partners, Brixmor said in a statement Wednesday. The landlord isn’t selling any shares and won’t receive any proceeds. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities are the underwriters for the stock sale. Blackstone built Brixmor in 2011 through the roughly $9 billion purchase of more than 500 strip centers from Australia’s Centro Properties Group, and took the New York-based company public in October 2013 as commercial-property markets were rebounding from the crash. The real estate investment trust is the second-biggest U.S. owner of shopping centers, after Kimco Realty Corp. Brixmor shares tumbled 20 percent on Feb. 8 after its chief executive officer, Michael Carroll, and two other executives quit following a discovery by its audit committee that employees were “smoothing” quarterly income. The REIT named James M. Taylor as president and CEO in April. The stock has since recovered, closing Tuesday at $28.10, up 8.8 percent for the year. The shares provided a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 55 percent since their initial public offering. In nominal dollars, Brixmor’s IPO was the largest of a retail REIT since Simon Property Group Inc., the world’s biggest owner of shopping malls, went public in 1993.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience. Apple Inc. (AAPL): Call the War Chest Waahmbulance! InvestorPlace 8/10/2016 Charles Sizemore © Jerome Favre/Bloomberg The Apple Inc. logo is displayed at one of the company's stores in Hong Kong. People come from all around the world to see Mount Everest. But if you lived in Nepal and saw it lurking in the distance every day, it might not seem nearly as impressive. You might take it for granted or even dismiss it as no big deal.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.06 -0.74 -0.66% Twitter Inc TWTR ▼ 18.24 -0.40 -2.12% Kellogg Co K ▼ 73.32 -1.17 -1.57% That’s really where we are today with Apple (AAPL) and the absolutely gargantuan Apple cash hoard. The tally for Apple’s cash and marketable securities has been so large for so long that no one really pays attention to it anymore. In fact, it seems the most common thing I hear said about the Apple cash stockpile these days is that “it’s really not that big.” People cite the fact that much of the quoted cash pile is really longer-term securities and remind you about Apple’s debt and potential tax implications. Frankly, that’s ridiculous. Apple Has a Lot of “Cash” Even allowing for a massive tax haircut, AAPL’s cash hoard would rank as one of history largest treasures … a fortune that would make Croesus blush. As of Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report, the company had $231.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. The Apple cash balance — the gross number, before any debt or tax considerations — would represent the 13th-largest company in the world: bigger than Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG), and just a few billion shy of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). 9 Stocks That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Of course, Apple’s cash is mostly overseas, while Apple’s $72.4 billion in debt is mostly domestic. But let’s pretend that AAPL suddenly got religion and decided it wanted to be debt-free now. And let’s further assume that Apple wanted to move its entire cash hoard stateside because … go America! And let’s take this one step further and assume that Apple is paying the full 35% U.S. corporate tax rate on the whole pile of money. (None of these are realistic assumptions, mind you, but let’s go through the exercise anyway.) After taxes, Apple’s $231.5 billion in cash and securities becomes $150.5 billion. That would still put the Apple cash hoard in the top 30 largest companies in the S&P 500 … about on par with Phillip Morris International (PM). After stripping out the $72.4 billion in debt, the $150.5 billion becomes $78.1 billion. That’s still not exactly chump change. In fact, that’s nearly double the average (mean) market cap of all S&P 500 companies and more than four times bigger than the median market cap of all S&P 500 companies! And remember, this all assumes the absolute worst-case scenario for taxes. Were Apple to actually attempt to repatriate its cash, it would likely negotiate much better terms. After all, if AAPL really thought it was going to get hit at 35% no matter what … wouldn’t it have gritted its teeth and brought the cash ashore by now? So, yes. The Apple cash hoard is a big deal, no matter how you slice it. Taking a Deeper Look at Apple’s War Chest A skeptic will point out that only $18.2 billion of the $231.5 billion is actual “cash” in the bank. The rest is held in “marketable securities.” That’s true, but let’s dig a little deeper there. The quarterly 10-Q report gives a fair amount of detail as to what makes up the Apple cash hoard: Cash and Marketable Securities Fair Market Value (millions) as of 6/25/2016 Cash$9,118 Money Market Funds$3,318 Mutual Funds$1,587 U.S. Treasury Securities$45,998 U.S. Agency Securities$7,511 Non-U.S. Government Securities$7,177 CDs and Time Deposits$3,729 Commercial Paper$4,708 Corporate Securities$128,898 Municipal Securities$961 Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities$18,515 Total: $231.52 billion The biggest slice of Apple’s portfolio is made up of corporate bonds, which at $128.9 billion comprise about 56% of the total. The accounting sticklers are technically correct when they say these bonds are not technically “cash.” They’re not. Unlike cash and U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds do have credit risk. But credit risk over a diversified bond portfolio is manageable and not particularly concerning. And that other great scourge of bond investors — interest rate risk — isn’t much of an issue because Apple intends to hold them until maturity. But let’s say that Apple needs to unload some of its bonds. As of quarter-end, AAPL was sitting on modest capital gains of about $1.3 billion on its total portfolio and about $750 million on its corporate bonds. So, even allowing for slight slippage due to transactions costs, Apple could liquidate its portfolio for cash if it needed to. But the key takeaway here is that Apple’s marketable securities — while not technically “cash” — are close enough to cash for our purposes here. These are bonds, CDs, money market funds and other conservative savings vehicles you might find in the proverbial widows-and-orphans portfolio. Bottom Line: Quit the Nitpicking Yes, while the Apple cash hoard may no longer awe us like it once did … frankly, it should. Apple has managed to maintain its war chest while also embarking on one of the most aggressive dividend and share repurchase programs in history. If all goes as planned, Apple will have delivered more than $300 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases by 2017 since starting the program in 2012. No matter how you slice it, that’s impressive. Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA is the principal of Sizemore Capital Management, a registered investment adviser in Dallas, Texas.
