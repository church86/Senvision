HSBC's New U.S. Retail Chief Is a Veteran of JPMorgan, Amex By Marc Hochstein August 15, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related HSBC U.S. Chief's Global Strategy Relies on Help from Affiliates Fingerprint ID Gets Thumbs-Up at HSBC Less Nag, More Muse: HSBC's Strategy for Its New PFM App HSBC Hires U.S. Retail Banking, Wealth Management Head What Bankers Can Be Thankful for This Year What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal HSBC has hired Anthony Glover, a veteran of JPMorgan Chase and American Express, to be its head of retail banking in the U.S., a newly created position. Glover reports to Pablo Sanchez, the regional head of retail banking and wealth management for the U.S. and Canada. Sanchez, who also used to work at JPMorgan, joined HSBC in mid-2015. "We're growing our business in the U.S.," Sanchez said in a press release. "Tony's deep consumer and retail banking experience will help us to further capitalize on our strategy to be the retail bank of choice for all our customer segments." Glover's job encompasses the duties of the former head of the U.S. retail network, Bill Brown, who left HSBC last month, along with other retail banking responsibilities, a bank spokesman said. Most recently, Glover was the head of corporate development for Chase Merchant Services, the JPMorgan unit that signs up merchants for the card networks. He left that job in October, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Chase in 1998 and served in a variety of senior leadership roles including general manager of affinity credit cards, head of human resources and head of retail banking in regional markets across the country. Before that, he spent 14 years with American Express in various roles in the company's finance organization.

Business JPMorgan says FTSE 100 to surge despite Brexit Michael Bow Monday 15 August 2016 09:56 BST Lighting up: JP Morgan believes the FTSE is well-placed to outstrip other stock markets AFP/Getty JPMorgan, one of the biggest critics of Brexit before the referendum, today declared UK shares would ride out the economic storm and maintain their status as the most attractive destination for global investors.   A triple-whammy of rising commodity prices, crashing bond yields and a boom in exports mean the FTSE 100 is best placed to outstrip other stock markets, especially in Europe, JPMorgan said.  The FTSE 100 is flirting with its record 7089.77 close, reached in April 2015, and rose 24.28 points to 6940.30. The comments are in stark contrast to warnings from JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon who said Brexit could cost up to 4000 UK jobs at the bank.  The ringing endorsement is significant given the barrage of poor economic data from the UK since its decision to leave the trading bloc nearly two months ago.  Read more Nationwide falls but stays bullish on Brexit Britain Manufacturing and service sectors saw a dramatic deterioration in activity last month to their lowest since April 2009 but UK stocks are likely to buck the gloomy trend, the bank said.  “We are not suggesting Brexit negotiations will be all smooth sailing. Still, if political uncertainty spikes again, our view remains that continental equities stand to lose more than the UK ones,” equity strategist Mislav Matejka said.  Rothschild’s view One man not so keen on shares is Lord Rothschild. The veteran investor has slashed exposure to quoted equities at his fund RIT Capital because of “what is surely the greatest experiment in monetary policy in the history of the world”. Listed stocks have fallen from 67% of his portfolio to 59% for the six months ending 30 June. He has bulked up hedge funds and credit investments. “In times like these, preservation of capital in real terms continues to be as important an objective as any in the management of your company’s assets,” he said. A recovery in emerging markets, caused by rising commodity prices, will help. About a third of UK blue-chip stocks’ revenue comes from places like China and India versus 20% for Germany’s DAX index and just 10% for the US S&P 500. The Bank of England’s further foray into quantitative easing will also depress bond yields for longer, giving FTSE 100 stocks an edge over other investment options on the table for stock-pickers around the world. UK dividend yields, a measure of how much income you receive on an investment, are riding high at 3.9%, the highest rate of any major region in the world.  It comes as the 10-year gilt yield hit another record low, at 0.5%, today after poor UK construction data on Friday. The crash in sterling to a 30-year low will also continue to fuel good FTSE 100 earnings growth. Around 72% of FTSE 100 sales come from abroad.

But a long, two-part study by The New York Times last week makes it clear that some — some — think tanks do not fulfill that mandate and, thus, do not deserve their tax-exempt status as an aid to intelligent popular and governmental analysis of issues and policies. Some of them in fact are thoroughly infected with the American political curse of being willing to sell out their integrity for cash. I figured out some decades ago that some of them anyway fell into the category of not being independent thinkers. It was about 1973 when I read  a government-commissioned report by one of them on a country that I knew well. My private research into the genesis of the expensive report made it clear to me, first, that it had been contracted out to provide work to someone’s pet think tank; second, that its “conclusions” were intended to reinforce a particular policy approach; and, third, that it wasn’t very good. The latest study indicates that the American Enterprise Institute, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Brookings Institution, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Hudson Institute, the International Center for Law and Economics, the Monument Policy Group and TechFreedom at least all engaged in for-pay lobbying for companies’ interests in the guise of independent research. Companies paying the think tanks either directly or through funded research included Comcast, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, General Atomics, Google, the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase bank, KKR, Lennar Corp., Microsoft and Verizon. Sums of money paid by the companies to the think tanks were large. JPMorgan Chase paid Brookings $15.5 million; Hitachi paid Brookings $1.8 million, as examples. Subject areas for commissioned “studies” included drone sales and net neutrality. All of the financial exchanges — from the companies to the think tanks and from the think tanks to their “non-resident scholars,” also sometimes known as lobbyists — were tax-free. In other words, the American taxpayer paid a company to pay a think tank as a “charitable contribution” to pay a consultant to prepare a position paper to be used, for example, to influence a congressional committee in making a decision that affected the company and the taxpayer. It gets a lot worse. The think tanks are populated extensively by ex-U.S. government officials. The president of Brookings is Strobe Talbott, who was deputy secretary of state in the Bill Clinton administration. Ex-U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk is executive vice president of Brookings. John J. Hamre, a former deputy secretary of defense, is chief executive of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This is to say that the think tank industry provides ample opportunities for “revolving door” Washington employment practices: Work for the government, get a high-paying job at a think tank that depends in large part for its existence on lobbying the government with tax-free money provided by companies with government contracts. This practice is, of course, not limited to the executive branch. Two more think tank types are former senators Trent Lott (Republican from Mississippi) and Byron Dorgan (Democrat from North Dakota), both affiliated with the Bipartisan Policy Center. And then we wonder why the average American thinks that the government and its officials and ex-officials not only don’t serve him but, in fact, see and use him as a sucker. We do not have to continue to put up with this stuff. First, oversight should be put into the tax-free status of the think tanks. There should be full disclosure of who — particularly what companies — they get, directly or indirectly, their funding from. If Lennar Corp. (home builders) gives $400,000 to Brookings for a study, the “fee for services” should be perfectly clear. We can be entirely sure that the think tank would clear in advance the study prepared with the company that put up the cash before it was released to the tender eyes of Congress or the public. Goodbye to any pretense of impartiality. Also, very clearly, if it is a “fee for service” transaction, the company concerned should not be able to claim the fee it provided the think tank as a “charitable contribution.” That is just nonsense, such an example of fraud as to be almost laughable if the laugh weren’t on us, the taxpayer. Another safeguard should be that the employment history, the affiliations of the researchers preparing the think tank report and their compensation should be clearly indicated in the document. (That information could also make interesting reading for the Internal Revenue Service.) If think tank researcher “X” also just happens to be on the staff or board of a company that has a dog in the fight over the question Congress or the public is supposed to be being informed by in the report, the reader should be able to know it easily. No more Mr. X is a non-resident scholar at the Animal Welfare Institute and is also a non-disclosed member of the board of Flea-Free Fur Treatment Inc. It’s amazing the amount of abuse of us taxpayers can be prevented by sunshine. That’s one of the reasons why independent American newspapers should not be allowed to slink off into the swamps as future fossil fuel.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 15, 2016 3:20pm   Comments Share: Related BFAM Earnings Scheduled For February 8, 2016 Benzinga's Top Initiations Bright Horizons insiders cash in some stock (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan has upgraded Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc (NYSE: BFAM) to Overweight from Neutral, saying the company continues to sustain multiple growth drivers and is entering a period of above-average margin expansion. "Coupled with the faster growing, higher margin Back-up care segment, we feel that BFAM has entered a margin inflection point with its new lease consortium centers," analyst Andrew Steinerman wrote in a note. The analyst noted that Bright Horizons, which has about 60 percent share of the U.S. corporate child care, could achieve long-term organic growth via its market inherent pricing power and secular adoption for its corporate child care centers. Steinerman continued that the margin inflection for the company should come in the form of new lease consortium centers. Bright Horizons currently has 52 new lease consortium centers, and the company's "margins are primed to benefit as the earlier classes reach maturity with fewer ramping classes in the mix." In addition, the analyst said Bright Horizons' track record of about 6–8 percent organic revenue growth (post closings) is expected to continue as about 85 percent of new wins still come from Greenfield opportunities with more employers deciding to offer corporate child care. Related Link: The Stakes Are High For Kohl's This Back-To-School Season Over the intermediate term, the analyst expects Bright Horizons to achieve mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth, an additional 1–2 percent of acquired revenue growth, low-double-digit adj. EBITDA growth, and mid- to high-teens EPS growth. "Consistent 3–4 percent annual tuition increases and dependable growth contributions from the faster growing Back-up/Ed Advisory segments present a sustained growth outlook," Steinerman added. Steinerman raised his 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates to $2.61 and $3.00, respectively, from $2.55 and $2.88. For 2016, the analyst expects earnings of $2.19 a share. The analyst also raised his price target by $6 to $76 on the shares, which, at time of writing, were up 4.35 percent on the day at $68.16. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 15, 2016 1:47pm   Comments Share: Related HD Loosen the Belts: With Thanksgiving Ahead, Volume Could Be Tepid The Sell-Side Reaction To Lowe's Q3 Report InsiderInsights.com Daily Round Up 11/22/16: Gramercy Property Trust, Tronc, Papa Murphys, Flexion Therapeutics (Seeking Alpha) Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) has seen its stock gain nearly 15 percent over the past year and has soared around 350 percent over the past five years. Despite the strong outperformance versus the S&P 500 index, which returned 86 percent over the past five years, analysts at JPMorgan think the Dow-component retailer should be a core long-term holding for investors. In a research report published ahead of Home Depot's earnings print (scheduled for August 16 before market open) Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan acknowledged that this may be the first quarter in some time where investors are no longer asking "what will Home Depot beat comps by." He added that this sentiment may stem from: Vendor commentary indicating a sequential slowdown in the quarter. Retail inventory reductions. Concerns over the promotional environment. Tough comparisons in the back half of 2016. Horvers also highlighted Census Retail Sales in the home improvement category, which decelerated to a 6.4 percent growth in the second quarter from 8.7 percent in the first quarter. However, the analyst argued that the 230 basis point sequential deceleration to Home Depot and rival Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW)'s same-store sales suggests just 40 basis points of downside for Home Depot and 100 basis points of upside for Lowe's. Related Link: High Expectations For Home Depot Earnings, Caution on Staples Horvers also stated that the census data doesn't capture market share gains and any correlations "can misguide when the weather is highly volatile." As such, the analyst is "more positive on the sector." Bottom line, Horvers reaffirmed Home Depot's status as "one of the best long-term stories" in the retail space given its sales and margin profile, the "Amazon-resistant nature" of the industry as well as its "significant" financial and operating leverage that "amplifies" long-term earnings per share growth. "With internal momentum building, we expect HD to benefit from its refocused branding and value proposition, which have driven favorable traffic and ticket trends at the retailer," Horvers concluded. "In addition, internal initiatives enable HD to gain share vs. its competitors." Shares of Home Depot remain Overweight rated with an unchanged $142 price target.

Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} August 15, 2016 11:42am   Comments Share: Related ORIG Watch These 7 Huge Call Purchases In Monday Trade Delphi And Other Companies You May Have Forgotten Were Spinoffs Energy/Materials - Top 5 Gainers / Losers as of 2:00 pm (Seeking Alpha) Related ESV Benzinga's Top Upgrades 20 Stocks Which Rallied Three Days On Increasing Volume Rowan: Buy On Saudi Aramco News (Seeking Alpha) Ocean Rig UDW Inc. (NASDAQ: ORIG) shares plunged more than 61 percent in Friday’s session after the company reported it's continuing to explore the possibility of bankruptcy. Deepwater drilling investors were hoping that crude oil’s surge from February’s low of near $26/bbl to above $51/bbl in June would be enough to keep deepwater stocks afloat. However, a pullback in recent weeks to the low $40s may have extinguished the last bit of hope that Ocean Rig can avoid a bankruptcy. The Ocean Rig news seems to have served as a reality check for other deepwater stocks as well. Transocean LTD (NYSE: RIG) shares fell 4.5 percent on Friday, and ENSCO PLC (NYSE: ESV) shares dropped 3.8 percent to close the week. The market appears to be re-thinking its knee-jerk selloff on Monday, however, as both Transocean and ENSCO have recovered much of their Friday losses. Earlier this month, Susquehanna upgraded Transocean from Negative to Neutral. Related Link: JPMorgan Sees Opportunity In Oil Services, Says M&A Will 'Take Backseat' JPMorgan analyst Sean Meakim doesn’t share the bullish sentiment. In May, Meakim specifically urged investors to avoid offshore oil plays ENSCO, Transocean and Noble Corporation Ordinary Shares (UK) (NYSE: NE). “Highly-levered offshore drillers in particular have mostly exhausted cost reductions and are now tapping the capital markets to avoid longer term cash flow hurdles,” he wrote. Still, at their current depressed share prices, if these offshore drillers can continue to avoid bankruptcy until the oil market significantly improves, the stocks could make for a compelling high-risk speculation play.

(AP Photo/Elijah Nouvelage) Share Written by Janet Guyon August 15, 2016 Everyone knows that retirement is an iffy proposition in the US. Americans either haven’t saved enough, don’t earn enough to salt away a nest egg, or will be faced with a broken Social Security system when we do retire. There’s a solution for all that. You could get a job at one of the companies that still offer defined-benefit pension plans. This is a fancy way to say that if you work for this company long enough–usually at least five years–they will pay you a certain amount every month for the rest of your life when you retire, normally after age 62. Defined benefit plans, or pensions, have gone the way of the dinosaurs in much of corporate America, replaced by 401ks (pdf) which require you to save and invest for retirement on your own. Most companies that offer 401k plans “match” a small portion of what you put in. Even if you contribute the maximum allowed under federal tax laws and your company matches part of that, you’re still subject to the vagaries of things like the stock market. The risk is all yours. But get a job at one of the places below and you’ll buy yourself a certain soothing security. These are the top 10 companies with the biggest defined benefit plans that are still taking new employees. Company Total Defined Benefit Assets (billions) Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. $23.39 Johnson & Johnson $14.36 JPMorgan Chase & Co. $14.02 PG&E Corp. $13.63 Prudential Financial Inc. $12.14 Consolidated Edison of New York $11.89 Merck & Co. Inc. $10.04 Southern Co. $9.46 Eli Lilly & Co. $7.16 Dominion Resources Inc. $6.43 Source: Pensions & Investments (P&I) This list comes courtesy of Aaron M. Cunningham, director of research & analytics at Pensions & Investments, a unit of Crain Communications. About 30 million of the 113 million people working in private industry in the US are still covered by pension plans. While many companies have been cutting pension costs by barring new employees from joining, about 60% of companies with pension plans let new employees participate as of 2012 (the latest year data was available), according to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PDF), the US government entity that insures pension plans. That’s down from 72% in 2008. Companies typically use a formula based on how long you were employed and your average or last years’ pay to calculate your pension at retirement. US companies by law vest pensions after five years of service and pay up to 1.8% of your salary per year of service, according to Christian Weller, a public policy professor at University of Massachusetts, Boston. So if you spent only five years at a company and earned an average of $100,000 a year, you’d get $9,000 a year when you retired. Most people spend more than five years with one employer, however. If you worked at a company for 30 years and earned $100,000 on average during the final few years, and the company’s promise was to pay you annually during retirement 1.5% of that average salary multiplied by years employed, you would get $45,000 a year for the rest of your life. (Participants can sometimes elect to trade lower annual payments for lump sum payouts or survivor benefits for their spouses.) Many US companies that pay pensions also offer 401k plans. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, pays retirees an annual pension and offers a 401k plan that matches their contributions, dollar-for-dollar, for up to 5% of their compensation. JPMorgan employees also have the option to take their pensions as a lump sum in cash rather than as monthly payments. The financial crisis has bolstered people’s support for pensions. According to a 2015 telephone survey conducted by Greenwald & Associates for the National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS), 82% of people in the US think a pension is worth having and 67% say they would take less pay to get a guaranteed income at retirement. Weller says employers are less willing to offer pensions because federal regulations require companies to fund their pension obligations using ever-changing interest rate assumptions. That means from year to year, keeping the pension fund topped up can cost big employers billions. It’s certainly easier to foist responsibility for retirement saving on their employees.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that Patrice Ktorza, 43, a former executive director at the bank, won his claim after a four-day hearing in June, according to a copy of the judgment provided to Bloomberg Friday. The court also said no deductions would be made from any award to Ktorza, unlike other recent cases where cash payments were cut because of the traders’ conduct. Ktorza was suspended in November 2014 for partially filling a trade, a practice the bank stopped salespeople from doing after a review of its business in the wake of the foreign-exchange manipulation scandal. Banks "short fill" or "partial fill" an order when they’re unable to fulfill the total value of a client’s request at the required rate. JPMorgan banned salespeople from short filling in an effort to prevent them from taking risks. "The tribunal is critical of the investigation process inasmuch as the claimant was never interviewed in an investigatory interview in connection with this trade," the court said in the ruling. The change in practice "seems to have been a sudden change rather than as the respondent would have the tribunal accept an ‘evolving landscape.”’ To access the complete Bloomberg News article hit the link below: JPMorgan FX Salesman Wins Dismissal Case in Latest Court Triumph Banks That Lent Failed Trader Millions Get Less Than 4% Back And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

But analysts expect its diversified business model to help it out-perform its industry peers. Founded and still led by chairman Ma Mingzhe, Ping An’s main focus remains insurance, with life and general insurance contributing 57 per cent of its profit last year. Its banking operation delivered 23 per cent of earnings last year, with the remainder split between its asset management and securities businesses. JPMorgan said that diversified portfolio will help the company outpace other pure-life insurance companies, which are expected to see more-dramatic 45-70 falls in six-month returns. Ping An’s banking unit, Ping An Bank, last week reported profit for the first half of 12 billion yuan (HK$14 billion), a 6 per cent interim increase, which JPMorgan said would “support the group’s defensive first half year earnings reporting potential”, given the bank’s profit represents 20-30 per cent of total group net income. Ping An Life restructured its business strategy in June to expand into lower-tier cities... we expect it to have sustained strong new-business momentum in the first half of this year Charles Zhou, Credit Suisse research analyst China Life, the country’s largest life firm, last month warned it expected first half net profit to fall by a whopping 65-70 per cent, while New China Life Insurance and Taiping Insurance red-flagged declines of 45 and 46 per cent, respectively. China Insurance Regulatory Commission last month said the overall industry’s profits fell 54.05 per cent in the half to 105.6 billion yuan, as a result of last year’s strong stock market rally not being repeated. The Shanghai A-shares market hit a seven-year high last year which helped Ping An to a 62.2 per cent growth in interim profit of 34.65 billion yuan in 2015. This year, however, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has declined by more than 16 per cent, making the A-share market the worst performer globally. Credit Suisse research analyst Charles Zhou said Ping An’s earlier reporting in June of a 16.6 per cent rise in first-half premiums, racked up impressively against its 2.7 per cent in general insurance income. “Ping An Life restructured its business strategy in June to expand into lower-tier cities,” Zhou said in a research note last week. “Coupled with the continued success of its high-quality ‘Ping An Fu’ products, we expect it to have sustained strong new-business momentum in the first half of this year.” Zhou said the recent extreme weather in South China could put a dent in Ping An’s claims ratios. “But in view of its geographically diversified portfolio, we expect limited claims pressure from the floods in the first half of this year,” he said. Ping An bought a 47.4 per cent stake in Chinese online business AutoHome for US$1.6 billion from Australian’s Telstra in June, and will utilise the business’s offline network to serve its customers. It also announced last month it was spinning off Ping An Securities and listing it in Hong Kong to raise funds and boost its international exposure. “We expect positive impact from those two transactions, long term,” Zhou said. Morgan Stanley equity analyst Jenny Jiang said the AutoHome deal makes Ping An its single largest shareholder. “We expect more cooperation between the two in areas such as auto sales, and related financial services such as financing and insurance,” she said. Ping An closed at HK$39.05 last Friday, up 1.26 per cent from Thursday. Its shares price has risen 19.97 per cent in the past six months.

Morgan Chase — a record amount compared to equity funds. How's that working out? At least so far this year, pretty well. In the longer run, however, their riskier choices are likely to end badly. The Morningstar US Long Core Total Return Bond index has gained 12.59% in 2016, vs. 8.32% for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index with dividends reinvested. Corporate long-term bonds have gained 14.48%. Powering the bond rally is an enormous thirst for yield, fueled by negative interest rates in nearly a quarter of the world. About $8 trillion of government bonds worldwide offered yields below zero, according to Bloomberg, affecting some 500 million people. Even though the bellwether 10-year Treasury note yields just 1.54%, that yield is far more appealing than a guaranteed loss. Investors' love for bonds continued in July, with intermediate-term bonds seeing an inflow of $15 billion for the month — the largest inflow of any Morningstar category. Intermediate-term bonds, which have gained 4.74% the past 12 months, have led Morningstar's monthly report for the past five months. At the same time, investors — mainly with advisers at their sides — yanked $27.3 billion from U.S. stock funds and $5.3 billion from international stock funds. For the most part, investors seem to be driven by fear, not greed, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “There's a nervousness among investors, given that we're in the 8th year of a bull market,” Mr. Rosenbluth said. Rotating into investment-grade corporates isn't exactly a daring move. “Verizon, ATT, General Electric are all doing fine.” Investors also seem to be less convinced that passively managed fixed income funds are better than actively managed ones, Mr. Rosenbluth said, despite the fact that any supporting data for active management is “mixed at best.” Investors put $13.5 billion into actively managed bond funds, vs. $20.5 billion for passively managed once. In contrast, investors pulled $32.9 billion from actively managed stock funds and added $33.8 billion to actively managed stock funds. The big worry is whether investors are seeking riskier types of bonds in their search for yield. Unfortunately, the answer seems to be “yes.” High-yield bonds, which have returned an average 13.59% this year, saw a $3.2 billion inflow in July. Emerging-markets bond funds saw a $2.9 billion inflow. Those funds have gained 12.88% this year. Rising interest rates could short-circuit any bond rally, although that doesn't seem to be a danger in Europe, where the economy is still stagnant. But both high-yield funds and emerging-markets funds could take significant hits if the U.S. or world economy falls further. 0 Comments What do you think?

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 15, 2016 3:27pm   Comments Share: Master investor Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management has been looking at fintech lately with the formation of Point72 Ventures. It has acquired key talent to run the division, like Pete Casella, formerly of JPMorgan, and Alex Tarhini, from Barclays Techstars, and has made investments in fintech firms like Quantopian. To get an understanding of the firm’s approach to fintech, Benzinga caught up with Casella, who is overseeing its strategic technology investments, and Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer for Point72. A Dynamic Organization Casella said he was motivated to jump to Point72 from JP Morgan because “Point72 is a really dynamic organization that’s very tech forward and has the ability to adopt and put innovative technologies to work.” According to Granade, Point72 is most interested in data analysis and compliance technologies. For example, Quantopian allows its customers to create custom algorithms that will crunch data to power investment strategies. Point72 has allowed the firm to manage up to $250 million of its assets. “We do a great deal of data analysis of all types, whether it’s bringing together large data sets or streams of data or the last-mile of displaying data sources to investment professionals,” said Granade, which spurred the firm’s interest in analytics firms. Fintech Unfinished When asked about the larger impact of fintech on the financial services industry, Granade said he doesn’t think the industry has yet felt the full extent of fintech disruption. “If you look at the industries that technology has massively reshaped, I don’t think finance is one of them yet,” Granade said. “I think finance has kind of been changed at the edges and not at the core. Fintech companies are moving in a highly regulated environment, working in an environment with very powerful and very wealthy incumbents, and so it’s going to take a lot of insight and a lot of fortitude to build these kinds of businesses.” Casella echoed Granade’s point, and sees fintech as maturing to a position where it will be able to solve larger problems rather than just consumer pains. “If you look at the first wave of what people are calling fintech, it has primarily been around consumer user experience and retail products like payments or asset management,” Casella said. “We’re just beginning to see smart entrepreneurs trying to tackle big institutional problems, and Point72 is very well positioned to help these entrepreneurs improve their products and gain market adoption.” Collaboration Interestingly, Casella said Point72 is looking at a collaborative investment strategy, rather than leading investments solo. “We would appreciate the opportunity to work with other smart investors who may be looking at a company if they think that we can uniquely add value to the situation,” Casella said. “If there are venture firms that are investing in the types of assets that we are focused on, we would envision working pretty closely with that group of investors,” Casella said.

HOW TO HIRE THE BEST Why the Office Dress Code Is Slowly Dying Companies competing to attract and retain the best talent are changing their expectations about what employees should wear on the job. By Katherine Reynolds Lewis The Fiscal Times 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Have the great cargo shorts wars of 2016 made it to your office? The passionate internet debate over '90s-era baggy shorts is just the latest example of why summertime has long been the bane of the office fashion police. Clothes get skimpier. Hot weather makes ties and jackets less appealing. The dreaded flip-flops threaten to emerge from the closet. Some traditionally stuffy government offices, law firms, banks, and management consultancies are changing their dress codes, often to help recruit or retain workers in a highly competitive job market--though flip-flops remain a step or three too far. J. P. Morgan Chase is allowing most workers outside its investment bank to trade their suits for business-casual clothing. Last year, Walmart loosened its dress code to allow its associates to wear denim. Accenture and PwC both recently adopted "Dress for Your Day" policies that let employees use their best judgment when it comes to clothing. Related: 21 Business Buzzwords Goldman Sachs Thinks You Should Know "It depends on where you're going and what you're doing. If you're in front of a CEO, you wear a suit," says Anne Donovan, PwC's people innovation leader, adding that the change answers the work force's desire to wear more comfortable clothes. "We're competing in a market that's a war for talent. We're listening to people who say: 'This would make it better.'" Accenture doesn't explicitly ban any specific clothes, but asks people to be mindful of factors like T-shirt slogans when dressing for work. The formality of work clothes has been sliding downhill for years, with experts pointing to the rise of tech startup culture--awash in hoodies and fancy sneakers--as leading the way. Now, startup Betabrand designs yoga pants specifically for the office. A survey of more than 300 senior managers released in June by staffing firm OfficeTeam found that half said employees now wear less formal clothing than they did five years ago. Related: Who's Having an Office Romance? The Numbers May Surprise You You can see the casualization of the workplace beginning a century ago but accelerating in recent years, with the emergency of fast fashion and new clothing choices. "It's been happening for the past 100 years with the emergence of a middle class and many social rules and social classes disappearing," says Francois Kress, chief executive officer of fashion label Carolina Herrera. "We have taken into account that people want more comfortable clothes." Carolina Herrera now sees perhaps 30 percent of its ready-to-wear sales in daywear separates, versus 70 percent in occasion or eveningwear. A few years ago the balance would've been 10-90 percent, and in the near future it's likely to be 50-50, Kress says. Increasing sales of activewear, which has been booming for the last three years, feed into the growing informality of work attire. Not only do people buy activewear for exercise, these same stretch fabrics are increasingly finding their way into everyday and work clothes. Customers want more versatile clothes that they can wear to work but keep on into the evening, whether for picking up kids after school or dinner out with friends. As a result, even luxury brands are launching activewear lines, such as the collaboration between Stella McCartney and Adidas or the recently announced partnership between Givenchy and Nike. Or take Burberry's line of lightweight stretch suiting that's easily packable for work travel. At Takeda Pharmaceuticals, many U.S. employees can be found in jeans on a daily basis. The company relaxed its dress code last August based on feedback in a regular survey. "The new dress code was intended to provide an even more comfortable workplace where employees can do their best work, a high priority for Takeda," says spokesman Jim Schwartz, adding that the company respects individual expression in appearance and dress, as well as the variety of work. On days that employees are working with vendors or external partners, they're expected to dress more formally than if they're primarily working alone. Related: The Retirement Revolution That Failed: Why the 401(k) Isn't Working At law firm Hunton & Williams, partner Rori Malech sees an increasing variety of options for men, who often wear just dress pants and shirt, whereas women tend to be a bit dressier, in sleeveless dresses or elegant blouses. "The most dressed down I will see is capri pants, but they're work capris with a dressy fabric--not Banana Republic," says Malech. "There's definitely a movement going more casual." The New York City office tends to be more formal than the Richmond, Virginia office--where the firm was founded--with Washington, D.C. and Texas offices being even more casual and California the most laid back. Related: So Long, Cubicle! How Millennials Will Change the Office Malech appreciates the more versatile work options available from fashion lines like MM.LaFleur, with comfortable dresses, fitted pants, and separates, and even has donned Betabrand "dress yoga pants" when she knew she'd be working an 18-hour day in her office. "Only if I'm going to be under a rock," she explains. "It's not the norm." In winter, women might wear dressy boots with a cute skirt, and you could see the occasional loafer. If Malech puts on jeans for casual Friday, she's sure to dress up the outfit with a jacket, nice heels, and pearls. "I would never not have a suit jacket, sweater, or wrap in my office," she says. "At a white shoe, Southern-founded firm, I don't think things have changed that much." Indeed, the challenge of a more casual and open environment is to strike the balance between comfort and a professional look. "The benefits of a more regulated way of dressing at work is that it was easy to look a certain way. There were only a few options," Kress says. "It's much more challenging for people to dress more casually but also look good." Even with all this change, companies of all stripes still draw the line at flip-flops. "Absolutely not," Malech says. PwC specifically asked employees not to wear flip-flops--or shorts. "We said: 'Use your judgment, and always represent the brand,'" Donovan says.

Dollar debt issued by firms from riskier and less developed countries has been among the year's best performing assets, yielding more than 11 percent, according to JPMorgan's emerging market (EM) corporate debt index, the CEMBI Broad. The average yield has fallen 150 basis points (bps) this year to about 5.2 percent, dropping more than both EM sovereign debt and developed-country corporate debt yields, which have been falling due to Western central bank bond-buying schemes. Investment-grade U.S. corporate debt yields average 3.3 percent, equivalent sterling-denominated bonds yield 1.8 percent while euro-denominated equivalents are even lower. In the past six weeks, investors have pumped a $18 billion into emerging debt funds, a record run, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data shows. A significant part of this will have flowed into corporate bonds, analysts say. Investors attribute much of this exuberance to funds that do not normally invest in emerging markets, "tourists" or "cross-over" investors, who have ventured in solely for yield. PineBridge Investments' emerging corporate debt analyst John Bates, whose firm has nearly $81 billion of assets under management, sees this factor as a risk. Developments, such as a change in U.S. interest rate expectations or concerns over the Chinese economy, can put such investors to flight, because unlike dedicated EM debt managers they are less used to the sector's volatility, he said. "These are tourists with very fat pockets. Typically EM is a small allocation within a big pension fund or asset allocator, so if you get a big fund dipping into that pool, and then removing that money there could be some very severe repercussions," Bates said. EM corporate bond markets may be seeing an "investment balloon effect", he said. "This hunt for yields is driving spreads tighter, and it is pretty indiscriminate, and even heavier the further down the credit spectrum you go." But for global investors, saddled with more than $10 trillion of negative-yielding developed markets bonds, the average 340 basis-point premium the CEMBI pays over U.S. Treasuries may be too much of a lure. Single B-rated emerging firms - carrying so-called junk credit ratings - have garnered returns of more than 20 percent year-to-date, according to the CEMBI Broad's high-yield subset. Bates cited the example of Indian renewables firm Greenko, which this month sold a single-B rated $500 million 7-year bond with a 4.875 percent yield, half a percent tighter than initial guidance. Orders amounted to a hefty $4.5 billion. Seasoned investors may point to International Monetary Fund warnings last week of corporate defaults in China, where 14 percent of debt is estimated to be from firms whose profits are less than the interest they pay on loans. "A lazy approach to corporate debt, seen as a nice spread pick-up over the sovereign, is a dangerous investment strategy," BNP Paribas Investment Partners deputy-head of emerging debt, JC Sambor, said. But some argue that against the backdrop of developed bonds, bumper yields on a sector with an average BBB-minus investment grade rating can hardly be considered a bubble. Also, fears about the sector's indebtedness are overblown, Commerzbank corporate debt strategist Apostolos Bantis said. He estimates emerging companies' ratio of debt to EBITDA - earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation - at 2.5-3.0 percent on average, is a similar level to U.S. investment grade firms and half that of junk-rated U.S. issuers. "Fundamentally, emerging market corporates are in better shape than U.S. high-yield and are comparable with U.S. investment-grade," Bantis said. Tight supply, an added factor in the rally, could also change soon because both emerging market companies and sovereigns face "a wall of maturity" as the huge debt volumes raised during the boom times come due for repayment. About $1.6 trillion falls due in the coming five years. Added to that, new bonds have been scarce this year, with gross issuance not seen exceeding $220 billion, JPMorgan says, down from $239 billion last year and $372 billion in 2014. Read More This is exacerbated by companies rolling over debt and buying back bonds. As a result, net issuance may total just $102 billion this year, JPMorgan estimates. However, Aviva Investors' deputy head of emerging market debt, Aaron Grehan, whose firm has nearly $415 billion in assets under management, sees no risk of a bubble and says that crossover investors' appetite should encourage more issuance. "The spread tightening we have experienced is likely to trigger greater issuance versus expectations," he said.

Business Market Report: Clarksons in full sail after it steers through rough waters Jamie Nimmo Monday 15 August 2016 12:01 BST Outperforming: Clarksons was the top rise on the London Stock Exchange's FTSE 250 index Rob Stothard/Getty Images Investors have applauded Clarksons for navigating its way through a choppy 2016 as the shipping firm blew analyst forecasts out of the water. Shares in the FTSE 250 firm rose 213.2p, or 10.5%, to 2248.2p as underlying pre-tax profits, despite falling, were better than expected in the first six months of the year at £21.8 million. The company, which is operating in what Clarksons boss Andi Case described as “the most challenging rate environment seen in many years”, managed to nudge revenues up from £145.3 million to £147.2 million and held the dividend at 22p per share. The results impressed Colin Smith at Panmure Gordon, who said profits were around 10% higher than he had anticipated and was confident the group would be able to improve on the 2015 dividend this year. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, suggests that the market downturn will eventually force weaker firms to consolidate, to Clarksons’ benefit. Read more JPMorgan: UK shares to surge despite Brexit London’s top tier index, the FTSE 100, continued its winning streak, strengthening by 24.28 points to 6940.30, with higher oil prices lifting supermajors Royal Dutch Shell, 28.5p richer at 2030.5p, and BP, up 2.5p at 435.2p. Tipped over the weekend to split from its South African mining operations amid pressure from the Public Investment Corporation, Anglo American was 16.2p better off at 873.1p. There was no sign of investors taking big profits off the table at Frankie & Benny’s owner The Restaurant Group on the back of Friday’s management shake-up-inspired surge. The shares were down just 1.3p to 416.4p as broker Cannacord suggested private equity suitors would “likely not lose interest until the share price has recovered”. Analysts at investment bank Citi convinced investors to pile into beleaguered Foxtons as it upgraded the London estate agent to buy, boosting the shares by 4.63p to 118.63p.  Mike Ashley’s tracksuits and trainers retailer Sports Direct, 6.8p cheaper at 302p, cut its stake in rival JD Sports again, this time to below 3%. Shares in JD, which have surged 50% in 12 months, retreated 2p to 1313p.  Stake cut: Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley (Sports Direct) Finally, junior miners have taken a pounding in the downturn, but Australia’s Aura Energy, a uranium miner with projects in Mauritania and Sweden, is to dual-list on AIM. It follows in the footsteps of rare earths explorer Mkango Resources, which became the first new mining listing in London in more than a year when it joined the junior market in June.
