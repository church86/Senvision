Elizabeth Warren is calling for an investigation into the Department of Justice to understand why it failed to bring any Wall Street bankers to trial. (Photo: Getty) Though President Barack Obama is set to leave office in matter of months, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is not willing to let him go without a full explanation as to why his administration refused to jail the Wall Street banksters behind the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In a letter sent to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz on Thursday, the progressive firebrand demanded an investigation into why the DOJ refused to file criminal charges against individuals despite "'serious indications of violation[s]' of federal securities and other laws," uncovered by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) probe into the causes of the economic crash. Warren said her staff reviewed thousands of documents recently made public by the FCIC, and identified "11 separate FCIC referrals of individuals or corporations to DOJ in cases where the FCIC found" such evidence. According to Warren, "Nine individuals were implicated in these referrals (two were implicated twice)." The DOJ, she continued, "has not filed any criminal prosecutions against any of the nine individuals. Not one of the nine has gone to prison or been convicted of a criminal offense. Not a single one has even been indicted or brought to trial." Further, she notes that her staff review "identified potentially illegal activity at 14 corporations (including five that were implicated in multiple referrals)." Though there were five corporations that reached a settlement with the DOJ, not one was criminally indicted or brought to trial. Summarizing the letter, financial reporter David Dayen noted that the corporate criminals examined in the FCIC documents included most of America’s largest banks—Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America)—along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Société Generale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moody’s, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FCIC presented DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave false representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law.  And the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae, CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG, CEO Stan O’Neal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch, and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup. "The DOJ's failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable," Warren concludes. "This failure requires an explanations." Thursday also marks 8 years since Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Warren said the anniversary is "a good occasion to stop and ask where the real accountability is and get some answers out of the Justice Department about why they haven’t prosecuted anyone." On social media, Warren reiterated that point: 8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy & millions of people suffered for it. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 15, 2016 Warren also wrote to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), on Thursday asking for his department to release "any and all materials related to the FBI's investigations and prosecutorial decisions regarding" the FCIC referrals, noting that the "additional information may help in the examination of this failure." In the Comey letter, Warren acknowledges that the FBI "does not typically release internal documents from its investigations," but that the bureau under Comey recently set new precedent for doing so with its disclosure of information pertaining to the investigation of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email server. At the time, Comey said that "making these materials available to the public [was] in the interest of transparency." "These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals," Warren writes. "If Secretary Clinton's email server was of sufficient 'interest' to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then sure the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to he same level of transparency." She concludes: "For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of 'intense public interest' about which 'the American people deserve the details' than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash."

(VIAB), Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) and Bluebird Bio Inc (BLUE) AERI and BLUE should open Thursday strongly higher, while VIAB is trending up against a few headwinds Sep 15, 2016, 8:31 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Tech stocks rose 0.6% yesterday, which was a bright spot among what was otherwise a dreary day for U.S. equities. The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4%. Thursday morning could see a bit of a rebound, however, led in part by Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:AERI), Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAB) and Bluebird Bio Inc (NASDAQ:BLUE) Here’s what’s moving these stocks today: Viacom Inc. (VIAB) VIAB shares were up in early trade despite a price-target cut from JPMorgan. JPMorgan analysts have dropped their PT on VIAB shares from $50 to $48. Shares are off about 9% this year as the company heads into the second day of their regularly scheduled board meeting. 7 Energy Stocks You Need to Dump Right Now One of the potential topics making the rounds: A cut to the company’s dividend, spurred by murmurs of potential debt rating cuts and the reported hiring of Morgan Stanley and Lion Tree to look over Viacom’s capital structure. The dividend rumor is mostly based around the fact that Viacom has not yet announced its next payment — something it typically would’ve done by the end of August. VIAB shares were up 1% in morning trade nonetheless. Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) Aerie Pharmaceuticals shares are skyrocketing following an update surrounding its new drug, which treats eye illnesses. The company examined the most recent 90-day period of a 12-month study known as Phase 3 that treats patients with Roclatan. The medication helps ameliorate glaucoma and other symptoms related to eye diseases. The clinical trial proved to be stronger than Aerie’s other products, including Rhopressa, which is used for similar purposes. Patients receive one dosage of the drug a day. 61% of patients experienced a reduction of diurnal intraocular pressure, which refers to the pressure that eye fluids cause. AERI shares were set to open Thursday up 66%. Bluebird Bio Inc (BLUE) BLUE shares were up strongly in Thursday’s morning trade amid news that Goldman Sachs has added the company to its Conviction Buy List. Goldman sees a whopping 115% upside in Bluebird Bio, citing a price target of $135. The firm points out that Bluebird is at a “value-inflection point,” citing the company’s upcoming Gen1 vs. Gen2 data in October and a LentiGlobin update in December, as well as pivotal readouts in mid-2017. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Sells Out iPhone 7 Plus, Punishes Be Per the Gen1/Gen2 data, Goldman says “We expect higher transduction efficientcy (~80%-90% vs. ~40% prior) and vector copy number (2x-4x higher) to drive substantial efficacy improvements, which may be underappreciated by the Street.” BLUE stock was up 5% before Thursday’s open.

Tracy Alloway tracyalloway September 15, 2016 — 3:58 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Should Bond Traders Brace for Bubble of a Lifetime? Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp We’ve seen this movie before. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Jay Barry point out that the latest sell-offs in government bonds and the rising yields they've produced resemble the 'taper tantrum' that engulfed markets back in 2013 as investors fretted about the potential for the Federal Reserve to reduce the pace of its asset purchases. Yields on sovereign debt have jumped in recent days thanks in part to concerns over the ability or willingness of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to continue their unconventional monetary policies, JPMorgan argues. But if those concerns were the spark that lit the fire, investors' collective positioning was the gasoline that fanned the subsequent flames. "At least a portion of the recent rise in Treasury yields has been driven by shifting perceptions of monetary policy at other developed market central banks," the JPMorgan analysts said. "Coupled with still-long position technicals and rich valuations, the setup is somewhat similar to the preconditions before the taper tantrum in 2013 and the euro tantrum in 2015." A JPMorgan survey of its clients showed investors were unusually long sovereign debt in the run-up to the recent sell-off. Portfolios were nearly two standard deviations longer relative to their medium-term average, while the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded richer relative to its fair value than they had been at any point in more than four years.  Source: JPMorgan Source: JPMorgan All of which sets the scene for a potential move higher as investors focus on upcoming central bank gatherings including the Fed's and the BOJ's two-day policy meetings next week.  Instead of buying more Japanese government debt (JGBs), the BOJ may opt to turn its purchasing to corporate bonds and local government bonds as it attempts to avoid further harming banks, pension funds, and insurers, JPMorgan economists have argued. Less JGB-buying would likely steepen the so-called yield curve and could cause a further sell-off in government debt. "Our Japanese economists continue to expect a 20 basis point cut in the policy rate, but they now think the BOJ will attempt to mitigate the cost of [its negative interest rate policy] in part by trying to steepen the yield curve," the analysts conclude. "Any attempt by the BOJ to steepen the yield curve next week could potentially lead Treasury yields to rise further from current levels."   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In 2010, he was the chief financial officer at Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, Italy’s third-largest bank, and a member of the senior management team that led it to the edge of collapse. Now, six years after leaving the firm, Morelli is returning as chief executive officer, charged with averting a failure that would reverberate throughout Italy and beyond. Marco Morelli Photographer: Augusto Casasoli/A3/contrasto via Redux Morelli is joining from Bank of America Corp. just as Monte Paschi is preparing to execute a last-ditch plan to sell 27.7 billion euros ($31.1 billion) of bad loans and raise 5 billion euros. That’s after the bank tapped shareholders twice and took two state bailouts since 2009. Some longtime observers are surprised the board chose an executive from the bank’s troubled past at the very moment it’s trying to secure its future. “Mr. Morelli was a key manager during a disastrous epoch,” said Fabrizio Bernardi, a Milan-based analyst with Fidentiis Equities who has a sell rating on Monte Paschi’s shares. “It’s counterintuitive that a manager is called back to restore a situation created when he was the bank’s CFO.” Chairman Resigns Yet Federico Santi, an analyst at Eurasia Group specializing in southern Europe, says the board’s selection makes sense. Morelli was steeped in the inner workings of Monte Paschi. What’s more, he has the support of the government and formerly ran the Italian business of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a lead adviser to Monte Paschi on the capital-raising strategy and an arranger of the planned stock offering. "Morelli knows Monte Paschi inside and out and is intimately familiar with the turnaround plan," Santi said. "Having an ‘insider’ at the helm will increase the chances the restructuring and recapitalization will be successful." Morelli’s appointment, announced Wednesday evening, punctuated a tumultuous week for the embattled lender. On Sept. 8, the bank abruptly announced that CEO Fabrizio Viola, who oversaw the recapitalization plan, was quitting. Then Monte Paschi dropped the bombshell Wednesday that Massimo Tononi, chairman since September 2015 and a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was stepping down, too. Morelli will assume the CEO and general manager positions on Sept. 20, the bank said. “Tononi’s departure is a further signal that those who are running the deal from the financial side want different people managing the bank,” said Jacopo Ceccatelli, CEO of Marzotto SIM SpA, a Milan-based broker-dealer. Monte Paschi’s shares rose 2 percent to 22.85 cents by 10:45 a.m. in Milan trading, the biggest gain on the 30-member Euro Stoxx Banks Index. That said, the stock remains down 80 percent this year. Morelli, 54, a wiry Rome native, is known in Italian banking circles as a sometimes brusque but hard-working professional who can deliver under pressure. A 1984 graduate of Luiss University of Rome with a degree in economics and finance, he ascended the ranks while toggling between executive roles at American banks in Italy and domestic lenders. Morelli was considered among the top candidates for recent CEO openings at UniCredit SpA, Italy’s No. 1 bank, and No. 2 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, according to press reports. Judgment Issue Described by friends and former colleagues as a fitness enthusiast who cycles, skis and plays tennis, Morelli cut a sober figure in a 2015 speech to students at his alma mater. Clad in black suit, white shirt and black necktie, he stressed the importance of judgment in building a successful career. “The more you move on the more you’ll understand that what counts is judgment,” he said in English. “You will be asked to opine on a number of things, people will seek your advice, so slow down and think about it, because that’s what’s going to build your CV. That’s the way your judgment is gauged by others.” Now Morelli’s decisions -- both past and present -- will be scrutinized like never before. He returns to Monte Paschi at a time of mounting anxiety in Italy. The country’s commercial banks are straining under 360 billion euros in doubtful loans, even as a national referendum looms that could make or break the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who wants to end Italy’s chronic political dysfunction and solidify his hold on power. Political and financial leaders in Berlin, Brussels, and Frankfurt are watching closely. For more information on Italy’s banking problems, click here "The Italian banking problem in the short term is the biggest issue facing the euro zone, counting Brexit," said Nicolas Veron, a Washington-based senior fellow with Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels. Renzi and his finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, have been improvising ways to shore up lenders without resorting to direct state aid under European Union rules, which would probably force losses on retail investors. In April, they persuaded Italian banks to set up a 4 billion-euro rescue fund dubbed Atlante. Critics have deemed the program too small to restore confidence given that non-performing debt is equivalent to a fifth of Italian gross domestic product.  Monte Paschi, a lender that’s anchored civic life in the Tuscan city of Siena for more than five centuries, has become the flash point in the escalating drama, and Morelli has found himself center stage. He joined Monte Paschi’s capital markets unit in 2004 after an eight-year term as CEO and general manager of JPMorgan’s Italian operations. By 2007, he’d become deputy general manager, one of the bank’s top executives. That year the board, led by Chairman Giuseppe Mussari, attempted to vault Monte Paschi into the big leagues by spending 9 billion euros in cash for Banca Antonveneta SpA in northern Italy. Horse Race When the global financial crash struck the following year, more than $925 million in losses largely from the deal poleaxed the Tuscan bank. Monte Paschi hired global investment banks to create derivative contracts that could ease the losses. Meantime, it suffered the ignominy of no longer being able to pay for the medieval costumes worn by riders in the famous Palio horse race that’s run in Siena every summer. In 2013, Monte Paschi became the target of national outrage when news broke that it used complex derivatives transactions fashioned by Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura Holdings Inc. to hide millions of euros in losses. This February, prosecutors in Milan sought indictments of 13 former and current executives at Monte Paschi, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura for allegedly colluding to falsify the Italian bank’s accounting between 2008 and 2012, manipulate its share price, and obstruct investigations by the authorities. The executives have denied the allegations, and preliminary hearings to determine whether they will face trial are continuing to take place this week in Milan. Not Implicated Morelli was not implicated in the case. As CFO, he was one of three Monte Paschi executives involved in discussing one of the swap transactions, according to Deutsche Bank documents seen by Bloomberg News. Two people briefed on Morelli’s role at the time say Morelli didn’t approve the transactions. In 2013, the Bank of Italy fined Morelli 208,500 euros for his role in a Monte Paschi transaction dubbed FRESH, according to central bank records. More than a dozen other executives were also penalized. Morelli denied the allegations and appealed the action, and the matter is pending. In a separate action in December 2013, prosecutors cleared Morelli of alleged wrongdoing in the case. Morelli, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on his tenure at Monte Paschi. Atlante Fund In 2010, he decamped to Intesa, where he served as general manager and deputy to the CEO. Two years later he moved to Bank of America. He worked closely with government officials on the privatization of Poste Italiane SpA, which raised 3.1 billion euros in an equity sale. As one of the bankers who helped design the Atlante rescue fund, Morelli worked side-by-side with Finance Minister Padoan and his team, according to a person familiar with the situation. Selling Paschi’s stock and bad loans will be no mean feat in a market wracked with doubt about Italy’s prospects, especially if Renzi’s referendum fails. JPMorgan, whose history in Italy dates back to the 19th century, has a lot riding on a successful offering. In July, CEO Jamie Dimon discussed the fate of Monte Paschi with Renzi over lunch in Rome, according to a person familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified. Within days, JPMorgan had elbowed its way onto Monte Paschi’s equity offering as co-lead adviser. Now former JPMorgan executive Morelli is taking charge of the bank. ‘Banking Fragility’ While a successful restructuring may buy the world’s oldest bank some time, it will do little to address the deeper problems that plague the euro zone’s third-largest economy, says Bruegel’s Veron. Bad loans are the easy part. Disentangling Italy’s banking and political systems, a governance regime that fosters inefficiencies and poor underwriting, remains the larger task. "Italy has a pervasive problem of banking fragility and that problem won’t go away even if Monte Paschi is patched up," Veron said. "And that means the economy and the people will continue to suffer." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

JPMorgan expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,000, representing a roughly 6 percent decline from its current level, making it the most bearish of its peers on the Street. In this scenario, the market leaders are poised for the biggest fall, while some sector laggards will do relatively better, Lakos-Bujas said. Lakos-Bujas sees rising equity market volatility as central to the pullback. Following a two-month period of very low volatility, investors have been lulled into a sense of complacency, and any pickup in volatility could spark a "deleveraging event," in which investors dump stocks, he said. That selling will not necessarily happen immediately, he said, but an initial wave of selling could snowball by breeding negative sentiment and aversion to risk. Already, investors are feeling cautious as stocks sit at lofty valuations, he said. "Positioning is pretty stretched. Technicals are exhausted. So if anything, I would probably be waiting for some further correction, and then take advantage of that to turn slightly more constructive," he told CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report." The recent rise in long-term sovereign debt yields is also cause for concern because it stands to draw investors out of dividend-yielding stocks like telecoms and utilities, which have served as substitutes for bonds during a period of persistently low interest rates. Dividend-yielders have been the biggest beneficiaries of outflows from bonds with low or negative yields, Lakos-Bujas said. Since those defensive stocks have driven S&P 500 gains, interest rates need to stay lower in order for the market to maintain current levels. "If yields continue to spike up, that could pressurize the market," he said, adding that the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision later this month will be critical. JPMorgan believes investors will ultimately rotate out of those defensives and into sectors that have not performed as well. The bank's sector picks are health care, energy, materials and financials. Investors got a preview of this when utilities and telecoms led a market sell-off last Friday, Lakos-Bujas said.

Analysts say it's an attractive investment. Alicia McElhaney Sep 14, 2016 4:38 PM EDT JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on Wednesday surpassed Wells Fargo (WFC)   as the most valuable bank by market cap, and analysts say the new leader of the bulge bracket banks could be the more attractive investment going forward after Wells' recent sales debacle. "We have a sell recommendation on Wells and a buy on JPMorgan," analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital said in an interview. "The reason that we have a sell on Wells Fargo is because it appears that its internal control systems have broken down." Wells Fargo's cap was at $236.94 billion at market's close Tuesday, while JPMorgan's clocked in at $240.27 billion. Wells Fargo's shares have fallen 6% since Friday. The company closed at $46.52 per share Wednesday. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has seen share prices rise 5.4% in the past 52 weeks, and is nearing its high of $69.03 per share it hit on Nov. 15. The company closed Wednesday at $66.40 per share, down 13 cents from Tuesday's close. "JPMorgan is hot as a firecracker right now," Bove said. "Its lending businesses are performing extremely well." Bove added that the company has big backlogs for its underwriting business, and that its cost-control measures are working well compared Wells Fargo's apparent lack of control over its human resources department. Bove noted Wells Fargo has multiple things to correct in its internal operations. Wells Fargo's shares have been falling since news broke Friday, Sept. 9, that the company had been pushing employees to reach unrealistic sales targets. Thanks to this pressure, employees opened fake accounts under customer names, then closed them before customers realized, just to get numbers up. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday just before market close that federal prosecutors were investigating the sales practices at the bank. "We want to be clear that the cross-selling itself was not the issue, but rather the aggressive tactics that were used to open and close accounts without the knowledge of some customers," wrote Jim Cramer, TheStreet's founder and manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, which owns WFC, in a post Sept. 13. "This has undoubtedly put a dent in Wells Fargo's 'good guy' brand, which had partially aided the stock in its recent, high relative valuation compared to its peers." Wells Fargo will pay a $185 million fine to the U.S. government, and let go of 5,300 employees. None of those fired worked as C-suite employees, who blame employees, rather than management, for wrongdoings. Additionally, the company will no longer have specific sales targets. "When a CEO says it's not my fault, it's the fault of the people not doing jobs, he doesn't have any method of understanding what his employees are doing," Bove said. " How do these people get hired? Once they were hired, why was there no effective way of monitoring what they were doing?" According to analyst Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray, who has an underweight rating on Wells Fargo, the company has more problems than this accounts scandal.  "We've been fairly negative on the company, not because of the issues they had with cross selling, but primarily due to growth concerns and additional regulatory costs," Barker said in an interview. He added that the latest problems at Wells can likely cause its fee income to stagnate further than it already has. Part of the problem is likely because Wells Fargo is a much larger than it used to be. The company purchased Wachovia during the financial crisis, which added $812 billion in assets, more than doubling its asset based. Today the company has about $1.9 trillion in assets today, Barker noted. "Wells Fargo had historically been considered one of the better managed banks," Barker said. "They built that reputation through the financial crisis and prior to it....This is a much bigger bank with a lot more complicated and much harder to manage." Both banks inked deals Wednesday morning, which could move the needle on size even more. JPMorgan's Chase division signed a multi-year deal with Best Buy (BBY) to accept Chase Pay in stores, online and through Best Buy's app. Chase Pay allows customers to pay with one click, no longer having to enter credit card or shipping information. No terms of the contract were disclosed publicly. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Securities, the investment and capital markets arm of Wells Fargo, announced Wednesday that it is selling its fund administration business, Wells Fargo Global Fund Services, to SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc. (SSNC) . No terms were released for this deal either. Whether these deals will have a significant impact on share price of either company is unclear.

John Hickenlooper Announces $9.5 Million to Launch Statewide Youth Apprenticeship and Career Readiness Programs Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today that Bloomberg Philanthropies and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have together committed $9.5 million to CareerWise Colorado (formerly Business and Schools in Collaboration, or BASIC), a new statewide apprenticeship system for high school students, and Denver Public Schools’ (DPS) CareerConnect. Partnering with the state, Bloomberg Philanthropies committed $5.5 million to CareerWise and JPMorgan Chase dedicated $4 million to Denver Public Schools Foundation for a pilot program that equips the district’s high school students with high-demand skills for lucrative careers and postsecondary opportunities in Colorado’s leading industries. U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez joined Hickenlooper during the announcement to highlight the Obama administration’s work in supporting youth apprenticeships and experiential learning. “In order to create shared prosperity for all Americans, we need to help more people access the skills and training they need to compete for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Apprenticeships are a tried and true training strategy that offer a path to the middle class and expand opportunities for working people,” said Perez. “The learn-while-you-earn model is instrumental to the competitiveness of our businesses, the strength of our economy and the future of our workforce. I applaud Colorado for making the investments that will help usher shared prosperity in the 21st century.” “Colorado is known as a national leader for innovative strategies to increase student achievement and improve opportunities for students once they finish high school,” Hickenlooper said. “This is an example of businesses coming together with schools that will help build better pathways to good careers and give more students access to the middle class. It will be an option for students from cities and towns across Colorado and for students who want to start their careers right away or want to pursue a college degree. They will all benefit from work experience and earning money along the way.” As growing industries in Colorado have an increased need to find skilled workers who can compete at a global level, the apprenticeship program will lead to a direct path for youth in the state to access higher education and well-paying jobs in high-demand industries. “We need to unleash our capacity for stronger, broader long-term growth by ensuring all young people are given the opportunity to acquire the skills needed for their future success and to support the competitiveness of our industries,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies. “To do this, businesses and educators must work together to ensure the skills being taught match those needed – not just for today’s workforce, but in the workforce of tomorrow. That’s exactly what this partnership in Colorado seeks to achieve.” Bloomberg Philanthropies is investing in a series of new, innovative career and technical education pilots around the country. All pilots feature strong local leadership and robust partnership across education, industry, government and non-profit sectors. The goal is to create a clear, comprehensive evidence base and increased capacity to replicate at scale the best of what works. “We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to give our young people the best chance to succeed after high school,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “Our investment in Denver’s youth will provide them with greater opportunities for meaningful employment and long-term economic success.” Students in their last two years of high school will be eligible to participate in CareerWise Colorado beginning in the fall of 2017. The program will begin with 250 apprentices and grow to serve about 20,000 students, or 10 percent of eligible high school students in the state, within 10 years. Participating students will spend up to half of their time on-site with employers while still earning credit toward high school graduation and post-secondary credentials toward a two-year degree. An additional year of apprenticeship post-graduation will further prepare students to enter the workforce directly or continue their post-secondary education at a community or four-year college. Apprentice students will be employees of partner businesses and paid a training wage for the time they are at work. CareerWise Colorado will build on the success of existing programs like DPS CareerConnect, which has been a statewide and national leader in providing students with project-based learning for career exploration, coaching, internships and college coursework to better prepare students for college and careers. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $4 million commitment, which is part of the firm’s global $75 million, five-year New Skills for Youth initiative to strengthen career education and create pathways to economic success for young people, will enhance CareerConnect to expand the program to include Denver’s K-8 students, and will initiate a bold, new apprenticeship model called CareerResidency. Currently, DPS CareerConnect serves more than 6,000 Denver students and helps them develop the skills and education for opportunities in Colorado’s engineering, tech, biomedical, advanced manufacturing and finance industries, and with this grant, plans to reach 9,000 students over the next three years. “The work that this funding supports will provide a bridge to districts in the metro area and across Colorado,” said DPS Superintendent Tom Boasberg. “We are excited to expand our own offerings to prepare students for successful careers and to share what we’ve learned through programs like CareerConnect with students from all over the state,” Boasberg continued. The Daniels Fund, Markle Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation have provided additional funds to support the youth apprenticeship system, along with support from the State of Colorado. This brings the total level of financial support for the program to more than $11 million. “Currently Colorado has an estimated 25,000 weekly job vacancies in high-growth industries that go unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers, costing the state over $300 million in lost GDP,” said Noel Ginsburg, chairman and CEO of Intertech Plastics. “Business can play a critical role in education that goes far beyond simply advising educators. By extending the classroom into our places of business, we can become producers, not just consumers, of the education system. The apprenticeship model will provide greater choice and opportunity for students in fulfilling their future career goals, while at the same time addressing the critical skills gap in business and industry, enabling them to better compete in the global economy,” Ginsburg added. Ginsburg chairs the Business Experiential-Learning (BEL) Commission established by Hickenlooper to work with the Colorado Workforce Development Council. Their partnership is focused on building business-led experiential learning opportunities like youth apprenticeships. “There will be growth and tangible benefit for all who participate in this program,” said Kent Thiry, DaVita chairman and CEO. “That benefit extends to everyone from the apprentices to the business community and the city of Denver with its expanding workforce in need of diverse talent.” In its first year, students will be placed in apprenticeships with leading Colorado companies working in one of four pathways including advanced manufacturing, business operations, financial services and information technology. As the program expands into more schools and communities and new businesses develop apprentices, additional pathways will be added. “My experience at Mikron has been great. I’ve learned about working at a company doing advanced manufacturing and it has given me the chance to gain skills that are going to help me in college and in my full-time career,” said Selena Elekovic, a student at Cherry Creek High School. “Now I know that I want to study mechanical engineering and go into that field after college. I’m excited that even more students are going to have this sort of apprenticeship in the future.” About CareerWise Colorado CareerWise Colorado is building a statewide system of youth apprenticeships that create pathways for students to access high-demand, high-paying careers at leading Colorado companies. Student apprentices also work toward high school graduation and earn postsecondary credit, industry credentials or both in their chosen career path. Established by the Business Experiential-Learning (BEL) Commission created by Gov. John Hickenlooper and chaired by Noel Ginsburg of Intertech Plastics, CareerWise Colorado will launch 250 apprenticeships in 2017 in school districts in metro Denver, the Western Slope and Colorado’s Eastern Plains. 20,000 youth apprentices, or about 10 percent of Colorado students in their last two years of high school, are expected to participate by 2027.

JPMorgan Chase has surpassed Wells Fargo as the biggest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo had been the largest by market cap since 2013, based on closing values. Shares of Wells Fargo fell more 3 percent on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase closed 0.79 percent lower. That gave JPMorgan Chase a market cap of nearly $240.3 billion versus almost $236.9 billion for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo shares have been under pressure in the past few days after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and two other regulators fined the bank $185 million. The bank must also pay another $5 million to customers for creating more than 2 million fake accounts for products like credit and debit cards to meet aggressive sales targets. On Tuesday, the bank said beginning next year it would eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. With Tuesday's declines, Wells Fargo saw its worst daily performance since June 24 and its first three-day losing streak since Aug. 3. —CNBC's Gina Francolla and Reuters contributed to this report.

Exchange. JPMorgan technical analysts advised clients to stay away from high-yield plays like utilities as a rotation out of those stocks appears to be underway. Instead, the investment bank recommends getting behind financial names, which in the past have benefited from higher rates. "Our bearish global bond outlook has been one of the main drivers of our equity call over the past month. That favored a sector rotation away from defensive groups like dividend payers and utilities, and into financials, which have shown relative outperformance when rates have trended higher over the past couple of years," wrote JPMorgan technical market strategist Jason Hunter. Into the end of the year, Hunter believes the bearish trend for Treasurys will extend. As a result, he predicts the rotation will continue.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the U.S. company, which oversees $1.7 trillion globally, set up China’s first wholly owned foreign money manager last month and plans to consolidate its business in the nation into the newly established unit in Shanghai. JPMorgan Asset Management (Shanghai) Ltd. will provide the platform for the group’s future development in China and become the parent for potential legal entities to be set up there, country head Desiree Q. Wang said. “As China opens up, cross-border investments will certainly grow because the market used to be a system of its own,” Wang said in an interview in Shanghai on Tuesday. Chinese authorities have been trying to strike a balance between opening up the market to attract more inflows, and further liberalizing the capital account in some areas that could worsen outflows after last year’s surprise yuan devaluation and ensuing stock-market rout. The nation began the free-trade zone in Shanghai in 2013 and has since set up 10 more to carry out trials on loosening movements of capital.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) FIXED INCOME This bond market sell-off looks a lot like ‘taper tantrum,’ the sequel Add to ... Tracy Alloway Bloomberg News Published Thursday, Sep. 15, 2016 11:02AM EDT Last updated Thursday, Sep. 15, 2016 6:54PM EDT Comments AA We’ve seen this movie before. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Jay Barry point out that the latest sell-offs in government bonds and the rising yields they’ve produced resemble the ‘taper tantrum’ that engulfed markets back in 2013 as investors fretted about the potential for the Federal Reserve to reduce the pace of its asset purchases. Yields on sovereign debt have jumped in recent days thanks in part to concerns over the ability or willingness of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to continue their unconventional monetary policies, JPMorgan argues. But if those concerns were the spark that lit the fire, investors’ collective positioning was the gasoline that fanned the subsequent flames. “At least a portion of the recent rise in Treasury yields has been driven by shifting perceptions of monetary policy at other developed market central banks,” the JPMorgan analysts said. “Coupled with still-long position technicals and rich valuations, the setup is somewhat similar to the preconditions before the taper tantrum in 2013 and the euro tantrum in 2015.” A JPMorgan survey of its clients showed investors were unusually long sovereign debt in the run-up to the recent sell-off. Portfolios were nearly two standard deviations longer relative to their medium-term average, while the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded richer relative to its fair value than they had been at any point in more than four years. All of which sets the scene for a potential move higher as investors focus on upcoming central bank gatherings including the Fed’s and the BOJ’s two-day policy meetings next week. Instead of buying more Japanese government debt (JGBs), the BOJ may opt to turn its purchasing to corporate bonds and local government bonds as it attempts to avoid further harming banks, pension funds, and insurers, JPMorgan economists have argued. Less JGB-buying would likely steepen the so-called yield curve and could cause a further sell-off in government bonds. “Our Japanese economists continue to expect a 20 basis point cut in the policy rate, but they now think the BOJ will attempt to mitigate the cost of [its negative interest rate policy] in part by trying to steepen the yield curve,” the analysts conclude. “Any attempt by the BOJ to steepen the yield curve next week could potentially lead Treasury yields to rise further from current levels.” Report Typo/Error   JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$77.68 -0.34 (-0.44%) Updated November 18 11:41 AM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Here's A Way To Think About It (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s JPMorgan Asset Management unit continued expanding its lineup of exchange-traded funds Wednesday with the debut of the JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSE: JPHF). “JPHF aims to democratize hedge fund investing by providing investors with institutional quality hedge fund strategy in a cost efficient, tradeable ETF wrapper. The ETF can serve as a core component of a portfolio's alternatives allocation. "The bottom-up approach results in a purer capture of the hedge fund exposure and better diversification than traditional hedge fund replication strategies, as it employs strategies that have true low correlation to traditional markets,” said JPMorgan Asset Management in a statement. JPHF is the company's first actively managed ETF. Welcome, JPHF! “JPHF will include equity long/short, event driven and global macro based strategies. The fund is managed by Rohami and Victor Lee, Managing Director and a Regional Specialist at J.P. Morgan,” according to ETF Trends. Related Link: Global X Adds To Thematic With 3 New ETFs The new ETF's managers evaluate relevant return factors to establish long and short equity positions with the goal of generating alpha. What Sets JPHF Apart JPHF also features an event-driven strategy designed to benefit from catalysts that could affect future share prices, including merger arbitrage opportunities. The new ETF also features a global macro strategy that can tap multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. “Alternative beta strategies provide investors with true diversification with attractive liquidity, transparency and cost,” said Robert Deutsch, head of ETFs for JPMorgan Asset Management, in the statement. JPHF is the tenth ETF from JPMorgan Asset Management. Earlier this year, the firm launched the JPMorgan Diversified Return Europe Currency Hedged ETF (NYSE: JPEH) and the JPMorgan Diversified Return International Currency Hedged ETF (NYSE: JPIH). The firm also has ETFs covering U.S. and emerging markets stocks, among other offerings. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Initiative for a Competitive Inner City Crunch Network What it will take to create inclusive high-tech incubators and accelerators Posted Sep 15, 2016 by Janis Bowdler 0 SHARES Next Story Indiegogo launches After Dark collection for saucy crowdfunding campaigns Janis Bowdler Crunch Network Contributor Janis Bowdler is head of small business and community development initiatives, global ohilanthropy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. How to join the network The success of high-tech accelerators has ignited the creation of similar models around the country hoping to replicate their accomplishments. But their achievements have not come without criticism. The exclusivity of the high-tech sector in general is reflected in the lack of diverse entrepreneurs being supported by high-tech accelerators and, to a lesser degree, by high-tech incubators. This lack of inclusion matters because women and minority entrepreneurs are significantly underrepresented in high-tech. Incubators and accelerators offer critical support to entrepreneurs — from business education to access to capital and expanded networks — and can be an effective tool for increasing the number of women and minority-owned businesses in the high-tech sector. Unfortunately, they are not making an impact because of the low participation rates of women and minority entrepreneurs in these organizations. A recent report by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City digs into the barriers preventing women and minority entrepreneurs from fully participating in high-tech incubators and accelerators. The good news from this report is that many high-tech incubator and accelerator leaders already recognize that lack of diversity is a critical issue for their organization and many want to address this issue, but are unsure of how to effectively do so. The other good news is that some organizations, high-tech incubators in particular, have already implemented strategies and practices that are creating impressive diversity rates (often around 30-40 percent) and helping to change the high-tech status quo. These success stories prove that high-tech incubators and accelerators can be more inclusive and serve as a promising tool toward creating a more inclusive high-tech sector. Participation barriers and solutions The report identifies four types of barriers facing women and minority entrepreneurs: recruitment, selection biases, program design and culture. Recruitment and selection biases may prevent diverse entrepreneurs from gaining access to high-tech incubators and accelerators, while programs that aren’t flexible and an exclusive, macho culture may make them not want to. Diversity should matter to the high-tech sector because it makes good business sense, not because it is politically correct. To create inclusive organizations, it takes deliberate actions on the part of incubator and accelerator managers to recruit women and minority entrepreneurs and to create programs that meet their needs. Recruitment Some high-tech incubators and accelerators simply don’t actively recruit any entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, women and minority entrepreneurs are less likely to find their way to these organizations than white men because they may not know about them, may not feel like they are a good fit or may not feel like they would be selected. Other incubators and accelerators struggle with limited pipeline networks and a lack of knowledge about how best to find diverse entrepreneurs. Selection Selection biases play out all along the incubator/accelerator system. Selection panels are often not diverse and people are more likely to identify with and select entrepreneurs who look and act like themselves. Ingrained cultural notions of what successful high-tech entrepreneurs look like also create biases. Private high-tech accelerators, whose reputations are built on ventures graduating with large infusions of venture capital, might find women and minority entrepreneurs less attractive because they attract less capital. Program design The program design of traditional high-tech accelerators, which often require intensive, in-person residency, may fit the lifestyle of the stereotypical young, white, male entrepreneur, but not others. Culture The macho, exclusive, hyper-competitive culture of some high-tech accelerators is the image marketed and shared by media, creating perhaps the biggest deterrent to women and minority entrepreneurs. High-tech incubators and accelerators can’t be both intentionally exclusive and hope to attract more diverse entrepreneurs. Policy implications Related Articles Slack’s director of engineering, Leslie Miley, doesn’t believe in diversity quotas Rev. Jesse Jackson says Apple is 'setting the pace' around diversity and inclusion President Obama calls for diversity efforts and openness with Mark Zuckerberg at GES Diversity should matter to the high-tech sector because it makes good business sense, not because it is politically correct. It is also in the economic interest of cities and states to ensure that all entrepreneurs have equal access to the support available to them to help their companies grow and create jobs. The recommendations and strategies set forth in this report offer a playbook for creating more inclusive high-tech incubators and accelerators. Hopefully, the documented barriers that exist for women and minority entrepreneurs in the high-tech sector will provoke a greater urgency for change in these organizations.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 204 Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images Elizabeth Warren Asks Newly Chatty FBI Director to Explain Why DOJ Didn’t Prosecute Banksters David Dayen David Dayen 2016-09-15T04:00:10+00:00 Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images Like a lot of other Americans, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to know why the Department of Justice hasn’t criminally prosecuted any of the major players responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. On Thursday, Warren released two highly provocative letters demanding some explanations. One is to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, requesting a review of how federal law enforcement managed to whiff on all 11 substantive criminal referrals submitted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), a panel set up to examine the causes of the 2008 meltdown. The other is to FBI Director James Comey, asking him to release all FBI investigations and deliberations related to those referrals. The FBI typically doesn’t release investigative details about cases that the DOJ chooses not to pursue, but Warren pointed out that in releasing information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server in July, Comey had pretty much shattered that precedent and set a new one. “You explained these actions by noting your view that ‘the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest,’” Warren wrote to Comey. “If Secretary Clinton’s email server was of sufficient ‘interest’ to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency.” In other words, if Comey can spend hours relating FBI decision-making about State Department emails, he can do the same for the activity that made millions jobless and homeless. The FCIC’s criminal referrals, which were sent to the Justice Department in October 2010, have never been made public. But Warren’s staff reviewed thousands of other documents released in March by the National Archives, including hearings and testimony, witness interviews, internal deliberations, and memoranda, and found descriptions and records of them. They detail potential violations of securities laws by 14 different financial institutions: most of America’s largest banks — Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America) — along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Société Generale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moody’s, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FCIC presented the DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave false representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure, and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law. And the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae; CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG; CEO Stan O’Neal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch; and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden, and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup. None of the 14 financial firms listed in the referrals were criminally indicted or brought to trial, Warren writes. Only five of the 14 even paid fines in civil settlements. None of the nine named individuals were criminally prosecuted, and only one — Crittenden, of Citigroup — had to pay so much as a personal fine, for a mere $100,000. Fannie Mae’s Daniel Mudd recently reached a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that imposed a fine of $100,000, but allowed Fannie Mae to pay it, rather than Mudd. It’s not clear whether the others were even investigated. In March, Fortune magazine reported that Rubin “was never contacted by the Justice Department in relation to the commission’s allegations.” “Not every individual or company accused of a crime is guilty of that crime and not every DOJ referral results in a conviction,” Warren writes in her letter to the inspector general. “But the DOJ’s failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable. This failure requires an explanation.” Warren has at least one ally on the House side. Just last week, Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., asked the FBI to publicly release case files relating to crisis-era investigations. She also has support from Phil Angelides, the chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. “There’s a gnawing feeling among the American people that this justice system may not have worked as it should have,” Angelides said in an interview with The Intercept. “Sen. Warren is right on and Americans have a right to know.” Angelides said “I know as little as you know” about the criminal referrals he sent to the Justice Department. He stressed that it’s not too late to prosecute on some activities, where the 10-year statute of limitations doesn’t run out until 2017. But if nothing happens, he believes that financial institutions will internalize the message that they can continue to violate the law with impunity. “It’s like someone who robs a 7-11. If you can steal $1,000 and settle for $20 would you do it again? Probably.” Read Warren’s letter to Horowitz, which includes information on the specific criminal referrals: Read Warren’s letter to Comey: Related Contact the author: David Dayen✉david.dayen@​gmail.comt@ddayen ˅ ⎕ 204 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → September → Consider Alternative ETFs as Traditional Assets Run on Fumes Consider Alternative ETFs as Traditional Assets Run on Fumes Max Chen September 14, 2016 0 Comment Actively Managed ETFs, Alternatives, Current Affairs, JPHF, Lead, New ETFs, Webcasts The fixed-income and equities markets have extended their bull run but their momentum is beginning to fade. With valuations high and risks ahead, investors should look to an alternative exchange traded fund strategy to hedge their portfolios. On the upcoming webcast, Look to Alternatives as Traditional Stocks, Bonds Run on Fumes, Jillian DelSignore, Executive Director and Head of ETF Distribution at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Yazann Romahi, Portfolio Manager and Head of Global Multi-Asset Research in the Multi-Asset Solutions Team at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Mark Matthews, Investment Research Analyst at CLS Investments, will outline various alternative strategies and ways the asset category can provide uncorrelated returns to traditional bond and stock investments to diversify a portfolio. For instance, the recently launched JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSEArca: JPHF), J.P. Morgan’s first actively managed ETF to hit the market, combines various hedge fund-esque, alternative investment strategies in an easy-to-use ETF wrapper. Trending on ETF Trends An ETF Bond Alternative with No Rate Risk Consider Precious Metal ETFs to Hedge Against Global Risks Prepping an ETF Portfolio for Risks Ahead A Preferred Securities ETF Strategy for Yield Seekers A Preferred ETF Strategy to Hone in on Income Specifically, JPHF will include equity long/short, event driven and global macro based strategies. The fund is managed by Rohami and Victor Lee, Managing Director and a Regional Specialist at J.P. Morgan. The equity long/short strategy involves simultaneously taking equities that are attractive based on relevant return factors and selling equities that are unattractive based on relevant return factors. The long/short strategy will try to produce alpha through exploiting pricing inefficiencies between equity securities through long and short positions. The event driven strategy will try to profit from companies on the basis that a specific event or catalyst will affect future pricing. For example, merger arbitrage strategies try to capitalize on price discrepancies and returns in corporate transactions. Lastly, the global macro based strategy tries to exploit macro economic imbalances across the globe. The strategy may be implemented through a number of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. The group of liquid alternative funds has been a growing investment category following the financial downturn as more investors turned to alternative investment avenues in an attempt to diversify their portfolios. The group of liquid alt funds that categories like equity long/short, event driven, relative value, macro and multistrategy often did better than the hedge fund indices. SEE MORE: ETFs Tracking Liquid Alts Outperform Traditional Hedge Funds Liquid alternative funds provided a much cheaper way to access the same kind of hedge fund-esque exposure – hedge funds may include a normal management fee of 1% to 2% on top of a performance fees of as much as 20% of annual gains. Potential investors should be aware that these types of investments are not meant as growth strategies to generate outsized returns in investment portfolios. In reality, these strategies are doing exactly what they were made for, diminishing volatility. Consequently, in bullish market conditions, the strategies may underperform, but if the markets sour, alts can shine.

A person uses a sensor for biometric identification on a smartphone in Berlin, Germany October 16, 2015. Credit: REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch More like this Forget fingerprints; Iris scans could validate mobile payments How it works: Iris scanning improves smartphone security 5 trends shaking up multi-factor authentication Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now With little fanfare, JPMorgan Chase on Monday (Sept. 12) reversed its security position on its mobile app, removing the need to type in a password once a customer has already been authenticated by either Apple's Touch ID or an Android biometric scan. Before Monday, Chase customers could log in using a biometric scan and see things such as balances but needed to authenticate themselves again with a password for transferring funds or making a payment. Now the biometric scan is sufficient for all bank functions. This is the latest in the battle between security reality and security perception. From a pure security perspective, any decently implemented biometric authentication (fingerprint, in this case) is far more secure than most passwords. But because of the biometric scan's ease and speed, some retailers and bankers feared that consumers might not perceive a transaction as secure unless the app also forced the typing of a password. Chase spokesperson Rebecca Acevedo said the change was caused by data coming from various handset makers. "About a year ago, Chase implemented Touch ID on iOS. We were the first major U.S. bank to do so. When we launched in 2015, we included a second step to the process that asked consumers for a password to transfer money or pay bills," Acevedo said. "Over the past year, the mobile phone manufacturers have continued to provide additional analytics into the level of security for Touch ID. We also heard from our customers that a one-step process would make banking easier, so we updated the mobile app to just biometrics." For the record, Chase said that it added biometric support for its Android app in March 2016. As for what those additional manufacturer-provided analytics told Chase, Acevedo said, "Unfortunately, we can’t share that information, but that information has made [Chase officials] more comfortable." As for Chase having "heard from our customers that a one-step process would make banking easier" — really? Chase needed customers to tell it that reducing authentication from two steps to one would be easier? Isn't that inherently obvious? Chase confirmed that it will now allow all functions without passwords, relying solely on biometrics. Obviously, that is limited to anything actually on Chase's site. "There are some sites that we link out to from the mobile app that require you to sign in," Acevedo said. This is an important development. Unlike a similar biometrics headache that hit retailers back in May, that retail problem stemmed from processor systems that couldn't see if a biometric authentication had already taken place. Therefore, it demanded a signature after a fingerprint scan verification already happened. That retail issue was doubly infuriating because, unlike PINs and passwords, signatures deliver absolutely nothing today in terms of secure authentication. But Chase's systems always knew when a biometric authentication was used, making the password demand truly annoying and pointless. I would love to see what data the handset makers provided that told Chase anything it didn't already know. From a security perspective, all the phone makers could have shared would be how popular the biometric authentications are and how few successful authentication frauds have happened. The most likely data is simply a change in how consumers perceive biometrics. As long as customers see biometric authentication as more secure, there is little to no perception risk in abandoning passwords/PINs on top of it. One problem here is that multifactor authentication assumes that the various factors are all independent and secure. Adding signature on top of PIN, for example, is not a viable MFA approach because signature adds no meaningful verification. Given how easy PINs and passwords can be to shoulder-surf or to steal in other ways, such as sniffing or keystroke-capturing, biometrics makes sense. If you want to marry that to, perhaps, a one-time access code messaged to a phone and only good for x minutes from point of transmission, fine. But I think the death of the password is long overdue. In geeky news, Chase also said that it was incorporating 3D Touch functionality into the app. That's where iPhones/iPads can perform differently based on how hard a user presses the screen. Chase said that users of its iOS app can now use 3D Touch "to quickly access ATM and Chase locations near you by pressing on the app icon." That's a nice trick, but ditching the superfluous password was much more comforting. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:20 PM, September 14, 2016 Updated: 12:35 AM, September 15, 2016 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said on Wednesday it has hired General Electric Co <GE.N> lending veteran Clarence Nunn to lead its middle market expansion strategy in the Southeastern United States. Nunn, 51, will be based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and will succeed Mark Bensabat, who is retiring next year after more than 35 years in banking, the company said. Nunn will also manage the franchise finance business of Chase's Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries team. He worked at General Electric for 24 years and was chief executive of GE Capital's franchise finance business, JPMorgan said. This year Chase is adding middle market banking offices in eight cities nationally. In the Southeast it has been operating from 15 cities. As the biggest bank in the United States by assets, JPMorgan is essentially barred from acquiring other banks to become bigger. Instead, to extend the bank's reach geographically and reap more economies of scale, executives have said they will add offices in new areas and extend their marketing to new customers. (Story corrects to show that Chase is adding middle market banking offices in eight cities across the United States, instead of just in the U.S. Southeast, paragraph 4.)

Morgan Rolls Out Its First Active ETF Strategy J.P. Morgan Rolls Out Its First Active ETF Strategy Tom Lydon September 14, 2016 0 Comment Actively Managed ETFs, Alternatives, Current Affairs, JPHF, Lead, New ETFs Exchange traded fund investors can now gain exposure to J.P. Morgan’s extensive management experience through its first active ETF that covers various alternative strategies taken from tested hedge fund plays. On Wednesday, J.P. Morgan launched the JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSEArca: JPHF). JPHF has a total expense ratio of 0.85%. JPHF was designed and is managed by Yazann Romahi, Global Head of Quantitative Beta Solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The  Diversified Alternatives ETF strategy was created by Romahi along with the support of a team of 17 investment specialists focused on beta philosophy research and development for over a decade. “Since 2005, we’ve had a team dedicated to researching and developing a leading alternative beta capability and we are thrilled to adapt this strategy for a new investment wrapper,” Romahi said in a press release. “JPHF helps to increase diversification, reduce overall portfolio volatility and deliver higher portfolio risk-adjusted returns.” The new fund will incorporate institutional quality hedge fund strategies in a cost efficient ETF wrapper. “In the past, alternative investments have been an exclusive option only accessible by a small portion of investors; however, JPHF now makes these investment vehicles available to a wider array of investors,” Robert Deutsch, Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. “Alternative beta strategies provide investors with true diversification with attractive liquidity, transparency and cost.” Trending on ETF Trends Legg Mason Adds New Emerging Market ETF to Low Volatility Suite A New Active Short-Term Bond ETF to Play Rising Rate Risks A Smart-Beta, Small-Cap ETF to Help Investors Cope with Volatility A New ETF Targeting High Yield Developed Market Dividend Stocks A New Smart Beta Restaurant ETF is on the Menu Specifically, JPHF will include equity long/short, event driven and global macro based strategies. The equity long/short strategy involves simultaneously taking equities that are attractive based on relevant return factors and selling equities that are unattractive based on relevant return factors. The long/short strategy will try to produce alpha through exploiting pricing inefficiencies between equity securities through long and short positions. The event driven strategy will try to profit from companies on the basis that a specific event or catalyst will affect future pricing. For example, merger arbitrage strategies try to capitalize on price discrepancies and returns in corporate transactions. Lastly, the global macro based strategy tries to exploit macro economic imbalances across the globe. The strategy may be implemented through a number of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Essentially, the managing advisor will try to generate positive total returns over time while including a relatively low correlation to traditional markets.

RISING STARS Why Millennials Are Freaking Out Over a Credit Card With a $450 Annual Fee It's the perks, man. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT, a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016, serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. @JustinJBariso Founder, Insight@JustinJBariso WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's official: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has gone viral. JPMorgan Chase, which launched the credit card just a few weeks ago, told Bloomberg it approved "tens of thousands" of applications in the first two days--despite the fact that it carries ... wait for it ... a $450 annual fee. But what's really interesting about this story is who wants these cards. According to Chase spokeswoman Lauren Francis, the majority of cards are going to Millennials. Say what? The same Millennials who are (supposedly) much less interested in credit cards than their older counterparts? Just last month, The New York Times reported that Millennials "aren't pulling out the plastic" like previous generations, under the headline "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards." Take a closer look. The Times continues: Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The problem is, this data doesn't talk about Millennials' possession of credit cards, but only about how much debt they carry. It's the perks, man But if the younger generation doesn't want credit cards for debt management, why do they want them? Put simply, for the perks. For example, I know Millennials who use their credit cards for every single purchase--and pay off their account balance in full every month. They do this solely to rack up points and earn free rewards. (My younger brother, for example, built an entire wardrobe from Old Navy through rewards certificates.) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card is further proof of this. Despite the hefty fee, the card offers the following benefits. (Special shout out to The Points Guy for breaking this all down for us.) 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (with a minimum of $4,000 spend on the card within the initial three months). Points can be transferred to various partners, including multiple airlines and hotels (estimated value: at least $1,500). 3 points per dollar on all travel and dining, worldwide (including money spent on Uber and Airbnb). Automatic $300 annual rebate for travel expenses. Priority Pass Select, allowing access to over 900 travel lounges around the world. $100 Global Entry credit every five years. Enhanced travel protections under the Visa Infinite program. No foreign transaction fees. Just a little understanding of the Millennial mindset gives insight into why the credit card blew up on the internet (with one thread discussing the card on Reddit attracting 10,000 comments). So many Millennials love to travel. And they love finding bargains even more. Looking back at those figures from the Fed, there's a lesson to be learned. The data may have been right, but the conclusion was wrong: Millennials don't dislike credit cards. They just dislike credit card debt. Like this column?

The stock fell after it was revealed the bank opened over two million unauthorized fee-accruing customer accounts. Read more Not too big to bail: Wells Fargo exec responsible for scam retires with $124.6mn The share price of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slid two percent on the news. The 86-year-old billionaire investor is the world’s fourth-richest person with a net worth of $65.8 billion. Wells Fargo also lost the crown of the world’s most valuable bank by market capitalization to JPMorgan after agreeing to scrap sales goals for retail bankers, effective January 1. The 3.3 percent sell-off slashed the company’s market value to $236.9 billion, compared with JPMorgan's market cap of $240.3 billion. The bank was fined $185 million last week after being accused by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of creating deposit and credit card accounts without clients' approval to boost sales. The phantom accounts resulted in some customers being charged fees for insufficient funds. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $5 million in compensation to customers. CEO John Stumpf will testify about the alleged misconduct. Wells Fargo said it had fired 5,300 employees involved in the misconduct. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Tuesday Wells Fargo will "take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done," adding that it would impact people "at all levels of the organization."

Nelson Mandela Home About Us Projects Multimedia Opinion Reports Agenda Contacts Search for: Article written on 14.09.2016 at 08:20 AM by Joshua Massarenti Article tags Feminism multinational corporations Oxfam Tax category: Africa, Economy, Gender, Rights and Society Corporate tax is a feminist matter 0 Sep14 CitiGroup, Coca Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Pfizer, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Microsoft; of all the things these multinational corporations (MNCs) agree on, two things stand out: a proclaimed devotion to the feminist agenda and a penchant for tax dodging. On the former, all MNC’s claim to dedicate some part of their corporate responsibility and philanthropy duties to the “economic empowerment” of women and girls in poor countries, and to that end, promote business skills, good saving practices and access to loans as a panacea for women’s empowerment and their countries’ development. The steps these corporations take “to advance and empower women” make them role models for gender justice among MNC’s, according to the United Nations Global Compact. But then there’s the tax issue. A few months ago, the NGO Oxfam calculated that between 2008 and 2014 alone, the 50 largest public companies in the US accumulated some $337 billion in tax breaks, while holding a whopping $1.4 trillion in offshore cash reserves. All the companies mentioned above are on the list. Tax dodging by MNCs represents “integral components of [their] profit-making strategies,” and a huge force of socio-economic devastation in particular for the Global South, where such taxes represent a larger share of overall government revenue (16%, according to the IMF, versus 8 % for their high-income counterparts), and where the technical capacity to deal with complex tax offshore investment hubs and other loopholes is weaker. Here, Oxfam argues, unpaid corporate taxes can make the “difference between life and death, poverty and opportunity.” The practice costs poor countries aroundUS$ 100 billion dollars a year. The result, predictably, is that across Africa, the working poor, (over 38% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa) often end up carrying the burden of raising tax revenue while the multinationals go scot-free. In Malawi, for example, where tax incentives for the mining sector allegedly suck out eight times the amount the government collects in revenues every year, some say that “it is the order of the day for small businesses to pay more tax than multinational companies.” Meanwhile, as a new investigation reveals, South African companies make extensive use of tax haven benefits in the Netherlands, where, apparently, “an office with a house plant is enough to satisfy tax inspectors that a company really has operations in [Amsterdam],” rather than just a letterbox company. (By routing money through the Netherlands, companies reportedly push down their tax rate from to as low as 0,6 %. Of the 20 largest companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, 14 have one or more subsidiaries in the Netherlands). Within progressive feminist groups and anti-poverty NGOs, tax justice is now treated as a key development and human rights concern, with many feminists pointing out that it’s women and children who suffer the most, when social services are not provided. Chiara Capraro worked for Christian Aid, whose Death And Taxes report estimated, as early as 2008, that developing countries lost more to false invoicing and trade mis-pricing by corporations (more on that later) than what comes in as development aid. Later, in partnership with Tax Justice Network Africa (who tweet here), they published “Africa Rising” which (amongst other things) outlines steps on how to stop corporations and other elites from abusing tax loopholes. To Chiara, who is now Policy and Advocacy Manager for Women’s Economic Rights at Womankind in London, corporate tax is a feminist matter and a huge potential source of empowerment for women, if given the chance to learn about, and organize around it.

KELLER AND KATHERINE CHIGLINSKY Bloomberg News First Published Sep 13 2016 07:42PM    •    Last Updated Sep 13 2016 07:42 pm Share This Article Wells Fargo & Co. lost its title as the world's most valuable bank to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo, which is grappling with the fallout from claims that its employees created fake customer accounts, slumped 3.3 percent to close at $46.96 Tuesday in New York. That reduced the firm's market value to $236.9 billion, compared with $240.3 billion for New York-based JPMorgan. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million last week after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused bank employees of creating deposit and credit-card accounts without clients' approval to reach sales goals. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf has been asked to testify in Washington about the alleged misconduct, while the San Francisco-based bank agreed to eliminate sales goals for retail bankers, effective Jan. 1. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The company's operations are being impacted by the investigation," Piper Jaffray Cos. analysts led by Kevin Barker said Tuesday in a note. "The financial tailwind from the sales mishaps was immaterial to the company's fee revenue, but the elimination of product sales goals could materially change how the company's retail banking segment operates and the fee revenue it generates." Bank stocks also were pressured Tuesday as traders reduced bets that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at next week's meeting. JPMorgan fell 0.8 percent, while the 24-company KBW Bank Index slid 1.6 percent, extending its decline for the year to 2.7 percent. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are among the top 20 largest firms by market capitalization globally. Apple Inc., the biggest, is valued at more than $582 billion, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. is second at $531 billion.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

HSBC Holdings Plc was sued for allegedly ignoring warning signs that the late David Elias was committing fraud. — Reuters picNEW YORK, Sept 16 — HSBC Holdings Plc yesterday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by former Bernard Madoff customers who accused the British bank of fuelling his massive Ponzi scheme by ignoring red flags and encouraging “feeder funds” to invest with him. US District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said a federal law governing securities fraud cases prevented the plaintiffs from bringing their class-action claims against HSBC’s US unit.  She also said she lacked jurisdiction over claims against the HSBC parent and non-US affiliates. Jason Zweig, a lawyer for the customers, declined to comment because he was reviewing the decision.  HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman declined to provide immediate comment. The customers filed the lawsuit in December 2014, after a federal appeals court said the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC lacked standing to sue HSBC, JPMorgan Chase & Co and other banks he accused of aiding Madoff’s fraud. In their complaint, the customers said HSBC sold structured financial products that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to Madoff through feeder funds. They also said HSBC looked the other way when encountering signs of fraud, to help sate its “unquenchable thirst” for fees. The customers said their accounts with Madoff were not “covered securities”, barring them from pursuing their case, because the con man had total discretion over their money. But the judge said the customers expected Madoff to invest their cash in covered securities, which are traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange, to achieve the “extraordinary” returns for which he had at the time been known. “That plaintiffs had no control over which particular investment strategy Madoff undertook or specific securities he purchased does not obviate the fact that plaintiffs were seeking, directly or indirectly, to purchase covered securities,” Swain wrote.  “Accordingly, plaintiffs’ claims are barred.” Madoff, 78, pleaded guilty to fraud in March 2009, three months after his scheme was uncovered.  He is serving a 150-year prison term. The trustee, Irving Picard, has recouped roughly US$11.2 billion (RM46.32 billion) for former Madoff customers. The case is Hill et al v HSBC Bank Plc et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09745. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Judge dismisses fraud lawsuit over 50 Cent’s ‘PIMP’ Joint NGO letter on LPA amandments — Human Rights Watch AIG must defend Bill Cosby against defamation lawsuits Former Rabobank trader gets three months jail for Libor scheme Jury awards US$3m in damages over ‘Rolling Stone’ rape story Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
