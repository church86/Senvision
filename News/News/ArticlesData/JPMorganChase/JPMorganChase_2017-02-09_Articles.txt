 One chart shows just how devastating healthcare costs are for American families Bob Bryan Feb. 9, 2017, 9:20 PM 7,573 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   A new study from JPMorgan Chase tracked the financial habits of American households around the time of a major medical expense. US households, on average, wait until they get an increase in income before paying for a major medical expense. Major medical expenses lead to long-term increases in credit-card debt and lower income and liquid assets. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs in the US are among the fastest-growing expenses for Americans, and they can be devastating. JPMorgan Chase looked at the data of 250,000 banking customers to study their financial habits, and found just how difficult paying for a large medical expense can be. According to the findings, families typically wait until they get a bump in income before they pay for a major medical expense. In the month before a major expense, incomes were 4% higher than average for households. Other discretionary expenses also increased the month before. "This might suggest that some families delayed health care expenses until they had extra income to spend, and when they did so, they also increased expenses in other categories," the report said. As we've reported previously, households have cited medical expenses as one of their most demanding financial burdens, and 12% of Americans deferred seeing a doctor because of the costs in the last year. Income and spending weren't the only things to increase around a large medical payment, according to JPMorgan Chase. Families also built up their borrowing around that time to finance the payments. "When a major medical payment occurred, in aggregate, families experienced changes in not just their income and expenses but also their liquid assets and borrowing," the report said. "This was often by necessity—the $163 increase in income (4 percent relative to baseline, in aggregate) would not have been sufficient to fully pay for a major medical payment that was at least $400 and $2,089 on average." JP Morgan Chase Institute The changes in preparation for a medical expense also differed by income level, according to the study: "Specifically, families in the lowest asset tercile increased their liquid assets by 14 percent ($1,102), compared to 8 percent ($869) among the middle tercile, and just 3 percent ($891) among the highest tercile prior to the major medical payment (Figure 20). This suggests that families with lower total assets were more likely to have been liquidity-constrained prior to the medical payment and were either paying off outstanding medical bills or had left a medical condition untreated until they were able to pay for the out-of-pocket expenses." One explanation for this is that the uninsured rate for low-income families is typically higher. So more of these costs are coming out of pocket, rather than through coverage, and require more planning. According to the "National Health Interview Survey," the government's premier survey on insurance statistics, 24.7% of "near poor" Americans go without insurance versus just 6.5% of "not poor" persons. Perhaps the most startling statistic from the JPMorgan Chase findings is the length of time it takes for families to recover from the large medical expense. "A year after a major medical payment families had not fully recovered financially relative to the baseline," the research found. "In aggregate, comparing 12 months after the medical payment to the baseline period, income was 3 percent ($112) lower, non-medical expenses were 1 percent ($56) lower, liquid assets were 2 percent lower ($410), and revolving balance was 9 percent ($217) higher." Of note, according to JPMorgan Chase, is that the decline in income and nonmedical expenses also indicates that the expenses show "major medical payments were associated with lasting changes in families’ financial well being."

In a letter to his investors dated Feb. 1, and seen by Reuters, Loeb said banks will increase returns on equity by between 2 and 4.5 percentage points over the next two years "before tax cuts or deregulation is considered." Third Point bought 400,000 shares of Goldman Sachs; 17.5 million shares of Bank of America; and 5.3 million shares of JPMorgan Chase, the filings show. The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking, coming out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. There is little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Third Point also disclosed new share stakes in Zayo Group Holdings Inc, Honeywell International Inc, Anthem Inc and Time Warner Inc. Third Point dissolved its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and cut its stake in Apple Inc by 26 percent to 1.9 million shares, according to the regulatory filings.

 Dan Loeb made a nearly $1 billion bet on Wall Street Rachael Levy Feb. 10, 2017, 5:05 PM 6,131 facebook linkedin twitter email print Dan Loeb, founder of hedge fund Third Point.Reuters / Steve Markus Dan Loeb went big on Wall Street. A February 10 regulatory filing shows that Loeb's Third Point took large positions in JPMorgan and Bank of America and, to a lesser extent, Goldman Sachs — investing nearly $1 billion in total in the banks' shares during the fourth quarter of 2016. The JPMorgan position was worth about $453 million; the Bank of America holding about $387 million; and the Goldman holding about $96 million, the filing shows.  Bank stocks soared after of the US election but have since leveled off. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America are all flat or up slightly for the year to date. The regulatory filing, called a 13-F, lists long stock positions that investment firms make. The positions are current as of 45 days prior, so it is possible that Third Point has since changed its positions.  In a recent letter to clients, Loeb said that his $15 billion hedge fund firm was betting President Donald Trump's propositions for tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and deregulation would be great for investors. "This environment is undoubtedly better for active investing — just as active investing was considered to be on its deathbed," Loeb wrote in the letter, dated earlier in February. Loeb also wrote that he had made a large move into the securities of financial companies. He said that the sector represented about 12% of the fund, up from 4.4% on November 8, the day of the US election. Loeb didn't mention positions in the banks, and it's not clear when during the fourth quarter of 2016 that Third Point made the investments. Third Point returned about 6.1% last year, according to the letter, less than the roughly 12% gain for the S&P 500 index, with dividends.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Fee schedule for Chase debit cards (Court documents) By Justin Wm. Moyer By Justin Wm. Moyer February 10 at 4:44 PM Follow @justinwmmoyer A federal class-action lawsuit alleges that JPMorgan Chase plotted to bilk money from D.C. jurors by forcing them to receive jury service payments on Chase debit cards that come with fees attached. The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by D.C. attorney William Mark Scott, says burdensome debit card fees deprived “those who duly fulfilled their civic duty” of fair compensation. “Chase has devised a deceptive and unlawful scheme to deprive jurors of their full payments for jury service,” the suit reads. “This is done without an iota of consent from jurors, who are, in fact, further misled by the deceptive materials Chase provides with its debit cards, which falsely advertise that jurors can receive their funds for ‘FREE.’ ” JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the suit. In the District, jurors receive $30 per day if they serve on a jury, plus a $4 travel allowance. But Scott’s suit alleges that he couldn’t access his full payment for serving on a jury in July because of two 25-cent charges after “not having enough money in the account to pay for a ‘declined’ Debit Card purchase,” according to the suit, and because of $1.50 in “inactivity fees.” Screenshot of website used to manage Chase Debit cards. (Court documents) A $13 balance from his July service is still “trapped” on his debit card, the suit said. In a statement issued by his attorneys, Scott, 58, said he has lived in the District for more than two decades and is usually called for jury duty every two years. An attorney who represents whistleblowers, he estimated he had served more than 10 times. The suit notes that Chase charges about $5 for withdrawing money from out-of-network ATMs and $7 for withdrawing money using the debit card at a Chase branch. (The nearest Chase ATM is in Newark, Del., according to the Chase website.) Meanwhile, small balances left on cards — like the $4 jurors receive when they report for jury duty but are not selected for a panel — cannot be easily accessed and are effectively “forfeited to Chase,” the suit said. “Chase thus has complete control over a captive population of American jurors, which Chase exploits through a scheme that is intentionally designed to rob these jurors of the money owed to them by statute to line Chase’s own pockets,” according to the complaint. Anna Haac, an attorney representing Scott, called the Chase cards an example of “corporate greed resulting in a transfer of wealth from the bottom up.” “These are taxpayer dollars that are supposed to go to jurors for serving their civic duty to our communities and performing an integral function in our American democracy,” she wrote in an email. Leah Gurowitz, spokeswoman for D.C. Superior Court, said more than 31,000 people served as jurors in the District during the last fiscal year, and jury fees totaled $701,000. She said the court began paying jurors with debit cards in 2015 on the recommendation of the U.S. Treasury Department, partly because of problems with courthouse ATMs that dispensed funds to jurors. “The program is not designed to save the court money but rather to make it more convenient for jurors — they don’t have to wait for checks to be issued each day,” she wrote in an email. She added: “Any fees imposed are negotiated between Chase and the U.S. Department of Treasury.” It’s not the first time a juror has faulted a court over the debit card system. After compensating its jurors with debit cards for three years, Norfolk switched back to checks in 2016 after complaints about fees. However, some jurisdictions say paying jurors with a debit card saves money. Gwinnett County in Georgia switched to Chase credit cards in 2014, saying it was cheaper than printing and mailing checks. local public-safety Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive How Trump could dismantle Wall Street reform Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 12:28 PM Feb 10, 2017 at 12:28 PM Renae Merle The Washington Post For years, Wall Street has complained that restrictions placed on the industry after the financial crisis went too far and were too costly. Those concerns didn't generate much sympathy - until now. President Donald Trump has opened the door for sweeping changes to the way financial institutions - big and small - are regulated. He signed an executive order calling for a review of the laws that govern the U.S. financial system in an opening bid to upend the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial reform legislation passed in 2010. Banks and other financial institutions are dusting off their wish lists in hopes of trimming, if not killing, some of the most costly portions of the law. The country's biggest banks will spend $100 billion over the next five years complying with regulations, said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA, a boutique investment firm. "Dodd-Frank was enacted to prevent another financial crisis," Mayo said. "And it was done quickly and with purpose, but it was not done efficiently for the industry." Of course, dismantling the legislation will not be easy. It took more than a year to pass and comprises hundreds of regulations issued by more than half a dozen agencies. Some pieces of the bill required the approval of several federal agencies and would be cumbersome to revisit. After hiring thousands of people to help digest the new rules, some big banks say they are not looking for another time-consuming change. Large financial institutions now must hold onto more capital, a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses, and endure yearly "stress tests" to prove that they could survive economic calamity. But that hasn't stopped some from getting bigger anyway. JPMorgan Chase now has nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, up from about $2.2 trillion in 2008. Wells Fargo has grown even faster, now holding $1.9 trillion in assets compared with $1.3 trillion in 2008. "We're not asking for wholesale throwing outof Dodd-Frank," Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at a financial services conference in December. James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, told CNBC recently: "I'll be very clear about this, I'm not a fan of getting rid of Dodd-Frank." Rather than starting over, industry leaders say, they would rather tweak the framework Dodd-Frank created. Some of those changes will require congressional approval, but others may be easier to accomplish through the business-friendly regulators Trump is expected to appoint than by enduring a bruising battle in Congress. Small community banks, for example, are hoping regulators will more explicitly exempt them from cumbersome rules developed for Wall Street giants. "There is a lot that can be done with new personnel," said a senior financial industry official, who like others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk frankly. Even insiders wonder what is ahead. Here is a guide to the areas of Dodd-Frank most likely to be rolled back during the Trump administration: Restrictions on risky trading Dodd-Frank touches nearly every aspect of the way banks operate. But one of the most controversial ones has long been the so-called Volcker Rule, which aims to prevent large, federally insured banks from making risky financial bets. Financial institutions that make loans and collect consumer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, shouldn't be taking on the same type of risks that hedge funds and private-equity firms may, supporters of the rules say. Limiting those activities help keep the financial system safer, they said. But problems began to mount as regulators tried to distinguish between speculative activities, known as "proprietary trading," which the rule intends to limit, and other types of activities such as "market-making," in which banks buy and sell securities to clients, or hedging, in which banks attempt to offset risk in their holdings. The banking industry says the rule, which is named after Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is too complex and has been improperly applied to small community banks. Dimon famously criticized the rule, saying regulators would need a psychiatrist to help determine whether a trade was proprietary. Dimon once famously warned that "for every trader, we are going to have to have a lawyer, compliance officer, doctor to see what their testosterone levels are, and a shrink - what is your intent?" "The intent behind the Volcker rule is a good one," Mayo said. "The execution is riddled with red tape, complexity and lawyers." But there is another factor: A 2014 report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a financial regulator, found that the rule would cost national banks as much as $4.3 billion to implement as they would have to sell some investments at a loss. That doesn't include the billions that banks would potentially lose by not being able to make these bets, industry officials say. Some Republicans want to ditch the provision all together, which would require legislation and is likely to spark a fierce fight with Democrats. But Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who Trump has nominated to be Treasury secretary, appears to be leaning toward coming up a compromise. "I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can't do," Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee last month. The consumer watch dog One of the signature achievements of the Dodd-Frank law was the creation of a new agency: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since its creation, the CFPB has crafted hundreds of new rules for mortgage lenders, banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions. It has also repeatedly found itself in the crosshairs of Republicans in Congress. "The CFPB is arguably the most powerful, least accountable agency in U.S. history," Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, head of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a Wall Street Journal column. "The agency defines its own powers and can launch investigations without cause, imposing virtually any fine or remedy, devoid of due process." The CFPB is led by one person, Richard Cordray, and is funded through fees collected by the Federal Reserve. That limits Congress' ability to provide oversight of the agency. If the CFPB was led by a bipartisan commission and funded by a congressional appropriation instead, for example, lawmakers could use that process to exert pressure on the agency to focus on different types of cases. Outrage at the agency has culminated in efforts by Republicans to urge Trump to fire Cordray before the end of his term next year. (Hensarling has proposed finding a way to defund the agency.) Democrats have mounted aggressive efforts to save Cordray's job, but adding to CFPB's problems is a federal appeals court decision last year that found the agency's structure unconstitutional. That decision is being appealed. While some industry officials and Republicans would like to get rid of the agency altogether, that appears unlikely. "This is a tricky one, there is a lot of bipartisan support for the [CFPB], there is no support to abolish the place," said the senior financial industry official. But "there is definitely some support for doing some governance" reform to change how it is run.  Executive compensation  Dodd-Frank also includes measures targeting the way corporate executives are paid. They are among the rules most despised by the business community and have already faced increased scrutiny. The legislation, for example, restricts the ability of banks to hand over large bonuses to executives who made risky bets on the markets - and gives them the right to claw them back after the fact. Industry officials have complained the rule is confusing and doesn't recognize the changes big banks have already made to their bonus structures. But, again, getting rid of this provision would require an act of Congress and would meet a lot of resistance from Democrats. In another case, Trump's acting Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Michael Piwowar is already acting. Piwowar has ordered a review of a rule that went into effect last month that requires companies to disclose how much their CEOs earn compared to their employees. The rule could reveal a potentially embarrassing disparity between the paydays of millions of workers and their top bosses. It is favored by labor groups, but is called unnecessary by the business community. "The point of this ratio is simply to advance an agenda that says executive compensation is too high and embarrass people," said Bill McLucas, a securities lawyer with WilmerHale, who spent eight years as SEC enforcement chief.  A powerful panel A change may also be coming for a powerful group created by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC. It is comprised of the leaders of the country's primary financial regulators, including the SEC and Federal Reserve, and is led by the Treasury secretary. The council is tasked with identifying and attempting to address risks to the financial system before they can damage the economy. But banking industry officials have complained that FSOC is opaque and operates a "blunt instrument," according to one financial industry official. The panel is too focused on developing new rules rather than streamlining the ones already put in place, another said. Rather than doing away with FSOC, some industry officials want to see it change its focus and explain its decision making more explicitly. "There is a sense in the industry that it should be easier to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it," said David Portilla, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, who served as a senior policy adviser to FSOC in 2012 and 2013. "The administration could refocus FSOC on streamlining regulations rather than increasing regulatory burdens as it has been." Among FSOC's most contested powers is to designate a company as a "systemically important" financial institution - informally called "too big to fail" - and worthy of additional scrutiny because it could pose a grave risk to the economy in a crisis. In 2014, the panel added AIG, Prudential, General Electric's financing arm and MetLife to that list. None is a bank, but each is so large and complex, the council found, that if it failed it posed a danger to the financial system. MetLife sued, arguing that FSOC did not properly assess the insurer's financial strength, noting that the company does not engage in the type of risky behavior that could rattle the economy. Last year, a federal district judge sided with the New York-based firm. The case is being appealed, but the Trump administration could drop it or take other steps to loosen regulations of these firms. Community banks are ready for relief Dodd-Frank was designed primarily to rein in large Wall Street firms. But small and medium-size community banks say they have been crushed under new regulatory burdens since the financial crisis. A lot of community banks are in rural areas that Trump won, said Paul Merski of Independent Community Bankers of America. They are now looking to the Trump administration for relief, he said. "We kind of got swept up by the Wall Street meltdown," Merski said. The changes smaller banks want vary, but come down to a simple principle: They shouldn't face the same sort of rules as megabanks such as Goldman Sachs or Bank of America. "Regulation shouldn't be one size fits all," Merski said. "You shouldn't have the same regulatory burdens on a community bank, which has a simple business model, that you have in a trillion dollar institutions. If a community bank fails, it is not going to bring down the financial system." These banks, for example, want to raise the $50 billion asset threshold at which banks face tougher oversight. That should be raised to $250 billion, industry officials say. Also, the CFPB is considering a new rule requiring banks to comply with the same reporting requirements when making a small business loan as they do with a mortgage, Merski said. That extra paperwork, and the threat of facing prosecution or a fine if it is not filed correctly, will scare some banks away from making small business loans, he said. "If this could be stopped it would help a lot of people," Merski said. "Banks operate on a small margin, every penny of additional staff you have to hire" to keep up with new regulations hurts. Bankruptcy without disaster One of the clearest lessons of the financial crisis is just how difficult it is to put a large, complicated financial institution through bankruptcy. Under Dodd-Frank, troubled banks that are too complicated for the regular bankruptcy process would fall under the "Orderly Liquidation Authority." This provision gives a regulator the ability to declare a company's failure risky to the financial system and take over. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would run the process rather than a judge and could lend the company funds and take other steps to prevent its financial problems from bleeding to the rest of the financial system. This provision also gives regulators the ability to collect fees from banks to recoup any costs incurred in unwinding the financial institution. That way taxpayers would not be stuck picking up the bill. But critics say the process is cumbersome and object to the collection of fees from other banks. Instead, they say, this provision of Dodd-Frank should be eliminated and the U.S. bankruptcy code should be updated to handle more complicated cases. "What matters more than anything, at this point, is that we figure out an approach to resolution that is not just a hope, and which will in fact reduce systemic fallout, said Kurt Schacht of CFA, an association of investment professionals. "We are concerned we are not there yet under" Dodd Frank Act.

Industry experts say the segment is being pushed along at full speed by rapid growth in the merchant networking silicon and the optical markets. Industry leaders also feel that 100G connectivity speeds will be in full effect this year, while 400G is expected by late 2018 or most likely by 2019. JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur and his outstanding team once again attended the annual Linley Cloud Hardware Conference in California this year. In a new research report, they noted that while challenges always exist within the sector, the path forward is very positive, and many of the companies that the analysts have rated as Overweight look to benefit from the data center market innovation. Here are five companies that really stand out now. Broadcom This stock has been on a roll over the past year and is expected to trade even higher. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. Its extensive product portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial and other. Applications for the company’s products in these end markets include data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems and displays. The company produces radio frequency (RF) front-end for LTE-enabled Apple products. Wall Street estimates that the company does 15% of its total business with Apple. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the RF arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. The analysts are also very positive on the company benefiting on the ramp to both the Tomahawk and the Tomahawk 2 and routing silicon Jericho and Qumran. Facebook is expected to use the company’s Tomahawk switching chip in the Voyager project. The Kalia, Qumran-AX and Qumran-UX families of products are complementary to Broadcom’s high-capacity StrataDNX Jericho and Qumran-MX SoCs. Together they provide the industry’s most comprehensive end-to-end portfolio of switching solutions across the carrier, data center and enterprise markets. Shareholders are paid a 2% dividend. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $230, and the Wall Street consensus target IS 216.23. The shares closed most recently at $205.34. Cavium This stock has been a Wall Street favorite for some time and could be another great addition to tech portfolios. Cavium Inc. (NASDAQ: CAVM) designs, develops and markets semiconductor processors for intelligent and secure networks in the United States and internationally. It offers integrated semiconductor processors for wired and wireless networking, communications, storage, cloud, wireless, security, video and connected home and office applications. The company’s products also include a suite of embedded security protocols that enable unified threat management, secure connectivity, network perimeter protection and deep packet inspection. Arista networks recently announced a new programmable switch, the 7160 Series, which uses the new XPliant XP80 chipset from Cavium. Cavium purchased Xpliant in 2014, and the purchase has paid off handsomely. JPMorgan has a $75 price target for the shares. The posted consensus target is $72.38. The shares closed trading on Thursday at $65.08. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were flat compared to the previous year, as well as revenue that was up 1%. But both the top and bottom lines exceeded the consensus analysts’ estimates posted at Thomson Reuters. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.93% dividend. The $44 JPMorgan price target compares with the consensus target of $40.09. The stock closed Thursday at $35.46 a share. Inphi This company also is a strong contender in the data center arena. Inphi Corp. (NYSE: IPHI) provides high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for the communications, data center and computing markets worldwide. The company’s end-to-end data transport platform delivers high signal integrity at leading-edge data speeds, addressing performance and bandwidth bottlenecks in networks, from fiber to memory. Inphi has solutions to minimize latency in computing environments and enable the roll-out of next-generation communications infrastructure. Many on Wall Street feel that cloud data center customers are more likely to embrace Inphi’s exciting 100G products like the PAM-4 solutions, ColorZ and others. The company is expected to roll out 200G this year and 400G soon after. JPMorgan has set its price target at $59, above the consensus target of $56.21 and the most recent closing share price of $48.71. MACOM Technology This is a company that has been the subject of takeover chatter over the past year. MACOM Technology Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: MTSI) supplies key enabling technologies for the cloud connected apps economy and modern networked battlefield. Recognized for its broad catalog portfolio of technologies and products, MACOM provides high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeter wave and photonic semiconductor products for diverse applications, ranging from high-speed optical, satellite, wired and wireless networks to military and civil radar systems. Many on Wall Street feel the company’s acquisition of Applied Micro was a very solid addition to existing product lines. The analysts noted in the report: MACOM has demonstrated working 100G PAM4 optical links (with the use of MACOM Linear Drivers and TIAs) which would be suitable for 400G in 4x100G configuration. The JPMorgan price target is set a $54. The consensus target is $53.73, and the stock closed Thursday at $45.44 a share.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle By Renae Merle February 10 at 10:18 AM Follow @renaemerle (Patrick George for The Washington Post) For years, Wall Street has complained that restrictions placed on the industry after the financial crisis went too far and were too costly. Those concerns didn’t generate much sympathy — until now. President Trump has opened the door for sweeping changes to the way financial institutions — big and small — are regulated. He signed an executive order calling for a review of the laws that govern the U.S. financial system in an opening bid to upend the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial overhaul passed in 2010. Banks and other financial institutions are dusting off their wish lists in hopes of trimming, if not killing, some of the most costly portions of the law. The country’s biggest banks will spend $100 billion over the next five years complying with regulations, said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA, a boutique investment firm. “Dodd-Frank was enacted to prevent another financial crisis,” Mayo said. “And it was done quickly and with purpose, but it was not done efficiently for the industry.” Of course, dismantling the legislation will not be easy. It took more than a year to pass and is composed of hundreds of regulations issued by more than half a dozen agencies. Some pieces of the bill required the approval of several federal agencies and would be cumbersome to revisit. After hiring thousands of people to help digest the new rules, some big banks say they are not looking for another time-consuming change. Large financial institutions now must hold onto more capital, a measure of a bank’s ability to absorb losses, and endure yearly “stress tests” to prove that they could survive economic calamity. But that hasn’t stopped some from getting bigger anyway. JPMorgan Chase now has nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, up from about $2.2 trillion in 2008. Wells Fargo has grown even faster, now holding $1.9 trillion in assets compared with $1.3 trillion in 2008. “We’re not asking for wholesale throwing out of Dodd-Frank,” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of ­JPMorgan Chase, said at a financial services conference in December. James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, told CNBC recently, “I’ll be very clear about this: I’m not a fan of getting rid of Dodd-Frank.” Rather than starting over, industry leaders say, they would rather tweak the framework Dodd-Frank created. Some of those changes will require congressional approval, but others may be easier to accomplish through the business-friendly regulators Trump is expected to appoint than by enduring a bruising battle in Congress. Small community banks, for example, are hoping regulators will more explicitly exempt them from cumbersome rules developed for Wall Street giants. “There is a lot that can be done with new personnel,” said a senior financial industry official, who like others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. Even insiders wonder what is ahead. Here is a guide to the areas of Dodd-Frank most likely to be rolled back during the Trump administration: (Patrick George for The Washington Post) Restrictions on risky trading Dodd-Frank touches nearly every aspect of the way banks operate. But one of the most controversial ones has long been what is known as the Volcker Rule, which aims to prevent large, federally insured banks from making risky financial bets. Financial institutions that make loans and collect consumer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, shouldn’t be taking on the same type of risks that hedge funds and private-equity firms may, supporters of the rules say. Limiting those activities helps keep the financial system safer, they said. But problems began to mount as regulators tried to distinguish between speculative activities, known as “proprietary trading,” which the rule intends to limit, and other types of activities such as “market-making,” in which banks buy and sell securities to clients, or hedging, in which banks attempt to offset risk in their holdings. The banking industry says the rule, which is named after Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is too complex and has been improperly applied to small community banks. Dimon famously criticized the rule, saying regulators would need a psychiatrist to help determine whether a trade was proprietary. Dimon once famously warned that “for every trader, we are going to have to have a lawyer, compliance officer, doctor to see what their testosterone levels are, and a shrink — what is your intent?” “The intent behind the Volcker rule is a good one,” Mayo said. “The execution is riddled with red tape, complexity and lawyers.” But there is another factor: A 2014 report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a financial regulator, found that the rule would cost national banks as much as $4.3 billion to implement as they would have to sell some investments at a loss. That doesn’t include the billions that banks would potentially lose by not being able to make these bets, industry officials say. Some Republicans want to ditch the provision all together, which would require legislation and is likely to spark a fierce fight with Democrats. But Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who Trump has nominated to be treasury secretary, appears to be leaning toward coming up with a compromise. “I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can’t do,” Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee last month. (Patrick George for The Washington Post) The consumer watchdog One of the signature achievements of the Dodd-Frank law was the creation of a new agency: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since its creation, the CFPB has crafted hundreds of new rules for mortgage lenders, banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions. It has also repeatedly found itself in the crosshairs of Republicans in Congress. “The CFPB is arguably the most powerful, least accountable agency in U.S. history,” Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), head of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a Wall Street Journal column. “The agency defines its own powers and can launch investigations without cause, imposing virtually any fine or remedy, devoid of due process.” The CFPB is led by one person, Richard Cordray, and is funded through fees collected by the Federal Reserve. That limits Congress’s ability to provide oversight of the agency. If the CFPB was led by a bipartisan commission and funded by a congressional appropriation instead, for example, lawmakers could use that process to exert pressure on the agency to focus on different types of cases. Outrage at the agency has culminated in efforts by Republicans to urge Trump to fire Cordray before the end of his term next year. (Hensarling has proposed finding a way to defund the agency.) Democrats have mounted aggressive efforts to save Cordray’s job, but adding to the CFPB’s problems is a federal appeals court decision last year that found the agency’s structure unconstitutional. That decision is being appealed. While some industry officials and Republicans would like to get rid of the agency altogether, that appears unlikely. “This is a tricky one, there is a lot of bipartisan support for the [CFPB]; there is no support to abolish the place,” said the senior financial industry official. But “there is definitely some support for doing some governance” reform to change how it is run. (Patrick George for The Washington Post) Executive compensation Dodd-Frank also includes measures targeting the way corporate executives are paid. They are among the rules most despised by the business community and have already faced increased scrutiny. The legislation, for example, restricts the ability of banks to hand over large bonuses to executives who made risky bets on the markets — and gives them the right to claw them back after the fact. Industry officials have complained the rule is confusing and doesn’t recognize the changes big banks have already made to their bonus structures. But, again, getting rid of this provision would require an act of Congress and would meet a lot of resistance from Democrats. In another case, Trump’s acting Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Michael Piwowar is already acting. Piwowar has ordered a review of a rule that went into effect last month that requires companies to disclose how much their CEOs earn compared to their employees. The rule could reveal a potentially embarrassing disparity between the paydays of millions of workers and their top bosses. It is favored by labor groups but is called unnecessary by the business community. “The point of this ratio is simply to advance an agenda that says executive compensation is too high and embarrass people,” said Bill McLucas, a securities lawyer with WilmerHale, who spent eight years as SEC enforcement chief. (Patrick George for The Washington Post) A powerful panel A change may also be coming for a powerful group created by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC. It is composed of the leaders of the country’s primary financial regulators, including the SEC and Federal Reserve, and is led by the treasury secretary. The council is tasked with identifying and attempting to address risks to the financial system before they can damage the economy. But banking industry officials have complained that the FSOC is opaque and operates a “blunt instrument,” according to one financial industry official. The panel is too focused on developing new rules rather than streamlining the ones already put in place, another said. Rather than doing away with the FSOC, some industry officials want to see it change its focus and explain its decision-making more explicitly. “There is a sense in the industry that it should be easier to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it,” said David Portilla, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, who served as a senior policy adviser to the FSOC in 2012 and 2013. “The administration could refocus FSOC on streamlining regulations rather than increasing regulatory burdens as it has been.” Among the FSOC’s most contested powers is to designate a company as a “systemically important” financial institution — informally called “too big to fail” — and worthy of additional scrutiny because it could pose a grave risk to the economy in a crisis. In 2014, the panel added AIG, Prudential, General Electric’s financing arm and MetLife to that list. None is a bank, but each is so large and complex, the council found, that if it failed it posed a danger to the financial system. MetLife sued, arguing that the FSOC did not properly assess the insurer’s financial strength, noting that the company does not engage in the type of risky behavior that could rattle the economy. Last year, a federal district judge sided with the New York-based firm. The case is being appealed, but the Trump administration could drop it or take other steps to loosen regulations of these firms. (Patrick George for The Washington Post) Community banks are ready for relief Dodd-Frank was designed primarily to rein in large Wall Street firms. But small and medium-size community banks say they have been crushed under new regulatory burdens since the financial crisis. A lot of community banks are in rural areas that Trump won, said Paul Merski of Independent Community Bankers of America. They are now looking to the Trump administration for relief, he said. “We kind of got swept up by the Wall Street meltdown,” Merski said. The changes smaller banks want vary, but come down to a simple principle: They shouldn’t face the same sort of rules as megabanks such as Goldman Sachs or Bank of America. “Regulation shouldn’t be one size fits all,” Merski said. “You shouldn’t have the same regulatory burdens on a community bank, which has a simple business model, that you have in a trillion-dollar institution. If a community bank fails, it is not going to bring down the financial system.” These banks, for example, want to raise the $50 billion asset threshold at which banks face tougher oversight. That should be raised to $250 billion, industry officials say. Also, the CFPB is considering a new rule requiring banks to comply with the same reporting requirements when making a small-business loan as they do with a mortgage, Merski said. That extra paperwork, and the threat of facing prosecution or a fine if it is not filed correctly, will scare some banks away from making small-business loans, he said. “If this could be stopped it would help a lot of people,” Merski said. “Banks operate on a small margin, every penny of additional staff you have to hire” to keep up with new regulations hurts. Bankruptcy without disaster One of the clearest lessons of the financial crisis is just how difficult it is to put a large, complicated financial institution through bankruptcy. Under Dodd-Frank, troubled banks that are too complicated for the regular bankruptcy process would fall under the “Orderly Liquidation Authority.” This provision gives a regulator the ability to declare a company’s failure risky to the financial system and take over. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would run the process rather than a judge and could lend the company funds and take other steps to prevent its financial problems from bleeding to the rest of the financial system. This provision also gives regulators the ability to collect fees from banks to recoup any costs incurred in unwinding the financial institution. That way taxpayers would not be stuck picking up the bill. But critics say the process is cumbersome and object to the collection of fees from other banks. Instead, they say, this provision of Dodd-Frank should be eliminated and the U.S. bankruptcy code should be updated to handle more complicated cases. “What matters more than anything, at this point, is that we figure out an approach to resolution that is not just a hope, and which will in fact reduce systemic fallout,” said Kurt Schacht of CFA, an association of investment professionals. “We are concerned we are not there yet” under the Dodd-Frank Act. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

US households, on average, wait until they get an increase in income before paying for a major medical expense. Major medical expenses lead to long-term increases in credit-card debt and lower income and liquid assets. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs in the US are among the fastest-growing expenses for Americans, and they can be devastating. JPMorgan Chase looked at the data of 250,000 banking customers to study their financial habits, and found just how difficult paying for a large medical expense can be. According to the findings, families typically wait until they get a bump in income before they pay for a major medical expense. In the month before a major expense, incomes were 4% higher than average for households. Other discretionary expenses also increased the month before. "This might suggest that some families delayed health care expenses until they had extra income to spend, and when they did so, they also increased expenses in other categories," the report said. As we've reported previously, households have cited medical expenses as one of their most demanding financial burdens, and 12% of Americans deferred seeing a doctor because of the costs in the last year. Income and spending weren't the only things to increase around a large medical payment, according to JPMorgan Chase. Families also built up their borrowing around that time to finance the payments. "When a major medical payment occurred, in aggregate, families experienced changes in not just their income and expenses but also their liquid assets and borrowing," the report said. "This was often by necessity—the $163 increase in income (4 percent relative to baseline, in aggregate) would not have been sufficient to fully pay for a major medical payment that was at least $400 and $2,089 on average." health spending changes COTDMore (JP Morgan Chase Institute) The changes in preparation for a medical expense also differed by income level, according to the study: "Specifically, families in the lowest asset tercile increased their liquid assets by 14 percent ($1,102), compared to 8 percent ($869) among the middle tercile, and just 3 percent ($891) among the highest tercile prior to the major medical payment (Figure 20). This suggests that families with lower total assets were more likely to have been liquidity-constrained prior to the medical payment and were either paying off outstanding medical bills or had left a medical condition untreated until they were able to pay for the out-of-pocket expenses." One explanation for this is that the uninsured rate for low-income families is typically higher. So more of these costs are coming out of pocket, rather than through coverage, and require more planning. According to the "National Health Interview Survey," the government's premier survey on insurance statistics, 24.7% of "near poor" Americans go without insurance versus just 6.5% of "not poor" persons. Perhaps the most startling statistic from the JPMorgan Chase findings is the length of time it takes for families to recover from the large medical expense. "A year after a major medical payment families had not fully recovered financially relative to the baseline," the research found. "In aggregate, comparing 12 months after the medical payment to the baseline period, income was 3 percent ($112) lower, non-medical expenses were 1 percent ($56) lower, liquid assets were 2 percent lower ($410), and revolving balance was 9 percent ($217) higher." Of note, according to JPMorgan Chase, is that the decline in income and nonmedical expenses also indicates that the expenses show "major medical payments were associated with lasting changes in families’ financial well being."

Grant | @kelligrant Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 12:45 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here’s the 411 on how to kick-start your emergency fund    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 8:30 AM ET | 01:28 Better start building that emergency fund. Earlier this year, a Bankrate.com report found that just 41 percent of Americans could draw from savings to cover a $500 emergency. The problem? That's a pretty minor bill as far as emergencies go. In a given year, 40 percent of families face an "extraordinary payment" of roughly $1,500 to cover an unexpected medical, auto repair or tax bill, according to a new analysis from JPMorgan Chase Institute. The bank assessed anonymized account data from 25,000 Chase checking account customers between January 2013 and December 2015. Tax time is the worst season for unexpected expenses — and not just for tax bills. JPMorgan Chase Institute data found that March and April are the most common months for extraordinary medical expenses. "Even with more money in their pocket from tax refunds, the strain of major and unexpected medical costs are hitting families hard and making it difficult for them to recover," Diana Farrell, president and chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, said in the press release. A year after an emergency medical payment, 48 percent of families still had depleted savings and 33 percent still had elevated credit card debt, the report found. Financial advisors typically recommend setting aside three to six months' worth of living expenses, although some families may benefit from having even more saved. That can be a daunting target, but even having a little bit set aside can mean you rely less on credit to cover an emergency, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. "One of the things that people need to consider in this situation is that you have to start somewhere," he said. Assess your budget and look for room to save even small amounts, McClary said. Set up recurring contributions from your paycheck into a savings account to help reinforce the habit. And if you do get a windfall, such as a bonus or a tax refund, save at least some of that money to help create a safety net. show chapters Beefing up your emergency fund    Friday, 3 Oct 2014 | 8:58 AM ET | 00:50 Kelli B.

Now, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is adding another unwelcome element: banking fees. In a handful of jurisdictions, the biggest U.S. bank by assets handles administration of the juror-compensation system, issuing debit cards instead of the age-old system of paper checks. In addition to the juror pay, the cards also come loaded with fees — for balance inquiries, for inactivity, for using non-Chase ATMs, for charges with insufficient funds and for cash or check issuance. The funds become impossible to withdraw from an ATM once the balance falls below $20, and in at least one jurisdiction — Washington, D.C. — there are no Chase branches or ATMs within 90 miles (145 kilometers), ensuring the funds will eventually be frittered away to the bank. IMAGE: Bloomberg News William Mark Scott, a lawyer who served on a jury in Washington last year, sued JPMorgan, accusing it of unjust enrichment and violation of the Consumer Protection Act. He’s seeking to represent all other jurors who were paid with JPMorgan debit cards. "Chase uses its monopolistic control over juror funds to steal captive jurors’ money by assessing unconscionable and deceptive fees," Scott claims. "By making it prohibitively expensive to receive an over-the-counter cash withdrawal from, or to receive a check drawn upon the debit card, Chase ensures a ‘rump’ balance will be left on each debit card -- and forfeited." Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit. It’s the second time in two years that Chase has been accused of taking advantage of captive customers. In 2015, thousands of ex-convicts said Chase charged predatory fees through debit cards issued to people leaving prison. The cards held prison pay and commissary balances. Chase took over distribution of prisoner pay under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Chase paid almost $450,000 to settle the lawsuit. For local courts, having a big bank come in and take over the juror-pay system was welcome relief. The cost of overseeing the system and cutting checks is time-consuming and expensive. In some jurisdictions, budget liabilities swelled into the tens of thousands of dollars as some jurors didn’t bother to cash or deposit checks. The full scope of JPMorgan’s juror pay program is unclear. Washington, Livingston County, Michigan, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, have adopted it, according to a Google search. Fort Bend County, Texas, also considered it but it is unclear if it went into effect there. JPMorgan doesn’t appear to disclose any information about the program in its financial statements. The bank announced in 2014 that it would exit the pre-paid card business, but continues to administer the program in jurisdictions where it is still under contract. Scott said in his lawsuit that he served in July on a superior court jury in Washington D.C., which pays $30 a day and $4 daily for travel. He got a Chase debit card and was twice charged 25 cents for not having sufficient funds when making a purchase. He was also twice charged $1.50 for inactivity. With about $13 left on the card, he has few ways of using it and expects it to be eventually eaten by fees. "If there is, in fact, any way for jurors to use or withdraw their rump balances, Chase conceals this in order to milk more fees from them," he claimed in the lawsuit. "Indeed, Chase expects and relies on individuals forfeiting these funds to the bank." The case is Scott v JPMorgan Chase & Co., 17-cv-249, U.S. District Court for District of Columbia (Washington).

Inorganic growth plan are EPS accretive, it feels. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 2 Comments Moneycontrol Bureau NTPC Bank of America Merrill Lynch has maintained buy rating on the stock, with unchanged target price of Rs 194 as Q3 numbers were broadly in-line while capacity addition lagged target. According to the research firm, 50 Kcal per Kg decline in Coal GCV (gross calorific value), if not passed on, may impact earnings by 6 percent and decline in interest rate may lead CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) to cut FY20-24 regulated return on equity (RoE). BoAML built 100 bps interest rate cut in regulated return on equity to 14.5 percent. While retaining overweight rating with increased target price at Rs 185 (from Rs 180 earlier), JPMorgan expects the company to close the acquisition of phase-I of Chhabra plant by March. Inorganic growth plan are EPS accretive, it feels. Citi has maintained buy rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 186 but preferred Power Grid given faster EPS growth and higher return on equity. The company believes it can add a further 2,620 MW in Q4. Change in measurement of GCV had no impact on Q3 result, JPMorgan says. IDFC Securities believes latest CERC regulations have reduced RoE for company's projects by over 4 percent and also believes commercialisation of plants will be slower in FY18 & FY19. The brokerage feels the stock is trading at reasonable valuations, while reiterating underperform rating, with revised target price at Rs 167. According to the brokerage house, positive HC order on appeal against CERC norms is key risk. Goldman Sachs expects NTPC's plant load factors (PLFs) to remain below 80 percent. The brokerage house says Q3 was in-line with expectations and timely capacity addition remains key. It is neutral on the stock, with increased target at Rs 176 (from Rs 169). With retaining hold rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 175, Emkay says it has rolled valuation multiple to FY19. It has assigned price-to-book value multiple of 1.9x to its regulated equity as on FY19. Earnings marginally impacted due to fall in PAF & PLF in Q3FY17, it feels.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 8, 2017 at 8:20PM The future of fintech is bright, almost blindingly so, but many of the entrepreneurs in the industry fail to grasp what will eventually lead to the downfall of countless fintech firms, particularly those that lend money. An unhealthy obsession with "yes" There's a belief among technology-based lenders that the goal should always be to say "yes." If someone needs money, it's less about whether that person or business is a good credit risk than it is about the customer experience and the length of time it will take the borrower to access their funds. The homepage of LendingClub (NYSE:LC) advertises personal loans of up to $40,000. You can "apply online in minutes" and "get funded in as little as a few days," the company says. Another prominent fintech lender Funding Circle claims that small businesses can get loans from between $25,000 and $500,000 in as little as 10 days. These are innovative services that seek to fill important niches in the credit markets. They enable people who have historically been shunned by banks to get loans in order to expand their businesses or to pay off credit card debt at less usurious rates. But even good ideas can be taken too far. It's on this note that fintech lenders can learn a lot from the history of banking. And the most important lesson of all revolves around the frequent need to say "no." Digging into the history of banking will one day prove invaluable to fintech investors. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Those who forget history... The credit cycle is the most powerful force in finance. Credit expands at a voracious rate when times are good. But it then contracts with such suddenness and viciousness that anyone who isn't prepared for the turn will be crucified on the cross of credit, similar to the 17,000 banks that have failed since the Civil War. Lenders get overconfident when the economy is ascending. They convince themselves and those around them that this time is different; that they've finally cracked the nut on protecting their institutions against widespread default. Warren Buffett refers to this as the institutional imperative, which he defines as "the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so." Buffett wrote this in the early 1990s, just as the credit cycle came crashing down on an entire generation of lenders who had convinced themselves that credit risk was a thing of the past. "In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming-like zeal, now they are experiencing a lemming-like fate," Buffett continued. We've seen tendencies like these emerge time and again throughout history. In the 1980s, investment managers believed that so-called portfolio insurance had eradicated the risk of owning stocks -- a close cousin of bonds and thus merely an alternative type of credit. It only became clear how naive this was once people realized that portfolio insurance had actually accelerated the market crash on October 19, 1987 -- so-called Black Monday. The same was true in the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2008. Lenders had convinced themselves that mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps offered ironclad protection against a downturn in the housing market. This liberated them to lend money to all comers irrespective of income, assets, and credit history. We all know how that story ended. This is why the best bankers, those like JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon, are obsessed with risk and humble in the face of the credit cycle. "No one has the right to not assume that the business cycle will turn," implored Dimon on the eve of the last crisis. "Every five years or so, you have got to assume that something bad will happen." This is also why investors and entrepreneurs should recoil whenever they hear leaders of fintech companies insinuate that they've neutralized credit risk once and for all. Take this claim from ZestFinance, an online lender that applies "Google-like math" to make credit decisions: This new technology is able to consume vast amounts of data to more accurately identify good borrowers -- enabling higher repayment rates for lenders and lower-cost credit for consumers. At ZestFinance, there is no human interaction of any kind involved in underwriting. Instead, we rely on several mathematical models running in parallel to make underwriting decisions. While many creditors take hours, or even days, to make credit decisions, we make them -- accurately -- in less than 10 seconds. This lack of humility is a mistake. While there's always the possibility that ZestFinance has truly tamed credit risk for the first time in thousands of years of lending, there are entire graveyards filled with companies that have said the same thing throughout history. Tempering dogma with reality The idea that credit should flow swiftly and freely is laudable, but it must be tempered with reality. Banks are retail operations that sell money, a commodity that anyone would want at the right time and at the right price. When it comes to credit, in turn, it's often more noble and responsible to say "no" than it is to say "yes." "It's a well-known maxim that one of the hardest things about running a business is to maintain the ability to say no and thereby save limited resources for the best opportunities," writes Duff McDonald in his biography of JPMorgan Chase's Dimon. "Over time, most companies simply lose their discipline." The same point was made by Fred Schwed, Jr. in his classic satire of Wall Street Where Are the Customers' Yachts?: The conservative banker is an impressive specimen, diffusing the healthy glow which comes of moderation in eating, living, and thinking. He sits in state and spends his days saying, with varying inflections and varying contexts, 'no.' ... He says 'yes' only a few times a year. His rule is that he reserves his yesses for organizations so wealthy that if he said 'no,' some other banker would quickly say 'yes.' His business might be defined as the lending of money exclusively to people who have no pressing need of it. This seems insensitive and exclusionary, but there's more than a grain of truth to it. Just ask the hundreds of banks that failed in the wake of the financial crisis after convincing themselves that credit risk had been eradicated from the face of the earth. Embracing strategic inefficiency The key to avoiding this fate is to embrace inefficiency, albeit to a careful and conscious extent. It's on this score that claims from fintech companies (such as LendingClub, ZestFinance, and to a lesser extent Lending Tree (NASDAQ:TREE)) about rapidly approving loans to people that they've never met in person is so concerning to anyone with any knowledge of the ceaselessly undulating waves of the credit cycle. More than a century ago, one of the two namesakes of JPMorgan Chase, John Pierpont Morgan, was asked during a Congressional hearing if commercial credit was based on money or property. "No sir. The first thing is character," Morgan responded. The inquisitor persisted: "Before money or property?" To which Morgan responded: "Before money or property or anything else. Money cannot buy it ... because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom." It's tempting for fintech entrepreneurs to reject this as outdated advice. After all, we no longer lumber around in horses and buggies like Morgan did. The Pony Express has since been replaced by the telegraph, which was later replaced by the telephone. Penicillin wasn't discovered until 15 years after Morgan uttered these words. And, of course, we now have the internet and big data. "Since the modern credit system was created in the 1950's, the world has changed," claims ZestFinance. "Technology has changed. So should credit." But the truth is that credit hasn't changed, or at least not as much as statements like these might otherwise lead one to believe. Technology can assist in the underwriting process, but it isn't a panacea that renders credit risk obsolete. More specifically, technology shouldn't be viewed as a substitute for assessing character, which is admittedly an inefficient process, though one that must be embraced by fintech lenders with an interest in surviving the unforgiving vicissitudes of the credit cycle. Defeating naivety I'm picking on ZestFinance only because it's the most open with its belief that the power to assess creditworthiness has been fundamentally transformed by technology. Indeed, based on conversations I've had with fintech entrepreneurs in the past, this opinion is common among fintech entrepreneurs who are well meaning and have years of experience writing code, but little knowledge of the undomesticated nature of credit. One explanation for this naivety is that many fintech entrepreneurs don't appreciate how common financial crises are. In the nearly 215 years since the turn of the eighteenth century, as I've noted previously, the United States has experienced 14 major bank panics. That equates to one every decade and a half. Another explanation is that fintech entrepreneurs involved in lending have the luxury of being dogmatic, as their personal capital tends to be insulated from their firms' credit decisions. Just like the fat cat bankers of yore, marketplace lenders such as LendingClub and Lending Tree traffic in other peoples' money, merely matching creditors with debtors. The inherent fragility of this model has proven itself repeatedly in the past. It was a loan broker that caused the nation's first "too big to fail" bank, Continental Illinois, to go under in 1984. And it was mortgage brokers like Countrywide Financial that led to so much destruction in the crisis eight years ago, which explains why JPMorgan Chase has forevermore sworn them off. Nassim Taleb makes this point especially elegantly in his book Antifragile. "For the Romans, engineers needed to spend some time under the bridge they built -- something that should be required of financial engineers today," he writes. "The English went further and had the families of the engineers spend time with them under the bridge after it was built." In short, while it's tempting to dismiss the hundreds of years' worth of experience reflected in the history of banking as outdated, fintech lenders do so at their peril. This won't be obvious until the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse, which could be many years from now, but when it happens it's those companies that embrace the lessons of the past that will not only survive the chaos and disorder, but emerge from it in a stronger competitive position.

  Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News SIGN IN BUSINESS INSIDER       PORTFOLIO SEARCH Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News CANCEL JPMorgan's head of US equities on the dollar, market volatility, and where investors should put their money in 2017 Tina Wadhwa Feb. 10, 2017, 11:49 AM Bloomberg Business Insider recently caught up with Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the head of US Equity Strategy at JPMorgan. In the interview, Lakos-Bujas discusses dollar strength, market volatility and where investors should put their money in 2017. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Tina Wadhwa: So, first, just a broad question. What are the big themes of the moment on your mind? What are you worried about, what are you excited about? Dubravko Lakos-Bujas: I would say dollar strength and the dollar strengthening further. And some of that could come on the back of current corporate tax reform proposals like the border tax adjustments that could impact the dollar upwards. So dollar strength is clearly one key source of risk for equities. The second one is interest rates, basically higher rates that result in further tightening. Wadhwa: Stocks on the whole have been rallying to all time highs since the news of Trump’s election. Have markets failed to price in the policy uncertainty of a Trump presidency? Are we starting to price it in now? Lakos-Bujas: So first of all we generally see the proposals that have been suggested by the new administration, looking at them based on all the information we have available right now, as a net net positive. As sort of pro-growth.  Clearly we had a very early call on that, and we basically came out with with a tactical S&P price target of 2300 that we thought we were going to reach in early 2017. We came out with that the day after the US election. That’s the more immediate effect that we thought could take place as the market starts to price in some of these proposals and a more pro-business agenda. There’s a lot of uncertainty so it’s hard to quantify things that precisely, but generally our view is net net constructive and we have reached this first leg up on the market. It took place relatively quickly pricing in some of these things in anticipation. What I think you’ll likely see now in the coming months is some elevated degree of volatility and elevated degree of dispersion across stocks and across industries as the market basically starts to gradually digest a lot of the views coming out. I would say in the coming months you’ll see a lot of potential volatility, and later in the year, some further small upside, so our 2017 price target is 2400. Wadhwa: Given the uncertainty you speak of, how can investors protect themselves? Lakos-Bujas: That’s not an easy one. You have two sides of it. One - you get a 5% pull back in the market, just given that generally fundamentals are relatively okay. Profit cycles are normalizing. Many people might use that weakness in the market to step in and buy at a cheaper level. There’s no simple way of answering that. You could look at ways of hedging your portfolio by buying volatility, buying volatility insurance, buying insurance by being long volatility, in case you do start to see some disruption or risk factors kicking in, be it on the US side with respect to these proposals or be it on the foreign side as far as geopolitics and elections. We’re going to see elections in France, Germany, the Netherlands. There’s a lot of unknowns. The second thing is if you believe that a strong dollar and rising rates are going to continue tightening conditions, don’t be surprised if at some point the Fed turns marginally more dovish, which means that gold and gold miners might be an interesting hedge to an existing portfolio. Wadhwa: President Trump is known for his impulsive tweets, on everything from particular companies to particular people. How does an investor handle this? Are we just one tweetstorm away from a crash? REUTERS/Carlos BarriaLakos-Bujas: You have to keep in mind that if you look at the events of 2016, a lot happened. If anything, at the end of the day, the fear factor may have been elevated, but markets turned out to be fairly resilient. There was some volatility but the volatility in many cases was fairly short lived and net net the markets were fairly resilient. I think these tweets could create some degree of noise or volatility, but I think the markets adapt and eventually cut through the noise. The more you see this happen, I think the more that the markets will basically adjust. I don’t think the markets will be all over the place on the back on that. Wadhwa: What makes the market so resilient? Lakos-Bujas: Because I think for one you do see an environment when central bankers globally remain very cautious. Even though the Fed is looking to normalize policy, still you could say that policy is relatively accommodative and that provides some form of synthetic floor. In the fundamental backdrop in terms of earnings and the profit cycle, things in general are improving and they’re normalizing. I wouldn’t call them very strong, but they’re okay. So if you look at our expectation for this year in terms of earnings, we’re calling for 7 - 8% upside in terms of earnings delivery. Wadhwa: Dating back to 1910, history shows that after a two term government has changed and a new government comes in, regardless of which side of the house they’re from, there’s a strong chance of a recession within 12 months. Are we headed for a recession in 2017? Lakos-Bujas: I don’t have a strong view on that. I’ve looked at the history, I’ve looked at previous election cycles, Republican versus Democratic party, incumbent versus non incumbent etc., and from all of the in depth analysis that we do, and we find the relationship to be statistically very weak. So I have a very hard time deriving judgment on the back of that information. I think we have a fairly unique environment today and you need to look at it in full context. It’s hard to sort of make a broad brushed historical comparison there. Wadhwa: In your view, what’s the the biggest risk to the global economy? Thomson ReutersLakos-Bujas: One is the dollar. The dollar continues to strengthen. The dollar on a global trade weighted basis has increased by about 20-25% over the course of the last 2-3 years. If that trend persists, you could see the global economy getting further pressurized. Keep in mind that 60% give or take of the global economy directly or indirectly is linked to the dollar. The dollar plays a very important role. That’s one key risk to look at. The second risk is what happens with rates. There’s a good amount of leverage in the system, especially if you look at corporates. US corporates ex-financials - leverage there is pretty much in line with all time highs, back to the 2007 levels. There’s less room for tolerating a significant amount of rate increases. And we need to see what happens on the trade side. If the US does adopt significant changes on the border side and that ends up resulting in significant retaliatory effects from some of our biggest trading partners like China, that clearly can affect the global economy. Wadhwa: Speaking of China, what’s your outlook? What’s going to happen there? Lakos-Bujas: Our research department’s outlook for China is still basically calling for positive growth, pretty much in line with what we saw for last year. Generally I think the macroeconomic momentum and data coming out of China and more broadly EM over the last 3-6 months has been positive. The trend has generally been positive there. So I think the outlook for us is on the positive side. Wadhwa: Turning back to equities, what sectors do you recommend? What sectors should we stay out of? Shutterstock/ChameleonsEyeLakos-Bujas: Within equities, we have been early on the reflation trade. We went overweight energy in December 2015. We went overweight materials in January 2016 and we also entered the financials trade in late 2015 which may have been a little bit too early, but so far it’s been paying off. Those are our three higher conviction sector overweights that I do think have more room to run, especially financials. The fourth one I would add into that bucket is healthcare. I like healthcare. I do see healthcare as a sector that will likely continue to print superior growth. Valuations have come down quite a lot. Valuation wise it’s attractive. Headline risk isn’t going to go away necessarily given the new administration, but I think a lot of the negativity around headline risk is already priced in. Wadhwa: 2016 saw a massive flow of funds from active into passive management, but many analysts see an upside for active investing in 2017. What’s your view? Is this trend likely to reverse? Lakos-Bujas: We’ve published a lot on this topic and clearly you have seen this big trend and rotation from the fundamental active equity world into the passive equity world. There are multiple reasons behind this. 2016 was the worst rotation from active to passive at least in the last 10 years, if not longer. The drivers behind this are twofold. You have cyclical drivers and structural drivers. Structural drivers won’t necessarily go away anytime soon. Structural drivers include everything from technological advancement to significant increases in computing power. Passive products have benefitted from these trends, and we have seen a proliferation of quant type products, smart beta, low vol, which are more passive in nature. They tend to give the end client more transparency and more liquidity. There's also been a huge focus on fees. I don't think those structural drivers go away anytime soon. They continue to persist. And the move flows underneath from active into passive. The cyclical drivers could be the growth environment and the interest rate environment. The outlook is somewhat more constructive going forward, and if we expect the dispersion will generally likely pick up given all of these moving variables on the policy side and on the macro side, that should bode well for your fundamental active manager. From a cyclical point of view, as you go into 2017, maybe 2018, I think there are going to be some positives. But I think these positives continue to get pressurized by some these negative structural effects. So I would say I’m not so sure that you will now see a complete reversal in this rotation, but I think you’ll see a slowdown in this rotation from active into passive. Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesWadhwa: What are your views on the way Brexit is unfolding and on the upcoming European elections? What are you worried about and what do you see as the biggest risks? Lakos-Bujas: I think it's still very unclear what a Brexit means in terms of outright trade. How does trade get renegotiated? Is there basically a hard stop or is there some kind of middle ground? It’s very hard to say. Clearly some degree of negativity has already been priced in, but then again I think we’re sort of in a wait and see mode to see what exactly takes place there. Plus Brexit could take awhile to play out - it could take years.  I think the more imminent risk are the elections in the Eurozone area - Netherlands, France, Germany. Brexit and the US election do provide a reference point and at least some precedent of what could happen with these upcoming European elections. So is there a possibility of a tail risk event there? Clearly there is. I don’t think we should be underestimating that. But I think our base case remains one where net net you will see a relatively balanced outcome. Could you see periods where volatility sort of spikes all of a sudden and you get these sort of fat tail risks play out? You could, but our net net case is that the underlying fundamentals and the macro backdrop will continue to gradually improve and that will be the more important factor. Momentum will likely continue to stay positive.

Brought to you in partnership with Hortonworks. 2017 could be a watershed year for how US-based banks and third-party app providers oshare data with each other. Since the start of this new year, two U.S. banks (JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo) have made significant announcements about their agreements to share data with Intuit securely through APIs. This is a marked change in the stance by big U.S. banks from their earlier position of reluctance towards allowing third-party personal finance management apps to access their customer banking data. Since there was no formal way of data sharing agreement between banks and third-party apps, the latter had to adopt the older insecure approach called screen scraping. These third-party personal financial management apps (made by companies like Intuit and Yodlee) currently use screen scraping. The user has to provide his or her banking username and password to these apps. These apps will then automatically log in using those user credentials, screen-scrape the bank data, and use it for reporting in its apps. This was problematic in multiple accounts, the most important being that the user had to share their user credentials with third-party apps. From the bank’s perspective, there was a heavy load on their servers, and this was affecting their banking website performance and operations. However, the explosion of the smartphones and mobile apps and the evolution of FinTech companies has created an environment where the third-party apps have become indispensable, a situation that the banks dislike, and their banking apps will never be able to replace them in terms of their effectiveness. In fact, banking regulators in Europe realized this a while back and instructed their banks to share data through APIs. The agreement between JPMorgan Chase and Intuit says that they will introduce Open Authentication and will exchange data through the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) 2.2 API. JPMorgan Chase customers will avoid giving their banking usernames and passwords since the technology will use an API token-based approach to authorizing Intuit apps to download the requested account information. Similar to the way apps in the social media world operate using OAuth, you can expect third-party apps to ask permission to access sensitive banking data. This is a huge improvement — you end up only sharing particular information in your bank accounts instead of the entire data being screen scraped. Good news for all the tech and citizen developers out there in the FinTech industry is that these big banks are not going to limit their partnerships only to Intuit. Banks are going to add more and more partners to access their customer's banking data. Therefore, there is an opportunity waiting to make it big and innovative with live bank data.

Dimon famously bought 500,000 shares of his company's stock — right before the market began to climb for the rest of the year and into 2017. The bold move became known as the "Dimon Bottom," but Dimon wasn't alone. Warren Buffett, Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, Elon Musk and casino magnate Steve Wynn all made investments that week, profiting millions of dollars as the stock market began a rally that has seen the S&P 500 surge 24.6 percent. Dimon's $26 million purchase last year was larger than normal. It increased his personal stake in JPM shares by 8 percent. The trade paid off well, as the stock rose 60 percent since then, making him $16 million just on his trade last year. That's not even counting the over $200 million he gained on his original stake. Mnuchin made two purchases of CIT Group that week, totaling 229,800 shares, at around $26, according to SEC filings tracked by OpenInsider. At the time Mnuchin was vice chairman of CIT. Mnuchin also bought 114,624 shares at $27.77 the week prior, on Feb 4. Compare those purchase prices with the $41.07 closing price CIT had on this week, or the $41.05 price it had in early December, when Mnuchin was tapped to run Treasury. All three trades combined earned him a profit of $4.9 million. Wynn also made well-timed purchases. The Wynn Resorts CEO made his $15 million purchase in the week of the Dimon Bottom as the tail end of an even larger buying spree in December and January. Wynn's February 2016 buy was the last time he bought Wynn shares. With a share price around $95 now instead of in the $50s, he's been a clear winner. Profits on that buy were about $10 million. Buffett's purchase of more than 1 million shares in Phillips 66 was simply part of a longer series of purchases spread out over the year, but he was wise to continue buying during the temporary slump. Phillips 66 has paid off the worst of all the February investments, returning only 8 percent. And then there's Musk, who bought almost 570,000 shares of SolarCity on Feb. 12. The purchase price was $17.56, a good deal considering the company was sold with the stock worth $25.37. That itself meant a 45 percent gain in just six months. But because those shares were converted into Tesla stock, which is up another 20 percent since the acquisition, that adds to Musk's gains. All in, that's over $5 million for one trade last February. If you consider the same five trades, but this time sort them by percentage return, you'll see that instead of Dimon being the big winner, it was actually Wynn, with Mnuchin and Musk right there with him. Correction: This story was revised to correct the year of the stock purchase to February 2016.

 There's a hot new posting for Wall Street bankers Matt Turner Feb. 7, 2017, 9:50 AM 5,869 facebook linkedin twitter email print Guy D'Alema/FX Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to places like Seattle, Denver, and Atlanta. JPMorgan just hired Brennan Spry as head of corporate client banking and specialized industries in the South, for example. Spry previously worked in Barclays' investment banking division. Spry will be based in Atlanta, overseeing a team of bankers in the region who provide services to large companies with more than $500 million in annual revenues. In addition, the bank has hired Nina Sprinkle to the corporate client banking team in Atlanta as a senior banker responsible for serving companies in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. She previously worked in syndicated and leveraged finance at SunTrust and Bank of America. Matt Tugwell has also joined as a senior banker focused on the Carolinas. He was most recently at Bank of America in the leveraged finance group. JPMorgan isn't the only bank hiring staff for or moving staff to regional centers in the US. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider last year. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth." NOW WATCH: The best and worst months to rent an apartment in major US cities Loading video...

The company has offered $7.5 million for the 60-acre property in Orangeburg, which used to be the site of the Rockland Psychiatric Center, city officials told the local news outlet The Journal News. While data center outsourcing is on the rise, with companies increasingly leasing colocation space and using cloud services instead of building their own data centers, many still find it necessary to keep some of their workloads in-house. This is especially true for bank data centers, which must comply with financial services industry regulations. Orangeburg is home to another financial-services data center, a server farm built by Bloomberg. There is also a colocation facility in town, operated by 1547 Critical Systems Realty, where one of the tenants is Green House Data. City officials have been using tax incentives to pursue companies that would build data centers in Orangeburg since Bloomberg decided to build its $710 million facility there in 2014. A lot of power is available from the local utility, and the city is close to the data center clusters in New York City and New Jersey. Bloomberg made the decision after its older data center in Manhattan came dangerously close to a disastrous outage during the flooding that followed Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Updated: February 11, 2017 @ 1:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Opinion Events Obituaries Buy & Sell Close Jennifer Rubin OTHER VIEW Other View: The president's princelings Feb 10, 2017 0 Jennifer Rubin WASHINGTON — In response to the president’s unprecedented attack on a company declining to do business with a family member, Nordstrom’s answered President Donald Trump’s accusation that it was treating Ivanka Trump unfairly. “To reiterate what we’ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance,” the company said in a statement. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.” In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka. National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, gave a measured response. “What we are all seeing is that we’re living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House,” he said. “It’s someone who communicates directly and forcefully and has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning, all of us, I think, how to work in that environment.” That’s one way of putting it. Another is that the president and his aides are inviting corruption. Had any federal employee, including a Cabinet official, done what Trump did, he or she would have run afoul of federal ethics regulations, specifically, Title 5, Section 2635.702: “An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. . . . An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.” This is garden-variety corruption, of the type we deplore in kleptocratic regimes around the country. Likewise, if an American company consented to hire or do business with a foreign leader’s children in order to grease the skids for business dealings or avoid government retribution it would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As the Financial Times reported recently: “JPMorgan has agreed to pay $264m to settle a US probe into its practice of hiring well-connected Chinese ‘princelings’ to win business. . . . Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. “ ‘JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions,’ said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. ‘JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.’ “ The White House (falsely) keeps insisting the president cannot have conflicts of interest, neglecting the Constitutional prohibition on receipt of monies from foreign governments. Nevertheless, Congress can and should close the gap in ethics laws given that this president refuses to divest himself of businesses and insists on using the power of his office (during the transition and currently) to benefit his family finances. Perhaps we need a presidential anti-corruption act that would make Title 5, Section 2635.702 applicable to the president and vice president. In any event, both spokesman Sean Spicer’s derogatory comments (an attempt to “coerce”) and counselor Kellyanne Conway, who directly hawked Ivanka’s line (“I fully—I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”), seem to run afoul of existing ethics laws and should be held accountable. There may be other legal avenues as well. Ethics guru Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution this week tweeted that there is a cause of action under California’s Unfair Competition law forbidding “any unfair business act.” Eisen told me Thursday, “The law has long recognized that when someone makes untrue statements about a business, and those statements cause harm, a cause of action lies. As it happens, California, which has a lot of Nordstrom’s stores, has one of the most generous laws in the nation in allowing a business to respond when it is the victim of unfair treatment.” He adds, “Interestingly, that law also allows the California attorney general or other public officials to bring an action as well. Nordstrom’s says the president and Mr. Spicer’s statements were not correct. . . . [T]his was a business decision that was made because Ivanka’s line was not selling, that there was nothing unfair or political about it.” Conveniently, former Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra is now California’s state attorney general. Over to you, Mr. Becerra. Rubin is a Washington Post columnist.

Don’t dismiss anomalous numbers just because they don’t support your preferred theory. by Peter Coy @petercoy More stories by Peter Coy February 9, 2017, 2:15 PM EST From Subscribe Reprints Photographer: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Wall Street economists insisted for months that the labor market couldn’t possibly get tighter without triggering wage inflation. “We are at full employment,” Deutsche Bank Securities headlined a note to clients in October. “Leading indicators of inflation flashing red,” it wrote days later. “On the cusp of full recovery,” Goldman Sachs wrote in December. “Wage inflation continues to gain traction,” JPMorgan Chase economists said in January. Then came February, and Wall Street’s much-anticipated wage pressure was nowhere to be seen. Even though employers added a more-than-expected 227,000 workers in January, average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent. Forecasters struggled to make sense of why Americans’ pay had barely risen at all. “What happened with wages?” asked economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The pay-growth puzzle bears on the vitality of the U.S. and this presidency It’s hard to blame the economists for overestimating wage growth; they’re applying the time-honored law of supply and demand. It stands to reason that when workers are in greater demand, they’ll be able to hold out for better pay. The mystery is why that hasn’t been happening in the U.S., at least not as much as most experts expected. The pay-growth puzzle bears on the vitality of the U.S. economy in coming years, to say nothing of the vitality of the Donald Trump presidency. If wage inflation really does threaten to overheat, the Federal Reserve under Chair Janet Yellen will feel obliged to raise interest rates to slow down the economy. That will prevent Trump from making good on his campaign promises to raise the growth rate to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent, or more. If there’s no wage inflation brewing, on the other hand, the Fed can afford to hold back, economic growth can accelerate, and the Republicans should do well in the 2018 midterm elections and beyond. No matter what you think of Trump, you should be hoping that the U.S. economy isn’t, in fact, already bumping up against its speed limit. Because if it is, it means that speed limit is distressingly low—and American living standards can improve only at a snail’s pace. Output dropped sharply during the last recession. Instead of springing back like a yo-yo, it’s drifted upward at a meager 2 percent a year. If the economy had grown since the end of 2007 at the average pace it did from 1947 to 2007, it would be 22 percent bigger than it is today. That’s a difference in annual gross domestic product of more than $4 trillion. The minuscule 0.1 percent increase in hourly earnings in January is, in this context, a strange mixture of good news and bad news. It’s bad news because it means long-suffering workers still aren’t getting the substantial raises they need to pay their bills. Labor has been getting a smaller share of the national income, while the share going to capital owners (business owners and shareholders) has been rising. And consumers can’t buy more stuff if they aren’t being paid more. The good news is that the small increase shows the economy can easily employ more people, and generate more goods and services, without overheating. It’s possible, of course, that the earnings growth number was a fluke. Economists found numerous reasons to play it down after its release by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Feb. 3. For one thing, a lot of the January employment growth was in lower-paying jobs such as retail, leisure, and hospitality, which put a drag on average hourly earnings. For another, wages in the high-paying financial sector fell 1 percent—a rare and unexplained drop that might well be reversed in February. Those who believe wage inflation is threatening point out that the labor market has indeed tightened over the past year by many measures. Earnings are up 2.5 percent over the past 12 months, and surveys of companies and consumers show the highest expectations for wage gains since the last recession. About half of small businesses report there are few or no qualified applicants for job openings, up from a quarter that said so in 2009. And people are voluntarily quitting jobs at a prerecession pace—something that could force employers to jack up pay to hang on to valued workers. “There are no good reasons why wage inflation should slow down now, because the economy is at full employment,” wrote Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank Securities’ chief international economist, in an e-mail. It’s dangerous, though, to dismiss anomalous numbers just because they don’t appear to fit with economic theory. It might be that the tiny earnings gain in January wasn’t a fluke after all, but rather an indicator that workers still lack bargaining power. David Weil, a Boston University Questrom School of Business economist who worked in the U.S. Labor Department under President Obama, says wages are suppressed because corporations have “fissured”—shunted their low-wage employees to outsourcers who pay them even less. One sign of slack is that companies haven’t been adding overtime hours, which they tend to do when they can’t hire as many workers as they need. Another strong indication of slack is that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.8 percent in January, from 4.7 percent in December, as people flooded into the labor market searching for work. The rate of participation in the labor force, which fell sharply from 2008 through 2013, has stopped falling despite the retirement of many baby boomers. “It’s far from obvious to me that we’re on the cusp of an imminent breakout of wage growth,” says Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, parting from his colleague Slok. In other words, Trump may be onto something in averring that the economy still has room for growth. He’s not one to comb through the BLS website to deepen his understanding of the economy. During the campaign he called the official unemployment rate that the BLS publishes “one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.” That said, the president is “absolutely right in saying that the labor market has much more slack in it than the Fed and other commentators are thinking about,” said David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth economics professor and former Bank of England policymaker, on Bloomberg TV before the latest unemployment report. Yellen could yet prove to be one of Trump’s most important allies in the fight for growth—even though he alleged during the campaign that the Fed was more political than Hillary Clinton. Blanchflower’s comment about “the Fed and other commentators” isn’t fair to Yellen, who’s pushed back against economists who warn that the central bank will invite inflation if it doesn’t aggressively raise interest rates to slow growth. “A natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the curve,” she said in a speech at Stanford in January. “The short answer, I believe, is no.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Economics makes strange bedfellows. Liberals who backed Obama’s demands for fiscal stimulus are now worrying that Trump will somehow engineer a growth spurt that will carry Republicans past Democrats in the next one or two election cycles. “Nobody I know in Congress doesn’t want job creation, but who gets the credit? That’s hard on them,” says Leo Hindery, a Democrat who’s managing partner of private equity firm InterMedia Partners in New York. Democrats are left warning that stimulus, especially if it’s in the form of tax cuts for the rich, will be a “sugar rush” that will leave ordinary Americans worse off. When it comes to economic data, it can be difficult to separate what people believe to be true from what they want to be true. “People need to be a little more scientific and a little less political in the nature of their interpretation,” says Robert Johnson, president of the left-leaning Institute for New Economic Thinking. “It’s times like this when people are least scientific.”   —With Patricia Laya Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wall Street strategists and company analysts have already been hard at work giving clients ways to play this big moment for the markets. Just a few weeks ago Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin shared a basket of stocks with the highest effective tax rates that he believes will benefit the most from the lowering of the corporate tax rate. Here are seven stocks the firm recommended in its "high tax rate" basket. In similar fashion, JPMorgan agreed with the same thesis of buying companies with high tax rates. "Companies with high effective tax rates and high domestic revenue exposure will disproportionately benefit from a reduction in tax rates," U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients. Here are 10 names the JPMorgan strategist highlighted with the highest tax rates. Strategas Research Partners focused on a different area of tax policy. The firm told clients to buy stocks that will benefit from his likely plan to allow multinationals to bring foreign profits back into the country at a reduced tax rate. "We have been surprised that our repatriation basket has not outperformed post-election since this tax change has the highest probability of being enacted," Dan Clifton wrote. For investors who want to trade the repatriation tax holiday being implemented, here are five companies in the firm's repatriation basket. In regards to company-specific ideas, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant is bullish on Disney shares due to tax reform. "Disney has a pro-inflation business model (advertising, theme park & resort pricing), is largely domestic, is a full taxpayer, has low leverage, and has relatively high capital expenditure levels," Jayant wrote in a note to clients. "Broadly speaking, in considering the primary insinuations put forth by Congressman Ryan's tax reform blueprint ... Disney stands to be a significant beneficiary." And Citi Research's Michael Rollins upgraded Verizon due to Trump's agenda earlier this year. "Since the election, we have become more optimistic on the prospects for tax reform and have been able to better understand the potential benefits for Verizon. We also believe Verizon is likely to see a lighter touch from regulation," analyst Rollins wrote. Finally, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods told investors to buy American Express as tax cuts will lead to more credit card spending. "Our analysis shows that historical changes in tax rates (both personal and corporate) have been catalysts for billed business growth (and GDP growth)," analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote. show chapters Trump: Will make tax announcement in a few weeks    Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 2:02 PM ET | 01:41 Tae KimInvesting Journalist Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DIS --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Nearly Forty Percent of Families Face an Extraordinary Medical, Auto or Tax Payment Annually, New JPMorgan Chase Institute Data Show WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New JPMorgan Chase Institute data on the financial health of U.S. households show that in any given year almost four in ten families make an extraordinary payment related to medical services, auto repair, or taxes of roughly $1,500, and it’s taking them over a year to recover from major medical expenses. Middle-income households also experienced a nearly $1,300 swing in monthly expenses, which is the equivalent of one month’s rent or mortgage payment. Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments builds on anonymized account data of roughly 250,000 core Chase checking account customers from January 2013 to December 2015. It is the third in a series of Institute reports evaluating household finances, including its inaugural report, Weathering Volatility: Big Data on the Financial Ups and Downs of US Individuals and its report on income volatility, Paychecks, Paydays and the Online Platform Economy: Big Data on Income Volatility. This new report found that extraordinary medical payments were most common during tax season and coincided with a 4 percent increase in total income. Families acquired over $900 more in liquid assets before making a major medical payment, yet many families did not recover financially within a year after making a major medical payment. Twelve months after the payment, savings remained depleted for almost half of families (48%) and credit card debt remained elevated for almost a third of families (33%). “This could be the most granular look at families’ financial volatility we have ever seen,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO, JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Even with more money in their pocket from tax refunds, the strain of major and unexpected medical costs are hitting families hard and making it difficult for them to recover.” Following are the key findings for this most recent look at the state of expense volatility for US households. Key Findings: Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments Finding One: Expenses fluctuate by nearly $1,300 or 29% on a month-to-month basis for median-income households, or $7,391 year-to-year. Discretionary expenses are more volatile than non-discretionary expenses in percentage terms. Month-to-month discretionary expenses fluctuate by 56 percent or $514 while non-discretionary expenses fluctuate by 28 percent or $735. Finding Two: Expense volatility was high across the income and age spectrum. While older families typically had less volatile incomes, they exhibited a larger range of income and expense volatility. Older families maintain similar, if not higher, levels of expense volatility even after significant decreases in income volatility after age 60. Finding Three: Almost four in ten families per year—particularly middle-income and older families—made an extraordinary payment over $1,500 related to medical services, auto repair, or taxes. One in ten families made more than one extraordinary payment in a given year. One in six families (16%) made at least one major medical payment in a given year, including 3% who made two or more. Older Americans had the highest incidence of extraordinary payments across all three types. Forty-four percent of families 65 and older made at least one extraordinary payment compared to that of 22 percent of adults under 25. Finding Four: Extraordinary medical payments were more likely to occur in months with higher income and specifically during tax season. Extraordinary medical payments were most common in March and April and coincided with a 4 percent increase in total income increases. The income increase stemmed mostly from tax refunds and not labor income. Finding Five: Prior to a major medical payment, families garnered significant liquid assets but did not recover financially within 12 months after the payment. Families acquired over $900 more in liquid assets before a major medical payment; this represented a 5 percent increase. The increase in liquid assets is more pronounced for families in the bottom percentile of liquid assets indicating they face a stronger liquidity constraint. Fifty-three percent of families increased their liquid assets one month prior to the medical payment, many of whom immediately spent them down in the month with a medical payment. Many families did not recover financially within a year after a major medical payment. In aggregate, comparing 12 months after the medical payment to the baseline period, income was 3 percent lower, non-medical expenses was 1 percent lower, liquid assets were 2 percent lower, and revolving balance was 9 percent higher. “Our integrated, high-frequency data on income, expenses, assets, and liabilities shed new light on the connection between physical health and financial health and the reality that families are not fully insured against the economic consequences of major health events,” added Farrell. “This indicates a need for better products and solutions to help families manage expense volatility and become more financially resilient.” View the full report Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments.

These three stocks may soon oblige. (Photo: Getty Images) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Dividend stocks can be the foundation of a great retirement portfolio. Not only do the payments put money in your pocket, which can help hedge against any dips in the stock market, but they're usually a sign of a financially sound company. Dividends also give investors a painless opportunity to reinvest in a stock, thus compounding gains over time. However, not all income stocks live up to their full potential. Using the payout ratio -- i.e., the percentage of profits a company returns to its shareholders as dividends -- we can get a good read on whether or not a company has room to increase its dividend. Payout ratios between 50% and 75% are ideal. Here are three income stocks with payout ratios currently below 50% that could potentially double their dividend payments. Gilead Sciences We'll begin the week by taking a closer look at a biotech behemoth that's potentially guilty of being too good: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). Gilead Sciences' claim to fame is its hepatitis C product portfolio (Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Epclusa). Gilead was the first company to bring an effective once-daily cure to pharmacy shelves, and it's not really relinquished its market share since. Its issues of late stem from its need to provide larger gross-to-net discounts to insurers for Harvoni, the HCV drug designed to treat the most common type of hepatitis C, genotype 1, and its having already nabbed the low-hanging fruit in the HCV market within the U.S. However, don't think for a moment that declining EPS and revenue estimates are a reason to avoid Gilead. For starters, Gilead's HCV products still have a massive market opportunity to hit. Even with the low-hanging fruit in the U.S. out of the way, Gilead has ample opportunity to treat the estimated 180 million people worldwide infected with hepatitis C. Even though some of these people aren't in countries where Gilead would receive the best margins, it nonetheless represents a long runway of opportunity. Not to mention the fact that none of Gilead's peers have even come close to improving the treatment timeframe and supplanting Gilead's therapies. Gilead Sciences is also a mammoth in the HIV treatment space. The company has around a half-dozen oral HIV innovations under its belt, with Stribild and Genvoya being among the most impressive and fastest growing treatments. Combined, Gilead's HCV and HIV franchises, along with its smaller approved therapies, should allow it to generate $15 billion or more in annual free cash flow through the end of the decade. This gives Gilead more than enough capital to seek out acquisitions and boost its shareholder yield. Remember, the last time Gilead made a big acquisition it acquired Pharmasset's leading asset, which spawned its HCV line of drugs. Currently paying out $1.88 annually (a 2.6% dividend yield), but slated to earn in excess of $10.50 per share each year through 2019, Gilead is a strong candidate to double its payout to shareholders. Union Pacific Another attractive rebound candidate is railroad giant Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP), which just finished up a challenging 2016. With commodity prices still challenged, Union Pacific found the sledding tough in most of its major freight categories. Coal freight revenue fell 6% in the fourth quarter, while chemicals were flat. The lone bright spot was agricultural products, where freight revenue rose 7%.  (Photo: Union Pacific) The good news is that a number of macroeconomic factors are looking up in 2017. For instance, consumer confidence is improving, which is great news for a cyclical logistics company like Union Pacific. Even more intriguing, energy prices are on the mend. Though higher energy prices boost its diesel fuel costs, they also have a positive impact on other commodity costs, as well as on Union Pacific's pricing power per carload. Despite its 2016 weakness, Union Pacific also managed to improve its operating ratio by 120 basis points to 62%. The key reason Union Pacific was able to improve its margin in the face of a weak commodity market was its stringent cost-cutting. As noted by my Foolish colleague Joe Tenebruso, Union Pacific reduced its locomotive count by 5%, while trimming its train, engine, and yard workforce by 7%. Having levers to pull is a nice thing for a cyclical logistics company when commodity prices can seemingly change at the flip of a switch. Considering that locomotives are a more fuel-efficient mode of transport than trucks as a function of total freight transported, it's unlikely that we're going to see freight transport by rail decline for any extended period of time. With Union Pacific currently paying out $2.42 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but on track for more than $8 in full-year EPS by 2020, a doubling of its dividend could be possible over the next five-to-10 years. JPMorgan Chase Sticking with the theme of gigantic companies, the last attractive income stock this week is money center bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). JPMorgan Chase has been hindered by a confluence of factors in recent years. For example, dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve has constrained its net interest margins, all while tougher regulations imposed from the Fed increased its expenses and reduced existing paths to profitability. As icing on the cake, the banking sector has been a pin cushion for fines since the Great Recession, most of which stem from its mortgage practices.  (Photo: Getty Images) On the plus side, these issues appear to be in the rearview mirror now. Though the Fed has only raised its benchmark federal funds rate twice over the past decade, it's firmly switched from a dovish to hawkish monetary policy. This lends hope that interest rates are going to head higher in the months and years to come. Higher interest rates help boost the net interest income banks generate from their variable loans. According to JPMorgan Chase's latest analysis, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term lending rates would add $2.8 billion in additional net interest income, while a 200-basis-point increase in both would lead to $4.5 billion in additional interest income. For what it's worth, 200 basis points would be very close to the Fed's targeted rate of 3%. Also, JPMorgan Chase stands to benefit from the possibility of relaxed regulations in the banking industry under the Trump administration. If Trump holds to his word and removes a number of banking regulations, it would become substantially easier for JPMorgan Chase and its peers to return money to shareholders. Currently, JPMorgan Chase is paying out $1.92 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but Wall Street is looking for $7.47 in full-year EPS by 2018. This would appear to be a recipe for a higher payout ratio and a bigger dividend in JPMorgan's future. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The company did not list any pricing details in this filing but in the previous filing the offering was valued up to $3 billion. The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNAP. The underwriters for the offering are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Allen. This company’s flagship product, Snapchat, is a camera application that was created to help people communicate through short videos and images. The company calls each of those short videos or images a Snap. On average, 158 million people use Snapchat daily, and over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. On average, more than 60% of daily active users (DAUs) use the chat service every day to send Snaps and talk with friends. Snap benefits from the frequency with which its user base communicates with one another because each message invites a user back to the application when they receive a push notification. On average, DAUs visit Snapchat more than 18 times each day. Snap detailed its finances in its filing: Worldwide advertising spend is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020. The fastest growing segment is mobile advertising, which is expected to grow nearly 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. We believe that one of the major factors driving this growth is the shift of people’s attention from their televisions to their mobile phones. This trend is particularly pronounced among the younger demographic, where our Daily Active Users tend to be concentrated. According to Nielsen, people between the ages of 18 and 24 spent 35% less time watching traditional (live and time-shifted) television in an average month during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2010. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. The firm may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, it does not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this time.

This is an upgraded Amazon Store Card specifically for Amazon Prime members. Advertisement This isn’t exactly an Amazon cash back credit card, because the credit only hits your statement, but it is an interesting option that savvy shoppers will want to pay attention to. With the right budgeting and planning this offers an option for users to save 5% on an iPad, new Android tablet, most Android phones, MacBooks, Windows notebooks and tablets, HDTVs, the PS4, Xbox One, major appliances, DVDs and books to name a few things. Many of these items also qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing options for 5, 12 or 24 months. What you need to know about the Amazon Store Card for Prime Members. The Amazon Store Card for Prime Members is issued through Synchrony Bank, the same bank that handles the mainAmazon.com Store Card. There are some negative reviews from users who did not understand the payment terms with the special financing options, so make sure you pay attention to the details. Here are seven important details you need to know about the new Amazon Prime Store Card. Advertisement 5% Back on Amazon Purchases The biggest reason this new Amazon Store Card is a tempting option for Amazon Prime members is that you can score 5% back every day. For comparison the Amazon Rewards Visa only offers 3% back at Amazon, but there is a bigger sign up bonus and you can use the Amazon Rewards Visa by Chase at other stores. Unlike the Chase Freedom card that only offers 5% back on Amazon purchases in the last several months of the year, this works every day. No Interest on Major Purchases for 6, 12 or 24 Months For users who don’t want to get the 5% cash back on a purchase it is possible to use the promotional financing. As long as you pay off the purchase before the 6, 12 or 24 month period there is no interest on the purchase, but if you don’t pay it off on time you need to pay interest on the whole purchase from the date of the purchase. This will stack of the 25.99% interest rate on your card for the last 6, 12 or 24 months. If you use this, it may be best to only make one major purchase at a time. Advertisement What Qualifies for Special Financing Offers Here’s what you can get special financing on. Amazon offers a handy list of things that qualify for the special Amazon Store Card financing deals. The 24-month special financing offers on Amazon are only good on HDTVs and Autodesk software. The 12-month and 6-month special financing options are valid on any order above $599 or $149 respectively. That means you can add almost anything to your cart to hit this level and use the promotional financing. When you check out you can choose 5% back or the financing offer, but beware that Amazon may set a default for you or set this card to a default payment option as part of the checkout process, so be sure to verify that your payment options are right for the next purchase you make. No Annual Fee, But $99 Amazon Prime Required There is no annual fee for the Amazon Store Card, but that doesn’t mean that it is free to use. You need to be an Amazon Prime member to use this special Amazon Prime Store Card. Advertisement Amazon Prime is $99 a year and it includes free two day shipping, $3.99 one day shipping options, unlimited access to music, movies and TV shows. Users also get free Amazon Cloud Drive storage with unlimited photo storage and can read free books through the Kindle First and Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. $40 Sign Up Bonus When you apply and are approved for the Amazon Prime Store Card you get a $40 Amazon account credit. This is small compared to some of the other bonus sign up options, but it is almost like getting Amazon Prime for half off for one year. This is on top of the 5% back bonus and financing offers, so you don’t have to choose between this offer and the others — but you only get it once. Only Purchases at Amazon.com The new Amazon Store Card for Prime Members only works at Amazon. Advertisement The Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card are only good for purchases at Amazon. You cannot use this to make purchases at the gas station, McDonald’s and any other store. This is fine as long as you know what you are signing up for and plan to use it accordingly, but if you want one you can use at other locations there are other cards to look at. Compare to Other Credit Cards Before you jump in and sign up for the Amazon Store Card and Amazon Prime Store Card you should look at other options. The Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card offers a $70 sign up option, 3% back at Amazon, 2% back at gas stations, restaurants and drugstores as well as 1% cash back on other purchases. This card also offers drastically lower interest rate options starting at 14.24% — but without any special financing options. There is also a Chase Freedom card that includes 5% cash back on Amazon purchases from October through December only. 8 Responses 04/16/2015 Austin Powers Reply When comparing other cards, your math doesn’t add up Josh. 05/24/2015 Ninja Reply Great article, very informative. Hopefully you’ll be able to answer this question: I applied for this card after being approved for the Amazon Visa. I was denied but I thought that it was because I forgot to add my suffix to my application details, however, I was denied again, for the second time within 5 minutes. So my question is; did they do a hard or soft pull to my credit and did it happen twice? Thanks for your time! 07/29/2015 Francia Reply Is only for USA? 08/04/2015 Hannah Reply I like the 5% but I only use this card for items that I know I won’t have issues with, like dog food. I would never use it to buy electronics or other important items bc using a major cc gives you an extra year warranty so getting an extra 2% isn’t worth losing a free year warranty. 10/30/2015 RJ Reply I have the amazon store card with a very healthy CL and im grateful because i purchase a lot from amazon even though i have the ebay mastercard with a higher CL amazon’s zero interest for 6 months is great. i bought a brand new laptop and as a prime member got it the next day and since it was new i got a one year manf. warranty directly from HP im wondering if i should wait till i pay off the purchase first before switching because im not sure if i will lose the financing for the 5% cash back does anyone know ? 01/15/2016 Bonita J sianis Reply I have been trying to cancel my amazon prime card, I want to keep my amazon.com card. It said on your page that you can cancel at any time. Well I have chatted and called everyone and no one will cancel thisw card. 07/22/2016 Atheena Reply The truth about this card. 1.) They choose what to pay off Randomly. I sent in a larger than normal payment to pay off my non promotional balances (what I owe that is not on payment plans – the base debt). There was plenty left over to pay off my upcoming August thru October promotional balances (each time you order something on a promotion each item incurs a separate promotional plan. IF you buy 4 items each over 149 on one order instead of getting on that is financed for 6 months you get 4 that are each financed for 6 months. This seems harmless and ok find out the *computer pays off your upcoming promotional balances RANDOMLY* This is what the assistant said to me. 2.) IF you ask them to pay it off off in order of sale date they have to file a ticket which will take 2 to 3 statement cycles to show up AND it will not show up on your statement till then. Since your accounts are aging out and you have to pay off the interest in those times which are as stated in item 3 below. YOU have no way to see they actually paid off the items OR if they add the interest you did not pay during these times. 3.) Statements do not show your separate balances. On your statement they DO NOT provide you with simple broken down totals, a.) your non-promotional balance. b.) They do not give you a balance to pay off they next total for upcoming months. They expect you to do the simple math that quote the assistant “Even a human can do it” Sure I can do it… but why???? Why should I have to? There is a level of standards generally accepted in the USA. These have dropped. IF You need this card and stuck getting it… BEWARE the people behind this are people who are doing a very high class SCAM!!! Anyone who tricks you out of money or sets you up to give them more money than is fair is a SCAM. IF I had been able to add a photo I have one of my statement to prove what I have said here. 02/10/2017 Terry Weaver Reply Amazon Prime store card is not for me! I am having statement mailed to me to pay bill! These terms are confusing, as I do not pay bills thru e-mail. How do I cancel AmazonPrime store card? Last digits 7633 I will pay bill when received in mail. Thank You! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Meet the VC Meet Peter Hsing, Managing Director at Merus Capital Before co-founding Merus, Hsing was Managing Director of the Corporate Strategy Group at Microsoft Innovation series by Steven Loeb February 10, 2017 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/48e2 Editor's note: Our Splash Health, Wellness and Wearables event is coming up on March 23 in San Francisco. We'll have Mario Schlosser, Founder & CEO of Oscar Health, Brian Singerman (Partner, Founders Fund), Steve Jurvetson (Draper Fisher Jurvetson), J.

Venture capital used to be a cottage industry, with very few investing in tomorrow's products and services. Oh how times have changed. While there are more startups than ever, there's also more money chasing them. In this series, we look at the new (or relatively new) VCs in the early stages: seed and Series A. But just who are these funds and venture capitalists that run them? What kinds of investments do they like making, and how do they see themselves in the VC landscape? We're highlighting key members of the community to find out. Peter Hsing is Co-Founder and Managing Director at Merus Capital. Before co-founding Merus, Hsing was Managing Director of the Corporate Strategy Group at Microsoft, where he led a team in identifying and evaluating several $1 billion+ growth opportunities. Prior to joining Microsoft, he was an Associate in JP Morgan's Telecom, Media & Technology investment banking group and Private Placements team in Hong Kong and a management consultant with Price Waterhouse in their Dispute Analysis and Corporate Recovery Services group. He started his career in technology in 1988 as a marketing intern with IBM. Peter holds an MBA in Finance from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and a BS in Industrial Engineering from Columbia University. VatorNews: What is your investment philosophy or methodology? Peter Hsing:  We honed our playbook for investing in enterprise software during our time at Google and Microsoft. We've always believed that the future is all about digitizing reality—creating a digital representation of reality.  VN: What do you like to invest in? What are your categories of interest? PH: We only invest in what we call "real software solving real problems"--these are enterprise software companies trying to solve big economic problems for their customers. Once reality is in the form of ones and zeros, whatever you're modeling can be more easily analyzed, optimized, or visualized with software. Specifically, digitizing reality includes AR/VR, AI, and all things autonomous. VN: What would you say are the top investments you have been a part of? What stood out about those investments in particular? PH: Some of our most successful companies so far include AdRoll, AllClear ID, and Symphony Communication. In each of those cases, the founding teams were exceptional and each has taken a long term approach to building a durable franchise. VN: What do you look for in companies that you put money in? What are the most important qualities? PH: Every investment we make must pass the three "T's:" Team, TAM (total addressable market), and 10x. It starts with the team--in our judgment, they must be exceptionally strong. They have to be going after a big opportunity--"real problems" that businesses face. And their solution must be at least an order of magnitude better than anything out there today and for the near future--"real software." In other words, we invest in exceptional entrepreneurs building "real software solving real problems." The vast majority of investments we pursue come from our collective networks. With our Google and Microsoft networks at the core, we’ve been building a broad network of software-focused founders, technologists, and executives for over 20 years.  VN: What kind of traction do you look for in your startups? And can you be specific? Are you looking for a number of customers or order volume? PH: As for traction, we follow "More's Law"--more is better! That's tongue-in-cheek. Having commercial traction is not a prerequisite to getting funded as risks we perceive will ultimately reveal themselves in the termsheet. VN: Given that these days a Seed round is yesterday's Series A, meaning today a company raises a $3M Seed and no one blinks. But 10 years ago, $3M was a Series A. So what are the attributes to get that Seed round? Since it's a "Seed" does it imply that a company doesn't have to be that far along? PH: There's no standard profile for whether you're raising a seed or A round--you have to go out and test the market, i.e., do your own price discovery. It takes a lot of effort and time and is, in most cases, a necessary distraction. Stay in touch with vetnture capitalists that you want to work with. Create a competitive bidding situation when the timing is right for you/the company. At the seed round, you're probably not taking on a new board member, but at the A, you most certainly will. Don't think of it as "giving up" a board seat--you're gaining a partner who you want to help guide/help you for the next 10 or more years. So, be extremely thoughtful about who you partner with. Do *your* diligence.   VN: Tell me a bit about your background. Where did you go to school? What led you to the venture capital world? PH: There's no well-defined career path to becoming a venture capitalist. It's all about experience, judgement, and relationships and that can take a person down a lot of routes. When I was younger, I was an avid reader of sci-fi/fantasy novels--earliest I can remember was the Tom Swift series--and the future always was about tech, so I've always been infatuated with the impact of innovation. I was the kid who begged my family go see Star Wars during our family vacation during the summer of 1977 where my dad was like, "We're in Cape Cod and you want to go see a movie?!" I was also the kid who begged my parents to get my brother and I the Atari 2600 for Christmas. The digital future was just always so much cooler! So, with my love of tech and my obsession with NYC (I grew up in CT), I attended the engineering school at Columbia. I helped fund part of my education by working as an intern at IBM on Madison Ave. starting in my sophomore year (more tech). From there, I worked in corporate restructurings at PriceWaterhouse where I became an Oracle DBA and wired up SCO Unix terminals, got my MBA in Finance at Wharton, and then was recruited into Microsoft's Corporate Development group, where I met and worked closely with my two business partners, Sean and Salman, starting in 1999. In late 2004/05, when Salman and Sean left Microsoft to run Google's Corporate Dev team, I took over Salman's role as head of Corporate Strategy at Microsoft. As MD of Corp Strat, my team and I brought the company into the era of SaaS via the first offerings of what is now branded as Microsoft Cloud. Like the Blues Brothers, we (Sean, Salman, and I) got the band back together in 2008 to firm our own venture capital firm, Merus Capital. I'll point out that I've been extremely fortunate to be a part of small, high-performance teams, whether at PWC, JP Morgan, or Microsoft, and have had strong mentorship via my manager(s). I feel that one cannot have enough mentorship early on and advise that one should be proactive in seeking a mentor(s). However, one must realize that, as with all relationships, there needs to be a "fit" both ways, so it takes time to find a good match. VN: What do you like best about being a VC? What makes you excited? PH: I meet super-smart, passionate entrepreneurs that are trying to make their mark on the world. I learn something new from them every day and they give me a glimpse of the future, today. I have two incredible partners with whom I've enjoyed working with since 1999 and who I deeply trust and respect. Together, with the backing of our amazing investors, we get to build our own business--Merus was a startup back in 2008 when we launched our first fund. We're entrepreneurs as well, so we have a ton of empathy for startup founders.  VN: What is the size of your current fund?  PH: We closed our third fund of $85 million last year. While we had a few endowments and foundations in our first two core funds, with this fund, we were able to significantly expand our investor base with the addition of one of the largest US foundations, a major university endowment, and a large, international fund-of-funds. VN: What is the investment range? PH: Our investment size ranges from $500k at the seed stage to $5 million or more at a Series A round.  VN: Is there a typical percent that you want of a round? For instance, do you need to get 20% or 30% of a round? PH: We don't have a firm target percentage ownership as each investment opportunity has unique circumstances. However, venture capital is inherently not scaleable, so we do need to have enough ownership to make it worth our time, as the hard constraint is the amount of time we have to devote to each of our portfolio companies. VN: Where is the firm currently in the investing cycle of its current fund? PH: We're actively investing our third fund and have closed 7 investments in the last 9 months. VN: What percentage of your fund is set aside for follow-on capital? PH: We reserve about 50% of our funds for follow-on investments and have also raised Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for larger or later follow-on rounds. VN: What series do you typically invest in? Are they typically Seed or Post Seed or Series A? PH: We make our initial investment at the Seed or Series A round.  VN: In a typical year how many startups do you invest in? PH: We might lead 3 Series A rounds in a typical year and make a half dozen seed investments. We prefer to keep our portfolios relatively concentrated. VN:  Is there anything else you think I should know about you or the firm? PH: Every firm is a bit different in style, structure and focus but similar to Benchmark, we have an equal partnership where founder interaction is always with a decision-making partner. Similar to Emergence, we have an enterprise focus. Venture is a state of coopetition where we might compete with a firm one day, only to co-invest with them the next.   What's made Merus successful has been maintaining a consistent investment approach. Consistent team, investment focus, and analytical approach. We also try pretty hard to not pay attention to what other investors like or don't like about a certain opportunity. So maintaining independence of thought is also important to our model.  Permalink <span>Send</span> Related companies, investors and entrepreneurs Peter Hsing Bio: Peter has over 20 years of technology industry experience.

Europe’s largest bank aims to make three or four acquisitions globally this year, with a particular focus on China. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/London HSBC Holdings Plc is planning to pursue deals to expand in asset and wealth management as the lender seeks to capitalise on the growing funds of the middle class in Asia and diversify its business away from traditional lending, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Europe’s largest bank aims to make three or four acquisitions globally this year, with a particular focus on China, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the strategy isn’t public. The targets would be portfolios of assets or platforms allowing the bank to offer a wider range of products, rather than sizeable asset-management companies, the people said. A bank spokesman declined to comment on HSBC’s strategy in the sector. International banks have been growing their wealth and asset management arms as balance-sheet lending and securities trading become less profitable under new capital rules. Led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s asset-management unit has grown to oversee about $1.7tn globally and set up a money manager in Shanghai last year. Swiss lenders UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG are pulling back from investment banking in Europe and shifting resources to the higher potential returns in Asian wealth management. Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has been under pressure to streamline HSBC, the biggest provider of trade finance in the world, after profitability declined and the share price flagged. The lender is in the middle of a program started in June 2015 to redeploy as much as $150bn of assets to Asia and hire 4,000 people in the Pearl River Delta region around Hong Kong, where Gulliver pledged to “capture growth opportunities” in asset management. Wealth products, including asset management, accounted for 10% of HSBC’s total revenue in the first nine months of 2016. Revenue from that business dropped 13% from a year earlier to $3.9bn, including $718mn from asset management. The bank is set to report full-year results later this month. Growth in the business may be a boon to retail banking and wealth management chief John Flint, seen as a candidate to succeed to Gulliver, who may step down in the next few years. Flint told investors in a presentation in October that the asset management business would shift its focus to Asia and that the unit had the “potential for selective acquisitions to strengthen franchise.” The bank said it increased assets under management in Asia by 15% to $145bn at the end of September, making up more than one-third of the $416bn total the unit oversees. That put it on track to meet its goal of boosting Asian assets under management by 10% a year through 2017 as part of Gulliver’s broader plan for the bank. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Feb. 10, 2017, 12:32 PM 1,019 facebook linkedin twitter email print Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.  Bridgewater Associates is as well known for being the world's largest hedge fund, with $150 billion in assets under management, as it is for its quirky culture of "radical transparency." An obvious question about the company is how — or if — Bridgewater's culture contributes to its success on the investment side. For the firm's co-CIO, Bob Prince, there's a clear correlation. We talked to Prince about the firm's  intense, unique culture, and how  he views the relationship between performance and working environment. We also recently caught up with Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the head of US Equity Strategy at JPMorgan. Here's what he had to say about dollar strength, market volatility and where investors should put their money in 2017.  A former hedge fund manager who retired at 36 is sounding the alarm on the Trump trade. And Abby Joseph Cohen, the president of Goldman Sachs' Global Market Institute, is retiring. Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin wrote a letter to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein asking how much influence Goldman has over Donald Trump. And one of the world's leading credit-rating agencies thinks Trump could be a disaster for the global economy. In deal news, the company behind Durex and Dettol just confirmed a $17.9 billion deal to buy a US baby milk maker. Wall Street stands to make more than $100 million from the deal. And Walt Disney is buying most of Saudi Prince Alwaleed's stake in Paris Disneyland. In corporate news: Under Armour denounces Trump travel ban after CEO praised president as 'a real asset for the country' Sears CEO Eddie Lampert will pay $40 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged he unfairly enriched himself with the company's "crown-jewel assets" The company behind Call of Duty and Candy Crush is soaring after reporting record revenue "Can't fly with broken wings" — Wall Street blasts Twitter for missing Q4 earnings Yelp plunges after sales outlook misses estimates In macro news, Canada's jobs report crushed it. And investors don't trust the Fed anymore, according to Business Insider's Pedro da Costa.  There's a bunch of news in the healthcare sector, too: The Senate has confirmed Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services The list price of a life-saving overdose treatment has skyrocketed 680% in the last 3 years — and now 31 senators want answers A decades-old steroid used to treat a rare disease just got approved by the FDA — and it costs $89,000 One of the largest middlemen in the drug industry just released a video showing why it should be able to remain secretive Here's how many people in every state don't have health insurance One chart shows just how devastating healthcare costs are for American families In other news, Tesla faces a unionization challenge after factory workers complain of injuries and long hours. Elon Musk called the attacks on Tesla's working conditions "morally outrageous." Lastly, here are 35 trips every couple should take in their lifetime. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hour Capital One is trying to curry favor with millennials with cafés around the US offering free Wi-Fi, local coffee and food, and complimentary money coaching — The more than 80 million people born into the millennial generation have grown up with technology by their side. This is how you know something desperate is going on in China's economy —The country has been suffering from money outflows for months — something that troubles Beijing because it pulls down the value of the Chinese yuan and makes the economy harder to manage. MARK CARNEY: Central banks need "the spirit of the millennial" —Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he wants to improve diversity at the central bank to avoid "being mono-culture, secretive and ridden with groupthink." Greece is in trouble again over its "explosive" debt — here's why— Greece is back. A disagreement among Greece's creditors over how to deal with the country's "explosive" debt pile is making the market nervous. Trading volumes are crashing at China's 3 biggest bitcoin exchanges —Trading volumes at China's three largest bitcoin exchanges have plummeted after the central bank put the virtual currency market under sharper scrutiny a month ago in a move that coincided with official efforts to stem capital outflows. A banker who's been on Wall Street for 20 years explains why you shouldn't worry too much about your first job —RBC Capital Markets' technology investment banking cohead, Michal Katz, has called some big-name Wall Street firms home over the course of her over 20-year career in finance.

"No one wants to miss a large pop when that news does come out." Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of a key House of Representatives committee, laid out his plan to roll back Wall Street and consumer protection rules, which were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.Banks, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan, were slightly higher.

Oil prices rose 1.5 percent after news that OPEC members' initial compliance with last year's production cut deal reached a record high. [O/R]At 9:38 a.m. ET (1438 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55.34 points, or 0.27 percent, at 20,227.74.

Activision Blizzard surged 13.7 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Sears Holding jumped 31 percent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 4.7 percent after Reckitt Benckiser finalised a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Skechers USA was up 17.8 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,770 to 837.

Hackers have been able to steal credit card and personal information from major companies like JPMorgan and Home Depot. As a result, cybersecurity has become more necessary, and instead of developing a dedicated department within a company, most opt to hire a third-party cybersecurity firm. What is interesting here is that many investors think cybersecurity is the next area in technology that needs real consolidation. The January 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in the selected cybersecurity stocks were mixed. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) saw its short interest increase to 23.70 million shares from the previous reading of 20.34 million. Shares were last seen at $11.37, in a 52-week trading range of $10.60 to $19.63. The short interest at CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) increased to 488,891 shares from the previous level of 449,382. Shares were trading at $54.03, within a 52-week range of $31.50 to $59.28. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.’s (NASDAQ: CHKP) short interest decreased to 6.66 million shares from the previous reading of 9.25 million. Shares were trading at $100.61, in a 52-week range of $74.34 to $100.87. The number of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW) shares short ticked up to 7.64 million from the previous level of 6.67 million. Shares were trading at $155.42, within a 52-week range of $114.64 to $165.69. Fortinet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FTNT) short interest decreased to 5.94 million shares from its previous reading of 7.48 million. Shares were trading at $37.75, in a 52-week trading range of $23.51 to $38.33.

By Yashaswini Swamynathan / Reuters The latest news on the Trump administration: 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump “represents a risk to international economic conditions,” noting that his “aggressive tone” and willingness to float “unanticipated changes” to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke “confrontational exchanges” that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals.     U.S. stocks hit record highs shortly after the open on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump said he would release a major tax reform plan in the coming weeks.

Slight chance of a shower throughout the evening. Low 32F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: February 11, 2017 @ 3:15 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds Close Provided Paul Certo contributed editor's pick urgent GUEST COMMENTARY: No Honor Roll for prez Peter Certo 18 hrs ago Provided Paul Certo Confession: Many moons ago, I actually thought there was a little bit to like about Donald Trump. During the primaries, he proved GOP voters could care less about the party’s usual pro-business bromides. He smeared free-trade agreements as bad for workers, lamented that Wall Street traders were “getting away with murder” on their taxes and won doing it. Then, during the general election, he ridiculed both parties’ support for military misadventures like the Iraq War. And he asked oddly reasonable questions about whether preserving NATO was worth going to war with nuclear-armed Russia over, say, Estonia. Granted, there was more not to like — his flirtations with white nationalists, his casual sexism, his nonstop lying. But I did sometimes wonder: Is there any silver lining to all this? The early days of the Trump administration suggest emphatically: No. Let’s break it down, report-card style. Trade: B- During his inaugural address, Trump promised “every decision” he’d make would be “to benefit American workers and American families.” To that end, he quickly pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and ordered a “renegotiation” of NAFTA, which many people blame for hurting blue-collar U.S. workers. Interestingly, Trump also used his Twitter pulpit to bully companies into keeping jobs in the United States, though this was more sideshow than substance. Economy: D- If all that was the good news, here’s the bad: Trump immediately issued orders to raise mortgage fees for working families and to rollback regulations designed to prevent another Wall Street crash. “We expect to be cutting a lot” of those regulations, Trump told a business roundtable, because — no joke — banker “friends of mine” can’t get the loans they need. He added there was “nobody better” to get advice from on the subject than JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. (That’s the same JPMorgan that got fined $13 billion for helping cause the crash.) Security: D- During his campaign, Trump said he had a secret, “foolproof” plan to defeat ISIS. His “100 Days” agenda revealed what that was: Tell the Pentagon to come up with a plan to beat ISIS. Maybe he figured they hadn’t thought about it? He then issued his infamous “Muslim ban,” which banned immigration from seven Muslim countries and cruelly suspended refugee resettlement from everywhere. No refugees from any of those banned countries have ever committed terrorism in the United States. But banned countries like Iraq — a partner in fighting ISIS — are now threatening to ban Americans, which may complicate Trump’s plans to “bomb the hell” out of the group.

While Trump rightly questioned going to war with Russia over Eastern Europe, his newest National Security Council member — political adviser (and white nationalist) Steve Bannon — says “there’s no doubt” we’ll go to war with China over some disputed rocks in the ocean. Feel safer? Climate: F Virtually all climate scientists say the planet is warming. Some even add that much of America’s eastern seaboard — including, say, Trump Tower — could be uninhabitable within the lifetime of kids born today. To combat this challenge, which Trump famously called a “Chinese hoax,” he nominated an EPA head who’s spent more time suing the agency than supporting it and installed an oil CEO as his secretary of state. Making America Great: Incomplete Trump is now the fastest president to ever reach majority disapproval, so he’s probably not seen the last of his bad report cards. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that Americans will figure out they can make America great again by resisting his agenda. Peter Certo is the editorial manager of the Institute for Policy Studies.

Trump's promise of a "phenomenal" tax plan helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over his protectionist stand and the lack of clarity on his policies. The biggest theme for investors is that Trump's tax plan will move quickly and he has always maintained that it is going to be very aggressive, said Uriel Cohen, founder of Alpine Global in New York. "No one wants to miss a large pop when that news does come out." Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of a key House of Representatives committee, laid out his plan to roll back Wall Street and consumer protection rules, which were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters on Thursday. Banks, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan, were slightly higher. The S&P 500 financial index rose 0.31 percent, giving the broader index its biggest boost. Goldman Sachs rose 0.78 percent and was the top stock on the Dow. The dollar index was up 0.3 percent to a three-week high of 101.01. Gold was down 0.3 percent. Oil prices rose 1.5 percent after news that OPEC members' initial compliance with last year's production cut deal reached a record high. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1438 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55.34 points, or 0.27 percent, at 20,227.74.

Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with energy's 1 percent rise leading the gainers. Activision Blizzard surged 13.7 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Sears Holding jumped 31 percent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 4.7 percent after Reckitt Benckiser finalised a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Skechers USA was up 17.8 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,770 to 837. On the Nasdaq, 1,396 issues rose and 859 fell.

This Year They've Been On a Massive Tear. by Elena Popina @lena_popina More stories by Elena Popina and Ben Bartenstein @BenBartenstein More stories by Ben Bartenstein February 10, 2017, 6:00 AM EST February 10, 2017, 12:35 PM EST Spread between EM debt and Treasuries near lowest since 2014 Pictet says emerging stocks a buy, joining bulls at BofA Wall Street’s love affair with emerging-market bonds is coming to an end, but the passion for stocks is unabated. BlackRock Inc. cut its recommendation for developing-nation debt to neutral this week as it reiterated a bullish view on equities, joining strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who prefer shares to fixed income. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says a pickup in global growth favors stocks. Both asset classes are enjoying their best start to a year since 2011, buoyed by the idea that the initial doom-and-gloom reaction to Donald Trump’s election was overdone considering that his economic policies -- particularly his threats of protectionism -- appear to still be in flux. Now investors are counting on faster global growth and a pickup in earnings to send developing-nation stocks even higher, but say valuations on emerging-market bonds are already rich and a likely increase in U.S. interest rates will be a drag. "The tide had been in favor of debt for so long and now we’ve very likely seen a sea change," said Tim Ghriskey, who oversees more than $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. "Emerging-market debt is probably something to avoid at this point or limit your exposure or stay on the low duration. On equities, you still want to be selective, but generally we think exposure can be increased.” That optimism was missing in the immediate aftermath of the election. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks plunged 7 percent in the days after Trump won office, while a Bloomberg gauge of corporate debt from developing countries posted the worst selloff in three years. Investors were panicking at the idea of Trump making good on his promise to put “America First,” anticipating a slew of trade barriers that would damp exports, send the dollar soaring and -- to the biggest pessimists -- possibly lead to a global recession. Those concerns abated in the weeks after the election, and while some analysts and investors say assets seem to be underpricing the risk of Trump’s trade policies, others focused on several bullish signs for both emerging-market stocks and bonds. They cite the pickup in global growth forecasts as the euro-area economy is rebounding amid stimulus programs and a pullback in the dollar following concern a stronger greenback was threatening to imperil developing nations’ competitiveness. Traders were also encouraged by higher prices for the commodity exports that many developing nations rely on, and a better political outlook in some of the biggest countries. Turkey is stabilizing after a coup attempt last year, Russia seems likely to be under less pressure from a Trump administration and Brazil is pulling out of its worst recession in a century after its president was impeached last year. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up “The protectionist threat is still legit, but questions remain about how strong it will be when or if it’s finally implemented,” said Steve Hooker, a Hartford, Connecticut-based emerging-market money manager at Newfleet Asset Management LLC, which oversees $12 billion. “Growth appears to be bottoming thanks to the easing recessions in Brazil and Russia. China data has been generally OK, commodity prices are supportive and U.S. rates and the dollar have not been the straight shot higher that many were expecting.” Emerging stocks have outperformed developed peers last year for the first time since 2012 and now trade near the highest level since September. Strategists at Pictet Asset Management this week upgraded the asset class to a buy, joining bulls at Bank of America Corp. Some $600 billion in market value was added to stocks in the biggest developing markets last month. Corporate profit estimates are rising twice as fast as forecasts for developed-market peers, leaving emerging-nation equities trading at 12.1 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.4 for stocks in advanced economies. That signals to bulls that valuations have more room to rise. Valuations for bonds look a bit more stretched, especially amid concern that quicker economic growth in the U.S. will lead to faster interest-rate increases that will lure funds from riskier assets. The spread between yields on emerging-market sovereign notes and Treasuries is the lowest since December 2014, when a currency crisis in Russia sparked a selloff in riskier assets. BlackRock cited high valuations when it cut its recommendation on developing-market debt in a report dated Feb. 6. While it looks appealing long-term, “strong post U.S.-election performance versus other risk assets makes us cautious,” BlackRock’s chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said in the note. Anders Faergemann, a London-based senior sovereign portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, voices a similar concern. “Emerging-market debt spreads are at a two-year low so valuations are stretched, which makes us cautious looking ahead,” Faergemann said. His Global Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Fund has outperformed 78 percent of peers in the past 12 months. Trump’s victory has sparked a surge in reflation bets, the idea that inflation is going to pick up. His comments that long-awaited details on promised tax cuts were upcoming gave a boost to the wager Thursday as equities in Europe and the U.S. rallied and Treasuries fell. “An environment with stronger growth may cause investors to rotate out of fixed income and allocate more into equities,” Jane Wei, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note earlier this month. There’s “a friendlier backdrop for riskier assets such as EM equities.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes rose to fresh all-time closing highs on Friday as a spike in oil prices supported energy shares and investors renewed their optimism about President Donald Trump's economic agenda. The S&P 500 tallied its fourth straight session of gains, a day after Trump vowed a major tax announcement in the next few weeks. The benchmark S&P 500 has surged 8.3 percent since Trump's Nov. 8 election, fuelled by expectations he will lower corporate taxes, reduce regulations and increase infrastructure spending. The rally had stalled amid concerns over Trump's protectionist stance and lack of clarity on policy reforms. "Investors were worried that the administration may have gotten off track and was pursuing other items," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "Tax cuts have gotten put back on the front burner," Forrest said, adding, "We are looking for gains in the economy at large from this, not just (earnings per share) gains in stocks." The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 96.97 points, or 0.48 percent, to end at 20,269.37, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 8.23 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,316.10 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 18.95 points, or 0.33 percent, to 5,734.13. The S&P and Dow closed at a record high for a second straight session, while the Nasdaq extended its streak of record closes to a fourth day. Energy shares <.SPNY> gained 0.8 percent. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a deal that took effect in January. Energy could continue to be in focus next week, when a host of small-cap companies in energy are due to report results. The S&P financial sector <.SPSY> ended up 0.2 percent. The group initially moved higher after Daniel Tarullo, the top Federal Reserve official charged with financial regulation, said he would resign, creating further room for Trump to reshape the Fed's policymaking staff. The focus on Washington comes as large U.S. companies were set for their second straight quarter of profit increases after several periods of declines. With more than 70 percent of the S&P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.4 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We are seeing a pretty solid rate of beats and we’re out of the earnings recession," said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. Activision Blizzard surged 18.9 percent after the videogame publisher reported higher-than-expected revenue and set a $1 billion share buyback programme. Its shares gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Skechers USA jumped 19.3 percent after the footwear maker's fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding soared 25.6 percent after the struggling retailer said it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 151 new highs and 22 new lows. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The S&P 500 tallied its fourth straight session of gains, a day after Trump vowed a major tax announcement in the next few weeks. The benchmark S&P 500 has surged 8.3 percent since Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by expectations he will lower corporate taxes, reduce regulations and increase infrastructure spending. The rally had stalled amid concerns over Trump's protectionist stance and lack of clarity on policy reforms. "Investors were worried that the administration may have gotten off track and was pursuing other items," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "Tax cuts have gotten put back on the front burner," Forrest said, adding, "We are looking for gains in the economy at large from this, not just (earnings per share) gains in stocks." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 96.97 points, or 0.48 percent, to end at 20,269.37, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.23 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,316.10 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 18.95 points, or 0.33 percent, to 5,734.13. The S&P and Dow closed at a record high for a second straight session, while the Nasdaq extended its streak of record closes to a fourth day. Energy shares .SPNY gained 0.8 percent. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a deal that took effect in January. Energy could continue to be in focus next week, when a host of small-cap companies in energy are due to report results. The S&P financial sector .SPSY ended up 0.2 percent. The group initially moved higher after Daniel Tarullo, the top Federal Reserve official charged with financial regulation, said he would resign, creating further room for Trump to reshape the Fed's policymaking staff. The focus on Washington comes as large U.S. companies were set for their second straight quarter of profit increases after several periods of declines. With more than 70 percent of the S&P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.4 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We are seeing a pretty solid rate of beats and we’re out of the earnings recession," said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) surged 18.9 percent after the videogame publisher reported higher-than-expected revenue and set a $1 billion share buyback program. Its shares gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Skechers USA (SKX.N) jumped 19.3 percent after the footwear maker's fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding (SHLD.O) soared 25.6 percent after the struggling retailer said it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 151 new highs and 22 new lows. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Trump called his tax plan as "phenomenal", but offered no details other than citing the need to lower tax burden on businesses. The news helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over Trump's protectionist stance and the lack of clarity on his policies. Trump's hint that the tax plan will move quickly is the biggest theme for investors, and he has always maintained that it is going to be very aggressive, said Uriel Cohen, founder of Alpine Global in New York. "No one wants to miss a large pop when that news does come out." Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of a key House of Representatives committee, laid out his plan to roll back Wall Street and consumer protection rules, which were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters on Thursday. Banks, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan, were slightly higher in premarket trading on Friday. The dollar index rose 0.23 percent to a near three-week high of 100.89. Gold was down 0.2 percent after hitting a three-month high on Thursday. Oil prices rose 1.5 percent after news that OPEC members' initial compliance with last year's landmark production cut deal reached a record high. Dow e-minis were up 30 points, or 0.15 percent at 8:28 a.m. ET (1328 GMT), with 21,713 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, with 100,854 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.12 percent, on volume of 19,481 contracts. A University of Michigan report is likely to show that its consumer sentiment index slipped to 97.9 in February from 98.5 last month. The data is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1700 GMT). Shares of Activision Blizzard rose 10.24 percent after the videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Sears Holding surged 44 percent to $8 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 5.17 percent after Reckitt Benckiser finalised a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Skechers USA was up 11.2 percent in light trading after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations.

By Ben White and Mary Lee 02/10/17 08:00 AM EST WHITE HOUSE PUSHES TRUMP INC. — Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey and I look at the remarkable extent to which the White House is willing to promote Trump family brands, from the president’s Mar-a-Lago club to Ivanka Trump’s clothing and accessories business. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday took the remarkable step of public urging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s goods following the flap with Nordstrom. She did so from the White House, a clear violation of federal ethics rules. Nothing is likely to happen to Conway because her boss probably enjoyed the comments and the Office of Government Ethics has no real power to impose any punishment. One unfortunate part of all this for Ivanka Trump is she really has nothing to do with any of it. Story Continued Below From the piece: “People close to Ivanka Trump say there is no way for her to fully divest from her branded products business because she owns it all herself and would have to shut down her company in order to eliminate any perceptions of conflicts. And they say she cannot do that because of existing multi-year contracts with various retail outlets and other partners. “Defenders say that Ivanka Trump would never discuss anything related to her personal businesses with the various CEOs who attend White House meetings or private dinners with her. This includes Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon who attended a recent dinner. Wal-Mart carries Ivanka Trump products. Some on Wall Street have also speculated about potential conflicts given all the financial executives who attend meetings with the first daughter. The list of finance executives who have attended meetings with her include investment banker Adebayo Ogunlesi, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Critics say this could raise the possibility of financiers providing favorable credit terms to Ivanka Trump for her various business endeavors. But people close to Trump say she has no lenders to her businesses and no debt. “She doesn’t owe anyone anything,” one person close to Trump said. Read more. TRUMP SMACKED DOWN BY APPEALS COURT — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “A federal appeals court has turned down President Donald Trump’s attempt to revive his controversial travel ban executive order. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the Justice Department’s request to lift a Seattle-based judge’s restraining order that blocked authorities from carrying out the limits Trump sought to impose on travel to the U.S. by refugees and by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. “The White House could take the issue to the Supreme Court, but the prospects for such an appeal are uncertain due in part to the high court being short a justice and split evenly between Democratic and Republican appointed justices.” Read more. TRUMP RESPONSE — Via Twitter: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE.” ABA FILES SUIT OVER FED DIVIDENDS — ABA President Rob Nichols and Washington Federal CEO Roy Whitehead in a WSJ op-ed: “Legal action against the government is always a last resort, yet it’s one that we must turn to when alternatives are unavailable and matters of principle are at stake. “That’s the situation in which America’s bankers find themselves today. In 2016 the government wrongfully withheld $1.1 billion in contracted dividend payments to the industry, reducing the money that banks use to make job-creating loans and investments in our hometowns. That amount will balloon to $17 billion over the next 10 years for all affected banks” Read more. The lawsuit is here. RUH ROH — WP’s By Greg Miller, Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima: “National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. “Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election” Read more. FSR IS MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: “The Financial Services Roundtable on Friday morning released its wish list for 2017. At the top: changing the structure of the CFPB to a commission; repeal of the Durbin amendment, which limits the fees that financial institutions can impose on debit card transactions; and setting capital standards based on risk rather than simply size, FSR President Tim Pawlenty told POLITICO “The organization would also like to see a more coordinated approach to cybersecurity regulations across agencies, as well as progress toward the white whale known as reform of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Read their overall priorities here, on cybersecurity here, and on housing here. TOOMEY TO YELLEN: DROP STRESS TESTS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Pat Toomey told Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a letter this week that the central bank should stop stress tests of the country’s biggest lenders. The Pennsylvania Republican said the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process was hampering lending, adding to compliance costs and increasing systemic dangers” See the letter.

Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip to 97.9 from 98.5. PURDUE OPPOSES BAT — Sen. David Purdue (R-Ga.) in a Wash. Times op-ed: “[T]he fourth idea being crammed into this comprehensive proposal by the House is the so-called ‘border adjustment tax.’ This 20 percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, shuts down economic growth, and is proven to grow the federal government. “Increased consumer prices would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs. This is exactly the wrong approach. Why would we do this at a time when millions of Americans are struggling to get from payday to payday?” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: The Durbin Amendment, which imposed government price caps on debit card interchange rates, was supposed to help consumers. Instead, it poured $42 billion into big-box stores’ pockets and left customers empty-handed. Government price controls are a lose-lose for Americans. Let’s repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS FROZEN — NYT’s Mark Landler and Michael Forsythe: “When the White House announced this week that President Trump had sent President Xi Jinping of China a letter wishing him a happy Chinese New Year, it did not disclose a major reason for the friendly gesture: Mr. Xi has not gotten on the phone with Mr. Trump. “Stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the ‘One China’ policy, Mr. Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected. Administration officials say they believe he will only do so after Mr. Trump publicly commits to recognizing a single Chinese government in Beijing.” Read more. FREEZE BROKEN — FT’s Demetri Sevastopulo: “Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the White House will respect the ‘One China’ policy, in a move that will ease tensions between the powers, according to two people familiar with the call. In his first conversation with the Chinese leader since entering the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he would abide by the diplomatic formula that Beijing and Taipei agreed in 1992.” Read more. MORE ON THE HENSARLING MEMO — Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “We believe this measure would offer relief to the banks, but do not see how it could pass the Senate. As a result, our view remains that banks will enjoy the most upside from the new regulatory focus that will exist once Trump installs his own people at the Federal Reserve, CFPB, FDIC and OCC. … “To us, the issue is not whether the House could pass such a bill. That seems to be a given. It is how to get such a measure through the Senate. Our view is that Democrats will not support such a material approach to changing the rules for bigger banks. And there is little probability they would support changes to the CFPB's authority. This is why we believe this bill is more about sending a message on how the GOP wants to change the law.” Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform: “This awful bill has always been a giveaway to Wall Street, and if anything it appears to be getting worse. It would hack away at crucial rules that prevent reckless banks from blowing up the financial system and the broader economy.” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking member of Senate Banking: “It took less than three weeks for House Republicans to show their hand on how they will renege on candidate Trump’s campaign promises to hold Wall Street accountable and help working Americans.” ABE-TRUMP PREVIEW — Bloomberg’s Margaret Talev: “Trump’s accusations of currency manipulation against Japan aren’t a priority for him in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planned for Friday, an administration official said. “The automobile industry will be an important topic in the talks, the official said. The official declined to address specifics about it or how the president would approach discussions on import taxes.” Read more. KUSHNER FAMILY DEAL — NYT’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. De La Merced: “The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. “The Kushners — led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his brother-in-law and key lieutenant for the family’s investments — have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law.” Read more. CEA DEMOTED — WSJ’s Josh Zumbrun reports: “The White House Council of Economic Advisers is being demoted by the Trump administration, which said in a statement Wednesday that the president’s cabinet won't include the chairman of the CEA, an official that President Donald Trump also has yet to name. “The diminished stature for the CEA, which was part of President Barack Obama’s cabinet and has advised presidents for over seven decades on the economic impact of their policies, means Mr. Trump will likely rely more heavily on other advisers, such as Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is head of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, the trade critic who is leading the National Trade Council.” Read more. NAMES FOR CFPB HEAD — CNBC’s Ylan Mui reports: “The White House is considering a top official at Fannie Mae to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to two people familiar with the discussion. “Brian Brooks is currently the mortgage financing giant's general counsel and has close ties to Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin. Brooks represented several of the investors in Mnuchin's purchase of failed subprime mortgage lender IndyMac for $1.6 billion in 2009. The bank was renamed OneWest, and Brooks joined the company as vice chairman.” Read more. #3 JOB IN DOJ — Bloomberg’s Tom Schoenberg reports: “The new U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, spent most of his Senate confirmation hearing answering questions about his civil rights record. The fate of remaining Justice Department probes of banks’ complicity in the financial crisis, though, may fall to a lawyer who spent much of the Obama administration representing the interests of banks and other corporations. “Trump last week nominated Rachel L. Brand, 43, a onetime senior counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to become associate attorney general, the No. 3 job in the Justice Department. The position, which requires Senate confirmation, supervises the civil, antitrust and environmental divisions, among others, making it an important overseer of many of the department’s probes of corporations.” Read more. TWITTER’S NEW AD STRATEGY — WSJ’s Deepa Seetharaman and Ezequiel Minaya report: “President Donald Trump has made Twitter Inc. more visible than ever. Now, the company has to find a way to cash in. “Twitter said Thursday it would revamp its advertising strategy, shifting away from older products like promoted tweets in favor of video ads, which executives said tend to attract big brands like car makers. The social-media service also plans to grow its data-licensing business, which charges companies that mine the billions of tweets flowing through the service every day.” Read more. TRUMP’S WALL: $21.6B — Reuters’ reports: “President Donald Trump's "wall" along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday. “The report's estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.” Read more. PHYSICAL COMMODITIES RULE — POLITICO Pro’s Victoria Guida reports: “Three Senate Democrats today urged the Federal Reserve to toughen its proposed capital and disclosure requirements on banks that own and invest in physical commodities. “The rule, proposed in September, would particularly affect Goldman Sachs, which along with Morgan Stanley was grandfathered in to being able to extract, transport and store physical commodities, which other banks cannot do.” Read more. DEUTSCHE BANK CONFLICT OF INTEREST — ProPublica’s Jesse Eisinger reports: “If you measure President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest by the amount of money at stake, or the variety of dicey interactions with government regulators, one dwarfs any other: his relationship with Deutsche Bank. “In recent weeks, Deutsche Bank has scrambled to reach agreements with American regulators over a host of alleged misdeeds. But because the president has not sold his company, the bank remains a central arena for potential conflicts between his family’s business interests and the actions of officials in his administration.” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: When the Durbin Amendment was passed in 2010, retailers pledged that consumers would see the savings. Years later, the truth is out: big box stores have pocketed an extra $42 billion—and, according to a Federal Reserve study, just 1 percent of retailers are passing savings onto customers. Even worse, many consumers lost access to free checking and debit card rewards. Enough with broken promises and consumer harm. It’s time to end this lose-lose for consumers and repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Mary Lee mlee@politico.com About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

The announcement pushed more volatile assets, such as stocks and commodities, higher, while governmental bonds slumped, reflecting the loss of investor interest to safe havens. As corporate America is eyeing a looming return to money-making from the staggering redistribution of wealth in the past eight years, there are, however, certain economic implications both in the US and overseas stemming from Trump's ambitious fiscal endeavor. The idea behind Trump's tax reform is quite simple at first glance: lower the taxes at home and hike protectionist customs tariffs (or border tax), resulting in tax relief for US businesses, while multinational enterprises would make up for the loss of US budget revenues with their money. "[We are] lowering the overall tax burden of American businesses, big league," Trump said. "We're going to be announcing something I would say over the two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax." No further details have been announced thus far, yet the markets responded with an explicit anticipation of greater business confidence, piling up cash in equity and commodities: oil prices are going up should Trump cut the taxes on a "big league" scale. "The outlook for the US is quite positive and that's pretty good for the US and for equity markets globally," Michael Bell of JPMorgan Asset Management said in his Bloomberg TV interview on Friday. "Imagine you get a corporate tax cut down to around 20pc compared with the average of about 35pc at the moment, that has a hugely positive impact on earnings." Indeed, higher earnings expectations, aside of making corporate investors happy, will also push business investment and reinvestment higher, which is particularly important after years of dismal private-sector capital allocation in the means of production. That means higher energy prices – specifically so, as OPEC is surprisingly delivering on its production cap agreements. © Flickr/ frankieleon Iran Prepares to Ditch Dollar in International TradeHigher business confidence also gains support from the ever-strengthening reflation expectations: as US prices are bound to go up with levels of imports slashed by the looming protectionist border tax, American consumers are likely to hurry making their purchases. An acceleration in core prices index typically sends more consumers to shops. Given some 72pc of the US GDP is driven by domestic consumption, growth projections are currently rather more optimistic than only six months ago, when many observers had expected a full-blown US recession to unravel in the first half of this year. Meanwhile, analysts from Goldman Sachs said the protectionist customs tariffs, yet to be announced by Trump, would dramatically reshape the global energy trade. "The decline in US LNG (liquefied natural gas) export prices post-tax credit would drive global LNG demand higher, in our view, reversing the loss of volumes that the greater decline in coal vs. foreign LNG costs had initially created," Damien Courvalin of Goldman said in the note. "On our estimate, this would leave global LNG demand unchanged pre- and post- a border tax adjustment." Whilst the US companies will seek to increase their energy exports, resulting in higher domestic fuel prices, the acceleration in US inflation and higher base interest rates will push the US economic growth higher. At the same time, international energy producers will seek to capitalise on trade deals the Trump administration would likely put on the table, so they could get access to the US energy consumers: America will still have to import energy, and restricting access to its domestic market will make it a desired prise in the perception on international producers. This is why energy stocks rallied on Trump's tax announcement despite the allegations international oil prices might tumble due to America's protectionism. As the economic growth is poised to gain momentum, private sector enterprises across most market segments are eyeing greater revenues. Yet, there might be some deviations from this basic layout when Trump gets to his tax reform in practice, meaning it is rather hard to predict how it will eventually play out. ...

A sign is seen outside the headquarters of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing. (Photo: GREG BAKER, AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE At different times throughout history, public sentiment has turned against America's biggest banks. Big banks are dangerous and must be broken up, many people believe. At the very least, they shouldn't be allowed to get any larger. But the problem with this argument is that by throttling the growth of American banks, the summit of global finance is ceded to institutions in other countries. In fact, the biggest bank in China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC, is already roughly a third larger than the biggest bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase, when measured by the size of their balance sheets. And it's not just rote size where U.S. banks have begun to lag behind their counterparts in the East Asian country. The same is true when it comes to brand value. ICBC is now the world's most valuable bank brand, says BrandFinance. Problems at Wells Fargo over the past year -- it was caught opening as many as two million fake accounts for customers -- caused the California-based bank to fall from the top spot last year. When the White House talks about the importance of enabling American financial companies to compete more effectively with firms abroad, as the President did in a recent executive order targeting the Dodd-Frank Act, these trends are probably what he and his team have in mind. ICBC is now the world's most valuable bank brand, says BrandFinance.  (Photo: handout) John Maxfield owns shares of Wells Fargo. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

European Union governments are bracing for a bust-up after Theresa May fleshed out her Brexit plans. A week after the British prime minister formalized her strategy, Brussels-based diplomats say the risk is growing that talks deteriorate early on, increasing the chance that Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 without an exit package, let alone the sweeping trade accord it’s seeking. EU officials have been irked by May’s push to curb immigration while maintaining trade ties, as well as her warnings that failure to get what she wants could prompt her to slash taxes or withdraw security provisions. EU flags outside the new Europa building in Brussels. Photographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg Likely early flashpoints include haggling over how much the U.K. owes the EU and whether the divorce and the future can be discussed at the same time. Any clash could mean May has to rein in her ambitions to avoid a disorderly split.   “The EU faces an existential crisis,” said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. “It will prioritize a deal which fosters coherence among the 27 and which demonstrates to all the disadvantages of leaving, even if that comes at a short-run economic cost to itself.” Former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told Bloomberg Television on Friday that May’s plan to exit the single market were a “logical impossibility.” “I don’t think I’ve met a serious person who is involved with the negotiations who thinks you can do what the government claims, which is settle the future arrangement between the government and the EU in its entirety within a very short timeframe.” Still, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday that he had no interest in “destructive” Brexit talks. Time for the Lords To activate the discussions, May must first win the approval of Parliament. Having won the backing of the House of Commons, she must now navigate the House of Lords, where her Conservative Party has less of a grip. Photographer: Leon Neal/WPA Pool via Getty Images The opposition Labour Party said on Thursday it’ll propose eight amendments, including the right for lawmakers to vote on May’s final deal. Other proposals cover a range of other matters, from Britain’s membership of Europe’s nuclear cooperation agreement to the rights of EU citizens resident in Britain. On Friday the Liberal Democrats also said they would seek to amend the bill. The bill can’t become law until both houses of Parliament have approved it, so if the Lords amend it, it must return to the Commons. That said, no amendment succeeded in the Commons and peers have been warned that failure to ratify the bill would raise questions about the legitimacy of the unelected part of Parliament. Brexit Secretary David Davis told Sky News that the Lords should do its “patriotic duty.” Corporate Boost May’s Brexit vision got a fillip on Thursday from the corporate sector. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook visited the premier and, according to the BBC, said he is “very optimistic” for Britain’s post-Brexit future. He cited his intention to build a new U.K. headquarters in London with room for at least 1,600 staff. “We’re a big believer in the U.K.,” said Cook. “There will be bumps in the road along the way, but the U.K.’s going to be fine.” Meantime, supercar manufacturer McLaren said it’s shifting chassis production to the U.K. from Austria in a move that will reduce its exposure to potential tariffs after Brexit. The company is building a £50 million plant in Sheffield to make lightweight carbon-fiber bodies for cars like the $1.4 million P1. While the automaker’s decision to shift production was made before last June’s referendum, the move will boost the percentage of British-made parts in its cars and comes as manufacturers prepare to minimize taxes that may be due on imported parts. “My request continually with the politicians is no tariffs, no trade barriers,” CEO Mike Flewitt said on Thursday. “For God’s sake, this is a modern world.” Automobile manufacturer Faurecia said it sees U.K. car sales falling 10 percent in 2017 because of Brexit. Brexit Bullets Control of U.K. borders may shave just 50,000 off the current net migration total of 335,000, according to Global Future Poland Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said a two-speed Europe would destroy the EU as he argued there is a need to “fix the European Union, not dismantle it” Bank of England hawk Kristin Forbes prepares to depart; Charlotte Hogg named new deputy The Legatum Institute said Brexit could pave the way for  a “prosperity zone” of like-minded countries such as the U.S., Australia and Canada to boost growth Trade Secretary Liam Fox said his department is now 3,000 people-strong, including 200 trade negotiators London gold wholesalers are considering a new U.K.-focused trade body, reports Platts Manchester United on Thursday blamed a 27.1 percent increase in its debt to £409.3 million ($512 million) on the slide in the pound, which accelerated after last year’s referendum Brexit means markets turn bearish on the U.K., says Bloomberg View’s Matthew Winkler And Finally... Near Dublin’s riverfront, the cranes are back, busy replacing U2’s iconic recording studio with a vast office complex. Less than a decade after a property crash sank the financial industry in Ireland, banking and real estate are reconnecting in the heart of the country’s capital. The plan is to provide a home for bankers leaving Brexit-era London, report Bloomberg’s Peter Flanagan and Dara Doyle. Investing in real estate investment trusts is a way to play that Brexit trade, analysts say. Local REITs are sitting on sites that could host firms looking for an Irish passport to sell into the EU, should the U.K. walk away from the single market. The Irish government has said it’s aiming to add another 10,000 international finance jobs.

The slightest delay in reaction could be the difference between making a quick profit and losing money. Rachel Mayer, a former JPMorgan trader, believes there's an easier way: let software do it. Her start-up created an app, where an algorithm scans the President's tweets for mentions of specific publicly-traded companies. Whenever Trump tweets about the companies, the app can send push notifications to alert users. These are called 'triggers.' "It's purely an informational tool," Mayer, who is CEO and co-founder of Trigger, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. The triggers are created based on "if this then that" type of statements and can help to guide investment decisions. For example, if Trump tweets about CNN and his tweet is about a fake news allegation, then a notification can be sent to alert users who own Time Warner - the parent company of CNN - stocks in their portfolios. If an automatic trigger fails to fire, a support team works "round-the-clock" to push out the alerts. "Our value proposition is linking different sets of data that the current brokerages don't support," she said, adding it allowed investors to consolidate all available information and manage investment risks. Getty Images Donald Trump, Tweeter-in-Chief. Trump's tweets, however, do not always correspond to an expected move in the market. Recently, the President criticized retailer Nordstrom's decision to wind down its relationship with the Ivanka Trump brand. Nordstrom shares initially sold off but then recovered their losses quickly. "It's still early days for deciding what his tweets mean long term for stocks, but individual investors are using it to stay on top of the trends that he is talking about," said Mayer. The triggers extend beyond Trump's tweets and include other data sets, including stock prices, movements in indices and currencies and even economic data. Users can create their own triggers or copy from another user. Mayer has plans to create more triggers based on other tweets, insider filings, weather, company upgrades and more. "Trigger is not just reliant on President Trump, even though it's put on the map recently for various reasons." — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

That's according to the board members who spoke Tuesday at a luncheon for major donors at the Hotel Crescent Court. One key has been job skills training tailored to the specific needs of area businesses, particularly in information technology and health care, said board member Anne Motsenbocker, managing director of JPMorgan Chase Bank. In addition, volunteer accountants have helped 40,000 people get $64 million in income tax refunds, she said. It's difficult to measure the percentage of high school graduates who are ready for college or careers due to recent changes in state assessment tests, said Bill Morrison, a board member and vice president and assistant general counsel of Tenet Healthcare. Overall, the organization has funded programs for 1.2 million students, parents and caregivers. Morrison said he expects an emphasis on preschool education via agencies such as Early Childhood Matters to make a clear difference in the future. Deborah Gibbins, a board member and treasurer of Mary Kay Corp., said that United Way's Healthy Zone schools initiative developed with the Cooper Institute has succeeded in lowering body mass index, improving aerobic capacity and increasing academic performance. It's currently in 141 schools. "We feel like we have a really proven model with that," she said. The charity is also working to improve access to health care, reduce emergency room visits, boost prenatal care and combat domestic violence and substance abuse. To learn more, visit unitedway.org.

Mark Zuckerberg Isn't Only Billionaire Trying To Save Lives, So Are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg And Ray Dalio By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 02/09/17 AT 9:44 PM Close Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only billionaire trying to eradicate diseases. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Bridgewater Associates Chairman Ray Dalio also have ponied up big bucks to eliminate such scourges as polio. Berkshire Hathaway genius Warren Buffett has donated billions. Zuckerberg and his wife, Chan, established a billion-dollar philanthropy organization in 2015 to "cure, prevent or manage all disease" by 2100 and has hired 47 scientists to begin researching and designing long-term strategies. Now the medical component, Biohub, has been funded with $50 million. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was founded in 2000 and is the largest transparently operated privately funded foundation in the world, launched the Global Health Investment Fund in 2013 with $108 million to develop drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and “other interventions against diseases that disproportionately burden low- and middle-income countries.” Among the foundation’s partners are JPMorgan Chase & Co., GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and the Pfizer Foundation. Gates also invited fellow billionaires Bloomberg and Dalio last year to aid in the fight to eradicate polio, raising an additional $70 million for the effort. The World Health Organization reported 42 new cases of the paralytic disease last year and one new case so far this year, mostly concentrated in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria where terrorist groups have made vaccination efforts dangerous. Polio no longer is a problem in the Americas, Europe or Australia but before the vaccine was introduced in 1955, the United States reported 10,000 to nearly 29,000 cases annually. Efforts to eliminate polio have nearly succeeded. Above, a medical worker administers polio drops to an infant in Agartala, India, Jan. 18, 2015.

Nearly half the world’s population is at risk of the disease, with 212 million cases reported in 2015 and an estimated 429,000 deaths. Since 2019, malaria rates have fallen 29 percent. Buffett donated $31 billion to the Gates Foundation in 2006, in hopes the money would be used to fight AIDS. Approximately 78 million people worldwide, 1.1 million in the U.S., are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with 2 million new cases reported in 2014. The scourge started in the last 1970s and by the end of 1985, there was at least one case in every region of the world. Genentech CEO and Apple Chairman Arthur D. Levinson heads up Calico, which uses Google’s cloud and data centers to mine data on disease and aging. Google CEO Larry Page has indicated the project’s aim is to extend human life by as much as 100 years. Among the other diseases, the Gates Foundation has targeted are enteric and diarrheal diseases, neglected tropical diseases, pneumonia and tuberculosis.

May’s initial demands –- and warnings over what she will do with taxes or security if she doesn’t get her way -– are elevating the likelihood that the U.K. leaves the bloc in 2019 without an exit deal, let alone the sweeping trade pact it seeks, according to five Brussels-based diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. The decline in sentiment comes less than two months before May plans to open discussions by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and suggests she may need to modify her approach to ensure the breakup doesn’t end up hurting both economies.  Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox, and follow @Brexit on Twitter. “It’s going to be very complicated, very messy,” former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb told Bloomberg Television this week. “When you’re negotiating Article 50, you’re talking about 200,000 pages of secondary legislation -- it’s not going to be easy to just get out.” For a QuickTake Q&A on what Theresa May’s Brexit dream means for Britain, click here. The messages from the diplomats are that EU governments are preparing to enforce their line that the U.K. can’t be better off outside the bloc than inside it and that they value safeguarding their own interests and regional stability above the need to maintain good relations with the U.K. While the diplomats acknowledged there is likely to be a long back-and-forth and that May has merely made an opening gambit, they said officials have been surprised by how combative the U.K. has been so far. “The EU faces an existential crisis,” said Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “It will prioritize a deal which fosters coherence among the 27 and which demonstrates to all the disadvantages of leaving, even if that comes at a short-run economic cost to itself.” Large Sums May outlined her strategy in a January speech and formally published it last week. She aims to leave the single market for goods and services, quit sending large sums of money to Brussels, clamp down on immigration and recapture law-making powers. As for trade, she wants a “bold and ambitious’’ commercial relationship with the EU but also the freedom to negotiate accords with other countries. Theresa May has put herself in "a very difficult position" over Brexit, @nick_clegg says https://t.co/yIS1jM4CIU pic.twitter.com/cLvTuPjCLZ— Bloomberg Brexit (@Brexit) February 10, 2017 She argues the relationship she envisages would benefit the EU too by ensuring easy trade across the English Channel and warns both economies would suffer if a pact can’t be struck. “It is in everybody’s interest to find an arrangement, to find a partnership between us that actually meets the needs on both sides,’’ May told the New Statesman magazine this week. “I don’t feel I have a weak hand.’’ Still, governments couldn’t avoid noticing that May’s pitch was laced with menace, the diplomats said. She suggested failure to land a deal could prompt the U.K. to cut taxes to maintain competitiveness and also hinted it could withhold security cooperation from its neighbors. Her willingness to engage with U.S. President Donald Trump also raised eyebrows. “She’s taken this huge strategic decision to ally herself with Donald Trump which has ruffled a lot of feathers,” former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. Diplomats across the EU “are mystified as to why she hasn’t tried to create more space to come to a more workable, a more moderate accommodation.” Hardening Positions British efforts to find allies among the other 27 EU states and undercut the European Commission in Brussels would risk hardening positions, the diplomats said. The U.K. has already started bulking up the status of embassies in central and eastern Europe. It has also yet to guarantee the rights of EU citizens currently living in the U.K., which outnumber Britons on the continent. How the talks will actually fare may be evident early on. An immediate flashpoint is set to be the haggling over Britain’s exit bill. Running to an estimated 60 billion euros ($64 billion), it comprises various financial commitments, such as pension obligations to EU officials and past pledges to the bloc’s budget and projects. Strategic Priorities U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox last week called the idea of such a bill “absurd” and the government has said it won’t pay for any EU projects signed after last November unless they “provide strong value for money and are in line with domestic strategic priorities.” The European Commission this week reiterated that Britain’s financial commitments “should be honored in full.’’ The structure of the talks will also prove nettlesome even as both sides agree they need to wrap up around October 2018 so as to give the British and European parliaments time to debate the draft plans. EU negotiator Michel Barnier maintains that settling the terms of divorce must come before discussions about a future relationship. That would put paid to May’s hopes of striking a new trade deal within two years, although European Parliament point-person Guy Verhofstadt recently said parallel discussions should be possible. While British businesses and London-based banks are also keen for there to be a transitional period after the day of Brexit to acclimatize, Barnier says that will be a matter for deep into the discussions. That could be a problem for May as an agreement could come too late to stop jobs and operations moving overseas. Recent evidence suggests May will struggle to divide and conquer the EU. The bloc has broadly stuck to its commitment not to hold even informal talks with the British until Article 50 is activated, while all its leaders say the U.K. will be unable to “cherry pick’’ the best bits of EU membership. ‘Situation Outside’ “Britain’s situation outside must be less favorable than the situation it’s had inside,” EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said in an interview in Belgium’s Le Soir newspaper on Friday. “Mrs. May will negotiate for British interests; we will negotiate for the interests of Europe at 27.” Instead of fracturing, the EU’s other 27 nations have used the time to carry out intensive preparations among themselves. National officials spent the past weeks lobbying Barnier and his team in Brussels to ensure pet causes such as Ireland’s border with the U.K. and which waters French fishermen can access aren’t ignored when the talks start. Barnier now has about 25 members of various European nationalities, drawing expertise mainly from the European Commission in differing policy areas, including specialists in financial services, the budget, trade and law. “The British may over-estimate the strength of the cards they hold,” Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said in a note. “That means that May and her ministers should conduct the talks in a sober, courteous and modest manner.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Now, the people Trump cast as Wall Street monsters crowd his administration, mysteriously reborn as the architects of a dangerous new economic strategy. Key in that strategy is what Trump describes as "doing a big number" on the Dodd-Frank Act, which Trump denounces, as "a disaster", and which Republicans deride as "Obamacare for banks". SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to prevent another GFC which saw thousands of foreclosures in the US. Photo: Bloomberg The 2010 act provides the protective rails that might guard against a repeat of the corporate and financial excesses that triggered the 2008-09 global financial crisis, by attempting to rein in the wild mortgage practices and risky bets that contributed to so many of Trump's forgotten people losing their jobs, retirement savings and homes. The act also authorised the government to wind up big financial firms that are in trouble; to monitor threats to the financial system; and to oversee the huge and complex derivatives market, the crazy ways of which also fuelled the financial crisis. Advertisement Also on Trump's chopping block is the arcanely titled Fiduciary Rule – it requires retirement financial advisers to act decently and put the interests of their clients above their own in a market with an estimated value of $US25 trillion ($32 trillion). The rule is due to come into effect in April 2017.

Speaking over images of Wall Street and casting the likes of Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein as lepers, Trump railed against "a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class – stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations". And on inauguration day, Trump kept "the establishment" in his sights: "The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs, and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land."

So Jamie Dimon does know Dodd-Frank -- like a mobster knows RICO 12/— AFR (@RealBankReform) February 3, 2017 In the ructions over Trump's migration crackdown, the President's scene-setting for doing away with Dodd-Frank and the Fiduciary Rule has garnered little attention in the midst of a blizzard of executive orders, memorandums and declarations of intent. In the Obama years, an army of corporate lobbyists and lawyers invested hundreds of millions of dollars fighting Dodd-Frank – as it went through congress and again in a subsequent, tortuous process of drafting the regulation through which the Act was being implemented. Dodd-Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a heroic agency that has clawed back more than $US12 billion for millions of "forgotten" Americans who were victims of abusive mortgage, credit-card and other lending vehicles by "establishment" financial institutions that continued their robber baron ways after the Great Recession. Trump parses his economic plans as help for both Wall Street and workers, by releasing them from regulatory constraints to allow banks to lend more to companies, which, he says, will then hire more workers. "We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can't borrow money," Trump said during a meeting with business leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House. "They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank." In truth, in talking about "nice businesses" that can't borrow Trump appears to be talking about himself – much of his recent borrowing have been from the German Deutsche Bank, because after his serial defaults and bankruptcies American banks shied away from lending to him; and surveys show that as few as 4 per cent of small businesses, a historic low, are unhappy with current loan availability. In a derisory attack on the Fiduciary Rule, Trump's new national economic council chief Gary Cohn told The Wall Street Journal: "We think it's a bad rule … like putting only health food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good. But you still shouldn't eat it because you might die younger." Sticking to his restaurant analogy, Cohn described Trump's reform pronouncement as a "table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming, [including] dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. "Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we're not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year," he told the Journal. But New York Times economics commentator Paul Krugman turned Cohn's restaurant analogy on its head. Denouncing Trump's economic policies as empowering ethically challenged businesses to cheat and exploit "the little guy", he writes: "If you want a better analogy, it's like preventing restaurants from claiming that their 1400-calorie portions are health food." In 2015, an Obama administration study found that the kind of "conflicted investment advice" that would become illegal under the Fiduciary Rule reduced total earning for retirees by about 1 per cent – that's a whopping $US17 billion a year that, Krugman points out, mostly ends up in the pockets of financial-industry players. "The administration apparently plans to turn over financial regulation to Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs, and make it easier for them and other big banks like Wells Fargo to steal from their customers and destabilise the economy," says Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. "That betrays the promises Trump made to stand up to Wall Street." Captured at the height of last year's election campaign, the Wells Fargo scandal, alluded to by Donner, was a credibility-enhancing scalp for the fledgling CFPB. Wells Fargo, with 40 million retail customers, was fined $US185 million for a scam in which the bank signed millions of customers up for accounts, credit cards, and services without their consent or knowledge – an industrial scale machine for raking in extra fees that known by the industry term "cross selling". The bank sacked more than 5000 lowly staffers. But senior executives got off scot-free, provoking a sensational showdown at a Senate hearing in September 2016, in which Massachusetts senator and consumer-protection firebrand Elizabeth Warren eviscerated Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. Reminding many Democrats of why she would have been a more effective Democratic presidential candidate than Hillary Clinton, Warren opened by focusing on an oft-stated Stumpf claim: "I am accountable." Warren: … what have you actually done to hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned as CEO or chairman of Wells Fargo? Stumpf: No, I have not. Warren: Alright. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on? Stumpf: Well, first of all, this was by 1 per cent of our people. Warren: That's not my question. This is about responsibility. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on? [...] Warren: OK, so you haven't resigned, you haven't returned a single nickel of your personal earnings, you haven't fired a single senior executive. Instead evidently your definition of "accountable" is to push the blame to your low-level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It's gutless leadership … "You know, here is what really gets me about this, Mr Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer, they probably would be looking at criminal charges for theft. "They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. "And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multimillion-dollar bonuses and you went on television to blame thousands of $12 an hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich. This is about accountability. You should resign … "But Wall Street executives almost never hold themselves accountable. "Not now, and not in 2008 when they crushed the worldwide economy." After that Stumpf was shamed into quitting. But Wall Street being what it is, Stumpf was "let go", to coin that quaint Americanism for being sacked, with a $US130-plus million package to salve his wounded dignity. Trump does not have the power to dispatch Dodd-Frank with a stroke of his presidential pen – because it is an act of Congress. But Republicans have signalled that in the face of resistance in Congress, they would resort to a time-honoured practice of neutering the act, by chipping away at the regulations and crippling the agencies that implement them by slashing their funding. In laying out his plan to euthanise the Dodd-Frank Act, Trump declared: "The American dream is back." As Wall Street waged guerilla warfare on the Dodd-Frank Act in 2009, then-president Barack Obama, for whom saving the economy after the 2008-09 financial crisis and Dodd-Frank are legacy jewels, famously remarked: "I didn't run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street." Fast forward to the 2016 presidential campaign, and Americans would be forgiven for thinking Trump was saying the same thing.

Now, the people Trump cast as Wall Street monsters crowd his administration, mysteriously reborn as the architects of a dangerous new economic strategy. Key in that strategy is what Trump describes as "doing a big number" on the Dodd-Frank Act, which Trump denounces, as "a disaster", and which Republicans deride as "Obamacare for banks".

The act also authorised the government to wind up big financial firms that are in trouble; to monitor threats to the financial system; and to oversee the huge and complex derivatives market, the crazy ways of which also fuelled the financial crisis. Advertisement Also on Trump's chopping block is the arcanely titled Fiduciary Rule – it requires retirement financial advisers to act decently and put the interests of their clients above their own in a market with an estimated value of $US25 trillion ($32 trillion). The rule is due to come into effect in April 2017.

Speaking over images of Wall Street and casting the likes of Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein as lepers, Trump railed against "a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class – stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations". And on inauguration day, Trump kept "the establishment" in his sights: "The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs, and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land."

So Jamie Dimon does know Dodd-Frank -- like a mobster knows RICO 12/— AFR (@RealBankReform) February 3, 2017 In the ructions over Trump's migration crackdown, the President's scene-setting for doing away with Dodd-Frank and the Fiduciary Rule has garnered little attention in the midst of a blizzard of executive orders, memorandums and declarations of intent. In the Obama years, an army of corporate lobbyists and lawyers invested hundreds of millions of dollars fighting Dodd-Frank – as it went through congress and again in a subsequent, tortuous process of drafting the regulation through which the Act was being implemented. Dodd-Frank also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a heroic agency that has clawed back more than $US12 billion for millions of "forgotten" Americans who were victims of abusive mortgage, credit-card and other lending vehicles by "establishment" financial institutions that continued their robber baron ways after the Great Recession. Trump parses his economic plans as help for both Wall Street and workers, by releasing them from regulatory constraints to allow banks to lend more to companies, which, he says, will then hire more workers. "We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can't borrow money," Trump said during a meeting with business leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House. "They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank." In truth, in talking about "nice businesses" that can't borrow Trump appears to be talking about himself – much of his recent borrowing have been from the German Deutsche Bank, because after his serial defaults and bankruptcies American banks shied away from lending to him; and surveys show that as few as 4 per cent of small businesses, a historic low, are unhappy with current loan availability. In a derisory attack on the Fiduciary Rule, Trump's new national economic council chief Gary Cohn told The Wall Street Journal: "We think it's a bad rule … like putting only health food on the menu, because unhealthy food tastes good. But you still shouldn't eat it because you might die younger." Sticking to his restaurant analogy, Cohn described Trump's reform pronouncement as a "table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming, [including] dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. "Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we're not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year," he told the Journal. But New York Times economics commentator Paul Krugman turned Cohn's restaurant analogy on its head. Denouncing Trump's economic policies as empowering ethically challenged businesses to cheat and exploit "the little guy", he writes: "If you want a better analogy, it's like preventing restaurants from claiming that their 1400-calorie portions are health food." In 2015, an Obama administration study found that the kind of "conflicted investment advice" that would become illegal under the Fiduciary Rule reduced total earning for retirees by about 1 per cent – that's a whopping $US17 billion a year that, Krugman points out, mostly ends up in the pockets of financial-industry players.

Business Home LBoard Adenan’s son campaigns for Mom and finds Dad’s calling Bernama Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Moody’s raises Indonesia outlook, top minister takes a dig at S&P Reuters | February 10, 2017 Officials have long been hoping for a ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor's, which has kept Indonesian debts at junk status. JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities welcomed a credit outlook upgrade by Moody’s as a sign investors are increasingly comfortable with the country, while the chief economics minister chastised Standard & Poor’s for holding back an investment-grade rating. Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its credit outlook on Indonesia sovereign debt to “positive” from “stable” late on Wednesday and reaffirmed its Baa3 ratings, the lowest notch for investment grade debt. The agency noted that Southeast Asia’s largest economy is now less vulnerable to external shocks and has a lengthening track record of economic stability and fiscal discipline. This followed a similar December move by Fitch, which has an equivalent BBB- rating, and comes as Indonesia’s policymakers seek to attract more foreign investment when emerging market assets globally are under stress. Late last year, the government sanctioned JP Morgan Chase & Co. for downgrading the country’s equity market. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in January she was concerned the downgrade could fuel a stampede out of the country’s assets. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo said the Moody’s upgraded outlook showed international recognition of the country’s “success in maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability that create a conducive environment for sustainable growth”. On Thursday, Indrawati said the government will continue to strengthen policies to “rationalize risk perception”. Officials have long been hoping for a ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor’s, which has kept Indonesian debts at junk status. Fitch Ratings gave Indonesia an investment grade ratings in 2011 and Moody’s in 2012. Minister’s views But Darmin Nasution, the chief economics minister, said investors should dismiss the fact S&P still has not given an investment grade rating. “We don’t know what (S&P’s) problem is. Its explanations change all the time… If it keeps changing its mind, don’t listen to it,” Nasution told reporters. S&P declined to comment on the difference between its assessment and that of its competitors. In a report in January, S&P said that although the US November election caused some initial weakness in the rupiah, investors have been buying Indonesian bonds. “We continue to see this confidence as contingent upon continued progress in reforms to foreign investment policy, fuel subsidies and ease of doing business,” S&P said. Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said “Among the three agencies, S&P has been more conservative in its assessment of Indonesia but we expect them to be the next one to upgrade.” Moody’s said key drivers of its change in outlook were smaller current account deficit and higher foreign exchange reserves. Indonesia’s current account deficit in 2016’s last quarter was its smallest in five years, while foreign exchange reserves at end-January were the highest since August 2011. Challenges in revenue collection were highlighted by Moody’s as a risk. The rating agency also warned it could lower the outlook if reform efforts unravel. Moody’s said it would upgrade Indonesia’s ratings if the government reduces reliance on external debt, while at the same time strengthening its financial institutions. On Thursday, Indonesian bonds rallied across the board both in the local currency and dollar bond markets. The rally saw yields falling 6-7 basis points in the rupiah government bonds. The Indonesian sovereign sector has been the best performer in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index in 2017 with a return of 4.01 percent.

Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

By Nicole Rojas February 9, 2017 23:31 GMT US markets closed in the green following promising moves by President Trump regarding taxesReuters US stocks closed in the green on Thursday (9 February) after US President Donald Trump promised a "phenomenal" announcement regarding his tax plan in the next few weeks. The 45th president has vowed to cut taxes, which is expected to have a stimulative effect on asset values. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 118.06 points, or 0.6%, to close at a record 20,172.40. The blue chips gauge managed to hit an intraday all-time high of 20,206.36, according to MarketWatch. Gains were led by Nike Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, with the help of of Goldman Sachs, which closed up 1.4%. The S&P 500 jumped 13.20 points, or 0.6%, to settle at 2,307.87 after reaching an all-time high of 2,311.08. The index traded within a 1% range for the 38th consecutive session, marking its longest streak on record. Financial sector saw big performers, according to MarketWatch. Morgan Stanley jumped 2.2% and Bank of America Corp saw an increase of 1.8%. Over on the Dow, JP Morgan Chase & Co also rose 1.6%. Energy stocks also saw gains, with a 1.3% rise in the price of crude oil to $53 (£42.40) a barrel. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite hit a closing record for a third straight session, ticking up 32.73 points, or 0.6%, to close at 5,715.18. According to MarketWatch, the last time the three major indexes all closed at records was 25 January. "I think it's a combination of investors feeling more confident that some tax package will get worked on. But I think that we also have lower interest rates recently and solid earnings," Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, told CNBC. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, added: "Those comments about taxes, the markets have been looking forward to that for a while, and that helps. At least we're not talking about Ivanka [Trump]'s dress line over at Nordstrom's." In the latest economic reports, weekly jobless claims dropped by 12,000 to 234,000 and wholesale trade data for December revealed a 1% increase on inventories, CNBC reported. US Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to 2.39% and the short-term two-year yield by 1.18%. Following a sale, the 30-year bonds yielded 3.016%. Gold prices dropped 0.2% to $1,236.80 (£989.44) an ounce. The US dollar surged against a basket of currencies, jumping more than 1% against the yen. By 6.15pm EST (11.15pm GMT), the USD was at £0.80.

'Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.' - Henry David Thoreau Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Captain Hook / Nothing to Lose - Mr. Trump Nothing to Lose - Mr. Trump By: Captain Hook | Thu, Feb 9, 2017 Share Print Email This is an open letter to President Trump, which I hope he both reads and understands. By way of introduction, and something you may or may not be ware of, I penned this piece entitled Braveheart back in November to celebrate your wonderful win, where you were elected the 'hero of the republic and common folk' - their savior from the evil doers. That said, and to set the tone for this open letter to you, please see recent comments from commentary published a few weeks back involving possible increasing vulnerabilities for America due the radical change you profess to be bringing to the table, as follows: "Wouldn't it be 'funny' if China unleashed increasing percentages of its still bountiful currency reserves on gold and silver bullion, with emphasis not on the former, but the latter considering its strategic importance to America's interconnected markets. As you would know from reading my reports on silver throughout the years, silver is not just important to the maintenance of the larger credit bubble - it's everything. The entire financial repression game, with interest rates at center, depend on keeping silver subdued, because of key inter-market relationships with gold (currencies), bonds, and equities, where radical change would unhinge the derivatives markets employed to manage the larger pricing nexus. So if China really wanted to hurt the US, all it has to do is set silver free from its COMEX shackles, the primary price-managing instrument used to keep general prices under control. And there's only one way to do that - buy it all (which they could do with trillions in foreign currency reserves) - or at least make global price differentials so substantial arbitrage becomes a 'no brainer' for the billionaires of the world. Then a 'buying panic' would ensure that would accomplish the same goal - it would clean them out - even JP Morgan's stash. It wouldn't take much if a true panic to accumulate physical silver ever takes hold, where momentum would eventually bring in all varieties of funds (sovereign, hedge, pension, etc.), not to mention the public. It wouldn't take much at all once it gets rolling - especially with Trump shaking things up." Fast foreword to today, Wednesday February 8th, while precious metals continue to understandably push higher given the 'true backdrop', I must point out silver's underperformance to gold again under the guise it's an 'industrial metal', so this is supposed to be understandable because stock market futures are down. Please realize however this is the BS story the bankers want you to believe, all the while selling unlimited amounts of COMEX silver contracts to control the price, as proved in last week's COT numbers. The banks sold silver down mercilessly last week with no fear of reparation, where its price would have performed much better otherwise. The question then arises, 'is this what we should continue to expect with Goldman Sachs in control of the Treasury again?' Where are the regulators Mr. Trump? Are you really 'in charge'? If you are truly concerned with making America great again, you will need to do something about this situation. America's got to take the hit before it's possible to be great again - you need honest markets Mr. Trump - you can take that to the bank. If you don't bring proper price discovery back to the markets, all your efforts will be for naught, because as you know, there's no free lunch. Be truly honest with the people Mr. Trump - we've already got a full quota of fakes. Your legacy will be failure in the end if you don't as you've been targeted as the 'fall guy' anyway. The falling money supply growth rates prove this assertion. Check it out. Your actions on Friday were not encouraging in this regard Mr. Trump. One could think you are attempting to deceive the American people like your predecessors. One could think you are playing 'the game', because you are not draining the swamp. You know - what you promised to do last year. Please tell us another collapse isn't being engineered (to be capitalized on by Wall Street), because it's hard to believe you could be that naïve? If the markets crash, which is inevitable at some point, the people will be looking for a scapegoat, and your many enemies will make sure that goat is you Mr. Trump. First they will run you through the ringer, and then they will attempt to impeach you. So you see, you really have nothing to lose by sticking to your promises - all of them - even the hard ones. Just be honest with the people - they're not stupid as you know (they elected you) - so don't think they won't understand 'truth' and that 'true pricing' needs to be brought back to the table. Because again, you have nothing to lose from such a move, as you are being made the 'designated goat' anyway - the outsider of the enemy within - never mind China. Bring back honest pricing to gold and silver because it's the right thing to do in the rebuilding of Americana - the America you love. The show you have put on so far, while impressive on the surface, lacks real punching power. If you want to fix that, back your blows with real weight, punches that truly hurt the opposition. Playing into their hands by making Middle America more indebted via an accommodative Fed is not the answer because larger bubbles will only burst bigger in the end. And the closer this is to election time the worse for you. Yes, it will take time this way too, and there are risks; but if you are serious about wanting to be in the White House for another four-years after 2020, you have no choice but to take such risks by neutralizing America's enemies now, both foreign and domestic. Otherwise you will just be enriching the oligarchs further - the Beltway and Wall Street parasites - you know - America's enemy from within you promised to neutralize. Bring honest pricing back to America's markets Mr. Trump; because again, as outlined above, for one reason or another, you have nothing to lose.

Also aligning with the markets as a whole, the IMX showed strong investor movement into the financial sector, particularly toward Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co, (NYSE: JPM). The Fed's decision to raise interest rates late in 2016, the increased strength of the dollar, as well as the looming promise of financial deregulation from the new Trump administration may also have added to the appeal of big banks among investors. 2016's best performing stock continued to be popular among investors, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) was a net buy from TD Ameritrade investors throughout January. Surprise Standouts The report also singled out Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) as standouts in two sectors that saw a downturn at the start of the year. Both companies were net bought in January, despite reportedly poor retail sales during the holidays and declining price in most energy corporations as the price at the pump remained stable. Selling At The Top Among the securities that saw a selloff in January were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) who both hit recent highs that month. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) also saw a lot of sales following what many believe was a stellar year for the companies properties, with the 2016 release of another entry in the Star Wars franchise as well as several Marvel Comics' movies and television series.

This proposed indirect purchaser class action applies to people in numerous states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and North Carolina. The proposed indirect purchaser classes include individuals and entities in those states who, between 2007 and 2013: Exchanged U.S. dollars for foreign currency with a regional bank or credit union; Banked with a regional bank or credit union and used their debit card abroad or issued foreign wire transfers; Traded stocks on a foreign exchange; Maintained 30.7 accounts and traded foreign futures, options, or commodities; or Purchased other foreign currency-related investments from a party other than one of the Defendants The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that beginning as early as 2007 and continuing through at least 2013, some of the world’s largest banks conspired with each other to fix prices and manipulate benchmark exchange rates in the FX market. These benchmark FX rates are used industry-wide in many different financial instruments and FX exchange transactions. By fixing FX rates, these banks increased their profits and decreased the value of their customers’ FX transactions. The defendant banks include Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC, RBS, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, and UBS. This class action seeks to recover damages against those Defendants for alleged violations of the antitrust and consumer protection laws of numerous states. These allegations have been the subject of investigations by multiple U.S., foreign, and international governmental authorities, and the Defendants have already been required to pay over $10 billion in fines to U.S. and European regulators. A related nationwide direct purchaser class action brought against the same Defendants is currently awaiting final approval of settlements totaling over $2 billion.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 9, 2017 at 2:41PM Bank of America's consumer bank still pumps out profits despite the downward trend in its branch count. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. With the growth of digital banking, bank branches have gotten a bad name. This is one reason Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has slashed its branch count by more than 20% since CEO Brian Moynihan took over at the beginning of 2010. Interestingly, though, if you dig into Bank of America's business units, you'll find that its consumer banking segment is its most profitable. It earned $7.2 billion last year, up from $6.6 billion in 2015. That's not only the largest profit in absolute dollars among Bank of America's operating units, as its runner-up global banking segment earned $5.7 billion in net income last year, it's also the most on a relative basis. The consumer banking unit's return on average allocated capital last year was 21%, which is tied for first place with its global wealth and investment management segment. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. This doesn't necessarily mean branches are still in vogue. After all, the increased digitization of banking is reflected in the profit Bank of America earns from its consumer bank, the benefits of which are substantial. The North Carolina-based bank says an automated deposit costs 90% less than a deposit done at a branch, and figures from JPMorgan Chase back this up. According to JPMorgan, it costs $0.65 to handle a deposit transaction in a branch, $0.08 per transaction on an ATM, but just $0.03 per mobile deposit. This starts to add up when you consider that Bank of America has more than 21 million active users of its mobile banking app. A full 68% of the bank's deposits are now done without a teller's assistance, either by way of an ATM or remote deposit capture on a smartphone. The net result is that Bank of America has been able to meaningfully cut its expense base. Its average cost per $100 in deposits has dropped by 34% since 2010, the bank noted last year, going from $2.61 to $1.71 as of the first quarter of 2016. As these trends continue, not only should it make Bank of America more profitable, but it will further widen the profitability gulf between its consumer banking unit and the three other operating segments.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter As U.S. stocks continue stubbornly to carve out records since Donald Trump’s November presidential election victory, financial and industrial stocks remain the clear winners while utilities and consumer staples lag behind. But, it appears the biggest beneficiaries since the election have been Russian stocks. As a benchmark, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48% has advanced 9.8% since the Nov. 8 election, a span of 62 trading days, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36%  has risen 7.7% and the Nasdaq COMP, +0.33%  has gained 10%. Since Trump’s Jan. . 20 inauguration (or 14 days of trading), the Dow has gained 1.6%, while the S&P 500 had advanced 1.4% and the Nasdaq has advanced 2.6%. Read: Stock market hits a trifecta of intraday records as energy, banks rally One benchmark however, has at least doubled that performance since the election, namely, the Moscow Exchange, or Micex, made up of Russia’s 50 largest companies. Since the election the Micex has jumped nearly 30% in U.S. dollar terms and nearly 20% using the Russian ruble, according to FactSet data. Since the inauguration, it has gained 5.9% in U.S. dollar terms and 4.9% in rubles. The biggest heavyweights on the Micex, the natural-gas giant Gazprom OGZD, +1.03% Lukoil LKOH, +5.19%  and Sberbank of Russia SBER, -1.07% have generally outperformed their American counterparts. Since Trump won the election, shares of Gazprom have risen 4.8% in local terms, while Lukoil shares have jumped 10% and Sberbank shares have leapt 19%. In comparison, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.83%  have declined 4.7%, Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.70% shares have gained 4.4% over the same period. Shares of the largest U.S. bank by market cap, however, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.23%  have rallied 23%. See: The biggest ETF winners and losers of 2016 A rush into Russian assets is also evidenced by the VanEck Vectors Russia ETF RSX, +1.16% and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF ERUS, +0.89% which have both gained about 17% since the election. While Russian stocks have gained a significant boost since the election, that hasn’t been the case for their Chinese counterparts. Since the election the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.42% has gained a paltry 1.1% based on the Chinese yuan, but has declined 0.4% in U.S. dollar terms, according to FactSet. Similarly, emerging markets ETFs have lagged behind with the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF VWO, +0.91%  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM, +0.92%  up 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Back in the U.S., small-cap stocks have benefited more than their larger counterparts since the election, but not so much since the inauguration. The Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.75%  has gained 14% since the election, but less than 1% since Trump was sworn into office. Since the inauguration, the clear winners have been technology stocks, which lead sectors on the S&P 500 with a 3.6% gain. In turn, tech shares have been paced by a more than 10% gain in Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.23%  shares. On the other hand, the worst performing sector since the election has been energy, which has fallen 3.5% since Trump took office. In subsectors, the worst performing stocks since the election and the inauguration have been textiles, apparel and luxury goods, with declines of 16% and 10% respectively. While the best performing subsector since the election has been trading companies and distributors with a 36% gain, a much more significant gain, in terms of market cap, has been seen in banks with an across the board 24% gain since the election Best performers on S&P 500 since election Company/ ticker % move since election % move since inauguration Nvidia Corp.

Counter-cyclical sectors were the day’s leading gainers while financial stocks took the brunt of the sell-off. WTI crude oil for March delivery settled at $52.34 a barrel, up about 0.3% on the day, even after a government report showed the addition of 13.8 million barrels to the nation’s commercial inventories. April gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,239.50. Equities were headed for a mixed close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.19% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.19%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded down 0.90% at $85.94. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $88.17. Volume was about 60% below the daily average of around 18.4 million shares. The big bank had no specific news. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded down 0.76% at $81.40. The stock’s 52-week range is $77.58 to $95.55. Volume was less than 10% below the daily average of around 11.4 million shares. The company had no specific news. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded down 0.75% at $163.85. The stock’s 52-week range is $102.10 to $170.00. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 3.4 million shares. The aerospace company had no specific news. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) traded down 0.71% at $110.46. The stock’s 52-week range is $83.85 to $112.83. Volume was about half the daily average of around 9 million shares. The company had no specific news.

And while the initial “Trump bump” for stocks in November and early December was significant, markets have since been mostly stuck: The S&P 500 is up a modest 2% since New Year’s Day, but we are in the longest stretch in market history without a 1% move or more for the benchmark index. It’s mostly because uncertainty is creeping in, and Republicans aren’t doing much to stop it, let alone deliver on campaign promises. But it’s also because of big uncertainty around what’s next for the U.S. dollar. In the words of investment bankers at J.P. Morgan Chase, “erratic policy emissions from the White House” have stoked uncertainty in the U.S. dollar. On one hand, President Donald Trump talks big about protectionist strategies and higher rates, but on the other, he has broken with decades of a strong dollar rhetoric by talking down the greenback. When taken in context of recent immigration policies and saber rattling over trade, it’s setting the stage for a potentially market-shaking move in currency markets over the next several months. So how do you hedge against big swings in currencies — or, if you’re an aggressive trader, how do you profit from the trend? Here are a few accessible ideas that don’t require actual forex trading experience: Currency ETFs provide alternative investments Trading currencies is a high-octane endeavor that is fraught with risk. Just one of the risks is that serious forex trading typically involves a lot of leverage, which sometimes can result in losses even bigger than your initial investment. For most investors, currency ETFs offer an accessible alternative to trading actual currencies. The Guggenheim CurrencyShares family of funds offer a way to play a host of major currencies via exchange-traded funds — and some have done quite nicely lately. For instance, the CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust FXA, +0.60%  is up 6% since Jan. 1, vs. 2% for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36% and the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust FXY, -0.07%  is up 5%. Both funds are designed to track the strength of their respective currencies vs. the U.S. dollar. Currency ETFs are not risk-free, of course. There’s a 24-hour marketplace that may demand constant attention, as well as the risk of your trade going south without warning simply because politicians have made an unexpected move affecting your currency of choice. How wearable technology can transform health care(1:46) Around 12-15 million people use wearable technology for health care - a market that includes Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and LG. MarketWatch spoke to Kate McCarthy, a health-care analyst that manages a rare disease using an Apple Watch and a service dog. Some investors aren’t looking at currencies as a way to make a fortune, but rather as a hedge in a volatile market with few good alternatives to stocks. In that case, a fund like the relatively stable Guggenheim CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust FXF, -0.22%  is worth a look — as is the increasingly popular PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, +0.12% which is tied to the strength of the U.S. dollar rather than the strength of U.S. stocks. Currency-hedged equity ETFs rise again Some investors have been frustrated in recent years by tactical investments in certain regions that didn’t play out as they expected thanks largely to forex pressures. Consider the run for Japan as “Abenomics” came to the fore. In calendar 2013, the Nikkei 225 index NIK, +2.49%  ran up an amazing 57%; however, the widely held iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.71%  gained only 22% or so. As a result, a host of currency-hedged ETFs have entered the market in the intervening years. One is the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF HEWJ, +0.82% which launched in 2014 and is designed to give exposure to Japanese equities “while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar,” according to iShares. Such funds fell out of favor in 2015 and early 2016 as the U.S. dollar halted its relentless rise. However, they are rising again in 2017 as investors brace for nationalist policies around the globe, potential trade wars and the resulting big swings in currencies that will follow. According to Bloomberg and State Street data, currency-hedged ETFs saw over $500 million in net inflows in both January and December. This is amid a 12-month trend that shows a net outflow of over $20 billion from currency-hedged investments. That trend is noteworthy, and investors looking overseas should consider follow the pack to hedge against currency fluctuations in their portfolio. A new trade: Dollar-hedged gold Currency-hedged equity funds are making a comeback. But what if you’re looking for diversification into another asset class? State Street Global Advisors, the brand behind the popular SPDR family of ETFs including the bullion-backed SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.26% recently launched the first dollar-hedged gold fund listed in the U.S. This new ETF, the SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust GLDW, +0.37%  , is meant to fight the impact of a strong dollar, which can hold back prices of commodities like gold. Richard Branson: 'Thousands' will go to space soon(2:28) Two years after a fatal accident, Virgin Galactic launched its first successful test flight in September. Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are racing to send tourists to space. Branson talks to MarketWatch about the future of space travel. Consider that while gold prices fell about 5% from the end of 2013 through the end of 2016, from roughly $1,200 to a little under $1,150, State Street claims that “when the effect of a strengthening USD is removed, gold priced in non-US currencies, such as the euro, increased from €873/oz to €1,096/oz, a 25% increase.” Admittedly, that’s this fund’s marketing department cherry-picking a period of tremendous gains for the U.S. dollar vs. a headline loss for gold. But it does illustrate the potential. To say there is market uncertainty in 2017 is a gross understatement. As a result, we’ve seen a pretty nice rally for gold in the last several weeks, with the precious metal up about 10% from its December lows. Untethering that gold trade from the impact of a strong dollar could be very profitable, then. The big question, however, is whether we will see follow-through on policies that will bolster the already impressive greenback even further. With the dollar near 14-year highs against the euro, how much stronger can it really get? Will any stimulus efforts by a Republican Congress offset any gains in the U.S. currency caused by Federal Reserve tightening? And will additional interest-rate increases happen at all? As I said, there’s a lot of uncertainty. But if you want to play a strong dollar and the resurgence of gold, the new GLDW fund provides an interesting tool for your investing toolbox.

After the lira's worst January in almost a quarter of a century, investors have cut exposure to local assets, fearing the central bank was incapable of tackling an inflation upsurge. But Cetinkaya, in a presentation at JPMorgan's London offices on Thursday, was able to point to the central bank's weighted average cost of funding as proof the bank is serious about inflation-targeting. The rate that the bank currently appears to use as the main gauge for borrowing costs in the economy is at 10.38 percent, up more than 200 basis points since the start of the year. People familiar with the matter told Reuters this week rates would stay at those levels until inflation peaked. In London, Cetinkaya confirmed that message, telling his audience of money managers he intended to keep rates around current levels as long as needed, to meet inflation targets and stabilise the lira. Fund managers who attended said they came away not entirely convinced. But they had some sympathy for Cetinkaya, who must balance controlling inflation - currently over 9 percent - with President Tayyip Erdogan's constant demands for lower interest rates. "They're trying to make everyone happy with this framework. That's the challenge," said Claudia Calich, head of emerging debt at M&G Investments, who attended the event. Like most investors, Calich has a lower exposure to Turkish debt than its weight in bond indexes, due to concerns over central bank independence, a fragile lira and a monetary policy clouded by a multitude of rates. At the central bank's last meeting it kept benchmark policy rates unchanged at 8 percent. But it tightened policy by raising overnight lending rates and upped rates on a liquidity window - a lira funding source for banks - to 11 percent. For the time being that may be enough. Societe Generale analysts, for instance, advised clients to buy lira, noting that the central bank's "explicit acknowledgment of accumulating inflationary pressures and expressed commitment to fighting inflation" had steadied the currency. The lira is some 7 percent off record lows, helped by the dollar's retreat in recent days. "(Cetinkaya) mentioned that additional tightening could be a possibility if need be. But would they do it pro-actively or would the currency need to go under pressure again?" Calich added. Appointed last April, Cetinkaya had been deputy governor since 2012 but Thursday's meeting was the first with him for many investors, who crowded into a standing room-only meeting. His lack of formal economics training had made many sceptical about whether he could stand up to Erdogan, whose priority is to accelerate economic growth. One bond fund manager said a gentle audience question about political pressure on the central bank had been deflected. "He was as hawkish as he could have credibly been given the constraint he is under," the fund manager said, requesting anonymity. "He sounded like he knew what the market needed and we knew what constraints the institution operates under," the manager added. "Nothing I heard today makes me more comfortable for the longer term." Little was apparently said about simplifying the policy rate framework, other than that being the bank's eventual aim. But some investors said they were concerned about Cetinkaya's references to a "dynamic monetary policy". "Turkey just needs to tighten monetary policy and hold it for a considerable period of time to ensure inflation begins to moderate. Use of terminology like dynamic implies the tight policy won't be long-lasting," said Tim Ash, senior sovereign strategist at BlueBay.

(Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) In response to the president’s unprecedented attack on a company declining to do business with a family member, Nordstrom answered President Trump’s accusation that it was treating Ivanka Trump unfairly. “To reiterate what we’ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance,” the company said in a statement. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.” In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka. National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, gave a measured response. “What we are all seeing is that we’re living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House,” he said. “It’s someone who communicates directly and forcefully and has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning, all of us, I think, how to work in that environment.” That’s one way of putting it. Another is that the president and his aides are inviting corruption. Conway's comments come on the heels of Nordstrom announcing it was dropping Ivanka Trump's clothing line. The #GrabYourWallet campaign, a boycott against Trump's products, says it is a major victory. (Jhaan Elker,Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Had any federal employee, including a Cabinet official, done what Trump did, he or she would have run afoul of federal ethics regulations, specifically, Title 5, Section 2635.702: An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. . . .  An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity. This is garden-variety corruption, of the type we deplore in kleptocratic regimes around the world. Likewise, if an American company consented to hire or do business with a foreign leader’s children in order to grease the skids for business dealings or avoid government retribution it would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As the Financial Times reported recently: JPMorgan has agreed to pay $264m to settle a US probe into its practice of hiring well-connected Chinese “princelings” to win business.  . . . “JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.” The White House (falsely) keeps insisting the president cannot have conflicts of interest, neglecting the Constitutional prohibition on receipt of monies from foreign governments. Nevertheless, Congress can and should close the gap in ethics laws given that this president refuses to divest himself of businesses and insists on using the power of his office (during the transition and currently) to benefit his family finances. Perhaps we need a presidential anti-corruption act that would make Title 5, Section 2635.702 applicable to the president and vice president. In any event, both Spicer’s derogatory comments (an attempt to “coerce”) and Kellyanne Conway, who directly hawked Ivanka’s line (“I fully — I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”), seem to run afoul of existing ethics laws and should be held accountable. There may be other legal avenues as well. Ethics guru Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution yesterday tweeted that there is a cause of action under California’s Unfair Competition law forbidding “any unfair business act.” Eisen told me this morning, “The law has long recognized that when someone makes untrue statements about a business, and those statements cause harm, a cause of action lies. As it happens, California, which has a lot of Nordstrom’s stores, has one of the most generous laws in the nation in allowing a business to respond when it is the victim of unfair treatment.” He adds, “Interestingly, that law also allows the California attorney general or other public officials to bring an action as well. Nordstrom’s says the president and Mr. Spicer’s  statements were not correct. . . . [T]his was a business decision that was made because Ivanka’s line was not selling, that there was nothing unfair or political about it.” Conveniently, former Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra is now California’s state attorney general.

At the same time, the Republican president, who made anti-Wall Street rhetoric a key part of his campaign message, began laying the groundwork to undo elements of the Dodd-Frank reform law. Don’t worry, though, because Trump has a perfectly clear rationale for his actions: “I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can’t borrow money. They just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” In other words, the president is targeting legal safeguards and layers of financial-industry accountability so that his friends can get more money. The comments were certainly candid. But they were also baffling. To the extent that reality matters, commercial lending is actually at record highs right now – even with Dodd-Frank safeguards in place – so it’s not altogether clear what the president is whining about. At the same White House event, Trump turned to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and said, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie.” If you voted for Trump because you thought he’d stand up to Wall Street, I’m afraid you were suckered. But perhaps most alarming of all is the potential impact of this administration’s vision as it relates to the finance industry. Vox’s Matt Yglesias had a good piece on this yesterday, noting that Trump seems determined to encourage Wall Street to engage in more risky lending. Weaker regulation, in other words, will let US-based banks gain more global market share relative to European or Japanese competitors. That’s great if you happen to be a bank shareholder or a bank executive, or have a yearly bonus pegged to bank share prices. But it has nothing to do with creating job opportunities for the long-term unemployed or increasing middle-class wages. There’s no great mystery as to how regulatory policy shaped primarily by the business interests of major banks ends – big profits, big bonuses, and eventually a big crash and a big bailout. But the genius of bank regulation as a policy area is that no matter how badly you screw it up, the odds are that on any given day, there won’t be a financial crisis anyway. A poorly supervised financial system can pile on egregious hidden risks for fun and profit and suffer no obvious bad consequences for years. If it happens to blow up in an election year, of course, you’re screwed. But while dramatic moves on immigration, health care, and budget policy are sure to provoke immediate blowback, on bank regulation, it’s entirely plausible that Trump will sow the seeds of destruction and nobody will notice until reelection is in the rearview mirror. The irony is, financial regulatory reform – which is to say, the safeguards Trump is eager to undo – has been quite effective. The system is more stable; the layers of accountability are preventing unnecessary riskiness; the markets have grown steadily; etc. I’ve heard compelling arguments that policymakers could make existing rules far stronger, but there’s no reason to turn back the clock to a pre-crash framework. Unless, that is, you’re a Republican president worried about your “friends” not having enough money. As for the politics, I think much of the talk about Trump facing a backlash because of betrayals of his campaign principles is probably overstated – his loyalists generally seem unconcerned with the president’s inconsistencies – but I think this is one of the few areas in which Trump and his team really are playing with electoral fire. He swore up and down for months that it was Hillary Clinton who’d do Wall Street’s bidding, while Americans could expect his administration to stand up to the finance industry and its lobbyists. Millions of voters actually believed he’d be “tough” on Wall Street. And now Trump is doing the exact opposite, creating serious economic risks, and doing the exact opposite of what many of his ardent supporters hoped for. The potential for serious consequences – economic and electoral – are real. Explore: The MaddowBlog, Donald Trump, Economy and Wall Street How Senator Strange made it from Alabama...

Kupiec Published February 07 2017, 8:00am EST More in Regulatory relief Basel Jeb Hensarling Print Email Reprints Share Share on Industry critics have charged that House Financial Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling’s regulatory reform bill, known as the Financial Choice Act, is a big-bank giveaway. But if that were true, why do signs point to big banks turning down the gift? In reality, Hensarling’s legislation has appeal for both those who want to unwind the Dodd-Frank Act – including Trump administration officials – and regulatory hawks who want to keep banks in check while protecting taxpayers from bailouts. The bill should be at the center of White House efforts to make financial regulation more efficient. It gives banks a choice: either continue under Dodd-Frank regulations or, alternatively, choose to maintain higher minimum capital – by meeting a higher “leverage ratio” of 10% – in return for being exempt from many Dodd-Frank regulations that are seen as overly burdensome and micromanaging bank operations. The Financial Choice Act, authored by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, lets banks opt for a tougher capital requirement in exchange for an exemption from Dodd-Frank Act regulations. The largest banks may decline that option. Bloomberg News But the hurdle for getting that regulatory relief is high, which explains why the largest banks are expected – should the bill be enacted – to choose the status quo of Dodd-Frank. A higher “leverage ratio” means banks cannot manipulate regulatory capital with complex risk weights. All instruments are viewed the same. Essentially, this means the largest banks would need to raise boatloads of new capital to meet the new test. The beauty of the Choice Act is it gives bankers the choice of which path to take; either way, the American taxpayers are protected. The core principle of bank regulation is to protect depositors and taxpayers from loss. Higher capital is a means toward this end. The more equity invested in a bank, the smaller the chance the bank will fail, and the less likely it could generate losses for depositors or taxpayers. Hensarling’s bill harnesses the idea that well-capitalized bankers shun imprudent risk-taking and should be allowed more latitude to manage themselves. A well-capitalized bank should be rewarded by removing the costs of complying with a host of unnecessary safety and soundness regulations. When a bank is required to maintain higher shareholder equity, the reduction in leverage changes its incentives. Bank managers naturally become focused on protecting their shareholders’ equity investment. A well-capitalized bank is likely to be a well-managed bank without micromanagement from bank regulators. Industry reactions suggest that the Choice Act would be popular among community banks, but is unlikely to appeal to all banks. Large banks have even expressed appreciation for Dodd-Frank. For example, a 2013 analyst report quoted JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as saying some Dodd-Frank provisions expand the “moat” that gives banks like his an advantage. That sentiment was echoed more recently by Jeremy Newell, the head of regulatory affairs and general counsel for The Clearing House Association, a trade organization for the largest, most complex banks. In testimony on the Choice Act in July, Newell said that certain Dodd-Frank provisions had fixed regulatory problems identified in the recent financial crisis, and that he supported a “pause before considering additional changes.” The comprehensive leverage ratio is not a risk-weighted capital rule—it treats all risky assets equally. A bank mortgage loan generates the same percentage capital requirement as a startup small-business loan. Critics argue that when equal weights apply to all bank assets, banks are encouraged to load up on risk. Their preferred alternative—the Basel risk-weighted capital measure—assigns a higher risk weight to bank assets that regulators deem to be higher-risk. While that is appealing in theory, there is no evidence that the Basel risk-weight approach is superior in practice. The Basel approach has many well-known shortcomings and indeed many believe that inaccurate Basel risk weightings were a chief cause of the subprime debacle and financial crisis. The risk-weight critique ignores the extra capital required by the Choice Act—twice the minimum bank capital required by Dodd-Frank regulations. Moreover, without Basel’s complex regulatory risk weights, banks that opt for the higher capital test of the Choice Act cannot hide risky exposures using modeling tricks or financial engineering to make risky assets appear safer than they are. Indeed, the Choice Act’s primary appeal is that it allows banks to choose higher capital to eliminate the need to pay legions of financial “experts” and former bank regulators to “optimize” a bank’s regulatory capital models. Bankers will be free to manage their own banks as they see fit. They can focus on lending and customer service, instead of on compliance with unnecessary complex regulatory rules. That said Hensarling’s bill could be still improved. If the Choice Act is to be successful, it must also include comprehensive reform of the process used by bank regulators to respond to undercapitalized institutions – known as “prompt corrective action.” PCA requires regulators to intervene and even close institutions when banks are operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. The Choice Act requires the Government Accountability Office to study possible PCA reforms, but it should go further and impose a new PCA standard synchronized with Hensarling’s bill. When a Choice Act bank falls below the 10% minimum leverage requirement, the September version of the House bill would reinstate required compliance with all Dodd-Frank rules. But imposing costly Dodd-Frank regulations on a weakened bank that can’t raise capital is only going to make consultants wealthy. The bill should be amended to include a PCA requirement for a supervisory rehabilitation plan should the capital of a Choice Act fall below a threshold set in law by Congress. The bill must also strengthen PCA bank closure rules to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and taxpayers against future losses. With a few minor but important adjustments, the Financial Choice Act is a regulatory solution that protects taxpayers but allows bankers to be bankers instead of compliance clerks. Paul H.

Minyanville SP 500 Valuation: Seems Reasonable Presently and Walking Up SP 500 Earnings Growth By Scutify Feb 09, 2017 8:42 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Seth Klarman, a well-known value investor in a recent letter to clients, talked about "perilously high valuations". In addition, we recently heard from Goldman Sachs on the downside of the so-called "Trump rally". Here is an article from Forbes, detailing some of the latest "bearish calls" on the US stock market, from a number of different perspectives. The following is a spreadsheet kept here at Trinity using JP Morgan's "Guide to the Market" statistics: JPMGTTMSP500Valmeasures Frequently, using "averages" can get you into trouble, but looking at the markets on a number of different valuation metrics, there doesn't seem to anything too alarming about the valuation of the current stock market. No doubt we can find pockets of overvaluation - you can still make a good case for the FANG stocks being overvalued, but that has been the case for some time. Seeking Alpha's website is loaded with negative stories and comments on Amazon and Tesla - both seemingly wildly overvalued stocks based on traditional metrics - although both are "disruptors" for sure in their respective spaces, and both stocks have demonstrated consumer appeal and consistent demand. (Amazon without question, while, with Tesla, a few questions remain.(Long AMZN in many accounts, TSLA in fewer accounts.) Look at the Treasury market: relative to long-term "real" (i.e. inflation-adjusted) rates of return, Treasuries have looked wildly overvalued, maybe the last 8 years, and certainly the last few years. Bond fund inflows totaled $163 billion in 2016, versus negative outflows in stock funds ? Analysis / conclusion: As years have gone by, more and more I put a premium on investor sentiment and looking at the AAII data here. Currently just 33% of individual investors (polled weekly by AAII) are now "bullish". The distribution is evenly divided by 1/3rd's, bullish, bearish and neutral. The hallmark of this bull market off the '09 lows is that the Street and individual investors tend to turn bearish very quickly, the Street has tended to underestimate SP 500 earnings strength (something that has worked fortuitously for this blog), and investors have become complacent about the risks in the bond market. To be sure this isn't a criticism of Seth Klarman or any other investor making a market call. If Seth is a "deep value" investor, his valuation metrics might have called the SP 500 overvalued in June of 2009. Doug Kass, the noted short-seller that writes for Jim Cramer's "TheStreet" would be negative for years, and then very, very right. Doug called the overvaluation in Technology in the late 1990's, and then went long in early 2003, but again looked to flip negative again in June, 2003, roughly 4 years and a few months ahead of the October, 2007, peak. The point is to readers, is that there is a constant stream of opinions on the market and stocks and bonds, put forth everyday to feed the beast that is the mainstream and financial media. The biggest failure - in my opinion- on the part of the individual investor or those "lay people" on Boards of endowments or public pension funds, is that they seem to think there is one person, (Bill Miller, Bill Gross, Peter Lynch, etc), or one firm (i.e. Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, etc.) or one style (growth, versus GARP, versus value, etc.) or one methodology (or one anything, really) that can succeed and deliver out-performance in all markets, but to readers, I say, there is no such beast. Patience and discipline are probably your best investing tools, and play "the long game". My own opinion on "market valuation" using the above JP Morgan valuation spreadsheet is that the SP 500 is simply "walking up" SP 500 earnings growth. There hasn't been too much "P.E expansion" in the last 3 years on the US stock market. The other opinion discussed with client's is that this is a relatively "controlled" bull market, and it is highly likely to continue, and by controlled I mean the complete absence of any real bullish sentiment. This US stock market rally has been hated for years. To conclude, these are just personal opinions, and readers should do your own thinking. A correction could hit the SP 500 at any time from an exogenous shock (or for any other reason really) but long-term investors should use that opportunity to allocate capital to the market. How fiscal policy and tax reform unfolds this year will be critical for the SP 500 in my opinion. That could/should be the next major market catalyst. Thanks for reading.
