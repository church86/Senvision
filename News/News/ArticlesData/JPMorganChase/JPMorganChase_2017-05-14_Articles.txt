 DIMON: 'Something went wrong, and the leaders collectively are responsible' Matt Turner May 9, 2017, 11:51 AM 4,898 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Jamie Dimon is worried about a lost generation.  The CEO and chairman of JPMorgan has spoken about a "national catastrophe" in education, and a generation that has been left behind. Business Insider spoke with Dimon on May 5, at the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the South Bronx, New York. JPMorgan Chase had just announced a $6 million investment in the Bronx as part of its $75 million New Skills for Youth initiative. We talked about education, the economy, and the Trump administration. We also discussed the level of anger at the global elite, fueling a rise in populism around the world. Here's what he had to say: Dimon: I kind of agree with it, when you leave people behind, and those people who are left behind, it's not their fault, it's the leaders of the institutions. There's always going to be an elite. You can have an elite in a communist society. It is the leaders, something went wrong, and the leaders collectively are responsible. There's some more terrible numbers — men, age 25 to 55, the labor-force participation rate is down 10%. That's unbelievable. There are 35,000 dying of opioids every year. Seventy percent of kids age 17 to 24 can't get into the US military because of health or education. Obesity, diabetes, reading and writing. Is that the society we wanted? No. We should be working on these things, acknowledge the flaws we have, and come up with solutions. Not Democrat. Not Republican. Not knee-jerk. Any good job is a good job. This whole concept of a dead-end job? It's not true. I've heard it my whole life. Jobs lead to dignity. If you're good at the first, then you can get the second. Jobs lead to household formation. Jobs are a better solution for society. The other part, the expanded earned-income tax credit, which can help the lower paid have more a living wage, which will lead them to do more. It will help small business. It won't help big business. More from Matt Turner: NOW WATCH: This animated map shows how religion spread across the world Loading video...

We have not really seen the market getting nervous." In a chat with ET Now, James E Glassman, MD, JPMorgan Chase & Co, says inflation is under control and so central banks are in a calm state. Edited excerpts: What is going to dictate the market moves because global as well as emerging markets seem to be getting in a bit of a consolidation/pause mode of late? It is interesting that while geo-politically there is volatility, the markets are pretty calm. Volatility is very low and it is not a mystery why the global economy is doing better and areas that have been on the weak side are picking up. Inflation is under control and so central banks are in a calm state. There is nothing to scare the markets. We have the Fed meeting coming up, Opec affirming production cutbacks and so maybe we will get some stability in oil markets. Nothing imminent is happening on the US political side which has been supporting the equity markets hoping for some more pro growth actions. But there is nothing disappointing yet and there is not a lot of political noise. So it helps the people to figure out where things are going but meanwhile the global economy is doing better. At the end of the day, that is what is driving the markets and why the volatility is so low. One basic reason why US markets have moved the way they have is because markets are anticipating some powerful reforms from the Trump administration and first 100 days so far we have not seen anything powerful or anything which could be called a big ticket reform. I wonder why markets are not getting nervous? Usually when you have political changing of the guard -- that is what happened in the US -- in any democracy, a big change in direction have always happened in the middle of really difficult economic times like a recession. The one thing that is different today is that the US economy is not in recession, it has actually recovered and that is why the central bank is talking about taking away interest rate accommodation. That means there is no immediate crisis to deal with. The real challenges are more structural and that is why the debate about healthcare reform, tax reform, and infrastructure spending are all focused on longer term issues. You are right there has been no sign of movement and some of these other issues that we are seeing, the peripheral issues are getting in the way but the market has a fair amount of tolerance. The people realise the political process is complicated and it is going to take time. There was a failure in the first attempt to try to get healthcare dealt with. The market has a lot more patience than you might think. We have not really seen the market getting nervous about these types of things and it might be that that rather than a specific initiative that we need, we just get a sense in the market that Washington has turned more pro growth whether it is referring to regulatory issues that the president has some control over and these other issues they keep telling us is going to happen, Though we know it is not imminent, as long as we have a belief that this might happen over the course of the next year or so, that will support the market.

X JP Morgan confirms new jobs on way in Dublin expansion US bank will buy a new property in the Dublin docklands to allow for expansion about 19 hours ago Updated: about 14 hours ago JP Morgan looks set to buy a 130,000sq ft development in the Capital Docks which has the capacity to hold more than 1,000 people. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire         JP Morgan has confirmed that it is to increase employment in Dublin, as it expands a key area of its business.. The bank’s head of investor services, James Kenny, told the Financial Times that it is to hire a “significant” number of people in Dublin for its custody and fund services businesses. JP Morgan already employs 500 people in Dublin and earlier this month the Irish Times reported sources as saying that it was set to expand here, with the creation of hundreds more back office posts. It has been widely reported that the bank is looking for new offices to house the increased staff numbers, including at the new Capital Docks development, managed by Kennedy Wilson, in the south docklands areas. JP Morgan looks set to buy a 130,000sq ft development in the Capital Docks which has the capacity to hold more than 1,000 people. Impact of Brexit on Ireland to be ‘negative and significant’ Tony Blair: Belfast Agreement may be changed over Brexit Banks considering Frankfurt move see office space setback The bank has previously said that it is looking at its options after Brexit, though it says that the Dublin plans are related more to the growth of its custody and fund service business. “Growth plans are driving our real estate plan,” Mr Kenny told the Financial Times, in an interview in Hong Kong this weekend. Flexible immigration policy Mr Kenny said JP Morgan’s impression is that some jobs can be “filled by people moving from other countries” because Ireland has a “very flexible immigration policy”. “The binding constraint in Ireland isn’t really around the supply of qualified people; it’s around infrastructure – the infrastructure in the city, the supply of housing . . . the capacity in the school system, the domestic transport infrastructure,” he said. JP Morgan indicated earlier this month that it wold shift jobs to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg as it prepares for the UK’s exit from the European Union. Sources told the Irish Times at the time that the group’s plans for Ireland, where it can trace its operations back to 1926, are focused on expanding existing back-office functions in Dublin, rather than adding front-office roles. JP Morgan Bank (Ireland) is mainly involved in providing administration and accounting services to hedge funds and mutual funds as well as treasury and cash management services to clients globally. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said before the Brexit referendum last June that the bank could move up to 4,000 of its 16,000 UK workforce in the event of voters opting to quit the EU. In January, he said the final number of job relocations could be higher.       Topics: Brexit James Kenny Jamie Dimon Kennedy Wilson Jp Morgan Bank  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Cyberattack: Workers told to be vigilant as they return to desks on Monday Work Reproduction was exhausting.

The city often conjured up images of dilapidated homes, abandoned lots and communities struggling with high unemployment and high crime. For too long, Detroit was viewed as a ghost town, a warning of what can happen when too many of a city's critical, interconnected elements go wrong.

Titan Brokerage: Ambit | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 441 Ambit believes that wedding jewellery will drive the company’s same store sales growth (SSSG), given the reduction in impact of demonetisation. It also said that jewellery business was in top gear, while margins lagged for the firm. The Return on Equity (RoE) will remain capped at 25 percent despite revenue CAGR of 17 percent over FY17-22. Its current valuation reflects 17 percent EPS CAGR over FY17-20 on low margin. Brokerage: Kotak | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 430 Kotak earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY18/19 go up 2-3 percent as it raised revenue assumptions sharply. EPS forecasts for FY18 and FY19 stand at Rs 12.4 and Rs 14.4. The brokerage also raised revenue estimates by 8-9 percent for FY18/19. It also cut margin forecasts to accommodate management’s aggressive growth-centric outlook. Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 555 CLSA believes that Titan is a strong play on urban discretionary consumption. The key risk to the stock remains to be the final rate under GST. While jewellery focus would be on growth, efforts will be to sustain current margin, the brokerage added. Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Call | Target: Rs 510 Current gold rates, GST rate of 5 percent and PAN limit reduction are the key risks to the stock. It raised FY18-19 EPS by 2/8 percent. Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 500 The global financial firm believes that the current valuation is discounting much of the optimism. A further acceleration in growth rates is a key upside risk to the stock. Meanwhile, higher GST rates, impacting demand, could be a key downside risk to the stock. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 550 Morgan Stanley said that Titan was its top pick in consumer discretionary space. It believes GST implementation, strong jewellery business could drive earnings ahead. On its March performance, it observed that 55 percent revenue growth in jewellery business was the key highlight for the firm. Customer acquisition of Tanishq will structurally drive growth trends higher. Yes Bank Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,920 CLSA observed that the bank’s annual report showed divergence in assessment of NPLs between the management and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in FY16. The bank’s stressed loan ratio rose from 1.6-3 percent, but is much lower than the sectors’ 13 percent. It is also scaling up its retail franchise with 16 percent branch growth and an employee growth of 34 percent. Meanwhile, losses in retail widened with investment and hence ramp up is the key. It sees 25 percent profit CAGR led by topline and steady credit costs over FY17-20. Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700 Deutsche Bank said that divergences as of March 2017 may lead to higher than expected NPL and credit costs in FY17. It does not see much risk to the earnings as FY16 divergence is already accounted. Nestle India Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Underweight | Target: Rs 5,700 The global financial service firm observed that Nestle India had an operationally weak quarter, but lower tax rates cushioned the earnings. It expects only a gradual recovery in revenue growth trends. It is underweight due to continuing weak growth trends across infant nutrition, coffee and chocolates. It reiterated its long held view that packaged foods in India may be nearing an inflection point. It also sees downside risks to valuation if volume growth across portfolio, including Maggi, lacks recovery. Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Underweight | Target: Rs 6,000 JPMorgan said that exports were impacted by lower sales to Nepal and Bhutan. Other operating income increased sharply due to timing differences of export incentives, it said in its report. Brokerage: Kotak | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 5,700 The brokerage has kept revenue and profit after tax (PAT) estimates for CY17-19 broadly unchanged. It continues to build aggressive assumptions into its model. The EPS estimates for the current and next calendar year stand at Rs 125 and Rs 150. Idea Brokerage: Kotak Kotak said that Volume surge in both voice and data with Jio in the backdrop is encouraging. Meanwhile, cost optimisation was the highlight of the quarter, it added. OBC Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 100 CLSA believes that an improvement in NPL coverage ratio to 38 percent QoQ was a key positive in Q4. It has lower earnings estimates for the current and next fiscal to build in a slightly lower topline and higher credit costs. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,280The brokerage house observed that there were signs of recovery in US launches and risk reward was favourable in the stock. It said that FY17 was the worst year in the company’s history with multiple challenges across businesses. It cut FY18/19 EPS by 17/9 percent. tags #Dr Reddys Laboratories #Stocks Views #Yes Bank Related news Business Yes Bank: How should investors be positioned now?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Country Garden Maintains Leading Position Worldwide with Sales of US$29.6 Billion in First 4 Months SHUNDE, China, May 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Chinese real estate developer Country Garden Holdings Company Limited (2007.HK) announced recently that, for the four months ended April 30, 2017, the company and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, achieved contracted sales of 204.2 billion yuan (approx. US$29.6 billion). The positive results allowed the company to maintain its leading position worldwide for this key indicator. The sales represent an aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of approximately 22.56 million square meters. A spokesman for Country Garden explained that the developer is committed to building affordable, quality housing, while the superior performance during the four-month period was mainly driven by the market and by the well-established reputation of the brand. Country Garden has defined 2017 as „the year of quality management”, explaining, by way of a metaphor, that the heart and soul of the dedicated craftsman goes into every brick that is laid. The company upgraded the standards applied to every step of the workflow and production chain, including site selection, the construction process, layout of the residential units and quality of the fixtures, not only offering a good home to families from different walks of life, but also providing comprehensive community support facilities and property services. The spokesperson disclosed that, during the four months, Country Garden followed all the guidelines issued by the Chinese government in terms of assuring buyers of reasonably priced accommodations and the market of a steady supply of new housing units. These actions contributed to the positive sales results. Country Garden’s growth has been reflected by the firm’s performance in the capital markets, with the market value climbing steadily to exceed HK$160 billion (approx. US$20.5 billion). JPMorgan said in its research report that the bank maintains an „Outperform” rating, in consideration of the developer’s „strong cash flow growth, a declining net gearing ratio, steady performance in the second half of 2016 and decreased financing activities”. JPMorgan noted that Country Garden is the only listed real estate company in China that continues to undertake large real estate projects in and around first- and second-tier cities, an approach that the bank considers as having low policy-related risks and is consistent with China’s new urbanization policy that is a part of the country’s economic development strategy as outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan. Country Garden is also one of the few real estate companies to have a well thought-out and reasonable incentive system, with headquarters trusting regional branches on land acquisitions, ensuring the profitability of projects.

Garden Holdings 14 May, 2017, 21:02 ET Share this article SHUNDE, China, May 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese real estate developer Country Garden Holdings Company Limited (2007.HK) announced recently that, for the four months ended April 30, 2017, the company and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, achieved contracted sales of 204.2 billion yuan (approx. US$29.6 billion). The positive results allowed the company to maintain its leading position worldwide for this key indicator. The sales represent an aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of approximately 22.56 million square meters. A spokesman for Country Garden explained that the developer is committed to building affordable, quality housing, while the superior performance during the four-month period was mainly driven by the market and by the well-established reputation of the brand. Country Garden has defined 2017 as "the year of quality management", explaining, by way of a metaphor, that the heart and soul of the dedicated craftsman goes into every brick that is laid. The company upgraded the standards applied to every step of the workflow and production chain, including site selection, the construction process, layout of the residential units and quality of the fixtures, not only offering a good home to families from different walks of life, but also providing comprehensive community support facilities and property services. The spokesperson disclosed that, during the four months, Country Garden followed all the guidelines issued by the Chinese government in terms of assuring buyers of reasonably priced accommodations and the market of a steady supply of new housing units. These actions contributed to the positive sales results. Country Garden's growth has been reflected by the firm's performance in the capital markets, with the market value climbing steadily to exceed HK$160 billion (approx. US$20.5 billion). JPMorgan said in its research report that the bank maintains an "Outperform" rating, in consideration of the developer's "strong cash flow growth, a declining net gearing ratio, steady performance in the second half of 2016 and decreased financing activities". JPMorgan noted that Country Garden is the only listed real estate company in China that continues to undertake large real estate projects in and around first- and second-tier cities, an approach that the bank considers as having low policy-related risks and is consistent with China's new urbanization policy that is a part of the country's economic development strategy as outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan. Country Garden is also one of the few real estate companies to have a well thought-out and reasonable incentive system, with headquarters trusting regional branches on land acquisitions, ensuring the profitability of projects. In addition, Nomura raised Country Garden's target price to HK$7.90 (approx. US$1) per share and expects its earnings growing by more than 30 per cent this year. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and other rating institutions also gave Country Garden a "Buy" rating.

James Kenny, JP Morgan’s head on investor services, was speaking to Financial Times this weekend as the bank – which already employs 500 people in Ireland – confirmed that it will hire a significant number of people in Ireland for its custody and fund services business over the next three years. Earlier this year the Irish Independent reported that JP Morgan was considering moving hundreds of staff from London to Capital Dock, the 31,600 sq m (340,000 sq ft) office scheme currently being developed by Kennedy Wilson in Dublin's docklands. The site could potentially house around 1,000 employees. Mr Kenny told the Financial Times that JP Morgan’s impression is that some jobs can be “filled by people moving from other countries” because Ireland has a “very flexible immigration policy”. “The binding constraint in Ireland isn’t really around the supply of qualified people; it’s around infrastructure — the infrastructure in the city, the supply of housing.....the capacity in the school system, the domestic transport infrastructure,” he said. Confirmation of JP Morgan's post-Brexit move will be welcomed, coming as it does in the wake of the decision by two major insurance companies, Lloyd's of London and AIG, to choose Brussels and Luxembourg instead of Dublin for their respective European Union bases. Prior to last June's referendum, J.P Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said as many as 4,000 employees could be relocated if Britain chose to leave. Next month Bank of China will open its first Irish branch in Dublin.

Courtesy Switch More than 1,000 contractors have had a hand in the Switch Pyramid campus in Gaines Township since legislation passed in December 2015 to bring the data center company to West Michigan. In the first 12 months of occupancy of the former Steelcase Pyramid, the company has spent more than $50 million to renovate the building into a Tier IV data center, said Adam Kramer, Switch’s executive vice president of strategy. Kramer also said 99 percent of the contractors who have had a hand in the building have been based in Michigan, tracked by driver’s licenses. The Business Journal toured the Switch facility last week with Kramer. The pyramid houses 225,000 square feet of data center space and the site eventually could house 1.8 million square feet. “You can see every dollar of it,” Kramer said. “It’s important that we’re hiring local to work on this job site.” Switch officially chose Grand Rapids for its East Coast data center when it received incentives from the state in December 2015 and promised a first-phase investment of $151 million and 103 jobs by 2021. The economic impact of the first 10 years is projected to be $5 billion and 1,000 jobs. A second 471,248-square-foot data center building has been approved by Gaines Township and will begin construction as soon as client demand calls for it, Kramer said. Switch, which opened its initial data center in Las Vegas in 2000, has been constructing daily since 2007. “Our timeline is to keep building, the internet doesn’t stop growing and neither does Switch,” he said. “We will continue to grow to fit the needs of our clients. Through good, through bad, Switch is always growing because the internet is.” Switch is in a state of perpetual growth. The company’s Las Vegas Core Campus has 2.4 million square feet of data center space, and the company recently opened its first facility in Tahoe Reno Citadel Campus, which is projected to be the world’s largest data center campus. Switch also recently opened data centers in Milan, Italy, and Bangkok, Thailand. The company is beginning to work on built-to-suit single tenant centers. There are multiple contracts pending or signed by Switch’s more than 1,000 clients to house data center servers within the Grand Rapids campus, Kramer said. Switch’s clients include government entities — including the state of Michigan — banks, movie production companies, video game companies and retailers. Notable clients include eBay, DreamWorks, Zappos, REI, MGM, HP, PayPal and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Switch provides the infrastructure for clients to store their servers and information. Tenants regularly upgrade their equipment and keep employees in the area to manage the servers. Companies also have located offices to Las Vegas to be near their data, as mentioned in previous Business Journal reports. Many existing clients have expressed interest in the company’s East Coast facility, and Kramer said new customers also are intrigued, despite the initial goal of supporting existing clients on the eastern side of the nation. “The reception of clients outside the state of Michigan has been just phenomenal, both our clients on the West Coast and East Coast, when we share with them why we chose Michigan, they’ve flown out here and fallen in love with it the same way we did,” he said. “We’re excited about the growth opportunities. We have attracted new clients as well because of the opportunity, including local companies waiting for a Tier IV environment in their backyard.” Switch has multiple partnerships in the works with Michigan companies, including a renewable energy initiative set to be released soon. Kramer confirmed a second year of its partnership with ArtPrize and talked about its workforce development with Grand Rapids Community College. The jobs would be related to Switch’s proprietary technologies relating to supporting the data centers, such as air conditioning and electrical systems. Switch has more than 260 patents for data center technologies and design. “We can start building a pipeline directly from the schools to working here at Switch on mission critical spaces,” he said. Kramer said Switch will open one of its Innevation Centers in the office floors or the pyramid, a collaborative workspace for the community. Kramer said Switch will be careful to collaborate and not step on toes of programs already offered in West Michigan in terms of economic development. Another community partnership was purely out of Switch founder and CEO Rob Roy’s commitment to karmic actions. A First Robotics Competition team from East Kentwood High School made it to the global competition but needed $13,000 to travel and didn’t have the funds. Kramer took the request to Roy, and the trip was financed. “They didn’t know if they’d get to go or not, these kids had worked so hard,” Kramer said. “The reason we love First Robotics is Rob really sees the next Rob Roy coming out of one of those teams. This building represents STEAM — science, technology, engineering, arts and math — First Robotics represents that same set of skills. “We don’t support it because we have to. We support it because we want to. We want to be part of this community, support the growth. We love West Michigan.” Pat Evans Pat Evans is a Grand Rapids Business Journal staff reporter who covers real estate, construction, architecture and design, retail, beverages, technology and county government.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Country Garden Maintains Leading Position Worldwide with Sales of US$29.6 Billion in First 4 Months SHUNDE, China, May 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Chinese real estate developer Country Garden Holdings Company Limited (2007.HK) announced recently that, for the four months ended April 30, 2017, the company and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, achieved contracted sales of 204.2 billion yuan (approx. US$29.6 billion). The positive results allowed the company to maintain its leading position worldwide for this key indicator. The sales represent an aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of approximately 22.56 million square meters. A spokesman for Country Garden explained that the developer is committed to building affordable, quality housing, while the superior performance during the four-month period was mainly driven by the market and by the well-established reputation of the brand. Country Garden has defined 2017 as "the year of quality management", explaining, by way of a metaphor, that the heart and soul of the dedicated craftsman goes into every brick that is laid. The company upgraded the standards applied to every step of the workflow and production chain, including site selection, the construction process, layout of the residential units and quality of the fixtures, not only offering a good home to families from different walks of life, but also providing comprehensive community support facilities and property services. The spokesperson disclosed that, during the four months, Country Garden followed all the guidelines issued by the Chinese government in terms of assuring buyers of reasonably priced accommodations and the market of a steady supply of new housing units. These actions contributed to the positive sales results. Country Garden's growth has been reflected by the firm's performance in the capital markets, with the market value climbing steadily to exceed HK$160 billion (approx. US$20.5 billion). JPMorgan said in its research report that the bank maintains an "Outperform" rating, in consideration of the developer's "strong cash flow growth, a declining net gearing ratio, steady performance in the second half of 2016 and decreased financing activities". JPMorgan noted that Country Garden is the only listed real estate company in China that continues to undertake large real estate projects in and around first- and second-tier cities, an approach that the bank considers as having low policy-related risks and is consistent with China's new urbanization policy that is a part of the country's economic development strategy as outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan. Country Garden is also one of the few real estate companies to have a well thought-out and reasonable incentive system, with headquarters trusting regional branches on land acquisitions, ensuring the profitability of projects. In addition, Nomura raised Country Garden's target price to HK$7.90 (approx. US$1) per share and expects its earnings growing by more than 30 per cent this year. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and other rating institutions also gave Country Garden a "Buy" rating.

Javier Garcia-Bernardo, The Conversation ,  Jan Fichtner, The Conversation  &  Eelke Heemskerk, The Conversation Published May 13, 2017.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYpCxXuF3M8 May 13, 2017.   Javier Garcia-Bernardo, The Conversation ,  Jan Fichtner, The Conversation  &  Eelke Heemskerk, The Conversation Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print A fundamental change is underway in stock market investing, and the spin-off effects are poised to dramatically impact corporate America. In the past, individuals and large institutions mostly invested in actively managed mutual funds, such as Fidelity, in which fund managers pick stocks with the aim of beating the market. But since the financial crisis of 2008, investors have shifted to index funds, which replicate established stock indices, such as the S&P 500. The magnitude of the change is astounding: from 2007 to 2016, actively managed funds have recorded outflows of roughly $1,200 billion, while index funds had inflows of over $1,400 billion. In the first quarter of 2017, index funds brought in more than $200 billion – the highest quarterly value on record. Democratising the market? This shift, arguably the biggest investment swing in history, is due in large part to index funds’ much lower costs. Actively managed funds analyse the market, and their managers are well paid for their labour. But the vast majority are not able to consistently beat the index. So why pay 1% to 2% in fees every year for active funds when index funds cost a 10th of that and deliver the same performance? Some observers have lauded this development as the “democratisation of investing”, because it has significantly lowered investor expenses. But other impacts of this seismic shift are far from democratising. One crucial difference between the active fund and the index fund industries is that the former is fragmented, consisting of hundreds of different asset managers, both small and large. The fast-growing index sector, on the other hand, is highly concentrated. It is dominated by just three giant American asset managers: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – what we call the Big Three. BlackRock’s Manhattan headquarters. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Lower fees aside, the rise of index funds has entailed a massive concentration of corporate ownership. Together, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have nearly $11 trillion in assets under management. That is more than all sovereign wealth funds combined and over three times the global hedge fund industry. In a recently published paper, our CORPNET research project comprehensively mapped the ownership of the Big Three. We found that the Big Three, taken together, have become the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the United States. Figure 1: Network of ownership by the Big Three in listed US firms. (See our paper for explanation of colours). Fichtner, Heemskerk & Garcia-Bernardo (2017) In 2015, these 1,600 American firms had combined revenues of about $9.1 trillion, a market capitalisation of more than $17 trillion, and employed more than 23.5 million people. In the S&P 500 – the benchmark index of America’s largest corporations – the situation is even more extreme. Together, the Big Three are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&P 500 firms, including Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, General Electric and Coca-Cola. This is the index in which most people invest. Figure 2: Statistics about the ownership of the Big Three in listed US firms. Fichtner, Heemskerk & Garcia-Bernardo (2017) The power of passive investors With corporate ownership comes shareholder power. BlackRock recently argued that legally it was not the “owner” of the shares it holds but rather that it acts as a kind of custodian for their investors. That’s a technicality for lawyers to sort. What is undeniable is that the Big Three do exert the voting rights attached to these shares. Therefore, they have to be perceived as de facto owners by corporate executives. These companies have, in fact, publicly declared that they seek to exert influence. William McNabb, chairman and chief executive officer of Vanguard, said in 2015, “In the past, some have mistakenly assumed that our predominantly passive management style suggests a passive attitude with respect to corporate governance. Nothing could be further from the truth.” When we analysed the voting behaviour of the Big Three, we found that they coordinate it through centralised corporate governance departments. This requires significant efforts because technically, the shares are held by many different individual funds. Hence, just three companies wield an enormous potential power over corporate America. Interestingly, though, we found that the Big Three vote for management in about 90% of all votes at annual general meetings, while mostly voting against proposals sponsored by shareholders (such as calls for independent board chairmen). One interpretation is that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are reluctant to exert their power over corporate America. Others question whether the Big Three really want this voting power, as they primarily seek to minimise costs. Play Corporate American monopoly What are the future consequences of the Big Three’s unprecedented common ownership position? Research is still nascent, but some economists are already arguing that this concentration of shareholder power could have negative effects on competition. Over the past decade, numerous US industries have become dominated by only a handful of companies, from aviation to banking. The Big Three – seen together – are virtually always the largest shareholder in the few competitors that remain in these sectors. This is the case for American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, as it is for the banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup. All of these corporations are part of the S&P 500, the index in which most people invest. Their chief executive officers are likely well aware that the Big Three are their firm’s dominant shareholder and would take that into account when making decisions. So, arguably, airlines have less incentive to lower prices because doing so would reduce overall returns for the Big Three, their common owner. In this way, the Big Three may be exerting a kind of emergent “structural power” over much of corporate America. Whether or not they sought to, the Big Three have accumulated extraordinary shareholder power, and they continue to do so. Index funds are a business of scale, which means that at this point competitors will find it very difficult to gain market shares. In many respects, the index fund boom is turning BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street into something resembling low-cost public utilities with a quasi-monopolistic position. Facing such a concentration of ownership and thus potential power, we can expect demands for increased regulatory scrutiny of corporate America’s new “de facto permanent governing board” to increase in coming years.

From June 1, the caps for construction finance will be cut to 40 percent of site value and 80 percent of construction cost, with the overall limit reduced to 50 percent of the expected value of completed properties. For developers with weaker finances, banks should consider deeper cuts, the monetary authority said in a statement Friday. Local institutions should set aside an adequate amount of capital for exposures to developers offering high loan-to-value mortgages, it said. Lending by some developers had been “inconsistent” with prudent practices, the HKMA said. Total mortgage loans by major developers amounted to HKD27.6 billion (USD3.5 billion) as of December 2016, up from HK$14.2 billion six months earlier, the HKMA said. Hong Kong’s property market, the world’s least affordable, has been on a tear despite attempts by the city’s leaders to cool prices in November by imposing additional taxes. Developers, which unlike banks aren’t subject to mortgage loan limits by the HKMA, have been increasingly aggressive in offering funding to buyers, prompting warnings from Hong Kong’s de facto central bank that risks are rising. Last month, the HKMA expressed concern about the riskiness of mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios issued by developers, as some analysts warned that property prices in the city are unsustainable. Analysts including Cusson Leung at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said that any external shocks could trigger tighter liquidity in the city’s banking system and increase home buyers’ borrowing costs. Prices of existing homes in Hong Kong have surged to records as buyer demand has remained brisk and developers have lured buyers with incentives and loan offers. Hong Kong’s secondary private residential property prices rose 0.5 percent in the week ended May 7, Centaline Property Agency said on its website Friday, bringing the increase this past year to more than 21 percent. The HKMA said Friday that some developers involved in recent land acquisition and development projects relied heavily on debt and banks financing them may in some cases face a “substantially higher level of credit and moral hazard risks.” Some real estate developers have been aggressively bidding for sites in Hong Kong, HKMA’s Deputy Chief Executive Arthur Yuen said in a briefing Friday. Some developers are using high leverage for financing and borrowing from different banks, he said. In one indication of heated competition for land, nine developers are bidding for a rare commercial project site in central Hong Kong on Murray Road, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.

X JP Morgan confirms new jobs on way in Dublin expansion US bank will buy a new property in the Dublin docklands to allow for expansion about 19 hours ago Updated: about 14 hours ago JP Morgan looks set to buy a 130,000sq ft development in the Capital Docks which has the capacity to hold more than 1,000 people. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire         JP Morgan has confirmed that it is to increase employment in Dublin, as it expands a key area of its business.. The bank’s head of investor services, James Kenny, told the Financial Times that it is to hire a “significant” number of people in Dublin for its custody and fund services businesses. JP Morgan already employs 500 people in Dublin and earlier this month the Irish Times reported sources as saying that it was set to expand here, with the creation of hundreds more back office posts. It has been widely reported that the bank is looking for new offices to house the increased staff numbers, including at the new Capital Docks development, managed by Kennedy Wilson, in the south docklands areas. JP Morgan looks set to buy a 130,000sq ft development in the Capital Docks which has the capacity to hold more than 1,000 people. Impact of Brexit on Ireland to be ‘negative and significant’ Tony Blair: Belfast Agreement may be changed over Brexit Banks considering Frankfurt move see office space setback The bank has previously said that it is looking at its options after Brexit, though it says that the Dublin plans are related more to the growth of its custody and fund service business. “Growth plans are driving our real estate plan,” Mr Kenny told the Financial Times, in an interview in Hong Kong this weekend. Flexible immigration policy Mr Kenny said JP Morgan’s impression is that some jobs can be “filled by people moving from other countries” because Ireland has a “very flexible immigration policy”. “The binding constraint in Ireland isn’t really around the supply of qualified people; it’s around infrastructure – the infrastructure in the city, the supply of housing . . . the capacity in the school system, the domestic transport infrastructure,” he said. JP Morgan indicated earlier this month that it wold shift jobs to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg as it prepares for the UK’s exit from the European Union. Sources told the Irish Times at the time that the group’s plans for Ireland, where it can trace its operations back to 1926, are focused on expanding existing back-office functions in Dublin, rather than adding front-office roles. JP Morgan Bank (Ireland) is mainly involved in providing administration and accounting services to hedge funds and mutual funds as well as treasury and cash management services to clients globally. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said before the Brexit referendum last June that the bank could move up to 4,000 of its 16,000 UK workforce in the event of voters opting to quit the EU. In January, he said the final number of job relocations could be higher.       Topics: Brexit James Kenny Jamie Dimon Kennedy Wilson Jp Morgan Bank  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Cyberattack: Workers told to be vigilant as they return to desks on Monday Work Reproduction was exhausting.

It will gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and return us to the Wild West days of the early 2000s where predatory lenders could prey on the elderly and the uneducated, knowing that there was no sheriff in town to stop ‘em. The subprime boom of the early 2000s has receded in memory the past 15 years, but a recent Supreme Court decision reminds us of what that kind of predatory behavior could look like. In Bank of America Corp. v. Miami this year, the court ruled that a municipality could sue financial institutions for violations of the Fair Housing Act arising from predatory lending. ADVERTISEMENT Miami alleged that the banks’ predatory lending led to a disproportionate increase in foreclosures and vacancies which decreased property tax revenues and increased the demand for municipal services. Miami alleged that those “‘predatory’ practices included, among others, excessively high interest rates, unjustified fees, teaser low-rate loans that overstated refinancing opportunities, large prepayment penalties, and — when default loomed — unjustified refusals to refinance or modify the loans.”   The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to address just those types of abusive practices. Dodd-Frank barred many of them from much of the mortgage market through its qualified mortgage and ability-to-repay rules. More importantly, Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was designed to be an independent regulator with broad authority to police financial institutions that engaged in all sorts of consumer credit transactions. The CFPB was the new sheriff in town. And like Wyatt Earp, it has been very effective at driving the bad guys out of Dodge. The Financial Choice Act would bring the abusive practices of the subprime boom back to life. The act would gut the CFPB. Among other things, it would make the Director removable at will, unlike other financial institution regulators. It would take away the CFPB’s supervisory function of large banks, credit unions and other consumer finance institutions. It would take away the CFPB’s power to address unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. It would restrict the CFPB from monitoring the mortgage market and thereby responding to rapidly developing abusive practices. The impacts on consumers will be immediate and harmful. The bad guys will know that the sheriff has been undercut by its masters, its guns loaded with blanks. The bad guys will re-enter the credit market with the sorts of products that brought about the subprime crisis: teaser rates that quickly morph into unaffordable payments, high costs and fees packed into credit products, and all sorts of terms that will result in exorbitant and unsustainable credit. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is the chief proponent of the Financial Choice Act. Hensarling claims that Dodd-Frank and the CFPB place massive burdens on consumer credit providers. That is not the case. Interest rates remain near all-time lows. Consumer credit markets have many providers. Credit availability has eased up significantly since the financial crisis One only needs to look at his top donors to see how the Financial Choice Act lines up with the interests of those consumer credit companies that are paying for his re-election campaign. These top donors include people affiliated to Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Capital One Financial, Discover Financial Services, and the American Bankers Association, among many others. Dodd-Frank implemented regulations that work very well in the consumer credit markets. It created a regulator, the CFPB, that has been very effective at keeping the bad guys out of those markets. The Financial Choice Act will seriously weaken the CFPB. When vulnerable consumers cry out for help, Hensarling would heave the CFPB over its saddle and let its horse slowly trot it out of town.

Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters A fundamental change is under way in stock market investing, and the spin-off effects are poised to dramatically impact corporate America. In the past, individuals and large institutions mostly invested in actively managed mutual funds, such as Fidelity, in which fund managers pick stocks with the aim of beating the market. But since the financial crisis of 2008, investors have shifted to index funds, which replicate established stock indices, such as the S&P 500. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The magnitude of the change is astounding: from 2007 to 2016, actively managed funds have recorded outflows of roughly US$1.2 trillion, while index funds had inflows of over US$1.4 trillion. In the first quarter of 2017, index funds brought in more than US$200 billion – the highest quarterly value on record. Democratizing the market? The Big Three. Photo: The Conversation This shift, arguably the biggest investment swing in history, is due in large part to index funds’ much lower costs. Actively managed funds analyse the market, and their managers are well paid for their labor. But the vast majority are not able to consistently beat the index. So why pay 1% to 2% in fees every year for active funds when index funds cost a tenth of that and deliver the same performance? Some observers have lauded this development as the “democratization of investing,” because it has significantly lowered investor expenses. But other impacts of this seismic shift are far from democratizing. One crucial difference between the active fund and the index fund industries is that the former is fragmented, consisting of hundreds of different asset managers both small and large. The fast-growing index sector, on the other hand, is highly concentrated. It is dominated by just three giant American asset managers: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – what we call the Big Three. Lower fees aside, the rise of index funds has entailed a massive concentration of corporate ownership. Together, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have nearly US$11 trillion in assets under management. That’s more than all sovereign wealth funds combined and over three times the global hedge fund industry. In a recently published paper, our CORPNET research project comprehensively mapped the ownership of the Big Three. We found that the Big Three, taken together, have become the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the United States. Network of ownership by the Big Three in listed US firms.

In the S&P 500 – the benchmark index of America’s largest corporations – the situation is even more extreme. Together, the Big Three are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&P 500 firms, including Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, General Electric and Coca-Cola. This is the index in which most people invest. Statistics about the ownership of the Big Three in listed US firms. Source: Fichtner, Heemskerk & Garcia-Bernardo (2017)   The power of passive investors With corporate ownership comes shareholder power. BlackRock recently argued that legally it was not the “owner” of the shares it holds but rather acts as a kind of custodian for their investors. That’s a technicality for lawyers to sort. What is undeniable is that the Big Three do exert the voting rights attached to these shares. Therefore, they have to be perceived as de facto owners by corporate executives. These companies have, in fact, publicly declared that they seek to exert influence. William McNabb, chairman and chief executive of Vanguard, said in 2015 that, “In the past, some have mistakenly assumed that our predominantly passive management style suggests a passive attitude with respect to corporate governance. Nothing could be further from the truth.” When we analyzed the voting behavior of the Big Three, we found that they coordinate it through centralized corporate governance departments. This requires significant efforts because technically the shares are held by many different individual funds. Hence, just three companies wield an enormous potential power over corporate America. Interestingly, though, we found that the Big Three vote for management in about 90% of all votes at annual general meetings, while mostly voting against proposals sponsored by shareholders (such as calls for independent board chairmen). One interpretation is that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are reluctant to exert their power over corporate America. Others question whether the Big Three really want this voting power, as they primarily seek to minimize costs.   Research is still nascent, but some economists are already arguing that this concentration of shareholder power could have negative effects on competition. Over the past decade, numerous US industries have become dominated by only a handful of companies, from aviation to banking. The Big Three – seen together – are virtually always the largest shareholder in the few competitors that remain in these sectors. This is the case for American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, as it is for the banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup. All of these corporations are part of the S&P 500, the index in which most people invest. Their CEOs are likely well aware that the Big Three are their firm’s dominant shareholder and would take that into account when making decisions. So, arguably, airlines have less incentive to lower prices because doing so would reduce overall returns for the Big Three, their common owner. In this way, the Big Three may be exerting a kind of emergent “structural power” over much of corporate America. Whether or not they sought to, the Big Three have accumulated extraordinary shareholder power, and they continue to do so. Index funds are a business of scale, which means that at this point competitors will find it very difficult to gain market shares. In many respects, the index fund boom is turning BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street into something resembling low-cost public utilities with a quasi-monopolistic position. Facing such a concentration of ownership and thus potential power, we can expect demands for increased regulatory scrutiny of corporate America’s new “de facto permanent governing board” to increase in coming years.

Dajani by hug digital Realty Bites Ahsen Ghufran Khan by Bayut Talking Tech Faisal Al Bannai by DarkMatter Yaashna Punia by Dubai American Academy / ALL EXPERTS France ‘En Marche’ but will the markets follow? May 14, 2017 12:14 pm More disruptive characters take to the political stage. Emmanuel Macron’s emphatic win in France’s presidential election brings a further new face to the global stage as voters still thrash around seeking solutions to their problem. Like Donald Trump, Macron has been a catalyst for a sharp rise in optimism – the French equity market is up nearly ten  per cent in barely three weeks. However, pending National Assembly elections in June may take away some of the excitement if Macron fails to muster a majority of like-minded deputies to support his policies. For the moment though enjoy the ride higher in European equities. Emmanuel Macron may have won the battle of the Presidential election, but few believe that is the end of the political war in France. The Presidential election has pitted two candidates who did not come from the mainstream parties, however it won’t be lost on the French population that Macron comes from the political elite. Whether he manages to carry the vote in the French National Assembly elections in June will be the acid test of whether the new President will have the support to carry a reform programme forward. Highlights of his policies €50bn of public investment plan for job training, shift to renewable energy infrastructure and urozonetion Cut in corporation tax and leeway for companies to re-negotiate the 35-hour working week Cut in jobless rate to 7 per cent from 9.7 per cent Reimbursement of full cost of glasses, dentures and hearing aids Ban on mobile use in schools for under-15s and €500 culture pass for 18 year-olds Although Macron may be reform-minded, there are many political commentators characterizing him as a French Donald Trump who will promise anything that people want buy and possibly fail to deliver. Today he has no sitting delegates in the National Assembly as his party was only formed some months ago. And even when he was the economy minister in Hollande’s government, he faced substantial opposition and at time violent protests against his attempts at labour market reforms. Having the backing of the National Assembly is crucial to Macron’s plans. Many a French government has travelled aimlessly when the President and Government are in what is called a ‘cohabitation’- in essence when the government and President come from different ends of the political spectrum. However, he faces some hurdles. While the established parties could not muster a credible candidate for President, they are likely to muster votes in the National Assembly elections in June. Macron has no sitting MPs and seems intent on luring existing MPs to his fold or bringing in candidates from other parties who have little or no political experience aligned candidates. For the record, a recent opinion poll by Opinonway projected that En Marche would win between 240-286 seats, the centre right Republicans and their allies 200-210, 15-25 for the National Front and the Socialist party support would drop to 28-43 seats from the current 280. However, opinion polls can be very misleading just after a Presidential election. Also, bear in mind that the French have sometime preferred to vote for a ‘cohabitation’ in order to keep the President-of-the-day in check. The election of Macron will provide a further near-term impetus to the European equity markets that have enjoyed a strong run of late. The MSCI Eurozone index has outperformed the global index by 7 per cent since mid-February, partly on stronger economic data and partly on the prospect of Macron’s election. The limit of that outperformance was probably the relative peak of early 2015, when the index was higher by ten  per centage points. However, that outperformance came after 30 per cent depreciation of the euro against the dollar allowing for a short term boost to corporate profits growth. On this occasion, the euro has been strong against the dollar, up 12 per cent since mid-2016. Hence a more likely target is a further 5 per cent gain taking the eurostoxx 50 back to its 2015 high of 3828. Technical analysts remain concerned that oil prices could be headed lower still, maybe towards $40. The oil price rebounded in the last trading session of the week, but appears to be still under downward pressure. WTI fell 6.3 per cent on the week after a rebound of 1.3 per cent late in the session on Friday. Both Brent and WTI touched levels not seen since November last year before OPEC reached an agreement to cut production. A decision by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to extend their production cuts may bring some stability to the market, but unless they collectively increase their target production cuts, it doesn’t seem that we will see an early marked recovery in oil prices. The ongoing added production from the US and the still-high inventories of oil are substantial challenges to the oil market. US oil production is up 10 per cent since mid-2016. US companies continue to add production rigs; last week a further six were added for the 16th week in a row despite the weakening oil price. The first quarter results by Continental Resources, one of the largest on-shore oil companies, only exemplified the challenge being laid down to OPEC. The company is nearly doubling its capital investment in 2017 compared to 2016 and expects to achieve 20 per cent annual production growth from 2018 to 2020. Just by way of an example to show how the efficiency of energy production is impacting the market and weighing down on energy prices more than had previously been expected, the EIA recently estimated that new well gas production in the United States increased by nearly 26 per cent in just the last year. The energy sector has underperformed by 15 per cent versus the global equity market index, a reflection of the weakness in the oil price. Meanwhile, BP has tripled its profits and Shell doubled its profits compared to the same period last year. Exxon, Chevron and Total also reported robust first quarter results.  Part of the problem is that despite the good results, analysts continue to cut their corporate profit forecasts. We believe that as long as the majors can defend their dividend payments, the stocks represent good long-term value at these levels. Cost cutting and improved productivity are ensuring that the oil majors can maintain their high dividend pay-outs. BP currently yields 6.8 per cent and Royal Dutch Shell 7.1 per cent. The lofty valuations of the technology sector are being offset by a strong pace of earnings growth. Earnings from the technology giants have been impressive last quarter with revenue growth of +20 per cent and earnings growth in the teens. Apple retains its position as the world’s most valuable company with the stock up 61 per cent over the last one year. Despite reporting an unexpected drop in iPhone unit sales in the March quarter, revenue grew 5 per cent.  Investors await the fate of the over quarter trillion dollars of cash with the company, with hopes of any tax amnesty ensuring further buybacks or investment in research. Apple, in line with President Trump’s policy of keeping jobs in America, also announced a new $1bn fund for US “advanced manufacturing”, signaling a change away from manufacturing overseas. Facebook’s revenues have increased by almost 50 per cent to $8bn in its first quarter, and the stock continues to perform, +26 per cent over one year, though the company has stated that advertising growth would slow down “meaningfully” in the second half of the year. Tesla’s market cap is greater than Ford and GM though it continues to make losses, however conviction in the shift to electric vehicles away from gasoline ensured a quick recovery in its share price after a sharp drop post announcement of results. The stock is up 43 per cent over one year. Technology companies need to maintain their strong growth for investors to keep faith with the tech-laden Nasdaq breaking records. Just eight technology companies account for almost 50 per cent of the S&P gains this year. The lower oil price is keeping GCC equity markets under downward pressure. The DFM index is technically in no-man’s land with a risk it falls back to the 3200 level from 3384 currently. The Saudi equity benchmark has maintained its trading range and looks well supported. The fall in the oil prices is providing a further challenge to those who expected inflation to become a problem this year. In this vein, the US April inflation data due to be reported this coming week will be one of the key data points for the markets. Last month inflation surprised to the downside, and core inflation was particularly weak. The market is expecting core inflation of 2.0 per cent unchanged from last month. In the US demand for inflation-linked bonds (TIPs) has remained weak particularly amongst retail investors who still don’t believe that inflation is about to take off even with the unemployment rate at a cyclical low. Indeed, in the most recent weekly mutual fund sales reports retail investors have been a net seller of TIPs. The implied levels of inflation priced into TIPs has slipped back to 2.05 per cent. In contrast to recent weak US economic data reports, the much-awaited US labour market release had supporting data for both the bulls and bears. The bulls will point to the better than expected headline jobs growth and the unemployment rate. The bears will point to the downward revisions to previous jobs growth numbers and the lower than expected wage growth. Wage inflation hit 2.5 per cent year-on-year compared to 2.7 per cent expected. Even if wage growth picks up, there are still limited signs that the US householder is willing to spend their money. US auto sales in April were below expectations. All of the major auto companies suffered significant falls in sales, down between 4 per cent and 7 per cent year-on-year. Inventories of cars have climbed to 70 days of sales compared to 55 two years ago. Consumers seem satiated on buying cars after the credit binge of buying cars on credit. Auto loans increased to an aggregate $1.2 trillion recently and have until very recently risen at a faster pace than any form of consumer credit. 25 per cent of auto loans are to subprime borrowers.  US auto stocks have been perennial underperformers versus the US equity market- that is likely to continue. China remains a concern for the markets particularly given increasing investor fears of a credit crunch. Much of the focus is on the shadow banking industry where the wealth management products have provided a significant share of corporate funding in recent years. JPMorgan estimates that these types of financial products account for US$4.2 trillion (over 30 per cent of GDP). The issuance of the WMPs is estimated to have recently fallen by 15 per cent year-on-year, hence leading to fears of a credit crunch. While larger Chinese banks face little in the way of a liquidity crisis the smaller regional banks could be challenged. Although any problem in the financial sector is probably manageable, were a crisis to occur in a dysfunctional way where the authorities struggle to take immediate control, the global asset markets could suffer. One only has to remember how fear gripped the financial markets in the first quarter of 2016, based on worries about China, to see that there could be a spike in volatility. Chinese equities are at a crucial technical support level with the possibility of 10 per cent downside. Of late, volumes in the equity market have been light. Hence, the markets appear to be waiting for further signals from the economic data to justify either a further sell-off or a rebound. Key data this coming week includes the inflation and money supply releases, plus aggregate financing data. Any sign of a more striking tightening of credit conditions could lead to a meaningful setback. Global credit markets were well bid amidst stronger US economic data towards the end of last week. The probability of another lift-off on US policy rates is nearing the 100 per cent mark for the June FOMC. The benchmark 10-year US government bond yields were well supported at 2.34 per cent post the strong payrolls data. The yield differential between the US and Germany 10 year bonds have fallen to 1.93 per cent from their recent high of 2.35 per cent. We expect this differential to mean revert in the long term towards its 1.23 per cent five-year average as ECB readies to taper in 2018 and normalize policy rates at the end of next year, given supportive macroeconomic trends in the Eurozone. We expect emerging market bonds as an asset class to continue to do well judging by the success of recent new issues. The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka returned to the debt capital markets by offering US$1.5bn of 10-year maturities priced at a yield of 6.20 per cent. Investor demand topped US$11bn with US investors accounting for 58 per cent of the book followed by Europe 22 per cent and Asia 20 per cent. The initial price guidance of 6.625 per cent was lowered to 6.20 per cent. We expect the new issue do well in the secondary market. The Republic of Turkey priced US$ 1.75bn of their 30-year bonds at a yield of 5.875 per cent after their initial price guidance of 6.125 per cent. In GCC bond markets, investors await the Sovereign Sukuk issuance by the Sultanate of Oman as well as from the Saudi Electricity Company. Gary Dugan is the Chief Investment Officer at Emirates NBD.

An article by Ben Tarnoff, technology writer for The Guardian, argues that capitalists and the culture of greed are actually killing America. Capitalists Hate Innovation His thesis is that capitalists shy away from innovation rather than embrace it. Innovation, he says, is too risky for those who are fixated on pleasing Wall Street to tolerate. Only the public sector can afford to make the investments needed in basic scientific research that lead to true innovation. “As the economist Mariana Mazzucato has shown, nearly every major innovation since the second world war has required a big push from the public sector, for an obvious reason: the public sector can afford to take risks that the private sector can’t,” Tarnoff writes. “It’s the government’s insulation from market forces that has historically made it such a successful innovator. It doesn’t have to compete, and it’s not at the mercy of investors demanding a share of its profits. “It’s also far more generous with the fruits of its scientific labor: no private company would ever be so foolish as to constantly give away innovations it has generated at enormous expense for free, but this is exactly what the government does. The dynamic should be familiar from the financial crisis: the taxpayer absorbs the risk, and the investor reaps the reward.” Following Tarnoff’s argument to its logical conclusion suggests the process should be restructured so that the government licenses the fruits of its basic research and reaps at least some of the rewards, which could then be plowed back into more basic research without asking taxpayers to foot the entire bill. Wealth Creation Begins With Governments Tarnoff smashes the myth that corporations are wealth creators. “From energy to pharma, from the shale gas boom to lucrative lifesaving drugs, public research has everywhere laid the foundation for private profit … The advances that created what we’ve come to call tech — the development of digital computing, the invention of the internet, the formation of Silicon Valley itself — were the result of sustained and substantial government investment. “Even the iPhone, that celebrated emblem of capitalist creativity, wouldn’t exist without buckets of government cash. Its core technologies, from the touch-screen display to GPS to Siri, all trace their roots to publicly funded research.” And yet, Apple is now sitting on a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash which it has cynically parked overseas to avoid paying taxes to the organization that is the primary source of that wealth — the US government. “Contrary to popular belief, entrepreneurs typically make terrible innovators. Left to its own devices, the private sector is far more likely to impede technological progress than to advance it. That’s because real innovation is very expensive to produce: it involves pouring extravagant sums of money into research projects that may fail, or at the very least may never yield a commercially viable product. In other words, it requires a lot of risk — something that, myth-making aside, capitalist firms have little appetite for.” The Harvard Business School Disease That “popular belief” has been fostered by America’s colleges and universities, principally Harvard Business School, alma mater to such capitalist heroes as Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. Business journalist Duff McDonald has just published a book entitled The Golden Passport which details how HBS, as it is fondly known to its alumni, has changed over the past 40 years from a place where business leaders are taught how to create wealth and benefit society to a place where they are taught to create wealth for themselves and their privileged colleagues. Edwin Gay, the school’s first dean, said business was the “activity of making things to sell at a profit — decently.” But since then, the school’s mission has been altered to something quite different and considerably darker. “The Harvard Business School became (and remains) so intoxicated with its own importance that it blithely assumed away one of the most important questions it could ask, which was whether the capitalist system it was uniquely positioned to help improve was designed properly for the long term,” McDonald writes. “With economic inequality at a hundred-year high and meaningful progress on climate change and other social and environmental issues embarrassingly paltry, the answer to that question is obvious. It is not.” McDonald goes on to deliver this most scathing assessment of the Harvard Business School, which he say teaches its students that “we’re all whores.” The logical extension of that is, “If everybody assumes you’re a whore, you might as well grab as much money as possible while you’re still in demand.” Ouch. Neoliberalism Is Bad For Human Beings And Other Living Things At its foundation, the current worldview of capitalists is embodied in what is known as “neoliberalism.” It is the engine that has driven the rise of globalization in which capitalism has metastasized from infecting not just the United States by the entire world community. “For decades, neoliberal politicians of both parties have promoted the notion that government should not only serve business, but operate like one,” Ben Tarnoff wrote in another Guardian piece published a month after the last election. “They’ve argued that public services should be privatized, or at least model the ‘efficiency’ of the private sector. They’ve claimed that business is the highest form of human endeavor, and that the role of the state is to empower and emulate it.” Donald Trump, the larger than life exponent of corporate power, swept away any hint of social responsibility as a legitimate objective of business when he was elected last November. Trump now gets taxpayers to pay for lavish weekly vacations at Trump owned properties. He sends his minions to China to con wealthy Asians into investing in Trump real estate ventures in exchange for preferential visas. Trump is using America to shill for his far flung commercial activities and his supporters are cheering him on, failing to see that every dollar his self-aggrandizing schemes put in his pocket means one less dollar left over for them. Trump’s policies will slash government investment in basic scientific research, which will seal America’s economic fate, argues Tarnoff. He decries the venture capitalist model that seeks to fund new companies so they can cash out in 3 to 5 years and claim enormous profits. He thinks true innovation needs a much longer timeline. His hero would probably be John Goodenough, the inveterate tinkerer and researcher who has devoted his entire life to perfecting the lithium ion battery. Without research, without exploring new ways to improve the human condition, whether or not they generate profits, income inequality will continue to grow. Like a snake eating its own tail, the American economy is devouring itself in a feeding frenzy that will leave nothing behind but empty wallets and broken dreams. Capitalists Eat Their Young “Capitalism prides itself on allocating resources well,” Tarnoff concudes. “If it creates inequality, its defenders argue, at least it also creates growth. Increasingly, that’s no longer the case. In its infinite wisdom, capitalism is eating itself alive. A saner system would recognize that innovation is too precious to leave to the private sector and that capitalism, like all utopian projects, works better in theory than in practice.” Source: The Guardian   Photo credit: YouTube   Check out our new 93-page EV report.

American shares make up more than half the global stock market. Since the beginning of 2016 their value has risen by almost 30pc, with around half of that rally occurring after the election of Donald Trump in November. A correction, regardless of what prompts it, would inevitably bring down all global markets, including London’s. The question on all investors’ minds is whether these prices are justified – or about to crumble. To begin with, take a look at what the numbers say. Measure one: Cape Cape, or the “cyclically adjusted price to earnings” ratio, compares average annual earnings over the past 10 years with share prices. It can be applied both to individual stocks and to whole markets. If a company’s share price is £10 and its average annual earnings per share over the past 10 years are £1, it would have a Cape value of 10. The higher the number, the higher the valuation. The Cape ratio for US shares stands at 29, compared with a 146-year average of 17 and a 50-year average of 20. The figures are from Robert Shiller, who devised the Cape ratio. For comparison, the UK market currently has a Cape value of 15. The Cape measure for US stocks has been higher only twice in more than a century: in December 1999, when it peaked at 44 at the height of the technology bubble; and in September 1929, just before the Wall Street crash, when it reached 33. In both of those cases the preceding rise was dramatic. Between September 1924 and September 1929 the Cape measure more than tripled from nine to 33. Between December 1994 and December 1999 it more than doubled from 20 to 44. By comparison, over the past five years the Cape has moved from 22 to 29. So while the US looks worryingly expensive, it has not experienced the explosive growth in valuation that preceded the two other crashes. Measure two: dividend yield Dividend yield is one of the simplest ways to value a market. The higher share prices are in relation to the dividend paid, the lower the yield and more expensive the market. This doesn’t necessarily hold true in those countries that do not tend to reward shareholders with dividends, but the US market contains a large number of consistent dividend payers. As of May 10, the S&P 500 index of the largest American companies had a yield of 2pc, according to data service Bloomberg. Since 1970 the S&P has averaged a yield of 2.9pc. But relative to more recent history 2pc does not look out of the ordinary and sits within the range it has been in since the global financial crisis. Measure three: price-to-earnings ratio A p/e ratio is a simple valuation measure. Like the “Cape”, it compares share price with annual earnings, but looks only at earnings over the previous 12 months. The S&P 500 index today is at a p/e of 21, compared with an average of 16 since 1954. Since that year it has been higher than today’s level four times. One was in 1987, preceding the Black Monday crash, while another was at the height of the dotcom bubble. On two other occasions, in 2009 and 1992, it was higher than today not because share prices were high but because earnings fell sharply. The rise in p/e this time round has been less dramatic, but the concern is that investors have “sleep-walked” into a valuation bubble without noticing. P/e ratios do need to be taken with a pinch of salt. The UK market is at a p/e of 35, according to Star Capital, an investment firm, thanks to temporarily weak earnings from the miners and oil companies that dominate the market. Does this add up to an 'inevitable' conclusion? Ultimately, market corrections happen when investors panic, so sentiment is another tool with which to gauge the potential for a crash. But it’s already negative. According to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch global fund manager survey from April, 83pc of professional investors believe that US shares are overvalued, a record. More revealingly, it said managers’ exposure to US shares had slumped to the lowest level since January 2008. Fund managers are holding significantly more cash than usual. So while the overwhelmingly negative sentiment from professional investors supports the idea of a correction, the fact that such a correction is anticipated and that cash has already been withdrawn suggests it may not, in fact, be so severe if it occurs. Not all measures of market support derive from share prices and earnings. The US unemployment rate is one measure that favours current valuations. There has been a strong relationship between unemployment data and the S&P 500 since the 1990s, according to Mike Bell, a strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. When US unemployment falls the market rises, and vice versa. Since the end of the financial crisis, unemployment has consistently dropped, and the S&P 500 has risen in line with the historic relationship. Mr Bell said: “In the most recent data, there are no signs of any trouble or change in direction of that trend, which could mean continued smooth sailing for shares.” Follow us for more investing ideas: @TelegraphInvest  For investment tips and ideas five days a week, read Questor Share this article Follow The Telegraph Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow The Telegraph Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Related Topics ISAs Shares Funds Share tips Dividends Show more Money latest 15 May 2017, 6:00am For sale: a show-off London home by Kanye West's interior designer for a cool £22.5 milion 14 May 2017, 7:23am 'Sky Q's erratic broadband disabled my smart home' 14 May 2017, 7:11am Tom Kerridge: ‘I’m a spender: I don’t have a single penny in a bank account’ Premium 14 May 2017, 6:38am 'Vodafone said I could return my phone - but then it wouldn't refund me' 14 May 2017, 6:27am 'Why did eBay side with the buyer when he returned my Apple MacBook?' 14 May 2017, 6:00am Property Doctors: what do I do about the damp in my walls?

'No Worries' At This Card-Free ATM Bank In the race to go Mobile - this bank just crossed the finished line in an epic way Wells Fargo is the first bank to hit card free options across all of their 13,000 ATMS in the US Maybe they understood that sometimes wallets get left behind, especially for us ladies who switch out purses on the daily because a pink sweater doesn't go with a brown bag Here's how Wells Fargo is doing it Download the app if you don't already have it. Request an 8 digit code from the app and enter that code into the ATM - you'll still need to enter the card's PIN - because it's 2017 and double security doesn't hurt anyone The code expires in 30 minutes so there's also less chances of fraud says Wells Fargo - Plus you still have to login to the app with your banking password - so triple check? Apparently other banks are following suit. The Chicago Tribune reports JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are testing out card free programs But still - do you ever really forget your first?
