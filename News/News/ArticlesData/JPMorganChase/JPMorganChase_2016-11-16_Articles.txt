(NYSE: JPM) has agreed to pay over $130 million to settle charges that it won business from clients and corruptly influenced government officials in the Asia-Pacific region by giving jobs and internships to their relatives and friends in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). As a result, JPMorgan also is expected to pay $72 million to the Justice Department and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for a total of more than $264 million in sanctions resulting from the firm’s referral hiring practices. According to the agency’s report, investment bankers at JPMorgan’s subsidiary in Asia created a client referral hiring program that bypassed the firm’s normal hiring process and rewarded job candidates referred by client executives and influential government officials with well-paying, career-building JPMorgan employment. During a seven-year period, JPMorgan hired roughly 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenues to JPMorgan. The SEC’s report found that JPMorgan violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. JPMorgan has agreed to pay $105.51 million in disgorgement plus $25.08 million in interest to settle the SEC’s case. The SEC considered the company’s remedial acts and its cooperation with the investigation when determining the settlement. Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division, commented: JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit. JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative. Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit, added: The misconduct was so blatant that JPMorgan investment bankers created ‘Referral Hires vs Revenue’ spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs.  The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied. Shares of JPMorgan were last trading up 1% at $78.25, with a consensus analyst price target of $74.24 and a 52-week trading range of $52.50 to $80.44.

The multinational bank, now the world's largest by market capitalisation, admitted to taking in more than US$100 million after hiring candidates referred by clients, including by senior Chinese officials in positions to steer business to the bank. Despite the announcement, shares in the JP Morgan were trading higher on Thursday afternoon, up 0.6 per cent shortly after 2000 GMT (4am Singapore time) in New York. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Mr Leslie Caldwell, chief of the US Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. The case drew attention for its focus on the use of hiring as a form of bribery. Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, JP Morgan Chase hired nearly 100 employees and interns referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, officials said. Despite the large settlement, Mr Bart Naylor of policy watchdog group Public Citizen, complained that the bank "has escaped true accountability". "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery'," he said in a statement. Officials at a regional subsidiary in Hong Kong created a client job referral programme sometimes known internally as the 'Sons and Daughters Program' to hire candidates of strategic value to the bank, according to the Justice Department. By 2009, senior executives had refined the programme to seek candidates with "directly attributable linkage to business opportunity", federal prosecutors said, citing internal JP Morgan Chase records. In one example, JP Morgan won a leading role in the initial public offering for an unnamed state-owned Chinese company after hiring a candidate who bank executives knew was unqualified, for a job in New York. The candidate had been referred in 2009 by a senior Chinese official who promised the business in return for the hire. Candidates hired in this programme typically received salaries equivalent to entry-level investment bankers despite performing mainly minor tasks such as proof-reading, according to the Justice Department. Authorities brought no criminal charges against the bank as part of the settlement and took no enforcement action against individuals. However, a JP Morgan Chase subsidiary in Hong Kong fired six employees and disciplined 23 others for their roles in the misconduct, the Justice Department said. In the settlement, JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay US$134 million in fines to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve, as well as another US$130 million in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1977, the United States has criminalised the practice bribing foreign officials to win business under a Watergate-era statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws but none enforces it as aggressively as the United States. US enforcement of the law has broadened in recent years, with authorities in Washington extending their reach to more industries and scrutinising a greater range of business practices for corruption.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. ___ America’s shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America’s shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week’s Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara’s office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen’s testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap’s third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap’s third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 per cent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favouring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don’t stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan’s Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person’s qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 per cent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 per cent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 per cent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon’s AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump’s accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times “is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena.'” The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 per cent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen’s term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

(REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay US$264 million to settle a foreign bribery case dubbed the "princelings case" in which the bank gave prized jobs to friends and relatives of Chinese officials, US officials announced on Thursday (Nov 17). The multinational bank, now the world's largest by market capitalisation, admitted to taking in more than US$100 million after hiring candidates referred by clients, including by senior Chinese officials in positions to steer business to the bank. Despite the announcement, shares in the JP Morgan were trading higher on Thursday afternoon, up 0.6 per cent shortly after 2000 GMT in New York. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Leslie Caldwell, chief of the US Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. The case drew attention for its focus on the use of hiring as a form of bribery. Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, JP Morgan Chase hired nearly 100 employees and interns referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, officials said. Despite the large settlement, Bart Naylor of policy watchdog group Public Citizen, complained that the bank "has escaped true accountability" "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,'" he said in a statement. 'SONS AND DAUGHTERS PROGRAMME' Officials at a regional subsidiary in Hong Kong created a client job referral program sometimes known internally as the "Sons and Daughters Programme" to hire candidates of strategic value to the bank, according to the Justice Department. By 2009, senior executives had refined the program to seek candidates with "directly attributable linkage to business opportunity," federal prosecutors said, citing internal JP Morgan Chase records. In one example, JP Morgan won a leading role in the initial public offering for an unnamed state-owned Chinese company after hiring a candidate who bank executives knew was unqualified, for a job in New York. The candidate had been referred in 2009 by a senior Chinese official who promised the business in return for the hire. Candidates hired in this program typically received salaries equivalent to entry-level investment bankers despite performing mainly minor tasks such as proof-reeding, according to the Justice Department. NO CRIMINAL CHARGES Authorities brought no criminal charges against the bank as part of the settlement and took no enforcement action against individuals. However, a JP Morgan Chase subsidiary in Hong Kong fired six employees and disciplined 23 others for their roles in the misconduct, the Justice Department said. In the settlement, JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay US$134 million in fines to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve, as well as another US$130 million in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1977, the United States has criminalised the practice bribing foreign officials to win business under a Watergate-era statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws but none enforces it as aggressively as the United States. US enforcement of the law has broadened in recent years, with authorities in Washington extending their reach to more industries and scrutinising a greater range of business practices for corruption. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Authorities now describe it as "corruption, plain and simple." JPMorgan Chase (JPM) improperly hired the "unqualified" children of China's ruling elite to win lucrative business from the country's key decision makers, authorities alleged on Thursday. Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank "corruptly influenced government officials" with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

"JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials ... who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China's ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as "Sons and Daughters." The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals.

The SEC and Justice Department had been investigating over several years whether some of JPMorgan's hiring efforts involved bribes, in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive $130 million of the settlement, with $72 million going to Justice and $61.9 million to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which penalized the bank "for unsafe and unsound practices." JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of "princelings," as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks, including HSBC and Goldman Sachs, have said their hiring practices in Asia were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: "The conduct was unacceptable." The hiring program was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said. Authorities said JPMorgan's Asia unit created an elaborate program, called "Sons and Daughters," that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan's normal recruitment practices, the SEC said. Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients, as well as Chinese officials at state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than $100 million in revenue, the SEC said. For example, in urging the hiring of one candidate, a JPMorgan banker said, "It will strengthen our relationship" with a client and solidify "our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >$500mm in offering size," according to SEC's order. Quid pro quo business arrangements remain an entrenched part of business culture in China that is very hard to avoid, said Alex Bourelly, who leads the SEC enforcement practice at the law firm Baker Botts LLP. Local staff members who have many government contacts know they can be quickly hired elsewhere if they are caught and fired for making improper payments, Bourelly said. "U.S. law has its limits in terms of how it can affect the behavior of people around the world," he said.

Authorities now describe it as "corruption, plain and simple." JPMorgan Chase (JPM) improperly hired the "unqualified" children of China's ruling elite to win lucrative business from the country's key decision makers, authorities alleged on Thursday. Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank "corruptly influenced government officials" with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving "anything of value" to win business from foreign officials. "JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials ... who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China's ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as "Sons and Daughters." The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals. "The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it "corruption, plain and simple." Related: Wells Fargo account openings plunge 44% Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities. These jobs scored JPMorgan more than $100 million in business. JPMorgan admitted to authorities that individuals hired during the scheme were given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. That's despite the fact that, according to the DOJ, they mostly focused on routine work such as "proofreading" and generated little actual business. JPMorgan's $264 million in fines is being divided up among multiple government agencies. The bank has agreed to pay more than $130 million to the SEC, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Despite the "blatant" conduct alleged by authorities, the U.S. did not announce any criminal charges against JPMorgan itself nor any individual employees of the bank. In a statement, JPMorgan said the hiring practices were "unacceptable" and the program was stopped in 2013. The bank said it took "action" against the individuals involved and has since improved its hiring procedures. JPMorgan also said in a filing that it continues to cooperate on other related investigations that are "ongoing." The SEC said it continues to investigate the issue. Authorities say the hirings were quid pro quo arrangements expressly made with the intent to win business. For instance, the DOJ said that in late 2009 a Chinese official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan would play in an upcoming IPO of a Chinese state-owned company. JPMorgan then spent months trying to place the candidate in a New York investment banking position -- despite realizing he was not qualified. The SEC said JPMorgan's internal controls were "so weak" that not one of these hiring requests was denied.

It's also the latest black eye for Wall Street and big banks. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo (WFC) outraged Americans by saying it fired 5,300 employees for creating as many as 2 million fake accounts. The scandal dealt a blow to Wells Fargo's reputation and resulted in the sudden retirement of longtime CEO John Stumpf. JPMorgan itself has also been in trouble in recent years. In 2013, JPMorgan paid $5.1 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac linked to misdeeds in the run up to the housing bubble. JPMorgan was also hit with a $1 billion fine for improper oversight that led to the London Whale trading debacle. Regulators worry the misbehavior among bankers is causing a credibility problem for the industry. "Deep-seated cultural and ethical problems," New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley recently warned," have "eroded the industry's trustworthiness."

 'BLINK BLINK, NOD NOD': Highlights from the JPMorgan bribery case Portia Crowe Nov. 17, 2016, 1:10 PM 8,028 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Neil Hall JPMorgan on Thursday agreed to pay more than $264 million to US authorities to settle charges that it bribed officials in the Asia-Pacific region to win business, ending a nearly three-year investigation. The charges alleged that JPMorgan gave jobs and internships to friends and family of corrupt government officials, which would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. "During a seven-year period, JPMorgan hired approximately 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenues to JPMorgan," the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote in a press release. Following the announcement, the SEC released documents used to argue its case.

(JPMC), agreed to pay a $72 million penalty for its role in a scheme to corruptly gain advantages in winning banking deals by awarding prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI’s New York Field Office made the announcement.  “The so-called Sons and Daughters Program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.  “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple.  This case demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to uncovering corruption no matter the form of the scheme.” “U.S. businesses cannot lawfully seek to gain a business advantage by corruptly influencing foreign government officials,” said U.S. Attorney Capers.  “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense.  In this case, JPMorgan employees designed a program to hire otherwise unqualified candidates for prestigious investment banking jobs solely because these candidates were referred to the bank by officials in positions to award business to the bank.  In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business.  This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” “Creating a barter system in which jobs are awarded to applicants in exchange for lucrative business deals is a corrupt scheme in and of itself,” said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney.  “But when foreign officials are among those involved in the bribe, the international free market system and our national security are among the major threats we face.  Those engaging in these illegal acts abroad may think they're out of sight and out of mind, but they're wrong.  The FBI has recently established three dedicated international corruption squads to combat this type of quid pro quo, and we'll use all resources at our disposal to uncover and put an end to these crimes.” According to JPMorgan APAC’s admissions, beginning in 2006, senior Hong Kong-based investment bankers set up and used a “client referral program,” also referred to as the “Sons and Daughters Program,” to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials.  The Sons and Daughters Program was used as a means to influence those same officials to award investment deals to JPMorgan APAC.  By late 2009, JPMorgan APAC executives and senior bankers revamped the client referral program to improve its efficacy by prioritizing those hires linked to upcoming client transactions.  In order to be hired, a referred candidate had to have a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.”  According to admissions made in connection with the resolution, these quid pro quo arrangements were discussed internally among JPMorgan APAC bankers.  For example, in late 2009, a Chinese government official communicated to a senior JPMorgan APAC banker that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan APAC would receive in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) for a Chinese state-owned company.  The banker communicated this message to several senior colleagues, who then spent several months trying to place the referred candidate in an investment banking position in New York.  Despite learning from personnel in New York that this referred candidate was not qualified for an investment banking position, senior JPMorgan APAC bankers created a new position for the candidate in New York, and JPMorgan APAC thereafter obtained a leading role in the IPO.  Further, JPMorgan APAC employees misused compliance questionnaires to justify and paper over corrupt business arrangements.  Employees also used a template with pre-filled answers, including that there was “no expected benefit” from the hire, and compliance personnel drafted and modified questionnaires that failed to state the true purpose of the hire. JPMorgan APAC further admitted that candidates hired during the scheme were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers, despite the fact that many of these hires performed ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product.  The corrupt scheme netted JPMorgan APAC at least $35 million in profits from business mandates with Chinese state-owned companies.  JPMorgan APAC entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $72 million to resolve the matter.  As part of the agreement, JPMorgan APAC has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program, and to report to the department on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program. The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that JPMorgan APAC did not voluntarily and timely disclose the conduct at issue.  However, JPMorgan APAC did receive full credit for its and JPMC’s cooperation with the criminal investigation, including conducting a thorough internal investigation, making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States and producing documents to the government from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws.  JPMorgan APAC also took significant employment action against six employees who participated in the misconduct resulting in their departure from the bank, and it disciplined an additional 23 employees who, although not involved in the misconduct, failed to effectively detect the misconduct or supervise those engaged in it.  JPMorgan APAC imposed more than $18.3 million in financial sanctions on former or current employees in connection with the remediation efforts.  Based on these actions and other considerations, the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 25 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range.  In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against JPMC, whereby JPMC agreed to pay $130.5 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest.  The Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors also issued a consent cease-and-desist order and assessed a $61.9 million civil penalty. Thus, the combined U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties paid by JPMC and its Hong Kong subsidiary are approximately $264.4 million.  The FBI’s New York Field Office investigated the case.  The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in this matter.  Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorneys James P. McDonald and Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney James P. Loonam of the Eastern District of New York’s Business and Securities Fraud Section prosecuted the case.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.  Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.   Download JPMorgan Securities Asia Pacific NPA     Back to List Publications Handbook Online Exchange Handbook Trading Places World Exchanges Media & Resources Press Events News FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index Glossary Acronyms White Papers Twitter Legal and About Us About Mondo Visione Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Cookies Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap © Mondo Visione 2016 About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Careers Sitemap Back to Top News RSS Site by Red Ant

By Roger Baird November 17, 2016 16:51 GMT The investigation has sent shockwaves around international banks, because hiring well-connected people for finance jobs is common in ChinaReuters US bank JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay $264m (£212m) to regulators to settle claims it hired the children of well-connected top Chinese officials to win business. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department launched an investigation in 2013, into the employment of what has been called "princelings". The regulators said during a seven-year period the bank hired approximately 100 interns and full-time employees "at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100m in revenues to JPMorgan". The bank's behaviour contravened the 1977 US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which bans firms from paying bribes to overseas officials to win business. Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division said: "JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit. "JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative." The investigation has sent shockwaves around international banks, because hiring well-connected people for finance jobs is common in China, where there is a strong emphasis on guanxi, or personal contacts, in doing business. Further probes The bank will pay the SEC $130m for violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is also expected to pay $72m to the US Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. JPMorgan engaged in the scheme, which it called the Sons and Daughters Programme, from 2006 until at least 2012, investigators said. Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's FCPA Unit, added: "The misconduct was so blatant that JPMorgan investment bankers created 'Referral Hires vs Revenue' spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs. "The firm's internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied." The Justice Department is understood to be still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they hired relatives of key Chinese officials to win business by gaining influence.

The multinational bank, now the world's largest by market capitalization, admitted to taking in more than $100 million after hiring candidates referred by clients, including by senior Chinese officials in positions to steer business to the bank. Despite the announcement, shares in the JP Morgan were trading higher Thursday afternoon, up 0.6 percent shortly after 2000 GMT in New York. The headquarters of JP Morgan Chase in New York ©Spencer Platt (Getty/AFP/File) "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Leslie Caldwell, chief of the US Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. The case drew attention for its focus on the use of hiring as a form of bribery. Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, JP Morgan Chase hired nearly 100 employees and interns referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, officials said. Despite the large settlement, Bart Naylor of policy watchdog group Public Citizen, complained that the bank "has escaped true accountability" "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,'" he said in a statement. - 'Sons and Daughters Program' - Officials at a regional subsidiary in Hong Kong created a client job referral program sometimes known internally as the "Sons and Daughters Program" to hire candidates of strategic value to the bank, according to the Justice Department. By 2009, senior executives had refined the program to seek candidates with "directly attributable linkage to business opportunity," federal prosecutors said, citing internal JP Morgan Chase records. In one example, JP Morgan won a leading role in the initial public offering for an unnamed state-owned Chinese company after hiring a candidate who bank executives knew was unqualified, for a job in New York. The candidate had been referred in 2009 by a senior Chinese official who promised the business in return for the hire. Candidates hired in this program typically received salaries equivalent to entry-level investment bankers despite performing mainly minor tasks such as proof-reeding, according to the Justice Department. - No criminal charges - Authorities brought no criminal charges against the bank as part of the settlement and took no enforcement action against individuals. However, a JP Morgan Chase subsidiary in Hong Kong fired six employees and disciplined 23 others for their roles in the misconduct, the Justice Department said. In the settlement, JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay $134 million in fines to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve, as well as another $130 million in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1977, the United States has criminalized the practice bribing foreign officials to win business under a Watergate-era statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws but none enforces it as aggressively as the United States. US enforcement of the law has broadened in recent years, with authorities in Washington extending their reach to more industries and scrutinizing a greater range of business practices for corruption.

Photo: Reuters JPMorgan Chase & Co will pay more than US$250 million to settle allegations by the US government that it had hired children of Chinese decisionmakers to win business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The bank will pay roughly US$200 million combined to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice, and more than US$50 million to the US Federal Reserve, the source said. There will not be any individual prosecution at this time, the source said. The SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring. The justice department opened a parallel investigation around the same time. Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China’s politically connected. While close ties to top government officials are a boon to any banking franchise across the world, they are especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions. The SEC, JPMorgan and the justice department declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank’s hires violated US anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said. Meanwhile, conflicting information on whether JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon could become US secretary of the treasury as part of US president-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet cast a cloud of uncertainty over the nation’s largest bank. Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job, but initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would “get” the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Thursday last week. Dimon declined to comment through a representative. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Tuesday last week, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting scheduled for yesterday, where a decision was to be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump’s campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune later reported that Dimon has already said no. This story has been viewed 1055 times.

X JPMorgan to pay $200m fine for hiring Chinese ‘princelings’ Settlement is the first to emerge from SEC inquiry into bribes paid to overseas officials Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 12:55 JPMorgan: The SEC’s investigation has widened to include other banks. Photograph: iStock         JPMorgan has agreed to pay a fine of more than $200 million (€186 million) to settle a US investigation into its employment of well-connected Chinese “princelings” to win business, sources say. The settlement, expected to be announced on Thursday, would be the first to arise from a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry launched in 2013 to determine whether bank hiring practices breached the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The 1977 law bans companies from paying bribes to overseas officials to win business. The investigation sent shivers around the global banking community because hiring well-connected people for financial jobs is common in China where there is a strong emphasis on guanxi, or personal connections, in doing business. Princelings are technically the children of high-ranking Communist party officials, but the term is often generally applied to the sons and daughters of China’s elite. JPMorgan had made several high-profile hires, including Gao Jue, son of a Chinese commerce minister, later employed by Goldman Sachs, and Tang Xiaoning, son of a former bank regulator, who went on to chair Everbright Group. Other banks The investigation into JPMorgan soon widened to include other banks. Earlier this year, HSBC said it was one of several under investigation. Others to have been contacted by the regulator include Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The US inquiry has coincided with a Chinese crackdown on corruption, adding to the pressure on western investment banks struggling in Asia with slowing economies and lower fees than they earn elsewhere. Since 2013, many banks have shifted away from promoting well-connected “rainmakers” to lead their mainland businesses in favour of lower-profile leaders. They have also de-emphasised forging strong connections with senior officials. Churn among JPMorgan’s top ranks in the wake of the SEC probe saw Fang Fang step down as China investment banking head in 2014 and Todd Marin as vice-chairman of the its Asia investment bank last year. ADVERTISEMENT As a result of the US investigation, the bank stepped away from various deals, including the public floats of Tianhe Chemical and Everbright Bank, because it was connected with the children of the chairmen of both groups. Joyce Wei, daughter of Tianhe chairman Wei Qi, worked at JPMorgan from January 2012-August 2013, according to the Hong Kong regulator’s register of authorised finance professionals. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Fang Fang Gao Jue Tang Xiaoning Todd Marin Wei Joyce Wei Qi Exchange Commission SEC Securities and Exchange Commission Citigroup Deutsche Bank Everbright Bank Everbright Group Goldman Sachs Group HSBC JPMorgan Morgan Stanley Tianhe Chemical China Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Irish News Gay Byrne to miss radio show over cancer concerns Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Sponsored Maia Dunphy: Let’s talk about fertility Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hammond says UK budget is constrained by high debt 17:31 Seen and Heard: Facebook secures payments services licence 16:59 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 16:48 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 14:58 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 14:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 2 Central Bank set to ease mortgage lending rules 3 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 4 Paul Krugman: Is there a Trump slump coming? 5 Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns 6 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 7 May’s changing vocabulary signals shift from ‘hard Brexit’ 8 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 9 Public sector pay rises?

Jamie Dimon would be "very good" for the U.S. as Treasury Secretary, but potentially losing him would be a blow to JPMorgan JPMtrue, Colm Kelleher, president of rival bank Morgan Stanley MStrue, told CNBC. Kelleher also said that it was "encouraging that the Trump transition team had made "practical" appointments, calling Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus a "wise choice" as chief of staff. On the other candidates reported to be in the running the role of treasury secretary in President-elect Donald Trump 's administration, Kelleher said that he did not know former Goldman Sachs GStrue banker Steven Mnuchin but added that Mnuchin was "qualified" and that "people (spoke) highly of him." There were conflicting news reports on Wednesday over whether Dimon, a Wall Street veteran who led JPMorgan through the global financial crisis, was a candidate for treasury secretary. Fox anchor Maria Bartiromo tweeted that Dimon would "get" the job and Fox Business News reporters tweeted that Dimon was one of the candidates being considered. Meanwhile, a Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon was "pitching hard" for the job. But two other sources told the newswire that Dimon was not interested, and Reuters reported that JPMorgan spokespeople as well as Dimon had declined to comment. "Jamie Dimon, I think, has been an exceptional leader in finance, pre- and post-crisis," Kelleher told CNBC's " Squawkbox " at the Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore on Thursday. "It would be very good for the country were it Jamie Dimon, it probably wouldn't be so good for Chase." JPMorgan shares were up 0.57 percent in aftermarket trade but fell 2.47 percent on Wednesday, following reports that Dimon could join the Trump administration. Kelleher attributed Trump's surprise election win to the same voter sentiment that drove Britain 's unexpected vote to exit the European Union. "I think the Trump presidency is just another example of populist outrage at the establishment," he said, adding that the same political phenomenon was being seen elsewhere, citing upcoming elections in Germany , France and Austria . Far right parties espousing anti-immigration rhetoric have been making headway across Europe in recent months. This was most notable when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party defeated German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats in regional elections in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in September. In France, the right-wing politician Marine Le Pen is expected to be one of the final two candidates in the first round of the country's presidential elections . "People are voting on sentiment rather than the issues themselves at the moment," Kelleher added. Meanwhile, Kelleher was confident that markets had largely got the "reflationary" post-Trump trade right, despite scant details on the President-elect's policy proposals. "I think (infrastructure spend) will be significant ... (With) the House and the Senate both Republican, probably he will get a lift in the debt ceiling to allow him to do that," Kelleher said, adding that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had proposed a similar infrastructure policy to Trump's, and that there was a broad consensus of approval for such a move.

Do this first, Donald Posted on November 17, 2016November 11, 2016 by GS Early Views: 2,897 188 Shares Now that we have a new president elected and preparing to take on the role as the world’s most powerful CEO, there is plenty of talk about what President Trump should do first. Many say the first is to bury Obamacare. Others suggest getting a conservative Supreme Court justice. Still, others want us to put ISIS down once and for all, along with the Assad regime in Syria. My number one wish is a little simpler. I want Trump to cut off the bailout funds that are going to the big banks, a full eight years after those same criminal bankers almost tanked the global economy. That’s right, they’re still getting paid from taxpayer dollars — JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America. Yep, most of the rogue’s gallery of financial thieves. According to The Washington Post, Wells Fargo — you know, the bank that just axed 5,000 lower level workers for a scheme started by greedy execs who walked away without a scratch — is eligible for another $1.5 billion over the next seven years. JPMorgan could receive $1.1 billion; Bank of America $964 million. These payments are the last vestiges of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program cobbled together by the banksters and their politicians. Of that enormous figure, a mere $28 billion went to help struggling homeowners. So, after handing over $672 billion to the banks, the Fed then began its infamous “quantitative easing” (a.k.a. QE) programs. Up to now, the Fed bought $4.8 trillion of Treasuries and then lent money to the banksters at zero to near-zero interest in the hopes they would loan the money. But the banks decided it was easier to simply buy Treasuries for 3 to 4 percent and triple their money risk free, rather than lend it out to individuals and businesses to get the economy going again. And for all that self-serving greed, they continue to get rewarded. Unbelievable. So, my hope is President Trump cuts off this fail upward cycle that we have seen since the financial crisis. Now, as far as the stocks that look good here, there are a handful of sectors that will be direct beneficiaries: Defense. As I’ve discussed before, it isn’t just a Trump administration that would promote bolstering defense, there is a major supercycle underway to rebuild the military after Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Healthcare stocks (health insurers, biotechs, pharmaceuticals) will be winners because Obamacare will be completely reformed and the drug makers will not be under the scrutiny that was threatened by a Clinton presidency. Financials (national bankster more than regional or local banks) will be strong less because of Trump but because they are major Treasury bond holders and the Fed will raise rates in December. Rising rates makes for bigger returns. Insurance companies will also be winners of this trend. Energy will also be a winner… but it will take some time. There is still a massive oil glut, so prices will not be high enough for any U.S. firms to make much money. Although if prices go too high, consumers and fuel-intensive businesses will be hurt. The sweet spot will be $50 to 75 a barrel. Coal will still struggle because the switch to natural gas has already taken place with most industries and utilities. Utilities will likely have less regulatory issues. Apparently, Trump is looking to completely revamp the EPA. Infrastructure (heavy industry and manufacturing). With a lighter touch from the EPA the companies that still make things in the U.S. will have an easier time meeting environmental regulations. Plus, Democrats will support infrastructure spending, so it won’t be a battle. This is a pretty optimistic list, but given the market’s initial reaction to the Trump win, it’s not unrealistic.

A group of representatives from each of these companies has worked for the past six months with the Open Networking User Group (ONUG) to develop a whitepaper exploring challenges of using hybrid cloud. ONUG’s Hybrid Cloud Working Group (HCWG) includes not only valuable tips from their experiences using the cloud, but also a wish-list of how these enterprises would like vendors to evolve their platforms. Here are 10 tips: 1. Categorize apps into low, medium and high risk tiers Which apps should move to the cloud? Before answering that question you need to classify your apps to know what you have. The HCWG recommends the following categorization of low, medium, medium+ and high security tier apps. Applications with the highest security risk should have the more stringent security protocols. Low risk data includes public or non-sensitive information such as customer-facing data. Medium risk data – such as ERP systems and business management applications, but not ones that include intellectual property or patent data - can go to the public cloud with extra security precautions. Medium+ apps are categorized as data with government controlled unclassified data or data subject to strict regulatory compliance issues. High-risk apps are not recommended to use in the public cloud; this includes information such as patents, critical business process and sensitive financial information. 2. Use a cloud broker Once an organization has determined which apps are appropriate for the public cloud, the next challenge is getting them there. An organization can access public cloud resources from any internet connection. ONUG member companies recommend using a cloud broker or “man-in-the-middle,” though, for two reasons: security (what the HCWG calls exploit mitigation) and improved performance. A cloud broker is typically a collocation provider that provides access points to multiple public cloud providers. Example vendors include Equinix, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. The cloud broker can be thought of as the new “far edge” of a corporate data center, providing a secure place to inspect network traffic going into and out of the cloud before it reaches the enterprise campus or remote data center. “Packet inspection/scanning or censoring of traffic occurs in the cloud broker to mitigate exploits before entering corporate data centers from cloud providers or exploits trying to do damage to cloud hosted services from private clouds,” the whitepaper explains. From a performance standpoint, the broker can provide direct fiber connections to multiple IaaS cloud vendors. The broker can serve other purposes too, from application delivery control functions such as load balancing and domain name system/dynamic host configuration protocol (DNS/DHCP) to hosting an active directory to authenticate users. By being a buffer between the cloud and the enterprise network, it’s an ideal spot to host Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Firewall security, as well as other network monitoring and analytics tools. Because it’s a collocation facility, the footprint is controlled completely by the customer and can be as large or small as the customer wants. 3. Listed prices are not actual prices Large enterprises negotiate directly with public cloud vendors and enter into enterprise agreements with discounted pricing. Listed online pricing is usually just a guide. The HCWG warns that contract negotiations can be a long and arduous process, however. 4. Use professional negotiators When negotiating an enterprise agreement with vendors, use a professional arbiter. Some HCWG member companies took as much as 18 months to negotiate a contract and spent up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. Experienced negotiators can be either in-house legal staff or external experts. 5. Licensing in the cloud is different HCWG members warn of being careful of licensing when using the public cloud. Make sure any software licensed for use on premises is legally allowed to be used in the cloud before doing so. Even if there’s no legal restriction against hosting an on-premises app in the public cloud, some licenses are just not designed with public cloud in mind. “Licensing may be based upon the number of CPUs that the software is accessed by, which may increase significantly once the application is placed in the cloud where more employees can now access [it],” ONUG explains. Search for public-cloud native software licenses where possible. 6. Compliance officer training Auditors who have been operating in an on-premise world their entire careers may have challenges working in a public cloud arena. “The language of cloud computing and location of assets is foreign to many auditors,” ONUG’s whitepaper states. Be prepared for a potentially frustrating process with auditors if they’re not familiar with the public cloud. ONUG encourages public cloud vendors to provide training programs and tools for auditors. 7. Liability is a hassle Some ONUG members found considerable frustration when negotiating liability with their IaaS cloud provider. In a more traditional managed services or other outsourcing arrangement, liability typically covers loss, damages and liability up to the value of the outsourced asset. Cloud providers sometimes offer a different type of liability. “Cloud providers seek liability to cover the dollar amount spent,” the whitepaper explains. “That is, if a company spends $50,000 per year with a cloud provider to host an application and experiences damages of $10,000,000, the cloud provider seeks its liability to cover $50,000. This level of liability will limit the type of applications that will migrate to cloud providers to the low- to medium-risk levels.” 8. Beware of lock-in Lock-in from a public IaaS cloud provider in some cases is unavoidable, and not necessarily a bad thing, the HCWG explains. The group recommends that end users recognize and acknowledge it. The whitepaper notes the relatively high cost of moving data between different cloud vendors, reinforcing the adage that it’s easy to get data into the cloud, but more expensive and difficult to get it out. Certain applications are more prone to lock-in too, including workload creation tools, non-standard orchestration tools, non-standard provisioning tools, and vendor-specific scheduling or automation tools. The more an organization’s developers or cloud administrators use and rely on these tools specifically geared for one vendor, the more difficult it could be to run those workloads in another environment. 9. Encrypt everything, and manage the keys It’s becoming a common enterprise practice to encrypt all data going to and stored in the cloud. ONUG reminds end users to make sure they manage the keys, too. Another security tip that is becoming common practice is to use role-based access controls – meaning that, for example, not everyone in an organization has access to administrative controls in a cloud environment. Those should be protected with at least two-factor authentication. 10. Understand the limits of the public cloud Along with the detailed list of tips based on their experience using the public cloud, HCWG members have a series of requests for cloud vendors of how their platforms can be improved to make the cloud easier to use. By exploring these wish-list items, it’s clear to see where the public cloud falls short. For example, HCWG members would like easier portability across public clouds, common encryption protocols among various cloud vendors and a common northbound API. The cloud has many advantages, but it’s not a panacea.

Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would "get" the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Nov. 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is "pitching hard" for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Nov. 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. "He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. "It is very difficult to replace someone like him." JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the Treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be Treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

The bank will pay roughly $200 million combined to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department and more than $50 million to the Federal Reserve, the source said. There will not be any individual prosecution at this time, the source said. The SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring. The Justice Department opened a parallel investigation around the same time. Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China's politically connected. While close ties to top government officials are a boon to any banking franchise across the world, they are especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions. The SEC, JPMorgan and the Justice Department all declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank's hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange commission opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring of "princelings", the term used in Asia to refer to the children or younger relatives of China's political leaders or top executives at state-owned enterprises. The settlement with the U.S. authorities could be announced as soon as Thursday, Bloomberg said. http://bloom.bg/2ghScue The SEC and JPMorgan declined to comment. The Justice Department was not immediately available to comment.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 16, 2016 at 2:44PM Image source: Wikipedia Commons. It's still too early to know exactly what the incoming Trump administration will mean for the nation's biggest banks, but if it follows through on its designs to deregulate the financial industry, then JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) could be on the verge of making a lot more money. There are a number of reasons for this, but the biggest all of could come from changes to bank capital requirements. The regulatory pendulum In the wake of the financial crisis, regulators scaled up the type and amount of capital that banks have to hold against the assets on their balance sheets. It was believed that by doing so, banks could survive the next crisis without needing to be bailed out by the government. Not only would banks have to hold more capital than they did previously, but the quality of the capital would need to be better. No longer would debt instruments and even certain types of preferred stock count as loss-absorbing capital. That role could now only be filled by common equity. The impact was particularly severe for the nation's biggest banks -- those like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Because these banks are now designated as global systemically important banks, or GSIBs, they're obligated to hold even more capital than their smaller, simpler peers in the regional banking space. JPMorgan Chase must maintain a so-called GSIB surcharge of an added 3.5 percentage points' worth of high-quality capital relative to its risk-weighted assets. Bank of America and Citigroup's surcharges come out to 3.0 percentage points above non-systematically important banks. The net result is that capital requirements have more than doubled for large banks. Going into the crisis, JPMorgan Chase faced a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4%. Now, after all the current rules are phased in, that figure is 10.5%. Data source: JPMorgan Chase. Chart by author. JPMorgan Chase alone holds so much capital now that it could absorb the combined losses of America's 31 largest banks under the most extreme version of the Federal Reserve's latest stress test. As CNN noted earlier this year: The Federal Reserve's stress tests estimate that JPMorgan alone would lose $55 billion in a worst-case economic situation. But the government has forced big banks to stock up on lots of capital. JPMorgan now has $350 billion of loss-absorbing resources. That means the banking giant actually has enough capital to swallow the losses of the next 30 banks, which is estimated at $167 billion. Because this reduces the amount of leverage banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup can use, it weighs directly on their bottom lines. It's one of the main reasons that banks are struggling nowadays to earn their costs of capital by generating returns on equity above 10%. Higher liquidity requirements, too To make matters worse, regulators also now require banks to keep a larger share of their assets in high-quality liquid assets than they did before the 2008 crisis. The thought process is that these assets can be readily converted to cash in the event of a bank run, similar to what brought down Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. At the end of the third quarter, JPMorgan Chase had $539 billion worth of high-quality liquid assets. To put that in perspective, that's only slightly less than the $587 billion market cap of Apple, the largest company by market cap in the United States. The problem is that highly liquid assets yield less than loans. The $409 billion that JPMorgan Chase kept as an average balance in deposits at other banks last quarter yielded only 0.44% on an annualized basis. Meanwhile, its average loan yielded 4.23%. This means that for every $100 billion that JPMorgan Chase allocates to highly liquid assets as opposed to loans, it forgoes almost $1 billion worth of interest income each quarter. That's a lot of money when you consider that the New York-based bank tends to earn around $6 billion on a quarterly basis. Dismantling Dodd-Frank The good news for JPMorgan Chase is that all of this could change under a Trump administration, which has promised to "dismantle" the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that empowered regulators to raise both capital and liquidity requirements. Trump's camp has been notoriously scant with details about possible changes to financial regulations (or, for that matter, anything), but we can get a sense for their thinking by looking at the Financial CHOICE Act proposed by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who's purportedly being considered for Treasury Secretary in the incoming administration. The central component of the proposed legislation would be to exempt banks from many of the heightened capital and liquidity requirements so long as they maintain a base level of capital. One could argue that this would reduce the soundness of the banking sector, as it almost certainly would, but there's little doubt that it'd serve as a potent stimulant to banks' bottom lines, and few more so than JPMorgan Chase.

The dollar rose to a one-year high against a basket of currencies on expectations U.S. interest rates will rise faster than previously anticipated if President-elect Donald Trump cuts taxes and boosts infrastructure spending. "The first thing we need to focus on is has the direction of the dollar changed because of the change in the administration," Richard Titherington, who is also head of Asia Pacific Equities team, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. "Investors had been assuming that the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong ... that does change the landscape quite dramatically and in general terms you would normally think that a rising dollar is a negative for emerging markets and Asian equities." MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended flat on Wednesday having touched a four-month low touched earlier this week. The index is down more than 4 percent since Nov. 8. Sharp gains in U.S. bond yields have drawn investors to the dollar, and the dollar index is just 0.5 percent away from its highest in more than 13-1/2 years. The strength has fanned fears funds are shifting to the United States from emerging markets. The Chinese yuan, on the other hand, weakened to 6.8703 to the dollar, its lowest level since December 2008. There was no investor panic because of the weaker yuan as the depreciation in the currency was backed by a stabilisation in the world's second-largest economy, Titherington said at the summit in Hong Kong. "The Chinese authorities have managed to engineer a currency adjustment without creating concerns that there is capital flight going on, which is a positive," he said, adding that the yuan would weaken further if the dollar continues to strengthen. Within Asia, Titherington said he was bullish on the long-term prospects for Indian and Vietnamese equity markets. He said, however, that India could see a negative impact in the short term due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's order to withdraw large denomination banknotes from circulation in a shock "demonetisation" drive to fight tax evasion, corruption and forgery. "Is the sell-off that you've seen in the equities over the last week, is that an opportunity or is it the market telling you this currency reform is going to cause significant problems for a long period of time?," he said, referring to the withdrawal of some bank notes. "I will tend to be optimistic ... certainly the government in India is taking a very big risk which I think is a long-term positive."

Charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. The EU competition enforcer can levy fines up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover for breaching the bloc's rules. JPMorgan said the EU charges were without merit when it was served the document and that it would defend itself. Credit Agricole has said it would examine the charge sheet. HSBC said at that time that it would defend itself vigorously. Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, RBS <RBS.L> and Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> admitted guilt in December 2013. Barclays <BARC.L> avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down billion-dollar fines to more than 10 banks and brokerages for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro cousin Euribor. Prosecutors have also charged more than a dozen men with fraud-related offences.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained in this press release, including any information as to the company's strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words "expect", "will", "may" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the company or Barrick North America Finance LLC as at the date of this press release in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Argentina, Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect the company's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company or Barrick North America Finance LLC. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to "Narrative Description of the Business-Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources" and "Risk Factors" in the annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2015, and to the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the annual audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each of which is on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and incorporated by reference in the Offer to Purchase, and to the section "Certain Significant Consequences for Holders" in the Offer to Purchase, for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect the company's ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. The Offerors disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

(REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) Automated teller machines aren’t just a source of cash. They’re also a way for scientists to understand what microbes are in the environment and on people’s fingers— such as mold from sugary food. For a new study, researchers took samples in the summer of 2014 from the keypads of 66 ATMs in New York City, and then analyzed what they found. They discovered microbes that live on human skin, as well as in places like bathrooms, kitchens, pillows, and evidence of food like chicken, fish, and mold from baked goods. “Our results suggest that ATM keypads integrate microbes from different sources, including the human microbiome, foods, and potentially novel environmental organisms adapted to air or surfaces,” Jane Carlton, director of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU and the senior author of the new study, said in a statement. The cash machines they studied were scattered across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn, and four of them were outside, although they didn’t see anything different with those ATMs compared to the inside ones. RECORD-BREAKING BATS CAN FLY AS FAST AS 99 MPH, STUDY SAYS While the majority of microbes came from unknown sources, and then from surfaces like televisions or restrooms, they were also able to identify microbes that came from human skin, ears, noses, and feces. Interestingly, in places like midtown Manhattan, they found mold that’s connected with baked goods— called X. bisporus, the fungus is “associated with spoilage of high-sugar foods such as cakes and confectionaries,” according to the study. While the researchers can’t be sure exactly where the mold came from, they have an idea: “it seems plausible that this fungus had been transferred from people who had recently handled baked goods, particularly in a commuter-heavy area such as midtown Manhattan, where there are many nearby convenience stores and cafés selling this type of food product to business workers,” the researchers write in the study. Ultimately, the study, which was published in the journal mSphere, provides a snapshot of what people have been doing, as well as microbes that come from the urban environment.

His supervisor in Asia told colleagues that “he’s not really built” for investment banking. He had “attitude issues,” had trouble “following basic rules” and was a prolific napper. Yet in 2010 he was offered a full-time job, over the reservations of some executives. In an email, a banker said the hire would curry favor with the student’s father, an executive of a Taiwanese company who was offering an $800 million transaction to the bank. “The quid pro quo is an analyst job for his son,” the banker wrote. Those details emerged on Thursday as JPMorgan agreed to pay about $264 million to settle U.S. allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision-makers to win business in violation of anti-bribery laws. “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,” Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said. The agreement ended an almost three-year investigation that set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted. Such leniency reflects the bank’s willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, U.S. officials said. The Justice Department’s fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,” JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a written statement. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved. We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also investigating JPMorgan’s hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. In the government’s 21-page agreement with JPMorgan, U.S. officials outlined a years-long scheme in which JPMorgan employees at the bank’s Hong Kong subsidiary sought to maximize profits by providing jobs and internships to children of individuals it hoped to do business with. At least $35 million in JPMorgan’s profits could be attributed to the hiring practices detailed in the agreement, U.S. officials said. JPMorgan engaged in the activity, which it called the Sons and Daughters Program, from 2006 to at least 2012 even though the bank had an anti-corruption policy designed to avoid any “quid pro quo arrangement,” investigators said. “Certain senior executives and employees of the company conspired to engage in quid pro quo agreements with Chinese officials to obtain investment-banking business,” they said. This included creating a program “to provide specific personal benefits to senior Chinese officials in the position to award or influence the award of banking mandates.” Bank employees took steps to avoid attracting the attention of authorities that possible anti-bribery laws were being violated. Paperwork about the hiring was doctored or altered “to conceal the corrupt arrangement” and avoid detection, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors in the office of the Brooklyn U.S. attorney, Robert Capers, described at least six clients that the bank’s Asia unit sought to cultivate as part of the scheme, including a state-owned financial services firm; a private Chinese manufacturing company; the Taiwanese private holding company; a state-owned Chinese bank and financial services firm; the deputy minister of a Chinese government agency and the executive vice president of a state-owned and controlled Chinese bank. U.S. officials didn’t name any of the individuals or companies involved in the program. Prosecutors cited a series of e-mails JPMorgan officials exchanged during the years-long scheme. In November 2009, for example, a JPMorgan executive in Asia suggested that the bank institute a practice of prioritizing “hires linked to upcoming transactions.” A managing director observed in September 2009 that “people in other investment banks are doing a better job. Therefore, in theory, we can accommodate more powerful sons and daughters that could benefit the entire platform.” Another e-mail discussed making hires “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.” The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of “roadmap” for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, people with knowledge of the situation have said. The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they’d hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. Prosecutors in the JPMorgan case cited several lackluster hires who got jobs as a result of their ties to decision-makers in Asia. For example, a JPMorgan supervisor asked if an entry-level investment banker was producing “real investment banking productivity” or “is he a photocopier?” “Photocopier,” the bank supervisor replied, nevertheless recommending later that the employee should be promoted, saying, “The deal is large enough we’d be crazy not to accommodate her father’s wants.” Another prospective hire, whose father was a deputy minister at a Chinese government agency, got a job with the bank’s Asia offices even though some bankers said “he was the worst business analyst candidate they had ever seen,” an executive wrote in an e-mail. Despite managers’ misgivings about the son of the Taiwanese company executive, the napping intern joined the bank’s staff in New York, prompting one banker to write, “Happy young man, and his dad will also be very pleased.” Three months later, JPMorgan won the company’s business, prosecutors said. The father “certainly followed through,” a bank employee wrote.

The deal will settle charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo programme that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. The bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators in the US. The bank reached what is known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell said. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans US companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this programme had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35m in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Ms Caldwell called the JPMorgan programme, which was called the Sons and Daughters Programme, was "nothing more than bribery by another name". Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement.

The settlement with US regulators comes after a three-year investigation into a vast foreign bribery scheme that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It could be the first of several such deals with Wall Street banks. “JP Morgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement division. “JP Morgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.” The Department of Justice called the scheme “bribery by any other name” and said it had recently created three dedicated international corruption squads “to combat this type of quid pro quo, and we’ll use all resources at our disposal to uncover and put an end to these crimes”. Starting in 2006 senior Hong Kong-based JP Morgan bankers set up and used a “client referral programme”, also referred to as the “sons and daughters programme”, to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials. The bank admitted that some candidates hired under the scheme did little more than proof reading but were paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. In one case bankers in New York told their Hong Kong peers that one Chinese hire was unqualified to be an investment banker. But a senior Chinese official had said that his hiring would help JP Morgan secure a lucrative role in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of a state-owned company. A position was created for the candidate in New York, and JP Morgan thereafter obtained a leading role in the IPO. JP Morgan Chase to pay $307m for steering investors toward own products Read more The DoJ calculates the scheme increased profits at JP Morgan by at least $35m. “US businesses cannot lawfully seek to gain a business advantage by corruptly influencing foreign government officials,” said US attorney Robert Capers of the eastern district of New York. “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defence. In this case, JP Morgan employees designed a programme to hire otherwise unqualified candidates for prestigious investment banking jobs solely because these candidates were referred to the bank by officials in positions to award business to the bank. In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business. This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s FCPA unit, said: “The misconduct was so blatant that JP Morgan investment bankers created ‘referral hires vs revenue’ spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs. The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied.” A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “The conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring program was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said.

Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank “corruptly influenced government officials” with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving “anything of value” to win business from foreign officials. “JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials … who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China’s ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as “Sons and Daughters.” The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals. “The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it “corruption, plain and simple.” Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities. These jobs scored JPMorgan more than $100 million in business. JPMorgan admitted to authorities that individuals hired during the scheme were given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. That’s despite the fact that, according to the DOJ, they mostly focused on routine work such as “proofreading” and generated little actual business. JPMorgan’s $264 million in fines is being divided up among multiple government agencies. The bank has agreed to pay more than $130 million to the SEC, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Despite the “blatant” conduct alleged by authorities, the U.S. did not announce any criminal charges against JPMorgan itself nor any individual employees of the bank. In a statement, JPMorgan said the hiring practices were “unacceptable” and the program was stopped in 2013. The bank said it took “action” against the individuals involved and has since improved its hiring procedures. JPMorgan also said in a filing that it continues to cooperate on other related investigations that are “ongoing.” The SEC said it continues to investigate the issue. Authorities say the hirings were quid pro quo arrangements expressly made with the intent to win business. For instance, the DOJ said that in late 2009 a Chinese official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan would play in an upcoming IPO of a Chinese state-owned company. JPMorgan then spent months trying to place the candidate in a New York investment banking position — despite realizing he was not qualified. The SEC said JPMorgan’s internal controls were “so weak” that not one of these hiring requests was denied. The settlement comes as JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been floated as a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. It’s also the latest black eye for Wall Street and big banks. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo outraged Americans by saying it fired 5,300 employees for creating as many as 2 million fake accounts. The scandal dealt a blow to Wells Fargo’s reputation and resulted in the sudden retirement of longtime CEO John Stumpf. JPMorgan itself has also been in trouble in recent years. In 2013, JPMorgan paid $5.1 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac linked to misdeeds in the run up to the housing bubble. JPMorgan was also hit with a $1 billion fine for improper oversight that led to the London Whale trading debacle. Regulators worry the misbehavior among bankers is causing a credibility problem for the industry. “Deep-seated cultural and ethical problems,” New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley recently warned,” have “eroded the industry’s trustworthiness.” Smart friendship bracelet gets girls into coding Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections Related Posts Medium lands biggest website yet Illinois Attorney General targets FanDuel and DraftKings Trevor Noah to miss ‘Daily Show’ due to emergency surgery NRF: Retailers Say Shorter Hours for Truck Drivers Would Increase Costs Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." The bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. "We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations," said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. "The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved." According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Credit Andrew Burton/Getty Images After more than three years of digging into JPMorgan Chase’s hiring practices in China, federal authorities have determined that the bank hired the children of Chinese leaders as part of a quid pro quo to win business in the booming nation, clearing the way for a costly punishment. As soon as Thursday, the authorities will announce a roughly $264 million settlement with the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The authorities, which include criminal prosecutors and civil regulators, will accuse the bank of orchestrating a long-running foreign bribery scheme. When The New York Times reported on the contours of a settlement in September, it was not known whether the authorities would explicitly accuse the bank of carrying out a quid pro quo — providing jobs in exchange for lucrative assignments from Chinese government-run companies. This issue, which strikes at the heart of whether JPMorgan violated United States law governing foreign bribery, became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations. The bank argued that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in China, and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws. The United States government, however, concluded that in several instances, senior JPMorgan bankers explicitly linked those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies, the people briefed on the matter said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, the people said, formalized the hiring into what it called the Sons and Daughters program. The bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients — and the bank’s ability to convert these hires into business deals. In reaching the settlement, JPMorgan is expected to accept the findings and conclusions of the investigators. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington and the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, which handled the civil regulatory aspects of the investigation, declined to comment. The settlement, which was smaller than once expected because JPMorgan showed a high degree of cooperation with investigators, followed a painful period for the bank. When the China hiring investigation first came to light in a front-page article in The Times three years ago, it added to a growing list of regulatory problems, including the $6 billion “London whale” trading scandal and a $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department over the bank’s sale of mortgage securities in the years before the 2008 financial crisis. The China settlement will now put to rest one of the last big regulatory headaches for the bank. Some of the senior bankers suspected of carrying out the hiring have since left JPMorgan. Just as important, the agreement signals the final chapter in the Obama administration’s pursuit of wrongdoing on Wall Street. That effort garnered big-dollar settlements and splashy headlines, but no criminal prosecutions of top Wall Street executives after the financial crisis — an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate. The foreign bribery case against JPMorgan is no different. The United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn and the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington are expected to impose a roughly $70 million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs. The S.E.C. will assess the largest punishment, about $130 million of the overall $264 million settlement, while the Fed will impose a roughly $62 million penalty. The bank also secured a moral victory by avoiding criminal charges, the people briefed on the matter said, and instead negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donald J. Trump’s surprise victory in the presidential election last week could disrupt the public perception that banks are treated leniently. Steve Bannon, a media executive appointed as Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, lamented in 2014 that “not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive” associated with the 2008 crisis. Mr. Trump’s presidency also could be a turning point in how banks and other corporations do business in China. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called China a “currency manipulator” and threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, but as president-elect he has shifted his tone and promised that the two nations would have “one of the strongest relationships.” No matter the relationship going forward, the Justice Department is expected to continue enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — the 1977 law that underpins the case against JPMorgan — and that might mean more cases against big banks operating in China. The JPMorgan case would represent one of the first major crackdowns on a big bank for violations of this law, but Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and other banks have also hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in China. Those investigations may fizzle, but the JPMorgan case provides a template for prosecutors and regulators to bring these sorts of cases, which once seemed far-fetched. JPMorgan’s lawyers urged prosecutors not to criminalize hiring practices that were common in the region. While hiring an American politician’s child in exchange for a government contract is a clear violation of law, global companies routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading Chinese politicians. JPMorgan went even further, however, and hired the family members of potential clients while seeking their business. Specifically, JPMorgan hired the children of Chinese officials running state-controlled companies that were seeking banks to help them go public. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act essentially bars United States companies from giving “anything of value” to a foreign official to win “an improper advantage” in retaining business. Initially, JPMorgan sought to prevent such violations. But as the Sons and Daughters program expanded, senior JPMorgan bankers explicitly tied those hires to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies, the people briefed on the matter said. In an email previously reported by The Times, a JPMorgan executive in Hong Kong linked one prominent hire to “existing and potential business opportunities” from a Chinese government-run company. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The executive also described the broader benefits of the hiring program, telling colleagues in another email: “You all know I have always been a big believer of the Sons and Daughters program — it almost has a linear relationship” with winning assignments to advise Chinese companies.

The SEC, JPMorgan and the Justice Department all declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank's hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said.  As the settlement was announced, there was conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon could become U.S. Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. As the settlement was announced, there was conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon  (pictured) was being considered as the next U.S. Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would 'get' the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since November 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is 'pitching hard' for the Treasury role.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 93 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. "We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations," said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. "The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved." According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

(Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay about $264 million to settle corruption charges that accused the investment bank of seeking to influence Chinese government officials by giving jobs and internships to their friends and relatives, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department announced Thursday. The investment bank, which was subject to civil and criminal investigations stemming from its hiring practices in Hong Kong and China, is specifically accused of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a federal law that prohibits bribing foreign officials. Hoping to gain more banking business, bankers in JPMorgan's offices in Hong Kong bypassed the firm's normal hiring practices and hired about 100 interns and full-time employees who were referred by foreign government officials in a seven-year period, starting 2006. The officials had ties to more than 20 state-owned enterprises, the SEC said. Calling the practice "a systematic bribery scheme," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division, said the candidates were "typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit." Candidates hired through the so-called "Sons and Daughters Program" were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers, but performed "ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product," according to the Justice Department. USA TODAY JPMorgan, Citi glide past profit expectations JPMorgan bankers in Hong Kong were aware that they were potentially violating the FCPA in creating the program, but continued it because "the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative," Ceresney said. JPMorgan will pay more than $130 million for the charges from the SEC. The company is also expected to pay $72 million to the Justice Department and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. As part of the settlement with the Justice Department, JPMorgan will not face prosecution and has agreed to continue to cooperate with any ongoing investigations. "The conduct was unacceptable," JPMorgan said in a statement. "We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved.  We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures, and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people." The crackdown on JPMorgan is part of the SEC's broader investigation of U.S. companies' hiring practices in the region, where family ties and other allegiances can play a significant role in job search among the political and social elites. JPMorgan's case "could be an industry wide problem," Ceresney said in a conference call with reporters. "We do not expect this to be the last case resulting from this sweep." The practice, which enabled JPMorgan to generate more than $100 million in revenue, was so blatant that its investment bankers created "Referral Hires vs Revenue" spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients who managed to get jobs for their referrals, according to Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's FCPA unit. In order to be hired, a referred candidate had to have a direct link to a business opportunity. USA TODAY JPMorgan's Dimon says it's time for a rate hike, sees no economic "potholes" "The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied," Brockmeyer said. "In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business," United States Attorney Robert Capers of the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. "This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” In one case cited by the Justice Department, a Chinese government official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia in 2009 that hiring a referred candidate could result in JPMorgan landing a prominent role in an upcoming initial public offering of a Chinese state-owned company. Despite being told that the candidate was not qualified, JPMorgan bankers hired the candidate in New York, resulting in the company landing a leading role in the IPO. 44 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fA47Cq

His supervisor in Asia told colleagues that “he’s not really built” for investment banking. He had “attitude issues,” had trouble “following basic rules” and was a prolific napper. Yet in 2010 he was offered a full-time job, over the reservations of some executives. Those details emerged on Thursday as JPMorgan agreed to pay about $264 million to settle U.S. allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision-makers to win business in violation of anti-bribery laws. Investigators described a systematic effort to curry favor with government officials and business executives. The Wharton student’s father was an executive of a Taiwanese company offering an $800 million transaction to the bank. In an e-mail, one banker wrote, “The quid pro quo is an analyst job for his son.” The government’s 21-page agreement with JPMorgan ended an almost three-year investigation that set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. U.S. officials said JPMorgan employees at the bank’s Hong Kong subsidiary sought to maximize profits by providing jobs and internships to children of individuals it hoped to do business with. In spite of a company policy prohibiting such quid pro quo, employees kept a spreadsheet that tracked the recruits and the revenue attributable to each one -- and then doctored or altered paperwork about the hiring activity “to conceal the corrupt arrangement.” In all, the bank generated at least $35 million in profits as a result of those hires, U.S. officials said. “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,” Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said. The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted. Such leniency reflects the bank’s willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, U.S. officials said. The Justice Department’s fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. Earlier: U.S. Offers Incentives for Companies to Self-Report Corruption “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,” JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a written statement. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved. We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also investigating JPMorgan’s hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. JPMorgan shares were up more than 0.75 percent to $77.98 at 1 p.m. in New York. ‘Quid Pro Quo’ JPMorgan engaged in the activity, which it called the Sons and Daughters Program, from 2006 to at least 2012 even though the bank had an anti-corruption policy designed to avoid any “quid pro quo arrangement,” U.S. officials said. “Certain senior executives and employees of the company conspired to engage in quid pro quo agreements with Chinese officials to obtain investment-banking business,” they said. This included creating a program “to provide specific personal benefits to senior Chinese officials in the position to award or influence the award of banking mandates.” Cultivating Clients Federal prosecutors in the office of the Brooklyn U.S. attorney, Robert Capers, described at least six clients that the bank’s Asia unit sought to cultivate as part of the scheme, including a state-owned financial services firm; a private Chinese manufacturing company; the Taiwanese private holding company; a state-owned Chinese bank and financial services firm; the deputy minister of a Chinese government agency and the executive vice president of a state-owned and controlled Chinese bank. U.S. officials didn’t name any of the individuals or companies involved in the program. Prosecutors cited a series of e-mails JPMorgan officials exchanged during the years-long scheme. In November 2009, for example, a JPMorgan executive in Asia suggested that the bank institute a practice of prioritizing “hires linked to upcoming transactions.” A managing director observed in September 2009 that “people in other investment banks are doing a better job. Therefore, in theory, we can accommodate more powerful sons and daughters that could benefit the entire platform.” Another e-mail discussed making hires “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.” The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of “roadmap” for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, people with knowledge of the situation have said. Other Inquiries The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they’d hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. Prosecutors in the JPMorgan case cited several lackluster hires who got jobs as a result of their ties to decision-makers in Asia. For example, a JPMorgan supervisor asked if an entry-level investment banker was producing “real investment banking productivity” or “is he a photocopier?” “Photocopier,” the bank supervisor replied, nevertheless recommending later that the employee should be promoted, saying, “The deal is large enough we’d be crazy not to accommodate her father’s wants.” Another prospective hire, whose father was a deputy minister at a Chinese government agency, got a job with the bank’s Asia offices even though some bankers said “he was the worst business analyst candidate they had ever seen,” an executive wrote in an e-mail. Despite managers’ misgivings about the son of the Taiwanese company executive, the napping intern joined the bank’s staff in New York, prompting one banker to write, “Happy young man, and his dad will also be very pleased.” Three months later, JPMorgan won the company’s business, prosecutors said. The father “certainly followed through,” a bank employee wrote. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Report: Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Says No To Being Trump’s Treasury Secretary Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Says No To Being Trump’s Treasury Secretary November 17, 2016 9:34 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave dimon in the rough jamie dimon secretary of the treasury donald trump jpmorgan chase Last week, rumors circulated that Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO whom President-elect Donald Trump had once called the “worst banker in the United States,” was being considered by the incoming Trump administration for the position of Secretary of the Treasury. However, a new report claims that Dimon has formally passed on the offer. According to Fortune.com, Dimon opted to stay on at Chase rather than accept the cabinet position, feeling he wasn’t quite suited for the gig. As the report notes, the CEO is well-known — if not infamous — for his outspoken ways, a personality that may work in the banking world, but might not fit in well with a job where you have to constantly answer to the White House, lawmakers, and the public. Barring a dark horse nominee that no one has discussed yet, this leaves Trump transition adviser, and former Goldman Sachs exec Steve Mnuchin as the most likely person to be named for the Treasury gig. Bloomberg recently reported that he is the favorite for the gig among Trump’s advisors, with bank-backed Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling — perhaps the legislator most intent on dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — and investor Wilbur Ross Jr. as possible nominees.

By David Dayen November 17, 2016 Illustration by Hanna Barczyk Ever since Wall Street bankers cratered the global economy in 2009, federal prosecutors have barely been able to keep up with the unprecedented scale of corporate wrongdoing. Last year, in a series of high-profile settlements, Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and the Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines for manipulating the exchange rates on foreign currencies. Credit Suisse forked over $1.1 billion for helping its wealthy clients evade taxes. And the Justice Department ripped up an earlier settlement with UBS and fined the Swiss bank more than $200 million for rigging interest rates. As critics have pointed out, such penalties are little more than chump change for Wall Street, especially compared to the enormous profits that big banks have raked in from their criminal activities. But even if the punishment doesn’t fit the crime, the record-setting fines levied by the Justice Department are still flooding federal coffers with billions of new dollars. Which raises the question: Where is all the money going? The answer, it turns out, is the Crime Victims Fund, a little-known pool of money created during the law-and-order push of the 1980s to assist victims of crime, much of it violent. All criminal fines paid by individuals or corporations are deposited directly into the fund, which in turn flows to states to support individual victims and the organizations that assist them: battered women’s shelters, counseling centers for abused children, families who lost their primary breadwinners to murder, victims left permanently disabled by violent assaults. America’s biggest corporate criminals, in short, are paying to help the victims of other criminals. Thanks to a wave of big-dollar settlements with banks and pharmaceutical companies, the Crime Victims Fund ballooned from approximately $3 billion at the end of 2009 to almost $12 billion by the end of 2014. The Justice Department collected $23 billion in fines last year—but only $2.6 billion made its way into the Crime Victims Fund. The problem is, the fund only receives money from criminal fines. And in most cases, the Justice Department has been letting big banks and other corporate criminals off the hook with civil settlements and deferred prosecution agreements. Those settlements, instead of going into the Crime Victims Fund, mostly get handed over to the Treasury to reduce the deficit. Of the $23 billion in fines the Justice Department collected last year, in fact, only $2.6 billion made its way into the Crime Victims Fund. That means the feds aren’t just letting banks and top executives off easy for defrauding customers—they’re shortchanging victims of murder, sexual assault, and child abuse. “No one of any importance has spent time in jail for the massive fraud that the Justice Department outlines in horrifying detail in deferred prosecution agreements,” says Bart Naylor, a financial policy advocate for the nonprofit consumer rights group Public Citizen. “Not only does this invite more crooks into this risk-free racket, it deprives crime victims of any relief.” When the Crime Victims Fund was established in 1984 as part of the Victims of Crime Act, few lawmakers in Washington resisted the chance to help sympathetic crime victims. A task force appointed by President Ronald Reagan heard from crime survivors who suffered from deep psychological trauma and crippling medical bills. Disabled assault victims lost their means of support. Others had trouble getting time off from work to testify against their tormentors, or struggled to return to everyday life, plunging them into financial distress. Even navigating assistance programs required experienced help. The main sponsors of the victims fund were Strom Thurmond, the archconservative senator, and Peter Rodino, the liberal congressman. “In an era of Reaganism and budget constraints, it was an extremely bipartisan initiative,” says Steve Derene, executive director of the national association of state agencies that administer the fund. Unfortunately, the way Congress set up the fund effectively makes much of the money off-limits to crime victims. As criminal prosecutions have increased in recent years, the fund has grown to record levels. Because deposits into the fund can vary wildly from year to year based on criminal settlements, Congress caps the amount the fund can disperse on an annual basis, leaving money for leaner times. The cap was initially set at $500 million. As the fund has expanded, Congress has gradually raised the cap—up to $745 million in 2014, then to $2.4 billion in 2015. But that still leaves a huge unspent sum that service organizations desperately need to support crime victims. “There’s $9 billion sitting there with a specific purpose in mind,” says Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute. “Meanwhile, victim services can’t pay their rent.” That huge reserve of cash, however, has turned out to be too big a temptation for Congress to resist. Last year, for the first time, lawmakers raided the fund, taking $1.5 billion from crime victims to help pay for their own spending measures. And the looting has continued. This year, Congress plans to divert $379 million from the fund to support programs designed to curb violence against women—a worthy cause, but one that is supposed to receive its own funding. Other proposals would transfer 5 percent of grants from the fund to tribal governments, or commandeer a portion of the money to support a Republican move to rein in the Justice Department. “A lot of programs that represent different areas would like to get their slice of the fund,” Derene says. There is another solution. If the Justice Department actually did its job and prosecuted corporate wrongdoers to the full extent of the law, there would be more than enough money in the fund to aid crime victims. What’s more, Congress could help victims of Wall Street’s own fraud by doing away with the ineffective “consumer relief programs” that the Justice Department inserts into civil settlements. Those programs often end up helping the banks more than the customers they cheated, allowing them to profit even further by selling off the homes of their victims. If money from consumer relief programs went into the Crime Victims Fund, it would be overseen by social service professionals who know how to help victims, rather than by federal prosecutors looking to make headlines. But such reforms are unlikely to happen without a push by victim advocates. For now, lawmakers appear more interested in robbing the Crime Victims Fund than in helping victims of robbery. “This is a social problem,” says Garvin. “You have a huge swath of communities suffering from victimization. We made the decision decades ago to support those communities. Now we’re abandoning them.” Read More Up Front, Magazine, December 2016, Politics, Wall Street, assault, Ronald Reagan, Reaganism, Victims Fund Sign up for your daily dose of politics, culture, and big ideas.

Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would "get" the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Nov. 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is "pitching hard" for the treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Nov. 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. "He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. "It is very difficult to replace someone like him." JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

It’s also a potential boon for Wall Street banks, which have quietly bankrolled these companies as they profit from detaining and incarcerating people.   A new report released today by In The Public Interest reveals that six major Wall Street firms work in tandem with the industry: financing its debts, servicing its bonds, and extending billions of dollars in credit to pay for its operating expenses and expansion into related markets, like selling ankle GPS systems to monitor immigrants.  By acting as a credit card for private prisons, those six banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo — help the prison companies avoid corporate taxes. That doesn’t sit well with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat. He’s been trying to push legislation that would make it harder for private prison companies to keep registering themselves as Real Estate Investment Trusts — entities that pay low tax rates, keep little cash on hand, and borrow heavily from banks. “It is wrong for private enterprises to bring a profit motive to incarceration and rehabilitation in this country, and I’m particularly concerned by how it’s fueled by tax laws,” Sen. Wyden told International Business Times. “In my view, most taxpayers would be disturbed to learn that their dollars are subsidizing corporate profits from the mass incarceration of minority and low-income Americans.” Activists working to reduce the incarcerated population also criticized Wall Street for profiting  from the expansion of the prison system. “These banks are embedded in our communities,” said Amanda Aguilar Shank, deputy director of Enlace, a coalition of activists who oppose for-profit detension. “At the same time they are financing prison expansion — the institutions that are tearing our communities apart. This is sickening.” The banks behind the prison industry, of course, see things differently. “We do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company’s ability to serve customers and support team members,” Ruben Pulido, VP of corporate communications at Wells Fargo, told IBT. “We have banking relationships with tens of thousands of companies in hundreds of different sectors, and we only do business with companies that have demonstrated a strong, ongoing commitment to complying with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.” The number of prisoners in privately-run prisons has exploded since 1990, from just under 7,000 to over 131,000. The facilities have at times been plagued by public scandal. In 2012, a federal judge called a prison that GEO Group later took over a “cesspool of unconstitutional and inhuman acts and conditions,” and in 2014 the head of the Mississippi prison system was charged with accepting bribes from private prison companies. (He pleaded guilty on related charges.) The ACLU has repeatedly sued CoreCivic for allegedly poor conditions in its facilities. And this past August, the Obama administration announced it would cease the use of private prisons for federal prisoners. This moratorium did not apply, however, to detained immigrants. Under the Obama administration, private facilities have become the go-to solution for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which now holds 73 percent of its detainees in for-profit detention centers. Last week, Trump suggested he could deliver a major business opportunity to the companies that profit off detaining immigrants: He suggested one of his top priorities would be to detain or deport some 2- to 3 million undocumented immigrants.  Critics say that private prisons rely on mass incarceration to be profitable, and that the industry lobbies for punitive and draconian laws to keep its facilities full. Aguilar Shank called the private prisons “a parasite that has to constantly expand.” She said the industry spends millions lobbying Congress to fund immigration enforcement agencies, and has indirectly supported harsh sentencing guidelines.   Geo Group did not respond to IB Times request for comment, but CoreCivic disputed that characterization. “It is CoreCivic's longstanding policy not to draft, lobby for, promote or in any way take a position on proposals, policies or legislation that determine the basis or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Jonathan Burns, a company spokesman, told IBT. “The primary focus of CoreCivic's lobbying efforts is to educate lawmakers on the benefits of public-private partnership generally and the solutions that CoreCivic provides.”  Public-private partnerships aside, CoreCivic and GEO Group would have no way to finance their operations without the financial industry's backing. “They need Wall Street to survive, given their business model,” Benjamin Davis, a researcher with In The Public Interest, told IBT. “They are dependent on the debt.” Last year, for example, GEO Group bought SoberLink Inc — a tech company that allows authorities to monitor alcohol use remotely — with a $25 million credit line from Bank of America, JPMorgan  Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, US Bancorp and Wells  Fargo. GEO Group doesn’t rely on Wall Street-financed debt because it’s pressed for cash — the private-prison industry generates more than a billion dollars in annual revenue. The industry finances its operations through debt in order to take advantage of a tax loophole.   Both Core Civic and GEO Group classified themselves as “Real Estate Investment Trusts” (REIT), a tax status originally intended for companies that profit from buying and renting of land. The REIT classification allows the industry to effectively avoid corporate taxes — but it also requires them to treat investors as if they were part-owners in a real-estate trust. So the for-profit prison companies must pay out 90 percent of its profits to shareholders, leaving very little cash on hand. That’s where Wall Street comes in. Davis combed through the SEC filings and found that, as of June 2016, CoreCivic owed $1.5 billion to Wall Street and GEO Group owed $1.9 billion. The debt is spread throughout a range of financial mechanisms including revolving credit, long-term loans, and bond issuance. At every step of the way, Wall Street banks cash in: In 2015 alone, CoreCivic and GEO Group paid out over $150 million in interest and handed over $10 million for bond-servicing fees. On top of that, the Wall Street banks operate a consortium to provide revolving credit to both GEO Group and CoreCivic: Both can access up to $900 million set aside by the banks. SEC filings do not make clear how much the Wall Street firms charge to keep the credit line open. Related Stories President-Elect Trump's Wall Street Circle President-Elect Trump's For-Profit Incarceration State During the course of the presidential campaign, the private prison industry surfaced as an major issue: Under pressure from activists, Hillary Clinton returned donations from GEO Group and eventually called for the end of for-profit detention. Trump charted a different course; the president-elect's Super PAC took in $100,000 from GEO Group, and he praised the industry on the campaign trail. “I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons,” Trump told Chris Matthews last March. “It seems to work a lot better.” “GEO group might be licking its lips right about now,” says Davis. “Trump's talking tough on crime, deportations, national stop and frisk — many signs point to a momentum shift towards more private prisons.” And investors are taking note. The day after the election, the Wall Street Journal cited GEO Group as a “stock to watch.” In the week since Trump’s victory, both CoreCivic and Geo Group’s stock prices have soared, at times rising as much as 40 percent higher than their pre-election value.   Correction: 11/17, 12:15 pm EST: This story has been changed to correct the number of prisoners in private facilities. National More Political Capital Trump’s Hate-Love Relationship With Goldman Sachs By Avi Asher-Schapiro The president-elect slammed campaign opponents for their ties to the financial industry giant.

By KERI GEIGER, MATT ROBINSON AND PATRICIA HURTADO Bloomberg News First Published Nov 17 2016 01:05AM    •    Last Updated Nov 17 2016 01:05 am Share This Article U.S. authorities are preparing to announce as soon as Thursday that JPMorgan Chase & Co. will pay about $200 million to settle allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision makers to win business, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement would end a nearly three-year investigation into whether the hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws. The highly publicized probe set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted, the people said. Such leniency reflects the bank's willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, several people familiar with the matter have said. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and about $70 million to the Justice Department, the people said. Both authorities offer reduced sanctions to companies that assist in investigations. The Justice Department's fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating JPMorgan's hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of "roadmap" for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, two of the people said. For two decades, Wall Street banks have led the way in taking Chinese companies public overseas, taking advantage of their global reach and ability to ensure billions of dollars of stocks get sold at premium prices. The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they'd hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. The challenge for authorities was to discern whether such relationships were coincidental or an improper quid-pro-quo. The U.S. has clamped down on corporate favors to foreign officials, which are tacitly permitted or even encouraged in some countries. Goldman Sachs hired children of senior executives at China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, and New China Life Insurance Co. Morgan Stanley brought in an analyst whose father is both a top official of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp., or Sinopharm, and the chairman of China National Building Material Co. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

November 17 2016 at 09:39am By David Henry and Steve Holland REUTERS JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. File picture: Dylan Martinez New York/Washington - Conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase & Company Chief Executive Jamie Dimon could become US Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet cast a cloud of uncertainty over the nation's largest bank on Wednesday. Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would “get” the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since November 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since November 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. “He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. “It is very difficult to replace someone like him.” JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the Treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be Treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

The bank is likely to pay about $130 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and about $70 million to the Justice Department. It would also pay more than $50 million to the Federal Reserve. Individual employees may not be prosecuted at this time. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. authorities would announce the proposed settlement as soon as on Thursday. This would end a three- year long probe into whether the bank's hires violated US anti-bribery laws. The settlement is much smaller than once expected due to JPMorgan's high degree of cooperation with investigators. The authorities reportedly offer reduced sanctions to those companies that fully co-operate and assist in investigations. It was in 2013 that the SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan over the allegations. The Justice Department also opened a parallel investigation. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating the bank's hiring practices. The bank reportedly argued that in China it is common to employ well-connected people, and that these hires come under the foreign bribery laws. In China, investment banks generally favor to employ children of political leaders, as close ties to top government officials play a critical role in business decisions in that country. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

Ware   |   Nov. 16, 2016 at 9:58 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo NEW YORK, Nov. 16 (UPI) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has reportedly reached an agreement with federal authorities to pay more than $250 million to settle accusations that it effectively bribed Chinese officials -- with offers of employment for relatives -- to win lucrative business in the densely-populated nation. The settlement, which would be split among federal government agencies, could be announced as early as Thursday, the New York Times reported late Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Committee have been investigating JPMorgan's hiring practices in China for nearly three years, trying to determine whether they violated anti-bribery laws. RECOMMENDEDAugust: Ex-JPMorgan Chase V.P. guilty on 9 counts of insider trading According to sources, authorities found that the bank offered to hire the adult children of Chinese officials in exchange for new business, news reports said. People familiar with the investigation said that practice was called the "Sons and Daughters Program." The Times report said the settlement amount will be around $264 million, and will be paid by the bank and a Hong Kong subsidiary. Regulators and Justice officials are expected to accuse JPMorgan of the long-running bribery scheme in their announcement. However, the sources said, neither JPMorgan nor individual employees will be prosecuted criminally as a result of the probe. It's believed the bank was fully cooperative with the government's review. RECOMMENDEDAugust: JPMorgan Chase to pay $446K to ex-inmates over debit card program JPMorgan has argued that hiring well-placed employees and interns in China is a common practice in the expansive nation. As part of the reported settlement, though, the bank will agree to accept the investigation's findings and conclusions, the Times reported. Bloomberg reported that about $130 million will be paid to the SEC and $70 million to the Justice Department. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating, Bloomberg's report said. JPMorgan Chase did not comment on the matter Wednesday.

After Fox anchor Maria Bartiromo tweeted that Dimon “will get” the position, her colleague Charles Gasparino tweeted that Dimon does not want the job but would be willing to play an advisory role. Bartiromo later said that Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc partner who was campaign finance manager for President-elect Donald Trump, is also a contender and that a decision will be made at a meeting today. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. Another source said Dimon was not interested in the job. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 per cent at US$77.40 (RM337.40) on heavy volume. The question of whether Dimon would leave the bank to become Treasury secretary first arose on Nov 10, when news broke that a member of Trump's transition team had reached out to Dimon to gauge his interest in the role. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want the job, it is rare to say “no” to a president-elect's request to join his cabinet. Doing so would also put Dimon and JPMorgan in an awkward position, because the bank would then be regulated by an administration Dimon rejected. But if Dimon were to take the job, it is not clear who would replace him as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including chief operating officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO. Separately, yesterday a source told Reuters that JPMorgan would pay about US$200 million (RM871.75 million) combined to settle probes by the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission into hiring in China. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles US business moguls urge ‘commonsense’ governance approach JPMorgan CEO buys more than US$25m of company shares Bank of China top-paid executive said to quit as China lenders come to grips with slowing economy JPMorgan’s Dimon says US banks healthy, Europe lagging JPMorgan’s board takes some power from Dimon Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would "get" the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Nov. 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is "pitching hard" for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Nov. 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. "He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. "It is very difficult to replace someone like him." JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the Treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be Treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

Global stock markets were mixed on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, as investors awaited more policy details from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Oil prices retreated, snapping an overnight rally. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Posted: Wednesday, November 16, 2016 5:55 pm | Updated: 7:25 pm, Wed Nov 16, 2016. Asian markets mixed as US rally fades, dollar retreats Associated Press | 0 comments KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday as a seven-day rally on Wall Street petered out overnight. The U.S. dollar retreated slightly after hitting a 13-year high and oil prices slipped. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei fell 0.14 percent to 17,838.06 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index eased 0.1 percent to 22,265.16. China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4 percent to 3,192.25 and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 1,977.59. Australia's S&P/ASX rose 0.15 percent to 5,335.90, while benchmarks in Taiwan, Singapore and Southeast Asia gained. ANALYST'S TAKE: Alex Furber, sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore, said Asian markets are still struggling for direction amid uncertainties over policies from President-elect Donald Trump. "It is very difficult to differentiate what is campaign and what is rhetoric. There is a lot of uncertainty over what policies will actually be put in place in the first 100 days of his presidency," Furber said. "That is why the rally in the U.S. has started to fade last night." OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude extended losses, easing 11 cents to $45.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed down 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell nine cents to $46.54 a barrel in London. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks ended barely lower Wednesday as banks return some of the huge gains made since the presidential election last week but technology and consumer stocks climbed. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.3 percent to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.2 percent to 2,176.94 but the Nasdaq composite added 0.4 percent to 5,294.58. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 108.9190 yen from 109.15 yen late Wednesday, while the euro rose to $1.0701 from $1.0681. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The agreement would end a nearly three-year investigation into whether the hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws. The highly publicized probe set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted, the people said. Such leniency reflects the bank’s willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, several people familiar with the matter have said. The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and about $70 million to the Justice Department, the people said. Both authorities offer reduced sanctions to companies that assist in investigations. The Justice Department’s fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating JPMorgan’s hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. Earlier: U.S. Offers Incentives for Companies to Self-Report Corruption The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of “roadmap” for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, two of the people said. Public Offerings For two decades, Wall Street banks have led the way in taking Chinese companies public overseas, taking advantage of their global reach and ability to ensure billions of dollars of stocks get sold at premium prices. The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they’d hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. The challenge for authorities was to discern whether such relationships were coincidental or an improper quid-pro-quo. The U.S. has clamped down on corporate favors to foreign officials, which are tacitly permitted or even encouraged in some countries. From BNA: A New Era in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Investigations Goldman Sachs hired children of senior executives at China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, and New China Life Insurance Co. Morgan Stanley brought in an analyst whose father is both a top official of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp., or Sinopharm, and the chairman of China National Building Material Co. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By JeffReeves Columnist The election of Donald Trump has brought about a lot of changes in Wall Street’s outlook. For instance, financial stocks like Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.40%  and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.40%   have been on a tear on hopes of easier financial regulations. Meanwhile, tech stocks including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.50%  and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.39% GOOGL, -1.30%  have been hurting big-time on fears of pain abroad and a rollback of “net neutrality” safeguards among other concerns. Read: Trump-fueled rally in bank stocks has gone too far, analyst says More volatility is assuredly ahead as investors make tactical changes to their stock portfolios in anticipation of 2017. But one of the biggest areas of uncertainty and change right now isn’t in stocks at all — it’s in bonds. And perhaps surprisingly, the environment is looking pretty good for investors looking to buy bonds right now. Here’s what income and bond investors need to know about the next few months: Another interest-rate hike is preordained. According to the CME’s FedWatch forecasting tool, there is a 91% chance of a rate hike in December to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. That’s not surprising, seeing as the Federal Reserve has talked a big talk about rate increases in calendar 2016, but thus far we haven’t seen a single one. The expectation that the Fed has to eventually follow through on its hawkish talk — coupled with criticism from Republicans about the current rate picture — makes it very difficult to imagine we will see the December meeting come and go without another increase to benchmark rates. December will mark the one-year anniversary of the Federal Reserve’s beginning of “liftoff” in interest rates, and you can bet we will see the sequel to last year’s rate hike in a few weeks. Read: Fed’s Bullard still favoring December rate hike However, that hike has been priced in. Of course, it’s important to note that bond markets have already responded in kind after rates exploded in the past week or so. After trading briefly under 1.8% on Election Day, yields on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00%  hit 2.3% recently — the highest level since January — on expectations of a higher interest-rate environment. So if you’re waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting to make a move, you’ve missed the boat. Case in point: The popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury bond ETF TLT, -0.29%   has been pummeled about 6% in the past week as higher rates have weighed on the value of bonds and bond funds. That move is a clear sign that markets have already adjusted in a big way. Is biohacking the next phase of human evolution?(3:03) An underground community is experimenting with tech implants that could disrupt the healthcare industry by pushing the limits of the human body. But will regulation stop their devices from wide adoption? Don’t expect any more big moves until January. “I do believe this rate rise is about 80% of the way through — at least this leg of it,” legendary bond investor Jeff Gundlach told CNBC on Friday. That sounds about right, particularly as markets wait for the FOMC meeting on Dec. 13-14. After we get the rate hike everyone is expecting, we wait for the holidays and the lame-duck Congress to wrap. In other words, there’s a good two months of nothin’ ahead between now and Inauguration Day. Perhaps there aren’t any big moves in all of 2017. Of course, any big moves the market will make in 2017 must be incumbent on Trump and Republicans in Congress delivering on their big promises to break the U.S. out of its current stagnation. As James Mackintosh wrote rather cuttingly in The Wall Street Journal recently: “It has taken markets just four days to price in four years of President Donald Trump.” So even if some of the bull case lately for stocks eventually come to fruition, how much of a pro-business climate in Washington is already priced in? Keep in mind how ho-hum 2016 was with thin market volume and rates absurdly right back where they started the year despite all the Fed watching. Give me a good reason, then, why it has to be different next year. What’s the conservative bond trade? Given the already stretched valuation for stocks and the big move that just got priced into bonds, perhaps an investment in intermediate bonds isn’t that foolish after all. I personally have used the recent market move as an opportunity to rotate out of some equity positions trading at high levels and move a bit of cash back into bonds at long last, since the interest-rate risk seems reasonably low compared with prior months. A good middle-of-the-road play is the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF BIV, -0.38% that charges a rock-bottom 0.09% annually and yields 2.2%. With an average duration of 6.5 years, it doesn’t have long-tail risk regarding future rate hikes. And with about 50% of the fund in government bonds and the rest in investment-grade corporates, it’s focused on high-quality debt. What’s the aggressive trade? If you want to take the tiger by the tail, the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF JNK, -0.06%   yields about 6.5% after a modest selloff. If you believe Trump and the GOP will lead to less burdensome regulations and thus lower default rates in energy and mining — two sectors that are common playgrounds for junk bond offerings — this fund is worth a look. And keep in mind that while theoretically conservative long-term bond funds like TLT have taken it on the chin, JNK has seen a much more modest decline of less than 2%.

President-elect Trump and House Republicans led by Speaker Paul Ryan both have plans to lower that rate and also allow a lower tax rate on cash large corporations hold overseas. A new research report from JPMorgan makes the case that lowering the corporate tax rate could be huge for many large cap companies, and it points to five leading medical technology stocks that the firm believes could really benefit. Noted in their report: Companies that would benefit the most from a lower US corporate tax rate tend to: (1) be earlier in their development cycle, (2) have a higher percentage of both their sales and profits in the US; or (3) they’ve yet to take advantage of some of the opportunities presented by more aggressive, long-term tax planning – be it around intellectual property, manufacturing, or transfer pricing. Of the stocks JPMorgan thinks could see a large benefit, these are the four highest profile companies, which in addition are suitable for more aggressive growth portfolios. Baxter International This company has hit our insider buying screens over the past year. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) provides a portfolio of renal and hospital products. Its Renal segment provides products and services to treat end-stage renal disease, irreversible kidney failure and acute kidney therapies. This segment offers a comprehensive portfolio to meet the needs of patients across the treatment continuum, including technologies and therapies for peritoneal dialysis, in-center hemodialysis (HD), home HD, continuous renal replacement therapy and additional dialysis services. The Hospital Products segment manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, inhalation anesthetics and biosurgery products. This segment also provides products and services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies. Its shareholders are paid a 1.16% dividend. The Wall Street consensus price objective for the stock is $53.25. Baxter shares ended trading yesterday at $46.07 a share. Edwards Lifesciences This company pioneered the artificial heart valve, and it could be poised for big growth. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (NYSE: EW) provides products and technologies to treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients worldwide. The company offers transcatheter heart valve therapy products, comprising transcatheter aortic heart valves and their delivery systems for the nonsurgical replacement of heart valves. The company also provides surgical heart valve therapy products, such as pericardial valves for aortic and mitral replacement, and minimally invasive aortic heart valve system, as well as tissue heart valves and repair products, which are used to replace or repair a patient’s diseased or defective heart valve. Top Wall Street analysts feel that the company’s acquisition of privately held CardiAQ earlier this year made good sense going forward. CardiAQ has human implants of transcatheter mitrial valves, and Edwards is focused on the mitrial valve opportunity after its very strong success in aortic valves. The company also has had tremendous success with transcatheter valve replacement. Transcatheter heart valve replacements are rapidly gaining favor in the medical community for use in those patients who are deemed unsuited for open heart surgery, and they are a fast growing revenue stream for the company. The stock was hit hard recently and may be offering investors an attractive entry point. The consensus price target for the shares is $122.10. The stock closed Tuesday’s trading at $88.91 apiece.

The industry is packed full of plastic charge cards promoting glamorous rewards, points, cash-back offers, free trips, miles and sign-up bonuses. How do you sort it all out? How do you protect yourself from getting burned by these big businesses? The FOX31 Problem Solvers sat down with travel and finance writer Jason Steele to get advice on how to get the best bang for your buck without getting baited into a bad deal. Cash reward credit cards If cash rewards are what you’re after, Steele says cards offering one-point-per-dollar is the old industry standard. Steele suggests Chase Freedom Unlimited, Capitol One QuickSilver Cash and Barclay CashForward World MasterCard. All three cards offer 1.5 percent cash-back on all purchases with 0 percent annual fee. Citi Double Cash offers 1 percent cash back on purchases and another 1 percent when you pay off your purchase. Chase Freedom and DiscoverIT offer 5 percent cash back on rotating categories when you buy things like gas, food and groceries. Travel reward credit cards If you’re more interested in travel: Chase Sapphire Reserve $450 annual fee 3 points per dollar on travel Earn $300 a year in travel credit Spend $4,000 in first three months and earn 100,000 bonus points to spend toward airfare, hotels, cruises, car rentals Access to airport business lounges Barclay Arrival Plus No annual fee for the first year $89 annual fee after first year Receive two times miles on every dollar purchase Spend $3,000 in first three months and earn 50,000 bonus miles Capitol One Venture Card No annual fee the first year $59 annual fee after first year Receive two times miles on every dollar purchase Spend $3,000 in first three months and earn 40,000 miles Keep in mind, too, Denver hub airlines such as United, Frontier and Southwest each has a card with perks, points and bonus miles. If you’re more interested in sign-up bonuses, Steele suggests going for the greatest roll-out bonus but says it’s not for everyone. “If you’re an inexperienced credit card user, you don’t want to be lured into a product that might not be right for you” Steele said. Steele said paying off your credit card in full each month will rake in the most rewards. If you aren’t able to pay off your credit card statements in full, Steele suggests shopping around for a credit card that boats an interest free balance transfer to help pay off the debt.

The BOJ can remain on hold unless the yen strengthens past 100 against the dollar, a possibility that is "pretty much gone" following Trump’s victory, Hideo Hayakawa said in an interview Thursday. “An early spring has come to the BOJ,” he said. Hayakawa’s comments add to the views that Kuroda will keep policy unchanged for the rest of his term through April 2018, unless he faces some shock. The yen dropped to an almost six-month low  this week, which should help corporate profits, raise import prices and may boost inflation as well. Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have said more easing is unlikely before Kuroda’s term ends, and the share of economists who don’t expect any additional stimulus rose to 35 percent ahead of this month’s policy meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey conducted late October. While Trump’s actual economic policies are unclear, it’s safe to say he would expand the fiscal deficit through tax cuts, said Hayakawa, who left the central bank in 2013. That will fuel inflationary pressures, trigger a rise in bond yields and strengthen the dollar, he said. “This is a bright spot for the BOJ,” although Trump’s rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal must be a headache for the government, he said. Leaders meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President-elect Trump met earlier on Friday, Tokyo time, in New York. The two men had frank discussions at their first meeting, according to Abe, who told reporters that it was a "warm atmosphere" and that the new U.S. leader was "trustworthy." Trump’s victory caused a surge in bond yields in the U.S. and other nations, and the dollar has strengthened against all major currencies except the pound. The yen traded at 110.15 against the dollar as of 9:52 a.m. in Tokyo after touching 110.35 earlier. The BOJ isn’t so concerned about a rapid rise in Japan’s 10-year government bond yield as it remains around zero percent, Hayakawa said. The yield turned positive this week for the first time since Sept. 21. On Thursday the BOJ fired a warning shot at the bond market, announcing its first unlimited fixed-rate purchase operation. This yielded no bids, a sign that it was more of a demonstration exercise than an intended transaction in notes. Hayakawa praised the BOJ’s September decision to shift its target to the yield curve from increasing the monetary base, as this change made the bank’s policies more sustainable. While no additional easing is in sight, Japan’s consumer prices are likely to remain around zero percent even early next year, distant from the 2 percent inflation target, he said.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com 360insights Names Tim Rochon CTO as it Launches Consumer Rebates Module for Channel Success Platform™ WHITBY, Ontario–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Unveiling today a new consumer rebate and management module for its Channel Success Platform™ – the world’s first cloud-based sales and marketing incentives software platform – 360insights also announced that it has hired former Loblaw Companies Limited VP of Information Technology Tim Rochon as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). “With his uniquely powerful combination of business and technology acumen, Tim is the ideal person to lead our future technology vision across an increasing number of market segments,” says 360insights founder and CEO Jason Atkins. “He has a strong track record of leading the vision, development and implementation of customer- and technology-driven innovation.” Rochon is a seasoned information technology and marketing systems manager with more than 20 years of leadership experience in the Canadian retail and financial services sectors, including senior roles at Loblaw, Shoppers Drug Mart, JP Morgan Chase, Sears Canada and CIBC. His role at 360insights is to lead the product development team in its mission to deliver best-in-class, software-based user experiences and business intelligence to the global brands served by 360insights. 360insights, previously known as 360incentives, has grown its business model as a cloud-based channel incentives platform underpinned by a robust state-of-the-art insights analytics engine. Its Channel Success Platform™ shifts the focus from channel program management to channel optimization, delivering for its clients’ higher integrity, data-driven, predictive decisions on where and how they direct their channel marketing spend. Rebates Module The latest development in the 360insights’ Channel Success Platform™ is the enhanced Rebates Module, which enables product manufacturers and marketers who offer promotional rebates to consumers, to deliver the most compelling consumer experience possible with the industry’s best online and mobile claim submission platform. Capitalizing on a multiplicity of consumer touchpoints, the 360insights Rebates Module delivers a transformational rebate experience to consumers and helps marketers increase lifetime customer value by giving them the analytical tools to understand, predict and act on real-world consumer behaviors. The reality is that most consumer rebate programs do not realize their full potential. Customers are often cynical, submissions are cumbersome and the redemption process can be frustrating. Even after the rebate is completed, marketers have no way to measure the results and effectiveness of the promotion. Lost is the opportunity to learn more about the consumer and ensure that the last impression of the brand with them is a good one. “Consumer product companies need to advance their traditional channel marketing practices in order to build brand advocates, make intelligent data-driven decisions and ensure the rebate transaction is a springboard for future brand loyalty, customer retention and increased market share,” Rochon says. “The enhanced Rebates Module we’re launching today enables all that to happen by connecting manufacturers, dealers, sales associates and consumers with a digitized rebate management solution that is seamless, brand-consistent and user-focused from end-to-end,” he says. “It is also the first module enhancement of many more to come that will elevate the value of the Channel Success Platform™.” ABOUT 360insights 360insights.com is the originator of the Channel Success Platform™, the first truly integrated software-as-a-service platform to enable brands to optimize their partner marketing and consumer incentive spend. Based in Whitby, Ontario, the company serves over 100 of the world’s top brands and has expanded to have operations around the USA and UK. In the past year, 360insights has raised over $40 million in private investment capital to accelerate the global growth and adoption of the Channel Success Platform™. With a company culture built around the simple concept of happiness, the company was awarded Employer of the Year honors in the Toronto Region Board of Trade’s 2016 Business Excellence Awards and has been recognized multiple times as one of Canada’s Best Small to Medium Employers.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit The Dark Side Wall Street’s Vampire Squids Pucker Up for Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER The Dark Side Wall Street’s Vampire Squids Pucker Up for Trump But the bond market suggests a more sinister future. by William D. CohanNovember 17, 2016 5:36 pm Email Facebook Twitter Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Bloomberg (Flag), by Joshua Lott (Trump), both from Getty Images. “I think he’s smart enough to know that doing something terribly favorable for the Street in the early days is probably not to his benefit,” one senior Wall Street executive told me recently, speaking, of course, of president-elect Donald Trump. “Why stoke the fires of Warren or Sanders or anybody else if you don’t have to?” Nevertheless, this person continued, the financial industry was finding much to like in Trump. “This is pretty tough for a lot of people,” this person said. “In our firm, there were a lot of us that expected a different outcome, but I don’t see anybody wandering around with tears in their eyes.” After eight years of languishing in the wilderness—seemingly ignored and unloved by the Obama administration—Wall Street appears to be buoyed by an election result that has much of America and the international community reeling. Banks have been on a tear since Trump inconceivably won the presidential election last week. JPMorgan Chase’s stock has hit its all-time high, moving up more than 15 percent in a week. Goldman Sachs is up more than 18 percent. Morgan Stanley’s stock is up around 20 percent. The stock of Bank of America, the home of Merrill Lynch for the past eight years, has gone up more than 25 percent. “I think it’s correct for the [stock] market to be aggressive right now,” investor Wilbur Ross, who is under consideration to be Trump’s Commerce Secretary, said on CNBC on Tuesday. “ . . . Trump’s policies, as you can see from everything he’s said . . . are expansive. It’s fiscal policy being put to work.” Wall Street is not without reservations about the president elect. The Street long ago washed its hands of Trump after he singed banks repeatedly by building, dismantling, and then rebuilding his private empire. The only major financial firm still doing corporate business with Trump is Deutsche Bank, and that is despite the fact that Trump sued the bank, in 2008, after he refused to repay the money that he borrowed to build the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. (Trump claimed a force majeure as a result of what he argued was Deutsche Bank’s role in causing the financial crisis. The parties have since settled their legal dispute.) And then there are Trump’s actual policy prescriptions, which aren’t any rosier for Wall Street. Trump has repeatedly said he favors ending the “carried interest” tax break that allows private-equity moguls and hedge-find titans to pay taxes at lower rates than most ordinary Americans. (Trump, too, said he has benefited from the “carried-interest” provision, as well as from a blizzard of other tax breaks unique to real-estate developers.) He has also said he would like to bring back the Depression-era law that once separated investment banking from commercial banking. But Wall Street, which makes its money from hedging risk and betting on future outcomes, is wagering that the good will outweigh the bad—that Trump won’t follow through on the elimination of the carried interest provision or the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall. (During a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on October 22, where Trump laid out his agenda for his first 100 days, neither of these items made the list.) And some are surely buoyed by Trump’s declaration that he would like to dismantle the still-being-implemented Dodd-Frank law, the 2010 legislation that greatly ratcheted up the regulation of Wall Street in the aftermath of the crisis. (Though that, too, didn’t make the list of topics during the Gettysburg speech.) In the meantime, as that executive seemed to suggest, Wall Street recognizes that it has already won the big bet. Trump’s victory has, at the very least, signaled the end of Elizabeth Warren’s reign of terror against the financial services industry. For nearly a decade, her hot rhetoric has been infinitely worse than any business or legal disputes that Wall Street has had with the president-elect. The future seems brighter, too. Once upon a time—like, 10 days ago—Warren and her partner-in-arms, Bernie Sanders, could eviscerate a banker with little more than a withering glance. Now, Wall Streeters are everywhere. In addition to Ross at Commerce, Trump seems ready to name as Treasury Secretary billionaire Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and the architect of the extraordinarily lucrative 2009 acquisition of IndyMac, a failed California bank, for $1.55 billion. Five years later, Mnuchin sold the bank for $3.4 billion. “Both are good friends of mine but, more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know,” billionaire investor Carl Icahn tweeted on November 15. Steve Bannon, Trump’s newly appointed White House senior advisor, used to work at Goldman, too, as did hedge-fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, who is also a member of Trump’s transition team. That’s an awful lot of Goldman people on the small Trump team, especially considering Goldman has made a particular point of not doing any business with the guy. VIDEO: Donald Trump’s Short List for Cabinet But Wall Street’s newfound infatuation with Trump isn’t without significant hesitation. The bond market, quite notably, has freaked out over the Trump victory, and that is quite a big deal. The bond market, after all, is a leading indicator of what it will cost ordinary Americans to borrow money in order to buy a new home or car, or to refinance an existing mortgage. Or what it will cost businesses to get a loan to build a new plant, buy new equipment, or hire more people. It will now cost everyone more to borrow money than it did a week ago (albeit at rates that remain low by historical standards). Since the election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has increased to around 2.3 percent, from around 1.8 percent on the day of the election—an extraordinary 27 percent upswing in yield for a market that rarely sees such dramatic movement. (The price of 10-year Treasuries has fallen a corresponding amount since bond yields move in inverse proportion to their price.) Not only is the bond market 10 times larger than the equity market, but it is also often a better predictor of how a sudden change in political and fiscal sentiment effects the economy. And right now the bond market is trying to tell us that it fears Trump’s policies will be fiscally irresponsible, as befitting the man who once proudly referred to himself as the “King of Debt.” The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has analyzed Trump’s plan to spend $1 trillion on overdue infrastructure projects while also dramatically cutting corporate and personal income tax rates and concluded that the national debt would increase to more than $27 trillion during the next decade, from around $20 trillion today. For a man who campaigned on the promise of reducing our national debt, a projected 35 percent increase is not exactly heartwarming. Of course, Trump and his team of supply-side, trickle-down aficionados—such as Ross, Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore —dispute the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. They are busy arguing that the combination of tax cuts and infrastructure spending will get the economy roaring again, and that 4 percent annual G.D.P. growth should be expected. With that kind of growth, tax receipts would presumably flood the Treasury and our national debt, now 105 percent of G.D.P., would be greatly reduced, not greatly increased. This is a specious argument at best, but one I found myself having on CNN the other night with Grover Norquist, another of the old Reagan-era warhorses. Norquist’s point was the old saw about how tax cuts will be a huge stimulus to economic growth. But he forgets to mention how the Reagan tax cuts, along with those by the two Bushes, vastly increased the national debt and the nation’s level of income inequality. I argued that it’s easy to say on national television that G.D.P growth will miraculously ratchet up to 4 percent. It’s a lot more difficult for that to actually happen Even on Wall Street, some people recognize the flaws in Trumpian arithmetic. I had lunch the other day with a senior banker—a Hillary Clinton supporter—at a boutique firm, and he was lamenting the turn of events. Yes, he said, he was sad his preferred candidate had lost. Yes, he said, he was sad about what he feared a Donald Trump presidency would mean for the nation, notwithstanding the benefits that might accrue to him personally and to his firm. “Do I really need another flat-screen TV on my wall if the price we have to pay for that is Trump?” he asked, wistfully, as he tucked into this lightly grilled swordfish.

Now, according to CNBC, Trump has decided to expand beyond just Goldman alumni, and is allegedly considering JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as the next US Treasury Secretary. BREAKING: Trump advisers considering $JPM CEO Dimon for Treasury post - sources https://t.co/Unij5oIyNe pic.twitter.com/TezAC3aOn0 — CNBC (@CNBC) November 10, 2016 Needless to say, we can only hope that this is an attempt to scare clicks by CNBC instead of the actual truth, because if Trump hopes that he can "drain a swamp" by hiring the swamp puppet master, he - and millions of his supporters - will be very disappointed. As for Dimon, or Mnuchin, they will be delighted: as a reminder, as Hank Paulson demonstrated so well, the only reason why bankers become Treasury Secretaries, is to be allowed to sell all their corporate stock upon moving to public office, *tax free.* That said, as CNBC also adds, Dimon passed on the opportunity: "In the wake of Donald Trump's upset victory, advisors have floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that the JPMorgan chief has said he would not be interested in the role."** » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Global Business - 5 days ago< > Embed Trump Said to Eye Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary 04:05 Nov. 14 -- Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin is reported to have been recommended for U.S. Treasury Secretary by President-Elect Donald Trump's transition team.

Six banks have played a major part in bankrolling the two largest private prison firms, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the GEO Group: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, and U.S. Bancorp, according to the ITPI's report, The Banks That Finance Private Prison Companies. CoreCivic and GEO Group use the banks' financing—which comes in the forms of loans, bonds, and credit—to buy up smaller companies that conduct residential reentry and sell ankle monitors for border agents to place on detained asylum seekers. That has allowed the two corporations to quietly monopolize the corrections and immigration enforcement industries. The banks, meanwhile, profit by collecting fees and interest on those loans, or investing their clients' money in the corporations' shares. At the end of June 2016, CoreCivic and GEO Group were $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in debt, respectively. Activists and lawmakers have long criticized the privatization of the prison industry and its partnership with Wall Street. As Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told International Business Times on Thursday, "It is wrong for private enterprises to bring a profit motive to incarceration and rehabilitation in this country, and I'm particularly concerned by how it’s fueled by tax law. In my view, most taxpayers would be disturbed to learn that their dollars are subsidizing corporate profits from the mass incarceration of minority and low-income Americans." And yet, as IBT points out, the relationship between Wall Street and the mass incarceration industry is likely to get a lot cozier under President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously expressed his support of privatization—especially for prisons and detention centers. IBT's Avi Asher-Schapiro writes: During the course of the presidential campaign, the private prison industry surfaced as an issue: Under pressure from activists, Hillary Clinton returned donations from GEO Group and eventually called for the end of for-profit detention. Trump charted a different course; the president-elect's Super PAC took in $100,000 from GEO Group, and he praised the industry on the campaign trail. "I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons," Trump told Chris Matthews last March. "It seems to work a lot better." Benjamin Davis, a researcher with the ITPI, told Shapiro that CoreCivic and GEO Group "need Wall Street to survive. They are dependent on the debt." Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice has said it would phase out the use of private detention—but under a Trump administration, IPTI expects that to change. In fact, immediately after Trump's shocking victory, CoreCivic and GEO Group's stocks skyrocketed—showing that, as In These Times put it on Thursday, "a President Trump is just what the private prison industry ordered." Many of GEO Group's facilities have been accused of violating prisoners' human rights. The Reeves County Detention Center in Texas was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015, while the nearby Karnes County Detention Center was the site of a hunger strike by incarcerated mothers. Mercedes Castillo, an immigration and criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles, told In These Times, "I am disheartened, stressed, anxious, and at a loss. Right now, after several of my clients have called, texted, emailed, Facebooked—sat in my office and cried— I have nothing to say but, 'I will fight for you and with you.'" "GEO group might be licking its lips right about now," Davis told IBT. "Trump's talking tough on crime, deportations, national stop and frisk—many signs point to a momentum shift towards more private prisons."

Florida District Marcia Heroux PoundsContact Reporter South Florida District’s small business loans surpass billion-dollar mark, data shows. Privacy Policy More small business owners snagged government-guaranteed loans to expand their businesses in fiscal 2016, new data from the Small Business Administration shows. The SBA's South Florida District saw lending of nearly $1.3 billion during this fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, which is an 8 percent increase over a year ago, the SBA announced Thursday. This is the second consecutive year that South Florida has exceeded the billion-dollar lending mark, according to the SBA district office in Miami. At the same time, the number of loans made by banks in the program increased by 12 percent. There were 2,709 district-wide loans, compared with 2,417 in fiscal 2015. "As we've recovered from the recession, it's the stronger small businesses that break the ice and get the loans," said Francisco "Pancho" Marrero, director of the South Florida District, which includes Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties and 21 other counties. "I'm confident this will go on. There's energy out there from the small business community, a sense of expansion, and I think it's translating into our numbers." Under the SBA lending program, business owners have lower down payments and often can take out longer loans, said Peter Salas, regional manager for specialty finance at JPMorgan Chase. "The SBA allows 20 to 25 years amortization," he said. Since the recession ended, more businesses have become profitable in the past two to three years and can invest in expansion. "Instead of repairing old equipment, they're replacing equipment. Instead of renting a warehouse, they're owning that warehouse," Salas said. Jeffrey Zaslow, co-founder of Overseas Aircraft Parts in Deerfield Beach, said he has a $2 million loan through the SBA that he has been able to renew for 15 years to finance the company's inventory. The 25-year-old company provides aircraft engines, parts and materials to airlines around the world. "Our business is very capital-intensive. While we don't need the SBA loan for day to day, we need it to acquire inventory," he said. The SBA approved 420 loans worth $191 million in Broward County, 316 loans worth $153 million in Palm Beach County, and 543 loans worth $232 million in Miami-Dade County. In total, the three counties saw an 8 percent increase in loan count over fiscal year 2015. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase banks were the largest lenders in the tricounty region during the year. In the SBA's primary loan program called 7(a), bank lending rose 12 percent to 2,406 loans over 2,139 in fiscal 2015. These are loans that provide financing to purchase equipment and machinery, inventory, fixtures and accessories, renovations and land, as well as construct new buildings, acquire existing businesses and repay debts. Nationally, the SBA approved more than 70,000 loans totaling $28.9 billion in loan programs for fiscal 2016. The total number and dollar amount of 7(a) loans increased by 1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, over the previous year. Marrero said the agency has increased lending from fiscal years 2011 to 2016 by 65 percent to Hispanics, 45 percent to African-Americans, 34 percent to women, and 13 percent to veteran business owners. "The SBA made strides ensuring business capital reaches those who need it most," he said. mpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650 Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The close: TSX rises as Yellen signals rate hike coming Add to ... Reuters Published Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 1:34PM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 4:04PM EST Comments AA Global stock indexes rose along with the U.S. dollar on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could raise interest rates “relatively soon.” Ms. Yellen, who testified on the economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee, indicated little had changed following the victory of Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. She said she intended to serve out her term, which ends in 2018, and indicated the Fed remained on track to raise rates at its meeting next month. Expectations have been high among investors that the Fed will raise rates in December. The dollar receded earlier in the day from a 13-1/2 year peak, though it turned higher after upbeat U.S. economic data stoked expectations of an acceleration in U.S. economic expansion in the fourth quarter. The dollar index, tracking the greenback relative to a basket of six foreign currencies, extended gains in U.S. afternoon trading following Yellen’s comments and was last up 0.5 per cent. In Toronto, Canada’s main stock index gained on Thursday in a broad rally as the country’s largest oil and gas company forecast higher production and lower costs in 2017. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 0.5 per cent after it said it expected production to rise by more than 13 per cent next year and spending to fall by more than $1-billion. The overall energy group finished slightly higher. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were in positive territory, with only materials stocks down on the day. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 92.87 points, or 0.63 per cent, at 14,826.09. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. erases a big early decline, finishing up 1.1 per cent to health care stocks higher. The head of the drugmaker’s mail-order pharmacy affiliate and a former Valeant manager were indicted on federal charges that they defrauded shareholders. The executives Andy Davenport and Gary Tanner were charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan on multiple counts including wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Valeant shares fell 5 per cent early Thursday after news of the arrests broke. The price recovered following an afternoon news conference at which Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said investigators are continuing to look for potential corruption and fraud that may have harmed shareholders and the marketplace U.S. stocks, which rallied after Mr. Trump’s surprise White House win on the potential for economic stimulus, edged up, led by a 1.2-per-cent gain in financials, which benefit from higher rates. “A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do,” said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The Fed, though, is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don’t want to hike too far too quickly.” The Dow Jones industrial average was unofficially up 35.68 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 18,903.82. The S&P 500  gained 10.18 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 2,187.12, , approaching its Aug. 15 closing record of 2,190.15. The Nasdaq Composite added 39.39 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 5,333.97.  “We’re still basking in the aftermath of the Trump election victory because of expectations for fiscal stimulus via lower corporate tax rates, but as time goes on investors will reposition based on what’s actually happening,” said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Miracle Mile Advisors. Mr. Trump’s expected increase in infrastructure spending is also expected to boost economic activity and inflation, and raises the possibility of more interest rate hikes. Traders are pricing in an 83-per-cent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was up 0.3 per cent, while Europe’s STOXX 600   rose 0.6 per cent. In the U.S. bond market, the yield curve steepened after the U.S. data suggested the labour market is tightening and inflation is beginning to gain traction. That prompted investors to sell government debt with longer-dated maturities. U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest increase in six months in October, while housing starts surged to a 9-year high, and jobless claims fell to the lowest since November 1973. The 10-year note fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.275 per cent. Overseas, the Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited bonds for the first time under a revamped policy framework as domestic debt yields surged in the wake of Trump’s election victory. More broadly, Japan’s efforts will raise questions about how far central banks such as the European Central Bank and others will be willing to tolerate steep and sudden rises in government borrowing costs. Oil prices settled slightly lower on Thursday, then fell as much as 1 per cent in the after-market session as a stronger dollar outweighed expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production. Oil started the day in the positive, with U.S. crude briefly up by as much as $1, on optimism that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would reach an agreement to cap production at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic about OPEC’s deal to limit oil output, while Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said OPEC members are ready to reach a “forceful” agreement, following a meeting with OPEC Secretary-General. But prices fell after the dollar index tapped a 13-1/2-year high on strong U.S. economic data and comments by Ms. Yellen that bolstered the case for hiking interest rates next month. The stronger dollar makes the greenback-denominated crude more expensive for holders of other currencies. “The strength in the dollar, that rate hike being priced in, is more of a concrete thing than the rumors and murmurs and ongoing rhetoric related to OPEC,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at energy data provider ClipperData. Brent crude settled down 14 cents a barrel at $46.49, before falling further to $46.12, down 51 cents, or 1.1 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude closed 15 cents lower at $45.42. It fell in post-settlement by 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45,01. Gold fell to a 5-1/2-month low on Thursday, giving up earlier gains as the dollar index tapped a 13-1/2-year high on strong U.S. economic data and Ms. Yellen’s . Spot gold was down 0.8 per cent at $1,215.50 an ounce, after falling to $1,210.73, the lowest since June 3. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.6 per cent at $1,216.90 per ounce. Gold turned lower as the U.S. dollar rose to the highest since 2003 against a basket of six major currencies. “With the move up in the dollar, that will continue to pressure gold prices,” said Dan Heckman, national investment consultant for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Kansas City. “Looking beyond today, we think that perhaps the dollar is starting to peak out a little bit in the near term and we might get a little bounce here in gold.” With a file from Bloomberg News Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Target's profit surges (Reuters)   MSFT-QMicrosoft Corp Latest Price$60.35 -0.29 (-0.48%) WMT-NWal Mart Stores Inc Latest Price$68.54 -0.65 (-0.94%) GC-FTGold Front Month Futures Latest Price$1,208.50 0.00 (0.00%) CL-FTCrude Oil Front Month Futures Latest Price$45.69 0.00 (0.00%) TSXS&P/TSX Composite Latest Price14,864.03 +37.94 (+0.26%) SU-TSuncor Energy Inc Latest Price$41.81 +0.59 (+1.43%) DJIADow Jones Industrials Latest Price18,867.93 -35.89 (-0.19%) COMPNASDAQ NMS COMPOSITE INDEX Latest Price5,321.51 -12.46 (-0.23%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,181.90 -5.22 (-0.24%) CSCO-QCisco Systems Inc Latest Price$30.18 +0.13 (+0.43%) BBY-NBest Buy Co Inc Latest Price$44.79 -1.20 (-2.61%) AAPL-QApple Inc Latest Price$110.06 +0.11 (+0.10%) WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$52.82 +0.33 (+0.63%) BAC-NBank of America Corp Latest Price$20.00 -0.08 (-0.40%) Updated November 17 7:01 PM CDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Regulators have spent almost three years investigating whether hiring by the American firm overseas violated US the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). To end the probe and settle charges it violated the law, JP Morgan has agreed to pay $130m to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), $72m to the Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve. The SEC said the bank had hired about 100 employees and interns over seven years who had been referred to it by foreign government officials, which resulted in the lender either winning or keeping hold of business that generated revenues of over $100m. According to the regulator, investment bankers at JP Morgan in Asia went around the firm’s standard hiring procedures by setting up a scheme in 2006 that enabled government officials and other clients to put forward candidates for jobs, which the bank described as a “Sons and Daughters” programme. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates Wall Street Credit: Reuters The SEC described JP Morgan’s misconduct as “blatant”, with bankers at the firm keeping spreadsheets to record the money that came from customers who had secured jobs for their children. At least $35m of JP Morgan’s profits were a result of the hiring programme, the SEC estimated. The fine is likely to rattle other banks as it has been common practice for businesses operating in China to employ potentially influential people. The Justice Department is thought to be examining the hiring practices of other US banks in the country. Andrew Ceresney, the director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said: “JP Morgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit.” He said that the bank’s employees “knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring programme because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative”. The fine took into account the fact that J Morgan, which is led by Jamie Dimon, co-operated with the SEC’s probe, and a spokesman for the bank said “we’re pleased that our co-operation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations”. The spokesman added: “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring programme in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved.

Yellen, who was testifying on the economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee, indicated little had changed yet following the victory of Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. She said she intended to serve out her term, which ends in 2018, and indicated the Fed remained on track to raise rates at its meeting next month. The dollar receded earlier in the day from a 13-1/2 year peak, though it turned higher after upbeat U.S. economic data, that stoked expectations of an acceleration of U.S. economic expansion in the fourth quarter, helped the dollar. The dollar index, tracking the greenback relative to a basket of key foreign currencies, was last up 0.1 percent. U.S. stocks, which rallied after Republican Donald Trump's surprise White House win, were mostly higher. "A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do," said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The Fed, though, is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don't want to hike too far too quickly." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.35 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,871.49, the S&P 500 had gained 6.81 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,183.75 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 24.57 points, or 0.46 percent, to 5,319.15. MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.3 percent, while Europe's STOXX 600 was up 0.5 percent. In the U.S. bond market, the yield curve steepened after the U.S. data suggested the labor market is tightening and inflation is beginning to gain traction. That prompted investors to sell government debt with longer-dated maturities. U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest increase in six months in October, while housing starts surged to a 9-year high and jobless claims fell to the lowest since November 1973. The 10-year note fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.263 percent. Earlier, the Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited bonds for the first time under a revamped policy framework, as domestic debt yields surged in the wake of Donald Trump's upset U.S. election victory. More broadly, Japan's efforts will raise questions about how far central banks such as the ECB and others will be willing to tolerate steep and sudden rises in government borrowing costs. Oil prices were higher as expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production outweighed global oversupply concerns. Brent crude oil was up 17 cents a barrel at $46.8, while U.S. was up 28 cents at $45.85.

Macy's products were among those on display at the FoodBizNJ event. - (AARON HOUSTON) Three food manufacturers and online retailers — who create different premium products without using preservatives by sourcing clean ingredients — walk into a room. No, that’s not an incredibly elaborate set up for a joke: It was the foundation for one of the most overlooked panels at the inaugural FoodBizNJ event on Nov. 2. “Food Manufacturers: Trends, Opportunities and Challenges,” moderated by Betty Janelle, executive director of the agribusiness and food banking division of JPMorgan Chase, brought together John Macy, founder and president of John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery in Elmwood Park, Carlos Vega, founder and president of Jersey Italian Gravy in Woodcliff Lake, and Patrick Leger, co-founder and co-owner of First Field in Skillman, to discuss the most common issues and topics facing their small businesses today. Here are some highlights from their conversation: Capitalizing on 'clean' ingredients “We have always had a clean label — we never even thought otherwise,” Leger said. “It is how we are different from our competitors, who have had a really hard time trying to retroactively clean up their products and have lost a lot of their credibility in coming out with something fresh against somebody like us who always used pure and simple ingredients from the get-go.” First Field’s minimalist brand label, created by a professional children’s book artist in Canada, reflects the fact that the company is above all committed to using clean ingredients. “We had always felt that product labels had way too much messaging — what it has, what it doesn’t — and we wanted our consumers to be able to develop an emotional reaction to our label rather than be told what to think,” Leger said. “We respect our consumers to do the research and understand what is going on. We see that more now with millennials, who want to know everything about their products. … So the idea was to provide a mosaic canvas to encompass this kind of authentic feeling.” Jersey Italian Gravy Carlos Vega, founder and president of Jersey Italian Gravy, left behind his corporate job in finance to purchase a beloved childhood pizzeria in West New York. He simply could not resist the “gravy” they had used that always resulted in unforgettable flavor. “When we bought the pizzeria, we were making 40 quarts of gravy every two weeks,” Vega said. “We tweaked the all-natural recipe and, by the time we were done with our new recipe, we were moving 40 quarts a day. Everyone was always asking for extra gravy.” Vega later sold the pizzeria and began to jar his “intellectual property” to become Jersey Italian Gravy in Woodcliff Lake in 2012. Today, over a dozen varieties of his marinara and vodka sauces are sold in over 4,000 stores nationwide, including even in Bed, Bath & Beyond, Stew Leonard’s and Christmas Tree Shops. Authenticity, Vega agreed, is key. “You don’t need a lot of ingredients to have a good product — it’s just about the sourcing of good tomatoes and the cooking processes,” he said. “People complicate things by adding junk, which is overpowering what the natural product should taste like.” Since Jersey Italian Gravy manufactures sauce on demand, Vega said it was imperative that it found a good manufacturing partner to ensure the right temperatures and quality control when packing. “We deliver the jars still hot to our customer — the hot packing is really what maintains the two-year shelf life on our products,” Vega said. Macy said his company has come a long way in terms of how it has packaged and sold its product. “In the beginning, we didn't even have a label — we were just selling directly to specialty shops who would put our products out on their counters and stack them up like log cabins,” he said. “The perception was, on the part of the consumer, that if it was being sold there, it was fine. Once we packaged our product, using ingredients you would find in your home kitchen, we learned that there was value in that.” While having a “clean” product and marketing it as such can be extremely lucrative these days, Macy said it is also important to remain vigilant in one’s market. “For a long time, we had written ‘all natural’ across the bottom of our packaging,” Macy said. “We actually just took that off, because word got around in the industry that there is a group of litigants specifically looking for (food manufacturers) making baked products with enriched flour, which was strongly recommended by the FDA in the 1940s as a means of getting Americans the nutrients that were leeched out in processing. It was earnest in its intent, but the nutrients that were being added back in were synthetically produced and therefore not ‘all natural.’ “All it takes it for one activist attorney to bring a class action lawsuit against you, and it becomes very expensive to defend yourself.” Increasing food safety measures Macy ran into a rather costly issue when creating a private label product for Nature’s Promise. John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery John Macy, founder and president of John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery, began his career in catering after college. He developed a recipe for spicy, twisted breadsticks with cheddar cheese and sourdough to serve to his clients in California. When he moved to New York in 1979, he installed a small oven and dough sheeter in his East Village apartment to continue baking and selling his “CheeseSticks.” By 1985, Macy’s recipe had become so successful that he was able to open a small storefront in the Lower East Side and began selling to multiple specialty retailers. John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery, which relocated to Elmwood Park in 1990, has since developed over a dozen different snacks since to sell to retailers such as Kings Food Markets and ShopRite. “While it has been very difficult to balance the growth of sales with the growth of our manufacturing capabilities, that has pretty much been our story for the nearly 25 years that we’ve been here,” Macy said. “And we are still seeing lots of new opportunities.” “The chocolate had all of its sub-ingredients properly declared, but soy was not bolded to identify it as an allergen. A buyer picked up on that, called and said they wanted us to take it all back,” he said. “If you’re not really careful, and your ingredient labels have a typo, you have the responsibility to take it out of the marketplace.” The error may not even be on your part, Vega added. “If you buy onions and tomatoes from the same grower and get a notification from them that there is E.coli, for example, then everything you ran with that batch has to be taken off the shelves,” Vega said. That is why retailers are now requiring additional “product sabotage” insurance to carry any size manufacturer’s products. “We just got hit with it this year; it cost us over $15,000 for a $2 million policy — and that’s on top of all of our other insurances,” Vega said. “It’s expensive, yes, but it does give you peace of mind should (a recall) happen.” Macy’s typographical error, he said, also cost his company several thousand dollars. But Macy said he still believes it is a good thing that the bar has been raised in terms of global food safety initiatives and measures. “It makes you better and it is worth doing,” he said.   'Private label' manufacturing John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery has had a good track record of producing “private label” products for other brands. Macy said he sees competition as being severely limited. “Chances are, if (a retailer) likes your product, they are not going to go to a contract manufacturer and say, ‘Can you match this?’ They are going to come to you,” Macy said. “You have the first opportunity — now, your margins have to fit within their formulas or they may have to go somewhere else. … The other thing you have to consider is that you may be competing with yourself, essentially — does that undermine the integrity of your brand? “Well, you may have to at some point. If you have a facility with fixed costs, as we do, you have an obligation to your staff and everyone that your business touches to stay in business. What is the volume you need to keep the lights on?” For Jersey Italian Gravy, Vega was able to rise to the challenge by thinking outside of the box. First Field What began as a family tradition and a hobby abroad has grown into a Skillman-based premium condiment brand ripe for growth. “We have terrible tomatoes in Quebec, but we made this homemade ketchup around the holidays to use in game dishes,” Patrick Leger, co-founder and co-owner of First Field, said. After relocating to New Jersey, Leger began tweaking and selling his mother’s traditional ketchup recipe by setting up an honors-system farm stand at the end of his driveway. His wife, Theresa Viaggiano, saw an opportunity to jar and sell it on a much bigger scale. The couple founded First Field in 2011 to manufacture all-natural original and roasted ketchups — with about half as much sugar and salt as other brands — as well as a cranberry sauce, pickle relish and pure strained and crushed tomatoes using fresh, fair trade ingredients. The company currently sells to retailers such as Kings Food Markets and Whole Foods. “We have been approached by retailers a few times to (make) private label products for them. We don’t do that, so we turned around and said, ‘Why don’t you give us the opportunity to make a brand new and unique recipe for you?’ ” Vega said. Whole Foods, he said, was the first one on board. “We came up with a Brooklyn-based marinara sauce for them. Then they took it a step further and said, ‘This is great, but why don’t we have your logo on your brand?’ ” Vega said. “Now, we are co-branding the sauce with them. Other retailers took note of that and started coming to us with the same request.” Not all of the distributors choose to put Vega’s logo on their jars, however. “But they are all our recipes. Out of (over a dozen types of products) we make, eight of them are co-branded or made exclusively for other retailers or distributors,” Vega said. This is a terrific option for both manufacturers and retailers, Vega said, in an age where consumers are beginning to wise up to what “private label” really means. It can also mean added security for manufacturers. “It is on (my partners’) manufacturing agreements that it is their recipe for as long as they continue to manufacture with us, but when we walk out that door, it’s ours,” Vega said. “That’s the way you keep the partnership.” For First Field, it is less about private label manufacturing or co-branding, and more about licensing strategies for the brand. “It’s complicated to work with farmers and process your own product. That is not simply something that can be ‘private-labeled’ away,” Leger said. “I see it as a trend that will endure — it is just the nature of economics — but even so, there is always room for nice brands to exist, even though we are competing against pantry staples that may be more competitive in price. We are challenged to grow and maintain our business by being different in our various spaces — and if consumers like a premium product and it continues to deliver on the qualities that they desire, people will continue to buy it.” While First Field is primarily a tomato business, Leger said, he does not want to be pigeonholed into any one product category. “We think we have the best tomatoes here in New Jersey and we have the access to them to make good products,” Leger said. “But, let’s say there is fantastic produce in another part of the country that we can make a value-added product from and be able to maintain quality control of the supply chain — if we are able to work directly with farmers from a fair trade perspective and if our operating philosophy existed in other businesses with fantastic access to product, that would definitely be something to think about.” More Garden State Grub • At FoodBizNJ, food and beverage industry leaders address $15 minimum wage issue • Welcome to the newest NJBIZ blog, Garden State Grub, covering all things food, beverage and business • Family-owned Laird, 236 years old, is jacked up over new revolution in cider and other apple liquors Share This Story On: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Meg Fry Follow @MegFry3 Meg Fry writes about women in business, millennials, food and beverage, manufacturing and retail.

Continue Reading Below The Dow, which snapped its seven-day rally on Wednesday, was little changed, weighed down by a fall in Wal-Mart <WMT.N>. Shares of the world’s largest retailer fell 4.4 percent after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly comparable sales. Yellen said the central bank could raise interest rates “relatively soon” and was prepared to adjust its outlook as the new administration takes shape. U.S. stocks had been on a tear since Trump’s surprise victory last week, with the Dow closing at a record level four days in a row. The rally lost steam this week as investors seek clarity on Trump’s campaign promises and brace for higher interest rates. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending are expected to boost economic activity and inflation, raising the possibility of more interest rate hikes. That sent the dollar index <.DXY> to a near 14-year high. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. “A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do,” said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The Fed though is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don’t want to hike too far too quickly.” At 11:03 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 17.19 points, or 0.09 percent, at 18,850.95. The S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 3.93 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,180.87. The Nasdaq Composite index <.IXIC> was up 13.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 5,307.69. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index’s <.SPSY> 0.75 percent rise leading the advancers. JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Bank of America <BAC.N> were up about 1 percent, boosting the sector. U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in six months in October, data showed. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in September. In other data, U.S. housing starts surged to a more than nine-year high in October and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a 43-year low last week. Cisco <CSCO.O> fell 5.3 percent to $29.90 after its current-quarter forecast fell below analysts’ estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,590 to 1,236. On the Nasdaq, 1,613 issues rose and 1,015 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 180 new highs and 13 new lows.

Selena Maranjian (TMFSelena) Nov 17, 2016 at 11:03AM When people refer to "the stock market" being up or down, odds are they have merely heard that the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is up or down. If you want to be a successful investor, it's important to understand what such indexes really are and how they can help you invest better. Let's take a closer look at the S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images. It's old The S&P 500 was launched in March of 1957, the year that West Side Story opened on Broadway and Paul McCartney met John Lennon. It originally held mostly industrial companies as well as some utilities and railroads. Financial companies were only added in the 1970s. Image source: Pixabay. 500 stocks, 80% of the market The S&P 500 has 500 component companies. As there are several thousand companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. market, 500 may not seem quite that significant. But get this -- they are 500 of the biggest companies in America and together, they make up about 80% of the overall market's value! Thus, as Standard & Poor's itself says, "The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities." The top 10 holdings recently were Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Amazon.com, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, JPMorgan Chase, and Google parent Alphabet. It's market-weighted The S&P 500 index is  the first U.S. market-cap-weighted index. The much older Dow Jones Industrial Average (which comprises just 30 companies), by contrast, is price-weighted. With a price-weighted index, the stocks with the highest prices will have the most influence, no matter how big or small the underlying company is. For example, Microsoft recently sported a share price near $60 and a market capitalization near $460 billion, while UnitedHealth Group had a share price near $150 and a market cap of $144 billion. Clearly, Microsoft is a much bigger company -- yet in a price-weighted system, UnitedHealth's stock moves would have more than twice the effect on the index as Microsoft's. The S&P 500, though, being market-cap-weighted, gives much more influence to Microsoft than UnitedHealth. Image source: Getty Images. Most funds lose to it You might assume that stock mutual funds managed by financial professionals who study stocks closely, deciding which to buy and sell, would perform better than simple index funds like those based on the S&P 500, which merely hold the same stocks as the index, with little decision-making required. You'd be wrong, though. Index funds tend to outperform actively managed funds. Indeed, according to Standard & Poor's, as of the end of June 2016, fully 87% of all domestic stock mutual funds underperformed the S&P 1500 Composite Index over the past 10 years. And 85% of large-cap stock funds underperformed the S&P 500. It's inexpensive to invest in Given that so many managed stock funds can't beat the S&P 500, it's quite sensible to just invest in an S&P 500 index fund. None other than superinvestor Warren Buffett endorses that idea: He says  that in his will, he offers these instructions for the money left for his wife: "Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.)" You can do so through many index funds from many fund companies -- just be sure to choose one with low fees, as there are very low fees to be found. One great choice is the the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY). It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the S&P 500 that works much like a stock, letting you buy as many or as few shares as you want throughout the trading day. It recently traded for about $218 per share, sported a dividend yield of about 2%, and charged just 0.1% in annual fees.

X State’s AIB share sale moves closer with advisory move Government to appoint investment banks to assist in future stock listing Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 16:30 Ciarán Hancock The selected groups will assist the State with early-stage preparations for an IPO of AIB shares. Photograph: Cyril Byrne         The Government has moved a step closer to the sale of AIB shares by preparing to appoint investment banks to assist in a future stock-market listing of shares. The Department of Finance has announced plans to run a tender among 12 investment banks and stockbrokers who are on an existing advisory panel. The capital markets panel comprises Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Nomura, UBS and Irish stockbrokers Davy, Goodbody and Investec. The selected groups will assist the State with early-stage preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) and will be appointed for an 18-month period providing the State with “optionality” through 2017 and well into 2018. They will work on a no-foal-no-fee basis. This means they will not get paid unless a transaction occurs. If the Government decides to press the button on an IPO, a wider banking syndicate will be appointed to move preparations forward. The Government would be expected to sell at least 25 per cent of AIB initially, which could raise up to €3 billion based on the €12.2 billion valuation placed on the State’s holding in AIB at the end of last year. The proceeds would be used to repay some of the national debt. Weak markets The Government had originally intended to float AIB shares this year but scrapped this plan due to weak capital markets, particularly for bank stocks. A six-month build-up to an IPO would be expected, during which AIB would be required to prepare the extensive documentation necessary for a listing, and to conduct roadshows with potential institutional investors around the world. Commenting on the tender process, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said: “My officials have commenced a competition process to procure joint global co-ordinators to enable a potential initial public offering of shares in AIB to the market. ADVERTISEMENT “While there is no fixed timetable for a sale at this time, given the long lead times involved in such a process this appointment is a necessary next step in order to provide the option to sell some of the State’s shareholding in AIB during 2017 or indeed early 2018.” “Such a sale is provided for in the programme for a partnership government and the ultimate decision will be subject to a range of factors including prevailing market conditions but the overriding consideration will be whether any transaction is likely to maximise the return for the State.” Strategic investment fund Separately, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is set to re-evaluate the State’s holding in AIB as part of its annual accounting cycle. “As was the case in 2015, ISIF will procure its own independent valuation of the investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland and a provisional valuation will be included in their Q4 2016 performance and portfolio update early in the new year,” the department said. AIB is 99.9 per cent owned by the State, having received a €20.8 billion bailout from taxpayers. The bank made a pretax profit of €1.9 billion last year, of which roughly half was from underlying trading and the balance from provision writebacks.       Read More Date for IPO of AIB shares drifts further out of view Pension deficit swells to €6.8bn at top companies Bank stress tests: setback to AIB and Bank of Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Irish News Gay Byrne to miss radio show over cancer concerns Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Sponsored Maia Dunphy: Let’s talk about fertility Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hammond says UK budget is constrained by high debt 17:31 Seen and Heard: Facebook secures payments services licence 16:59 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 16:48 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 14:58 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 14:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 2 Central Bank set to ease mortgage lending rules 3 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 4 Paul Krugman: Is there a Trump slump coming? 5 Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns 6 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 7 May’s changing vocabulary signals shift from ‘hard Brexit’ 8 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 9 Public sector pay rises?

View Details When choosing the best card for your Black Friday shopping, there are a few important things to consider: 1. How Do You Want To Save? There are two main ways to save more money by using a credit card to pay for Black Friday shopping. The first is by earning rewards such as cash back, miles or points when you pay. Another way you can save is by getting a credit card with a low intro APR period on purchases. That way you can pay off your Black Friday purchases over a long period of time without having to worry about the APR. This saves you money because you can avoid the interest you would pay if you were to carry a balance on your regular credit card. Even if you have the cash to pay for your purchases, taking advantage of a long intro APR period for your purchases can help you save by letting you keep the bulk of your cash in interest-earning accounts or other investment channels. 2. Where Do You Shop? You might be one of those people who doesn't head to specific shops to catch deals, but just goes around picking the fruit. But then, you may be a dedicated customer at specific retailers. If you do your shopping at many different stores and types of retailers, then look for a card like Citi® Double Cash Card – 18 month BT offer, a partner card, or Chase Freedom Unlimited℠ that gives you a good amount of cash back on all eligible purchases rather than purchases in set categories. Department store shoppers should take advantage of cards that offer higher cash back at department stores. Some cards give you high cash back for supermarket shopping or Amazon.com purchases. If you shop at one or two stores only, then a store rewards card may work fine. But bear in mind that many store cards have high APRs, and don't necessarily give you more rewards than other more flexible rewards credit cards. You may also be limited in how you can redeem the rewards you earn, and might not actually save much money. 3. How Much Time Will You Need To Pay Off Your Black Friday Shopping There isn't any point missing out on great deals and then paying more for the same thing a month or two later. If you don't have handy cash to pay for the things on your shopping list, then paying off your purchases over time is a good solution. You will want to avoid most store installment payment plans, as these usually come with nasty strings attached and high interest. A much better idea is paying for those amazing deals using a credit card with an introductory low APR period. Good low interest cards will offer 0% intro APR on purchases for up to 21 months from the time you open your card account. That means if you open your new card account just ahead of Black Friday, you can pay off your purchases over a long period of time. Just bear in mind that once the card's intro APR period ends, you will have to pay the regular APR. So make sure to pay off your balance in full well ahead of the end-date. 4. What Type Of Rewards Do You Want? The most common rewards you earn with credit cards are points, cash back and miles. Points can be redeemed through a points program. Each points rewards program is different, and provides different options when you redeem your points. Depending on the rewards program you may be able to redeem your points for merchandise, experiences, travel, gift cards and even cash back. Some points rewards programs give you a lot of value when you redeem your points for a certain type of reward. For example, Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card lets you convert points to frequent travel programs at a 1:1 conversion rate. The main downside of points is that the value you get when redeeming points for merchandise, travel or gift cards is decided by the credit card company. So it can be a bit of a hit and miss setup. Cash back is a much less complicated type of credit card reward. Basically, you earn a certain percentage of what you spend on eligible purchases back. Some cards redeem your cash back automatically as a statement credit, check or deposit into your bank account. Other cash back cards let you choose how you redeem your cash back, and may let you redeem for gift cards, travel or merchandise in much the same way as points cards. The main benefit of cash back is that your rewards have a fixed value in cash. If you earn $100 of cash back, this will normally convert into $100. So you know exactly what you are getting with a cash back credit card. Miles credit cards let you earn miles for eligible purchases. Some cards such as United MileagePlus® Explorer Card let you earn actual frequent flyer miles. Other miles cards, including Discover it® Miles and Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card, let you earn "miles" that you can redeem towards travel purchases at a miles to dollar rate. Using a miles credit card that lets you earn miles on all your purchases is one of the easiest ways to save on travel. 5. Online Or In Brick-And-Mortar Stores? Some credit cards let you earn extra rewards when you shop at big retailers through the card's deals program. Chase Freedom® lets you earn up to 15% extra cash back when you buy stuff using Shop Through Chase. Discover it® Cashback Match™ cardholders can use Discover Deals to earn extra cash back or score instant discounts when they shop deals online or in stores. Make sure to choose the card that suits your Black Friday shopping style. Remember that the card you use can mean the difference between getting up to 20% extra savings on stuff you buy and enjoying interest-free credit, or getting hammered with interest payments for the next year or more.

The dollar continued to appreciate against other currencies and reached its highest mark in 13 years. Banks took the biggest losses as a seven-day rally in that sector petered out. Industrial companies, also big gainers since the election, traded lower as well. The price of oil gave back some of its enormous gain from the day before. Graphics processor maker Nvidia and household names like Apple and Microsoft led technology companies higher. Rising stocks outnumbered decliners. The dollar has been very strong in recent years, just not this strong, and it’s been pretty stable compared to other currencies. But in the wake of the election, investors think the U.S. economy might grow a bit faster and inflation might pick up. “What’s pushed the dollar higher here in the short term is with the Trump win, particularly combined with (Republicans) holding on to the Senate,” said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Still, Wren doesn’t think the dollar will rise much further. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 3.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,176.94. The Nasdaq composite picked up 18.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,294.58. After a long losing streak before the election, the Dow had risen for seven days in a row through Tuesday and set several all-time highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also made large gains and are near the records they set this fall. JPMorgan Chase led banks lower as it fell $1.96, or 2.5 percent, to $77.40 and Morgan Stanley lost 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.19. Banks are coming off their best single week since the financial crisis as investors hope for higher interest rates and more profits from lending, as well as cutbacks in regulations that could boost bank profits. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other currencies, rose to its highest level since April of 2003. The dollar is rising in part because investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace in response to inflation stemming from the increased spending that President-elect Donald Trump has proposed. A stronger dollar hurts U.S. companies that do a lot of business overseas because it makes their products more expensive, and it affects their earnings when they are translated from other currencies back into U.S. dollars. However it makes imported goods cheaper for consumers in the U.S. The dollar slipped 109.15 Japanese yen from 109.32 yen late Tuesday. The euro slid to $1.0681 from $1.0718. Technology companies moved upward as they continued a rally from a day earlier. Graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $5.44, or 6.3 percent, to $91.63 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft, and Apple picked up $2.93, or 2.7 percent, to $110.04. Tech stocks had weakened since the election. Trump’s policies might affect their sales in China and other key markets, and a big surge this summer had brought some technology stocks to all-time highs. Retailer Target raised its profit forecast and its sales projections for the third quarter with the holiday season approaching. That came as the retailer gave a strong third-quarter report, as it put more emphasis on low prices after it stumbled in the second quarter. The stock gained $4.59, or 6.4 percent, to $76.03. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, reported a bigger profit and better sales than investors expected and its stock gained $2.90, or 3.9 percent, to $76.39. That helped lead consumer stocks higher. Home improvement retailer Lowe’s fell after it said traffic in stores was low during the third quarter, and Lowe’s reported a smaller third-quarter profit because of several big charges. Lowe’s lost $2.03, or 2.9 percent, to $67.02. Oil prices slipped. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 32 cents to $46.63 a barrel in London. The price of U.S. crude oil soared Tuesday as investors hoped the oil-producing OPEC countries will agree to a production cut that would boost prices. Energy companies fell. They had rallied on Tuesday along with the price of crude oil. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.21 percent from 2.22 percent. Bond yields, which are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages, have risen to their highest levels since the beginning of the year as investors expect inflation to rise. Bond investors hate inflation because it erodes the value of the fixed interest payments that bonds pay. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2 cents to $1.32 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold slipped 60 cents to $1,223.90 an ounce. Silver fell 12 cents to $16.93 an ounce. Copper fell 4 cents to $2.47 a pound. In Germany the DAX lost 0.7 percent while France’s CAC 40 was off 0.8 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 slid 0.6 percent. Asian markets finished mostly higher. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi in Seoul, South Korea gained 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed 0.2 percent lower. ———— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, dollar, cents, investors, stocks, other, Other stories from today: Vast shale oil field in Texas could yield 20 billion barrels Facebook apologizes for latest metrics errors Cisco tops Street 1Q forecasts     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

 Holders of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable "Total Consideration", which includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 of principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase (the "Early Tender Premium").

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Offer to Purchase, holders may tender Notes until midnight, New York City time, on December 1, 2016, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the "Expiration Date"). The settlement date for the Tender Offer will follow promptly after the Expiration Date. The Offerors expect the settlement date will be December 2, 2016. The Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If any of the conditions are not satisfied or waived by the Offerors, the Offerors will not be obligated to accept for purchase, purchase or pay for, validly tendered Notes, in each case subject to applicable laws, and may terminate the Tender Offer.

Ditto for the purple scarf for your sister.  Just as you’re deciding whether to splurge, a salesperson approaches with an offer that seems to come from the retail gods: Apply for an immediate store credit card and save 10 percent on today’s purchases. But take a breath, and read the fine print before deciding. And that goes for all the credit card offers stuffing your mailbox dangling a myriad of perks like airline miles, zero interest and cash back. Opening a new bonus-laden account during the holidays when some extra credit could make an extra-special holiday can be a good idea. Choosing wisely is key. Don’t buy that purse with the store card unless you can pay it off at the end of the month. That’s because store credit cards’ interest rates average about 23 percent, while a typical bank card rate averages 15 percent, according to Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. Play Video CBS Evening News The scary truth about store-branded credit cards A survey out Thursday says store credit cards can have interest rates twice as high as a regular bank card. Anna Werner has more on the cost of p... “That’s a significant difference, and the interest can override any discount if you can’t pay it off,” said Schulz. Still, some sign-up rewards can help brighten the holidays. The Chase Freedom Card offers a $150 cash back bonus to new holders who spend $500 over three months. “If you know you’re going to spend $500, get it -- and then you never have to use it again,” said Schulz. It’s important to consider what you buy and which dividends you’ll use when selecting a new card. An airline miles card may not make much sense now if the funds that you previously earmarked for exotic travel are now dedicated to a mortgage. What good is 5 percent cash back at gas stations if you don’t own a car? Creditcards.com has a tool to help you compare and select cards as does NerdWallet.com and ConsumerReports.org. The sites have information on annual card costs, interest rates and various perks.  You can find lots of options for no-fee cards, though don’t immediately dismiss the ones that require you to pay for privilege of stuffing the plastic rectangle in your wallet. The eye-popping $450 fee for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card may be a good deal if you’re a jetsetter. It comes with a $300 travel credit and $100 for the TSA Precheck program. Holders earn three points for every dollar spent on travel or dining, and you get a 100,000 point bonus for spending $4,000 in three months.  “You need to know how the card fits into your life,” said Schulz.   Zero interest rate cards that allow holders to pay back the cost of purchases over time without amassing fees can be especially tempting around the holidays. They help avoid what can be a nasty financial hangover in January and February. Schulz said to comparison-shop for post-grace-period interest rates. Be careful that the card doesn’t charge you interest going back to the date of purchase for the entire cost of the item even though some of it has been paid off. That’s more common with store cards than bank cards, however. Retailer Big Lots (BIG) offers its credit card holders who buy $250 worth of merchandise no interest for six months, a period that extends to a year if you charge $750 or more. But if you don’t pay it back on time, you’re hit with a 29.99 percent interest rate backdated to the time of purchase. That’s one big lump of coal. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Speculation reached a fever pitch on Wednesday that Dimon, the powerful chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, would join the Trump administration cabinet as the nation’s 77th Treasury secretary. “Hearing @jpmorgan ceo jamie Dimon will get treasury secy job. Big meeting tomorrow,” Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo tweeted. Dimon has said publicly "not suited for job/staying @jpmorgan" but its down to him and Mnuchin. We won't know for sure until end of week — Maria Bartiromo (@MariaBartiromo) November 16, 2016 The tweet sent the bank’s stock down to $76.88 before ticking up, to $77.40, a 2.5 percent decline. Dimon’s name was floated last week as being on Trump’s short list for the job. After Wednesday’s rumor, a source familiar with the Trump-Dimon discussion played down the likelihood of Dimon heading up Treasury, a job first occupied by Alexander Hamilton, founder of The Post. A bank spokesman declined to comment. Dimon, who is in Argentina, has said that he’s not interested in the job.

Mr Abe is seizing the chance to lobby the president-elect while key US policies are in flux and is expected to underscore the importance of the Japan-US alliance after Mr Trump raised the prospect of a US retreat from Asia during his election campaign. The surprise Trump victory has left many in Asia wondering whether the new US leader will rehabilitate the region’s two most controversial leaders, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Meanwhile, Mr Trump has again denied claims infighting is hampering the critical process of putting in place his cabinet. The president-elect took to Twitter, saying reports of chaos were “totally wrong” and everything was going “so smoothly”. Mr Trump also dumped his press pool again, raising flags about access and transparency in the incoming administration. In the Democratic camp, deep divisions have opened in the wake of the election result. The solution? An agenda to align with many of Mr Trump’s proposals that put him at odds with his own party — such as paid maternity leave — is being constructed.

LinkedIn has more than 6m registered users in Russia and is the first major social network to be blocked by Russian authorities. (Reuters) Scalps at Rio Tinto The FTSE 100 mining company has fired Alan Davies, chief executive of its energy and minerals division, and Debra Valentine, the head of legal affairs, after reviewing a $10.5m payment made for advisory services on a giant iron ore project in Guinea. These are waters of open conflict uncharted for an organisation unfortunately well practised in the art of crisis management. (FT, AFR) £100bn Brexit hole Chancellor Philip Hammond will admit to the largest deterioration in British public finances since 2011 in next week’s Autumn Statement when the official forecast will show the UK faces a £100bn bill for Brexit within five years. Meanwhile, Martin Lewis argues in the FT that the economic statement gives Mr Hammond the chance to put things right on student loans.

The bank will pay roughly $200 million combined to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department and more than $50 million to the Federal Reserve, the source said. There will not be any individual prosecution at this time, the source said. The SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring. The Justice Department opened a parallel investigation around the same time. Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China's politically connected. While close ties to top government officials are a boon to any banking franchise across the world, they are especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions. The SEC, JPMorgan and the Justice Department all declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank's hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said.

The tech sector was the day’s leading gainer, but was more than offset in the DJIA and S&P 500 indexes by financials and utilities which led the losers. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $45.57 a barrel, down 0.5% for the day. December gold dropped less than 0.1% on the day to settle at $1,223.90. Equities were headed for a mixed close before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.32% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.20%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.32%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded down 2.81% at $77.13. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $80.44. Volume was roughly equal to the daily average of around 16 million shares. The big bank had no specific news. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded down 2.32% at $206.28. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $211.77. Trading volume was about 35% above the daily average of around 3 million. Investors could have been taking some profits in financial stocks that have run up sharply since last week’s elections. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) traded down 1.74% at $62.54. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97to $65.46. Volume was about 25% below the daily average of around 6.8 million shares. The company had no specific news Wednesday, but pharmaceutical stocks, like financials, may have seen some profit-taking. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded down 1.27% at $85.71. The stock’s 52-week range is $71.55 to $95.55. Volume was about half the daily average of around 10.7 million shares. The EIA report on oil inventories showed a bigger-than-expected build and a rather modest production decline. Of the Dow 30 stocks 12 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 18 are set to close lower.

Trump’s unexpected victory has been mixed. While many lauded the New York mogul’s convincing victory last week, others took to the streets in protest of a president-elect they’ve deemed sexist, racist and xenophobic. This week, some protests in major cities and on college campuses stretched into their sixth day, and while most have remained peaceful, others have not. Anti-Trump demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, quickly escalated to violence last week with protesters destroying property, blocking streets and throwing projectiles at police officers. Just since last Thursday, riots have caused $1 million worth of damage in Portland and led to more than 100 arrests. Over the weekend, some of that dismay made its way to Mobile, as the Alabama Green Party held a “Rally Against Trump(ism)” in Cathedral Square. Contrary to what some assumed, the organizers in Mobile weren’t just protesting the election’s outcome. “A lot of people think [Donald Trump] came into power because he gave a racist, misogynistic, homophobic message, and that most people that voted for him hold those same ideas in their heart, and I’ll say, ‘Yes, some of them do,’ but most voted for Donald Trump because he brought an economic message to the people,” Tyler Henderson, chair of the Alabama Green Party, said. “This is a message that resonated, and you can tell this because another economic populist rose up alongside Donald Trump, and his name was Bernie Sanders.” As many on the political left have done over the past week, Henderson laid some of the blame for Trump’s victory at the feet of the Democratic Party and its nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Claiming a need for a “political alternative to the Democratic Party” in Alabama, Henderson pushed for those at the rally — around 30 or so — to consider the Green Party. He and other speakers also condemned a rash of reported attacks and harassments directed at minorities since Trump’s election. On Sunday, Trump himself addressed those incidents in an interview with Lesley Stahl aired on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” telling those responsible to “Stop it.” In Mobile, Henderson called on Trump’s supporters and his detractors to speak out against that type of “bigotry” if it continues. “What we’re seeing now is a rise in very angry, but also very bigoted, ideology, and whether you like Donald Trump or not, that’s what’s happening because of his presidency,” Henderson said. “We don’t just call on the allies of minority communities and the allies of LGBT communities and allies of women — we’re also calling on you that voted for Donald Trump to stand up for what you claim to believe in and condemn these people.” Consistent with predictions that Trump had a miniscule chance of taking the White House, those that make a living through market speculation have also been wrong about the immediate effects a Trump presidency would have on U.S. financial markets. Before the election, a long-shot Trump victory came with a warning from Wall Street giants such as Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — an unexpected, unpredictable candidate seizing the presidency would cause a drop in stocks in favor of a more-secure bond market. Yet so far the opposite has proven to be true. Bond markets in the U.S. and in Europe have seen a wave of sales suggesting investors are betting on an economic policy under Trump that will favor a rise in interest rates. Still, with campaign rhetoric touting domestic growth and promises to dismantle longstanding international trade agreements, Dr. Reid Cummings, director of the Center for Real Estate and Economic Development at the University of South Alabama, said last week that Trump’s effect on the economy would be left to speculation until he takes office. However, he also added, “in general, business tends to like smaller government and less regulation.” If that holds true, he believes a Trump White House coupled with GOP gains in Congress could be “good for business” overall. Still, in port cities such as Mobile, Trump’s desire to negotiate “better deals” in existing international trade agreements is something local officials will likely be monitoring closely. To that effect, Jimmy Lyons, president of the Alabama State Port Authority, told Lagniappe some of his initial concerns have eased slightly over the past week, as Trump has moved away from the “talk of protectionism” in trade that came up during his campaign. Lyons says he now wonders how much of that was “just the heat of the campaign” and how much might live on to become executive policy. “Anything that could spark a trade war — where we put a tariff on our stuff, and then another country puts a tariff on their stuff — could have an effect on imports and exports, and that was one of the only things that was a significant concern of mine from the standpoint of operating a port,” Lyons said. “But given some of the softening we’ve seen now that the campaign has ended, I don’t know that those concerns are as valid any longer.” But while Trump’s economic policies might look malleable heading into 2017, his environmental policies don’t appear to be losing any steam from campaign trail. Last week he selected Myron Ebell, a leading contrarian of the scientific consensus on global warming, to head the transition of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has also maintained he would rescind the “job-destroying executive actions” President Barack Obama took related to climate change — including the Clean Power Plan aimed at limiting carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange was an early critic of that plan, joining 24 other states’ attorneys general in securing a stay on implementing the plan from the U.S. Supreme Court in February. “[It] would shutter coal-fired power plants around the country, including in Alabama, while killing jobs and raising power bills for hard-working families,” Strange said of the Clean Power Plan at the time. However, while Strange might be happy with the early signals from Trump’s transition team, they’re causing concern for environmental groups along the Gulf Coast — even among those that have historically worked with Democrats and Republicans alike. “During this time of presidential transition, one of the world’s most important environmental restoration efforts will continue in the Gulf region, and we urge the Trump administration to work with Gulf experts on any policies that may impact this region,” Kara Lankford, interim director of Gulf restoration at Ocean Conservancy, told Lagniappe. “At the same time, [we’re] concerned about the signals being sent by the Trump transition team, with a climate change denier currently being considered to lead the EPA transition team. Given the need for strong action on climate change to protect coastal communities, especially in the Gulf, we will be following this appointment closely.” Locally, Mobile Baykeeper executive director Casi Callaway said the environment of the Gulf Coast takes on a different level of importance because of how necessary it is to not only the area’s ecosystem, but also to its “jobs, economy, community, health and recreation.” If environmental support at the federal level is scaled back under Trump — and all signs suggest it will be — Callaway said, there will still be local environmentalists in multiple organizations committed to doing what’s best for Mobile Bay. “If over the next four years environmental protection is no longer a priority, Mobile Baykeeper will just have a bigger job to do,” she said. “As the environmental advocate for our coastal community, [we] will continue to achieve progress toward a healthier, more sustainable environment with the support of our members and volunteers who are committed to clean water, clean air and healthy communities.” Congressman: State could benefit from Trump presidency By Dale Liesch Voters in Alabama overwhelmingly chose Republican President-elect Donald Trump over Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton on Election Day, and that loyalty may pay off as his administration begins to take shape. Not only are several Alabamians being considered for positions inside a Trump White House, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, but with the GOP retention of the House and Senate, some of the state’s representatives could see new leadership roles on Capitol Hill. Sessions, who is from Mobile, has been rumored to fill a number of Trump’s cabinet positions in the week since Trump’s Electoral College win: a possible attorney general post, or maybe secretary of defense or secretary of homeland security, according to media reports. Sessions, one of the first senators to throw his support behind Trump, will apparently be rewarded for his early support of the real estate magnate. U.S. Rep Bradley Byrne (R-Montrose) said Sessions would do a wonderful job as a member of Trump’s cabinet. “I’ve known Jeff Sessions for 40 years,” Byrne said. “He has a high level of integrity … he’s well respected. He’ll be a tremendous asset to the Trump administration.” Sessions’ appointment to a cabinet position will undoubtedly help the Mobile area when it comes to decisions of the federal government, Byrne said. Sessions’ possible cabinet appointment would not be the first time he’s been tapped by a president. He was rejected for a federal judgeship in 1986, in part due to his actions as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and for his views toward the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Sessions successfully ran for Senate in 1996 after a brief stint as Alabama Attorney General. In addition to Sessions possibly leaving the Senate for the White House, Alabama could also benefit from the GOP’s retention of a congressional majority. Byrne said GOP Sen. Richard Shelby will maintain his high position in the senate and other Alabama members of Congress could see their roles expanded. For instance, U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) could see greater responsibility as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Byrne said. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Saks) could see a promotion from sub-chair of the House Armed Services Committee, he added. “For the rest of us, it’s too early to know,” Byrne said. Alabama’s support of Trump could pay dividends when it comes to policy decisions and federal spending as well, Byrne said. Progress on the Interstate 10 bridge over the Mobile River should continue under a Trump administration, he said. The president-elect has championed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, which Byrne thinks will include money for the federal portion of the project. The state’s portion of the project could come from tolling or Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act money, which is given to Gulf Coast states by oil companies in exchange for drilling rights off the coast. “I expect the design portion to be complete by the end of next year,” Byrne said of the bridge project. “The state should be able to decide on funding by then. Construction could begin as early as 2018.” A Trump presidency could also mean continued support for the U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, which would benefit Austal, Byrne said. Trump’s call for an expansion of the U.S. Navy fleet from 276 ships to 350 ships would mean the build-out of the LCS program’s 52 ships would have to continue, Byrne said; 26 of those ships would be built in Mobile. In addition to infrastructure funding and increased military spending, a Trump administration could return the state’s red snapper season to a normal duration, Byrne said. Trump would be able to “reach down” to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Fisheries Services to get them to end the current regulations, he said. In a column released this week, Byrne also said he looked forward to working with Trump on securing the border and repealing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, “once and for all.” Baldwin turns out for Trump By Jane Nicholes Baldwin County voters turned out in droves to vote for Donald Trump, achieving record turnout in numbers if not in percentages. Some 95,000 people went to the polls, and they stood in lines that often ran outside, down sidewalks and around buildings. When the votes were counted, 77 percent voted for Trump, 19 percent for Hillary Clinton and the remainder for a smattering of other candidates. Only two small precincts, the Vaughn Community Center near Stockton and the Douglasville Boykin Center in Bay Minette, went for Clinton over Trump. Baldwin County Probate Judge Tim Russell had predicted turnout would be at 80 percent or above and was surprised to find on Wednesday that it was actually 65 percent. He visits the polls on Election Day and makes projections based on the turnout when he arrives at a precinct. “The trend dropped way off later in the day, which told me that the younger voters didn’t come out after work like we thought they would,” Russell said. He said he was surprised, but he also noted that rain lingered late into the day in south Baldwin County. Lines may have discouraged some voters as well. Sheer numbers, though, set the record. “That’s the biggest turnout that we’ve ever had in the history of the county by far,” Russell said. Four years ago there were 69,000 voters for the presidential election. Russell said the population increase over four years plus the turnout show that he will need more money in the future to run high-profile elections. The next such election will be in June 2018, when the governor, Legislature, statewide and county officials will be on the ballot. Baldwin was one of 14 counties to experiment with a new format for checking voter IDs. People in two precincts walked in, had their driver’s licenses scanned and then signed in on a screen, like a credit card transaction. The experiment was confined to the Bay Minette and White House Fork precincts and proved to be faster than manually looking for a voter’s name in a book, Russell said. He said 95 percent of Baldwin County voters have driver’s licenses. While those two precincts were faster, nearly 5,000 absentee ballots took until 1 a.m. to count, Russell said.

Monday, November 21, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Asia shares win reprieve as bond rout pauses for now November 17, 2016, Thursday TOKYO: A pause in both the sell-off in global bonds and sharp rise in the dollar following Donald Trump’s election victory, together with Wall Street’s record high overnight helped Asian shares steady yesterday from a four-month low struck a day earlier. President-elect Trump’s plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending would boost demand while his proposals to deport illegal immigrants and impose tariffs on cheap imports, if implemented, are seen likely to drive inflation higher. That prospect has given rise to expectations that US interest rates will rise faster than earlier anticipated, making the dollar stronger, but investors are still trying to assess what opportunities a Trump presidency will bring. “The markets are having a bit of a pause at the moment. But people still want to do more of this trade,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “If you look at the US markets, investors are looking at coming infrastructure spending and so on and they are rotating to stocks from bonds.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 per cent on Wednesday, bouncing back from a four-month low touched earlier this week. The dollar’s strength has fanned fears investors could shift funds to the United States from emerging markets. Emerging market stocks managed to rise 0.3 per cent on Tuesday after having fallen 7 per cent over the previous four sessions. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.1 per cent to nine-month high on Wednesday, thanks to the dollar’s retreat from a 5 1/2-month high against the yen. The dollar was trading at 109.03 yen in late morning trade in Asia, having slipped slightly off high of 109.34 yen struck on Tuesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.29 per cent to a record high while the S&P 500 gained 0.75 per cent. Since Trump’s unexpected victory last week, US shares have rallied while US bond prices tumbled, pushing up their yields sharply. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries slipped to 2.207 per cent from Monday’s 11-month high of 2.302 per cent, although that is sharply above its levels around 1.86 per cent before the election. US retail sales rose more than expected in October, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. US interest rate futures are pricing in an 85 per cent chance of a rate hike, compared to 75 per cent before the election. The two-year US notes yield fell to 0.989 per cent on Wednesday, having hit a 10-month high of 1.029 per cent on Tuesday. Nikko SMBC Securities estimates US two-year notes are currently pricing in five Fed rate hikes in the next two years, said senior strategist Makoto Noji. “If we base our assumption on (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen’s gradualist approach, which can be roughly translated as two rate hikes per year, we could say that the market has already priced in tightening they could reasonably imagine at this point,” Noji said. “But of course if Trump’s policies stoke inflation that cannot be contained by two rate hikes per year, the US bond market could see big moves again,” he added. Sharp gains in US bond yields have drawn investors to the the dollar, and its index against a basket of six major currencies hit its highest level in almost a year on Tuesday. It slipped slightly in Asia on Wednesday to 99.982, but was still just 0.5 per cent away from reaching its highest level in more than 13-1/2 years. The euro traded at US$1.0724, just above Monday’s US$1.0709, its lowest level in almost a year. The Chinese yuan also weakened to 6.8703 to the yuan, its weakest level since December 2008. Gold traded at US$1,232.3 per ounce, not far from a 5 1/2-month low of US$1,211.8 seen on Monday. In contrast, oil prices hovered near their highest levels in about two weeks after having jumped nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday on bets OPEC members will agree to cut output when they meet later this month. US crude futures stood at US$45.67 per barrel, after having risen to US$46.09 late on Tuesday, their highest since Nov 2. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

PHOTO: ST FILE Get smart Nov 17, 2016 5:50 AM Singapore SINGAPORE will close out the year by rolling out a slew of experiments and plans to boost the efficiency of financial transactions through technology, including the use of digital currency, as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) makes good on its ambition to build a smart financial centre. In a landmark trial for a financial centre, a pilot will be launched to test interbank payments using blockchain technology with eight banks and the Singapore Exchange; this comes with an option to expand this trial to transactions in foreign currency. Singapore will also test a way of feeding existing citizens' data to banks and other financial institutions to speed up form-filling. MAS managing director Ravi Menon said at the opening of Singapore's first fintech conference on Wednesday: "In an industry facing the headwinds of lower economic growth and heavier regulatory burdens, innovation must be the way to refresh and re-energise the business model. "And innovation is not always with high-tech. It is about seeking newer and better ways to do things, about a spirit of enterprise. It is about hope in the future. The financial industry needs that." Blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions, created from digital "blocks" containing information of financial transactions linked in a virtual chain. Participating banks and relevant institutions in the blockchain can access the information on this ledger. Such technology can also build the use of a form of digital currency. Under the blockchain pilot, MAS will work with the three Singapore lenders and five foreign banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and JPMorgan - to test such technology for interbank payments, including cross-border transactions in foreign currency. The banks will deposit cash as collateral with the MAS, in exchange for MAS-issued digital currency. The banks can later redeem the digital currency for cash. With this system, participating banks pay each other directly with this digital currency, instead of first sending payment instructions through MAS. This could do more than the current system to strengthen resilience and lower costs, said Mr Menon. The banks can also transact directly on a blockchain, as OCBC did with its first-ever blockchain payment transaction with its subsidiaries, OCBC Malaysia and Bank of Singapore, this month. The solution was jointly designed by OCBC Bank and Singapore-based BCS Information Systems. Mr Menon said: "This project marks the first step in MAS's exploration of ways to harness the potential of central bank-issued digital currency. The next phase of the project will involve transactions in foreign currency, possibly with the support of another central bank." UOB's head of group technology and operations Susan Hwee said the bank will increase investments in blockchain, as it sees potential in the technology. Oliver Bussmann, former UBS chief information officer who worked on blockchain technology at the bank, said at the conference he was bullish about cross-border transactions on distributed ledgers, pointing to the momentum around the topic. But well-known former banker Blythe Masters, now chief executive of distributed-ledger service start-up Digital Asset, remarked wryly that the network effect is hard to achieve: "In other words, multiple entities get a religion - preferably the same religion - and decide to show up at the same venue to worship. We know how often that's happened in the history of mankind." In a second experiment, Singapore will try extending information in a government database to the financial industry. The information, kept in a portal known as MyInfo, includes personal details such as NRIC numbers, and residential addresses. The aim is to help financial institutions use this data for form filling, cutting the slog and chances of errors during data entry when gathering the same types of basic information on customers. This pilot will be run with as many as three banks in the first quarter of next year. DBS and Standard Chartered are said to be confirmed; OCBC is getting final approvals to be involved in the trial. MAS will run this experiment with the Ministry of Finance and GovTech. Singapore will also look at more sophisticated uses of citizens' data so that the financial industry can meet the know-your-customer (KYC) requirements in a far less laborious manner, said Mr Menon. Meanwhile, Singapore is gunning to be a "centre of excellence" for the use of application programming interfaces (APIs), which are a set of protocols that define how a system talks to another. It has set out standardisation guidelines - key to prompting common usage among financial institutions and start-ups, said Mr Menon. MAS has also noted that more consumers want to buy financial pro-ducts online. It will soon allow insurers to offer a full suite of life insurance products online without advice - expanding beyond simple term-life and broadly standardised policies - but not without setting out guidelines on safeguards. As well, it will propose ways to manage algorithms for robo-advisers, given that such digital-advice platforms for investment services will soon reach Singapore, said Mr Menon. This will expand on existing efforts in the retail-payments space, with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) working on a scheme that will enable consumers to pay one another using mobile numbers or e-mail addresses as identifiers, rather than bank account numbers. ABS will also move the industry towards using a single-payment terminal that will accept all major card brands. Amid all this innovation, MAS has attracted deeper expertise in cyber-security; the Financial Services - Information Sharing and Analysis Centre from the US is setting up in Singapore its only cyber-intelligence centre in the Asia-Pacific. The centre is the global financial industry's go-to resource for cyber-threat intelligence analysis and sharing, said Mr Menon. "As more financial services are delivered over the Internet, there will be growing security and privacy concerns from cyber threats," he said. "Users will have confidence in new technologies and innovative services only to the extent that they have confidence in cyber security." All in, Mr Menon pointed out that regulation must not "front-run" innovation. "The regulator must run alongside innovation. It is important to keep pace with what is going on, assess what the risks might be, and continually evaluate whether it is necessary to regulate or to leave things to evolve further." MAS on Wednesday finalised its regulatory sandbox guidelines for financial institutions and start-ups to test their ideas. It is already reviewing some sandbox applications, and expects to have some of these proposals launched in the sandbox soon.

Global stock markets were mixed on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, as investors awaited more policy details from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Oil prices retreated, snapping an overnight rally. Mary Altaffer AP Photo i By EILEEN NG Associated Press Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday as a seven-day rally on Wall Street petered out overnight. The U.S. dollar retreated slightly after hitting a 13-year high and oil prices slipped. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei fell 0.14 percent to 17,838.06 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index eased 0.1 percent to 22,265.16. China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4 percent to 3,192.25 and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 1,977.59. Australia's S&P/ASX rose 0.15 percent to 5,335.90, while benchmarks in Taiwan, Singapore and Southeast Asia gained. ANALYST'S TAKE: Alex Furber, sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore, said Asian markets are still struggling for direction amid uncertainties over policies from President-elect Donald Trump. "It is very difficult to differentiate what is campaign and what is rhetoric. There is a lot of uncertainty over what policies will actually be put in place in the first 100 days of his presidency," Furber said. "That is why the rally in the U.S. has started to fade last night." OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude extended losses, easing 11 cents to $45.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed down 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell nine cents to $46.54 a barrel in London. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks ended barely lower Wednesday as banks return some of the huge gains made since the presidential election last week but technology and consumer stocks climbed. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.3 percent to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.2 percent to 2,176.94 but the Nasdaq composite added 0.4 percent to 5,294.58. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 108.9190 yen from 109.15 yen late Wednesday, while the euro rose to $1.0701 from $1.0681.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Noeleen Walder JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will pay more than $250 million to settle allegations by the U.S. government that it had hired children of Chinese decision makers to win business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The bank will pay roughly $200 million combined to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department and more than $50 million to the Federal Reserve, the source said. There will not be any individual prosecution at this time, the source said. The SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring. The Justice Department opened a parallel investigation around the same time. Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China's politically connected. While close ties to top government officials are a boon to any banking franchise across the world, they are especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions. The SEC, JPMorgan and the Justice Department all declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank's hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said.

Morgan added a small-cap strategy to help investors gain exposure to smaller companies with potentially less volatility. On Wednesday, J.P. Morgan launched the JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPSE). JPSE has a net expense ratio of 0.39%. JPSE will try to reflect the performance of the Russell 2000 Diversified Factor Index, which is comprised of small-cap equity securities in the U.S. selected based on a rules-based proprietary multi-factor selection process that screens for relative valuation, momentum and quality. Stocks are also weighted to diversify risk across individual equity securities. According to J.P. Morgan, this process has historically helped drive strong performance. “FTSE Russell market research indicates that investors are looking for index tools and ETFs based on leading benchmarks to help them pursue a wide range of their objectives, including lower volatility, return enhancement and diversification” Ron Bundy, CEO North America Benchmarks at FTSE Russell, said in the press release. “Our Russell 2000 Diversified Factor Index is designed to deliver these benefits in a rules based and transparent manner.” Trending on ETF Trends Legg Mason Adds New Emerging Market ETF to Low Volatility Suite A New Active Short-Term Bond ETF to Play Rising Rate Risks A New ETF Targeting High Yield Developed Market Dividend Stocks A New Smart Beta Restaurant ETF is on the Menu A Dividend-Focused International ETF That Hedges Currency Risks Moreover, the fund’s screen process should help diminish risk or exposure to more volatility small-cap securities to help bolster long-term, risk-adjusted returns. The underlying index diversify risks that are less likely to be rewarded while overweighting areas that are more likely to be rewarded. “In choppy markets, many investors are seeking a less volatile way to participate in equities” Robert Deutsch, Global Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a press release. “JPSE is a cost-efficient, risk-managed approach to U.S. small cap investing, enabling clients to get invested in the equity markets.” The alternative multi-factor indexing methodology may help investors diversify away from potential risks associated with traditional market capitalization-weighted indices, such as bubbles, risk concentrations and preference for overvalued stocks. JPSE rounds out J.P. Morgan’s U.S. equity asset category offerings, including the JPMorgan Diversified Return US Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPUS), which leans toward large-cap companies, and JPMorgan Diversified Return U.S. Mid Cap Equity ETF (NYSEArca: JPME), which focuses more on mid-cap stocks.

(Reuters/Brendan McDermid) NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are slightly lower Wednesday as banks return some of the huge gains they’ve made since the presidential election last week. The dollar continues to appreciate against other currencies and has reached its highest mark in 13 years. The price of oil is up further after a big rise the day before. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,838 as of 1:15 p.m. Eastern. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 7 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,173. The Nasdaq composite picked up 13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,288. The Dow has risen for seven days in a row through Tuesday and is up 5.8 percent over that time. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also made large gains. BANKS SLIDE: Banks took the biggest losses in early trading. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.86, or 2.3 percent, to $77.78 and Morgan Stanley lost 95 cents, or 2.4 percent, to reach $39.06 while Zions Bancorp fell $1.59, or 4.1 percent, to $37.17. The S&P 500’s financial stock index has jumped 11 percent since the presidential election. CURRENCIES: The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other currencies, rose to 100.38, its highest level since April of 2003. The dollar is rising in part because investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace in response to inflation stemming from the increased spending that President-elect Donald Trump has proposed. A stronger dollar hurts U.S. companies that do a lot of business overseas because it makes their products more expensive, and it affects their earnings when they are translated from other currencies back into U.S. dollars. However it makes imported goods cheaper for consumers in the U.S. The dollar slipped 109.20 Japanese yen from 109.32 yen late Tuesday. The euro slid to $1.0695 from $1.0718. STAY ON TARGET: Retailer Target raised its profit forecast and its sales projections for the third quarter with the holiday season approaching. That came as the retailer gave a strong third-quarter report, as it put more emphasis on low prices after it stumbled in the second quarter. The stock gained $5.44, or 7.6 percent, to reach $76.88. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, reported a bigger profit and better sales than investors expected and its stock rose $2.54, or 3.5 percent, to $76.03. That helped lead consumer stocks a bit higher. LOWE’S LOWER: Home improvement retailer Lowe’s fell $2.51, or 3.6 percent, to $66.54. The company said traffic in stores was low during the third quarter, and Lowe’s reported a smaller third-quarter profit because of big charges connected to the end of its Hydrox joint venture, write-downs of canceled projects, and goodwill and impairment charges. Its rival Home Depot traded lower Tuesday after its quarterly report. TECH RESET: Technology companies also moved upward as they continued a rally from a day earlier. Scientific instrument maker Agilent picked up $1.11, or 2.4 percent, to $46.51 after a strong earnings report, graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $5.38, or 6.2 percent, to $91.57 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft, and Apple picked up $2.39, or 2.2 percent, to $109.50. Tech stocks had weakened since the election. Trump’s policies might affect their sales in China and other key markets, and a big surge this summer had brought some technology stocks to all-time highs. INDUSTRIALS: Defense contractors Lockheed Martin declined $3.84, or 1.4 percent, to $262.09 and General Dynamics fell $2.25, or 1.3 percent, to $165.77. Airlines also traded lower after some hefty gains on Tuesday. OIL: Oil prices were mixed. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 11 cents to $45.92 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, remained at $46.95 a barrel in London. The price of U.S. crude oil soared 5.7 percent on Tuesday as investors hoped the oil-producing OPEC countries will agree to a production cut that would boost prices. Energy companies fell. They had rallied on Tuesday along with the price of crude oil. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.22 percent. Bond yields, which are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages, have risen to their highest levels since the beginning of the year as investors expect inflation to rise. Bond investors hate inflation because it erodes the value of the fixed interest payments that bonds pay. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Germany the DAX lost 0.7 percent while France’s CAC 40 was off 0.8 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 slid 0.6 percent. Asian markets finished mostly higher. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi in Seoul, South Korea gained 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed 0.2 percent lower.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks fall, bond selloff stalls Margreet Dietz Thursday November 17, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street fell with bank stocks, while some tech shares including Apple continued a rebound from their recent slide, as investors reassessed their post-US election bets. Government bonds also steadied after their recent selloff. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 54.92 points, or 0.3%, to 18,868.14. The Dow closed at an all-time high on Tuesday.  The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 0.2% to 2176.84, while Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.2%. "As much as we love to believe all the pro-business things the new administration and the Republican Congress is going to move forward with, that's still next year's business," Boston-based Wunderlich Securities chief market strategist and director of research Art Hogan told Bloomberg. "You have to look at a market that in the short term is getting stretched." Banks pull down Dow The Dow moved lower as declines Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase shares, down 2.3% and 2.3% respectively, outweighed gains in Apple and Visa shares, up 2.4% and 1.7% respectively. "Investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialise," brokerage Baird said of the post-election rally in bank stocks, according to Reuters. Bucking the trend, shares of Target traded 7.2% higher after it posted a quarterly profit that surpassed expectations and upgraded its full-year forecast. The latest quarterly earnings "reflect meaningful improvement in our traffic and sales trends and much stronger than expected profitability," Target chief executive Brian Cornell says. US government bond prices edged up, ending a six-session run of declines, as tepid economic data helped ease selling. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 2.222%, compared with 2.240% on Tuesday. Yields fall as prices rise. Wholesale prices weaken While bets remain firmly in favour of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in December, a Labour Department report shows wholesale prices in the US were weaker than expected last month. The producer price index was unchanged from September, after a 0.3% increase the previous month. Separately, a Fed report shows factory production rose 0.2% in October, following a similar increase in September. "With the global economic backdrop more stable and growth set to pick up in the United States, we expect to see activity in the manufacturing sector improve a bit in the coming months," North Carolina-based Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2% decrease from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.6%, Germany's DAX Index slid 0.7%, while France's CAC 40 Index dropped 0.8%. Opec officials are working to nail down details of their plan to limit oil supply and gaps over some sticking points are narrowing, Reuters reported. "There is definitely somebody that thinks that there is a risk of having higher prices in the first half of 2017," Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, told Bloomberg. "It's saying that somebody in the market is either hedging for potentially higher prices in 2017, or somebody is taking a bet that prices will be higher next year."

The U.S. dollar retreated slightly after hitting a 13-year high and oil prices slipped. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei fell 0.14 percent to 17,838.06 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index eased 0.1 percent to 22,265.16. China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4 percent to 3,192.25 and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 1,977.59. Australia's S&P/ASX rose 0.15 percent to 5,335.90, while benchmarks in Taiwan, Singapore and Southeast Asia gained. ANALYST'S TAKE: Alex Furber, sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore, said Asian markets are still struggling for direction amid uncertainties over policies from President-elect Donald Trump. "It is very difficult to differentiate what is campaign and what is rhetoric. There is a lot of uncertainty over what policies will actually be put in place in the first 100 days of his presidency," Furber said. "That is why the rally in the U.S. has started to fade last night." OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude extended losses, easing 11 cents to $45.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed down 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell nine cents to $46.54 a barrel in London. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks ended barely lower Wednesday as banks return some of the huge gains made since the presidential election last week but technology and consumer stocks climbed. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.3 percent to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.2 percent to 2,176.94 but the Nasdaq composite added 0.4 percent to 5,294.58.

The U.S. dollar retreated slightly after hitting a 13-year high but oil prices rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC 40 fell 0.2 per cent to 4,493.41 while Germany’s DAX shed 0.3 per cent to 10,632.58. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares fell 0.6 per cent at 6,749.72. U.S. stocks were poised for a steady opening, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.1 per cent. ANALYST’S TAKE: Alex Furber, sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore, said markets are still struggling for direction, stymied by uncertainty what President-elect Donald Trump will do. Markets are watching for Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony on the economic outlook to Congress later Thursday, and for the release of a slew of economic data, including October consumer prices and weekly jobless claims. “It is very difficult to differentiate what is campaign and what is rhetoric. There is a lot of uncertainty over what policies will actually be put in place in the first 100 days of his presidency,” Furber said. “That is why the rally in the U.S. has started to fade last night.” OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rebounded, rising 21 cents to $45.78 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed down 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 19 cents to $46.82 a barrel in London. ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s Nikkei was flat at 17,862.63 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index eased 0.1 per cent to 22,262.88. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.1 per cent to 3,208.45 and Australia’s S&P/ASX rose 0.2 per cent to 5,338.50, while benchmarks in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore gained. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 109.13 yen from 109.15 yen late Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0728 from $1.0681. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

The boost is evidence of investors' hopes that Trump will implement a high-spend, low tax regime which will push up interest rates, said analysts.    The US dollar closed on 100.37 on Wednesday after reaching a peak of 100.57 earlier in the day, its highest since April 2003  While the dollar soared, stock markets showed the first symptoms of an 'election hangover'.  The Dow and S&P 500 indexes dipped for the first time, falling 54 and 3.45 points respectively since Tuesday's close. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tens of thousands of students join protests to make campuses... Mexico, China, Israel and two dozen more: Trump transition... Share this article Share Banks suffered for the first time since the Republican's win, with US Bank Corp stocks falling 1.70 percent and Bank of America shares dipping by 2 percent.  The fall is the start of an 'election hangover', said experts, after a week of record-breaking growth since Trump's surprise triumph.  'You've got a little bit of a hangover from the Trump rally today,' said Steven Chiavarone, a New York-based associate portfolio manager of Federated Investors Global Allocation Fund. The surge is proof of investors' hopes in President-elect Donald Trump's plans for a high-spend, low-tax regime, said investors  'The market priced in pretty quickly a very rosy scenario but now you're seeing a little doubt on the counter frame as he puts together his team.'  The dollar's surge is evidence of investors' faith in a pro-business, low-tax regime, said analysts.  'What's pushed the dollar higher here in the short term is with the Trump win, particularly combined with (Republicans) holding on to the Senate,' said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.   It may also demonstrate investors' hopes for increased interest rates triggered by the Federal Reserve in response to Trump's anticipated spending spree.   While the dollar soared, the Dow index was down for the first time since Trump's win  The S&P 500 also closed on a negative average after a record-breaking week of trading  Wall Street has slumped into a post-election hangover, said experts. Above, traders at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday  The greenback has been slowly strengthening after an initial dip in the early hours of November 9 when Trump emerged as the election winner - a shock outcome and one which rocked the markets.  Investors withdrew their faith in the dollar and US stocks, placing it instead in safe havens including the Japanese yen and gold and silver.  Their confidence was returned hours later as the Dow and S&P indexes recovered initial losses and embarked on a record-breaking week of trading.  Now, it is on course for parity with the euro - an unseen occurrence since 2002.  Technology stocks were among those that thrived on Wednesday while the indexes suffered as a whole.  Graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $5.44, or 6.3 percent, to $91.63 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft, and Apple picked up $2.93, or 2.7 percent, to $110.04.  Oil prices however fell. Benchmark US Crude lost 24 cents to $47.57 a barrel and Bent Crude fell 32 cents after soaring on Tuesday.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 69 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

Credit: The CMO Club Most Popular Last night The CMO Club honored 40 CMOs in 10 award categories, ranging from Marketing Innovation to Social Responsibility, from Customer Experience to Creativity and Storytelling. The variety of the annual awards -- now in their fifth year -- reflects the fundamental truth that the CMO role is ever evolving, and requires both in-the-moment practicality and see-around-the-corner vision. Focusing on the second component, I asked 15 of the 40 award winners to share their thoughts on the challenges that await their peers in 2017. What I heard was initially perplexing but ultimately revealing. Under siege for years to deliver more (awareness, leads, sales, experiences, data, stories, LTV, KPIs, etc.) with less (budget, time, staff and patience), many successful CMOs have come to terms with the demands of their jobs simply by embracing the and over the or. Dichotomy is suddenly a friendly state of mind: a place where CMOs find the courage to boldly plot out their biggest challenges for the year ahead. "Our challenge will lie in how well CMOs respond not just to change but to the sometimes more uncomfortable position of ambiguity," said Gina McDuffie, CMO of production equipment company VER. 1. Nurturing IQ and EQ With mar-tech budgets rivaling their IT counterparts, you might think the CMO's job is reserved for the left-brained these days. Lee Applbaum, the CMO of Patron Spirits, on the other hand, fears that focusing on short-term digital campaign metrics is a form of myopia that "loses the longer-term implications around building brand equity and affinity." "Today's CMO must possess the fundamental 'IQ' skills necessary to execute the job technically, but even broader 'EQ' skills to manage the organization -- particularly at the senior management and board level -- so that it understands that building a sustainable, world-class brand often means making short-term sacrifices," Applbaum said. 2. Driving sales and brand The challenge of driving short-term results while simultaneously building one's brand almost dates back to the caveman's first marketing plan. What's new is the array of options to consider. "We are clear on our goals and tactics for direct marketing and our owned assets, but the rest of the landscape is changing so rapidly we will need to take some bets," said Melinda Welsh, CMO, Home and Auto Finance, JP Morgan Chase. Anthony Christie, CMO of Level 3 Communications, frames this challenge as "accelerating quality top line growth," with "quality" referring to the need to attract the right type of customer. 3. Balancing the science and the art "Much of the marketing conversation over the last several years has centered around data and analytics -- the 'science' of marketing," said Rich Honiball, CMO of the Navy Exchange. Though Honiball recognizes the importance of analytics, he advises CMOs not to "lose sight of the 'art' of marketing: not only the creative ways in which we deliver our message, but what the message is in the first place." Patti Newcomer, VP, marketing, Intuit ProConnect Group, agrees that cutting through creatively in every channel is essential. "I think we might be losing sight of that as our key challenge in the midst of all of the technology challenges that we're all grappling with," she said. 4. Connecting innovation and culture Increasingly, CMOs see themselves not just as a spark for innovation in product development and marketing but also as agents of change across their organizations. Claudia Schiepers, CMO at Greystone & Co, describes this dual challenge as the need to come up with "Innovation strategies," adding, "How can we make sure that everyone in the company genuinely feels like they are an active participant in the organization's innovation activities." Paula Puleo Blomquist, CMO at Eyemart Express, sees the job evolving to be "more about change/culture management than channel strategy development and execution." 5. Mining data and thinking creatively "Because there's so much data available, we're often overwhelmed," said Arra Yerganian, CMO at Sutter Health. To overcome this challenge, Yerganian believes great marketers will use "a sixth sense that helps them find and drive forward ideas that resonate with the consumer in a new, authentic way." Dan Marks, CMO, Hancock & Whitney Bank, echoed this sentiment: "There has never been a better time to be a CMO with the tools available like design thinking and better analytical capabilities to speak directly to customers and improve the customer experience," he said. 6. Owning both marketing and customer experience Long at the mercy of less-than-stellar product quality or customer service, some CMOs are eager to take ownership of the entire customer experience, starting first with better employee training. "There's too much emphasis right now on technology and channel, and not enough being done to ensure a proper carry through with respect to employee training," said Steven Handmaker, CMO at Chicago-based Assurance. "If we portray one experience and deliver another, our brands can be fatally harmed." 7. Weighing data and strategy Alma Derricks, VP of sales and marketing at Cirque du Soleil, believes marketers need to "defend themselves against the growing mythology of Big Data as a silver bullet to customer-facing issues; data is a tool, not a replacement for a coherent go-to-market strategy." Ann Davids, SVP & CMO of Direct General Insurance concurs: "I struggle with how much of this technology we really need to consume and at what time, as to not over invest in new emerging [tech] when you can wait and benefit from others R&D investments and experiences." 8. Leading for today and tomorrow Lest you thought that CMO challenges aren't all that tough, consider the fact that many CMOs see anticipating the future as a critical part of their job. "Those who are following today's trends may realize they've arrived at the party a little late," explains Dara Royer, CMO at the non-profit Mercy Corp. Elissa Fink, CMO, Tableau Software, put it this way: "A very large challenge is figuring out how to move forward in big, transformational ways without sacrificing the little, incremental improvements that are often a huge portion of ongoing success." Or, as Jane Wakely, CMO, Global Chocolate at Mars, offerred in conclusion: "Companies and brands need to keep the tension of learning from and honoring the past whilst being agile and entrepreneurial to embrace the future."

Please Don’t Feed the Gators. Published on Wednesday, November 16, 2016 by People's Action Blog Welcome to Swamp Trump. Please Don’t Feed the Gators. by Richard Eskow 0 Comments "It’s true," writes Eskow. "The reptiles are taking over." (Photo: Pixabay/CC0) It’s already a Washington truism that Donald Trump, who promised to “drain the swamp” of lobbyists and others who exploit government for personal gain, has turned to it instead for his key appointments. It’s true. The reptiles are taking over. Let’s take a tour of the place while we still can. "Trump’s only doing what his fellow developers did in the Florida Land Rush of the 1920s: He’s selling people paradise, but giving them swampland instead." Welcome to Trump Swamp. Join us on the glass-bottom boat as we gaze on the denizens below. Keep your hands inside the railings – and please don’t feed the gators. It’s hard to get past the white nationalist in any discussion of Trump’s team. Sure, they call Steve Bannon’s worldview “alt-right,” but that’s deceptive. That makes it sound like something new, when hatred is as old as the hills. White supremacist Jared Taylor cheered Bannon’s hire, saying he suspected Bannon will serve as an “anti-waffler” to maintain Trump’s ideological and racial purity. (Taylor’s most recent tweet, as of this writing is, “Excellent Boston Globe article about the Hispanic invasion. This is how we throw away our country.”) “I think that’s excellent,” said former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke of Bannon’s hire. “Perhaps The Donald IS for ‘REAL’,” the chairman of the American Nazi Party exulted, adding: “Time will tell.” Admittedly, when one of the President-elect’s appointments gets positive responses from the KKK and the Nazis, it’s hard to focus on his other hires. But it’s important. If “personnel is policy,” as Sen. Elizabeth Warren says, then Trump’s policy is plunder. Billionaire Steve Mnuchin is a leading contender for Secretary of the Treasury. As we first noted last August, Mnuchin ran a mortgage-lending outfit called One West, which was investigated for its abusive treatment of borrowers. The California Reinvestment Coalition asked authorities to investigate One West’s pattern of racial discrimination in foreclosures, and specifically cited its “foreclosures of widows.” Looks like the proprietor of Trump University has found a soul mate. There are others. Trump also sought out JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary. Dimon has presided over a truly epic orgy of fraud during his tenure. Dimon is a generous campaign donor to politicians from both parties, which may explain why he has escaped serious investigation. (Dimon wisely took his name out of consideration for the job. Elizabeth Warren would have humiliated him.) Then there’s billionaire Wilbur Ross, a leading contender for Commerce Secretary. Ross, who is already reassuring investors that Trump won’t do anything rash on trade, invests in “distressed assets.” What the aliens in “Independence Day” do to planets like Earth, Ross does to troubled companies. He plunders them for anything of value and then leaves them in ruins. And speaking of plundering a planet and leaving it in ruins, here are the leading contenders for Trump’s top energy and environmental slots: Oil tycoon Forrest Lucas is a frontrunner for Secretary of the Interior. He makes his money by digging up the land he would be tasked to protect. But Lucas is not a one-dimensional candidate. He also hates animals. Lucas is, as Politico reports, “one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and (who) defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses.” Like dogs? Lucas reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending puppy mills from a ballot initiative. And you’ll get two for the price of one: his wife and Lucas Oil co-founder Charlotte Lucas has attacked atheists and Muslims on Facebook, writing, “I’m sick and tired of minorities running this country!” Feel like you’re in a swamp yet? Trump’s considering a real mother-fracker for Energy Secretary: Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm has extensive holdings in corporations that use fracking and other techniques to extract oil from Mother Earth. (What did you think I meant?) Hamm’s spent years trying to get federal lands turned over to companies like his for exploitation. Bloomberg News reported that Hamm tried to get some earthquake researchers fired from the University of Oklahoma, where he’s a major donor, because they were investigating the connection between oil and gas extraction and Oklahoma’s “nearly 400-fold increase in earthquakes.” Expect more man-made earthquakes under a Trump/Hamm regime. Trump is also reportedly planning to turn leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency to far-right environmental nemesis Myron Ebell. Ebell has parlayed his extreme anti-government views and his refusal to accept climate science’s findings – a refusal grounded in absolutely no scientific qualifications whatsoever – into a lucrative gig as the head of a fossil-fuel industry front group he calls the ”Competitive Enterprise Institute.” Today the institute, tomorrow the world – destroying it, that is. (Note to media: “Climate contrarian” is a weasel phrase. It’s like calling Flat-Earthers “geography contrarians.” The right term for Ebell is “industry-funded crank.”) There are more cold-blooded creatures like these in Trump’s world, but it’s time for our tour to end. What we’re seeing here is nothing new. Trump’s only doing what his fellow developers did in the Florida Land Rush of the 1920s: He’s selling people paradise, but giving them swampland instead. Trump’s “contract with the American voter” promised that he would “clean up corruption and special interest collusion” in Washington in his first hundred days as president. Oh, well. It won’t be the first contract Trump’s ever broken. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.

Illustration by Paul Kisselev for Observer. Call it the bonfire of the certainties. America’s super rich, including many of the people on the Observer’s annual Rich List, spent the last year holding their breath, wealth management experts say, delaying major decisions until after the presidential election. But if they were expecting its result to bring any kind of certitude about the future, they were as wrong as most every political “expert” in the country. The shock that Donald J. Trump would be moving from Fifth Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue briefly sent global markets into a loop. Dow futures on the morning the election results became clear immediately plunged 750 points, before the market recovered to end the day at a near-record high. The NYPD, meanwhile, installed a wall of sand-filled city dump trucks outside Trump Tower, the president-elect’s current redoubt, as a precaution against the several thousand angry protestors who converged around dusk. THE RICH LIST 2016 NEW YORK’S RICHEST ATHLETES NEW YORK’S RICHEST MUSICIANS NEW YORK’S RICHEST NEWS ANCHORS NEW YORK’S RICHEST MEDIA CEOs NEW YORK’S RICHEST COMEDIANS “It’s been a year of mayhem,” said Barry Ritholtz, chairman of Ritholtz Wealth Management. “The election really pushed everything else out of the way.” The election of America’s first billionaire president caps a remarkable year for so-called Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs), defined as those with at least $30 million in investable assets. Their global numbers grew by 5,200, or 3.1 percent, according to the most recent figures released by WealthInsight, an analytics firm. This was despite some institutions predicting another downturn in the near future: In July, UBS pegged the odds of a coming recession at 34 percent, up from 23 percent in 2015. JPMorgan Chase concurred, estimating the risk at 37 percent. “But this was a year that seemed to surprise people with its economic strength,” said Ritholtz. “The economy is resilient, and despite a pretty steady drumbeat of negativity, it keeps doing really well.” Ultra High Net Worth Individuals could reasonably look forward to “a Trump tax-cut windfall,” in both individual and corporate contributions—Barry Ritholtz, chairman of Ritholtz Wealth Management According to the most recent World Wealth Report, published in October by the consultancy, Capgemini, 2016 was also a good year for merely HNWIs—those with $1 million on hand to invest. “North America’s HNWI population grew by 2 percent to 4.8 million and their wealth by 2.3 percent to US$16.6 trillion,” its authors reported. The year was not without its headwinds, of course. Britain’s surprise vote in June to exit the European Union—or “Brexit”—briefly rattled financial markets, depressing the pound and sowing still-unclear long-term consequences. In New York City, one group complaining of a slowdown were Midtown ultra-luxury developers. Along the West 57th Street corridor known as “Billionaires’ Row,” the last four years had seen a building boom in residential towers, with many new apartments offered between $50 million and 100 million. But the combination of oversupply and a dwindling stream of foreign investors brought sales of such residences “to a complete halt,” the elite broker, Dolly Lenz, told The New York Times in July. A growth trend in UHNWI-spending this year has been the acquisition of “experiences,” in addition to the usual baubles from Cartier or Ferrari, said Doug Gollan, editor of DG Amazing Experiences, a weekly e-newsletter for private jet owners. Gollan cited ice-driving on frozen lakes in Finland, booking African safaris and even luxury private trains as popular travel experiences for the personal-jet–set. But another new trend is for UHNWIs to reserve an entire, smaller five-star resort, so they can vacation with their extended family in privacy. “Up to about 50 rooms, all the resorts offer buyouts,” he said. He added that the wife of one New York billionaire—an avid hunter, who was celebrating a landmark birthday—booked the entire cast of Duck Dynasty and redecorated their West Monroe, La., headquarters especially for a surprise party. (The birthday boy had thought his jet was on its way to New Orleans, until it was diverted for the reveal.) As for the year ahead, Ritholtz described Trump’s victory as “the proverbial good news and bad news.” “The bad news is we really have no idea what sort of policies a Trump Administration will enact,” he said. But on the plus side, UHNWIs could reasonably look forward to “a Trump tax-cut windfall,” in both individual and corporate contributions. Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economics professor who has studied wealth and its effects for decades, predicted: “Donald Trump is very likely to eliminate the estate tax—or the ‘death tax,’ as he likes to call it. This will be a huge boon to the very wealthy since today only the top 1 percent of wealth-holders pay any estate tax.” But the prospect of a policy prevented by split government won’t pay dividends, warned Wolff, only further aggravating “overall wealth inequality in this country and lower wealth mobility between generations.” Don’t empty the sand-filled dump trucks just yet.

A list of some likely contenders WIN McNAMEE/GETTY IMAGES Rachelle Younglai AND EVAN ANNETT The Globe and Mail Last updated: Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 11:55AM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Shares Comment s Stay tuned here for the latest updates and background on the reported contenders for America’s top offices and the issues a Trump cabinet will face in office TABLE OF CONTENTS Advisers • Treasury • Commerce • State • CIA director • Trade • Homeland Security • Interior • Defence • Attorney-General • Energy • Environment Loyalty matters to president-elect Donald Trump and the 70-year old reality television star has chosen some of his staunchest supporters to serve in his administration. His first cabinet nominee is Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney-general. The Republican lawmaker is known for his hardline positions on immigration and was one of few senators to actively campaign on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Mr. Sessions will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump’s more controversial picks – retired general Michael Flynn as national security adviser and anti-establishment conservative Stephen Bannon as chief strategist – do not need Senate approval. Mr. Trump’s other supporters are also expected to land big positions in his administration, including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The real estate mogul’s eldest children and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are part of the transition team. Mr. Kushner is reportedly trying to figure out how to circumvent federal anti-nepotism laws so that he can serve in his father-in-law’s administration. All cabinet nominations require Senate confirmation and Mr. Trump’s choices may not all win approval. Republicans only control the Senate by two votes and several opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Here’s a look at Mr. Trump’s appointees and who may fill the key positions in his White House. White House advisers ALEX WONG/GETTY IMAGES Stephen Bannon: The appointment of Mr. Bannon as Mr. Trump’s chief strategist sounded alarm bells across the political spectrum and among hate-watch groups. The head of the right-wing website Breitbart News has called it “the platform for the alt-right,” or the white nationalist, anti-Semitic movement that supports Mr. Trump. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors and exposes hate groups, said Mr. Bannon propelled Breitbart to become a white nationalist propaganda mill and called on the Trump team to rescind the hire. The choice of Mr. Bannon appeared to placate Mr. Trump’s anti establishment base. Mr. Bannon is known for ripping into mainstream Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Reince Priebus: The Republican National Committee chairman was one of Mr. Trump’s most devoted soldiers. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Priebus took heat from mainstream Republicans for defending Mr. Trump’s actions. Mr. Priebus threatened Republicans who did not fall in line with Mr. Trump and his loyalty earned him the position of chief of staff. Mr. Priebus has ties with long serving Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, which will help smooth relations between the White House and congressional Republicans. Corey Lewandowski: When Mr. Lewandowski was Mr. Trump’s campaign manager during the primaries, he believed it was best to “let Trump be Trump.” He was eventually fired amid assault allegations and concerns he could not run a national campaign. But Mr. Lewandowski was steadfastly loyal and continued to advise Mr. Trump while being paid by CNN to provide political commentary. Jared Kushner: Mr. Trump’s son-in-law was one of Mr. Trump’s prominent advisers during the campaign and is part of the transition team. He reportedly pushed his father-in-law to choose Mike Pence as his running mate. Mr. Kushner also helped mastermind the campaign’s decision to bring Bill Clinton’s sexual abuse accusers to the second debate, in an effort to shake Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Michael Flynn: The retired general will serve as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, a role he played on the campaign. Mr. Flynn was one of the only high-level defence officials to openly support Mr. Trump. He served as the Obama administration’s Defense Intelligence Agency director before being fired in 2014 for what he said was the “stand I took on radical Islamism.” Mr. Flynn’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is reflected in Mr. Trump’s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Earlier this year, the retired general tweeted: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” His position does not need Senate approval. Trump’s transition team faces setbacks after departure of Mike Rogers President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team suffered its second upheaval in less than a week amid a power struggle to influence the shape of the incoming administration. (Return to table of contents) Treasury Has someone been picked yet? No BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/GETTY IMAGES Mr. Trump rode to victory on a wave of populism but is considering Wall Street types and a long serving Republican lawmaker for the country’s top economic job. Whoever is picked will help implement tax cuts and fulfill Trump’s campaign promises to create 25-million jobs and save factory jobs that have been lost to globalization. Steven Mnuchin: The hedge fund manager and former Goldman Sachs banker was Mr. Trump’s campaign finance manager, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, and part of the president-elect’s transition team. Wilbur Ross: The billionaire investor is chairman of Invesco Ltd. subsidiary WL Ross & Co. He and Mr. Ross might also be in the running for the commerce secretary job (see below). Jamie Dimon: The CEO of JPMorgan Chase was one of the few bank heads who emerged from the 2007-09 financial crisis with his reputation relatively intact. His record has since taken a hit amid the bank’s multi-billion-dollar trading loss. Jeb Hensarling: As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, the Republican lawmaker has repeatedly tried to repeal the massive Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. Mr. Trump’s views on regulation are aligned with the Republican Party, but recently there has been speculation that Mr. Trump only wants to overturn parts of the law. Fed chair’s job complicated by Trump’s victory Economic policies of the president-elect are best described as ‘inflationary,’ making an interest rate increase a near certainty, David Parkinson explains.

No ZORAN IVANOVICH/iSTOCKPHOTO The commerce department describes the secretary’s mission as being “the voice of U.S. business within the president’s cabinet,” focusing on job creation and domestic business. Wilbur Ross: The billionaire investor was reported to be in the running in a tweet by billionaire Carl Icahn, who claimed to have just spoken with Mr. Trump. Steven Mnuchin: Mr. Icahn also named Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s campaign finance manager and economic adviser, as a possible commerce secretary candidate. (Return to table of contents) Secretary of State Has someone been picked yet? No BRENNAN LINSLEY/ASSOCIATED PRESS The country’s top diplomat will have the tricky job of forging new relations with America’s allies after Mr. Trump questioned whether the U.S. should honour its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and praised dictators such as North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The state department also has oversight over the Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected. Mr. Trump and Republicans agree the pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas once fully completed, should be built. Rudy Giuliani: A former New York mayor and associate attorney-general in Ronald Reagan’s administration, Mr. Giuliani was one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters. But consulting work for foreign governments by his firm, Giuliani Partners, has put him under added scrutiny for the State Department job. The firm helped businesses on behalf of states including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and Mr. Giuliani also advised TransCanada, which sought to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Newt Gingrich: The former House speaker spent two decades as a lawmaker. After he was forced to resign as speaker in 1998, he dabbled in lobbying, ran a consulting firm and unsuccessfully ran for president. He attached himself to the Trump campaign early on, providing advice and defending the real estate mogul’s actions. John Bolton: A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Bolton has years of foreign policy experience, but he has raised eyebrows with some of his hawkish positions, including a 2015 New York Times op-ed in which he advocated bombing Iran to halt the country’s nuclear program. Bob Corker: Republican senator from Tennessee and chairman of the upper chamber’s foreign relations committee. The countries that will gain and lose from Trump's presidency Following a U.S. presidential election that has affected more than just the United States – in both negative and positive ways – some world leaders are scrambling to figure out, what now? Mark MacKinnon explains. (Return to table of contents) CIA director Has someone been picked yet? Yes JASON REED/REUTERS Espionage and cybersecurity played an outsized role in the 2016 election, with Washington blaming Russian hackers for an attack on Democratic National Committee servers and Donald Trump inviting Moscow, apparently in jest, to do more hacking to uncover Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. Mr. Trump faced criticism from former national-security officials during the campaign, and in choosing who to lead America’s intelligence agencies, Mr. Trump faces an uphill battle in winning the security establishment’s trust. Mike Pompeo: On Nov. 18, the Trump transition team announced Mr. Pompeo, a GOP congressman from Kansas, had been offered and accepted the nomination for the CIA directorship. Mr. Pompeo originally backed Marco Rubio for the Republican nomination, but is reportedly close with vice-president-elect Mike Pence. (Return to table of contents) Trade Has someone been picked yet? No DARRYL DYCK/THE CANADIAN PRESS Mr. Trump has blamed the North American free-trade agreement and U.S.-Chinese trade policies for eliminating high paying jobs in the United States. He has vowed to rip up NAFTA and label China a currency manipulator. The president-elect’s position on trade won him the support from working class voters, which in turn helped flip Democratic-leaning states Republican. So far, Canada’s ambassador to the United States has said Canada is open to renegotiating NAFTA. Dan DiMicco: The former chief executive of steel producer Nucor Corp. has been talked about as a possible trade representative in the Trump administration. TPP seen as doomed after Trump victory Washington’s apparent intent to scrap pact leaves Canada scrambling for options. Observers suggest looking to Asia for deals, Steven Chase explains. (Return to table of contents) Homeland Security Has someone been picked yet? No CHUCK BURTON/ASSOCIATED PRESS This is expected to be one of the key portfolios in the Trump administration. Mr. Trump kicked off his campaign promising to get Mexico to pay for a wall between their two countries. He said he would deport the 11-million undocumented immigrants living in the United States and has said he would ban Muslims from entering the country. However, his position has wavered throughout the campaign. His latest comments called for the deportation or jailing of what he called three million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Mr. Trump’s supporters have cited illegal immigration as their top issue and they will be watching his administration carefully to ensure he follows through on his promises. David Clarke: The African-American law enforcement veteran made a name for himself by criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it “Black Lies Matter” and saying the activists would join forces with the Islamic State. During the campaign, the Milwaukee County Sheriff told supporters in a tweet that it was “pitchforks and torches” time. (Return to table of contents) Interior Has someone been picked yet? No KAREN BLEIER/AFP/GETTY IMAGES This department is in charge of the country’s natural resources. Sarah Palin: Resource development and exploration has a friend in Ms. Palin. The former Republican vice-presidential nominee and former Alaskan governor became known for her “drill, baby, drill” motto. Other reported possibilities: Jan Brewer, former Arizona governor; Forrest Lucas, founder of oil products company Lucas Oil; Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources Inc.; Robert Grady, venture capitalist, partner in private equity firm Gryphon Investors. Campbell Clark: Thanks to Trump, Trudeau’s calculus on climate no longer adds up For all the questions about what Mr. Trump will do as president, one thing is pretty clear: He won’t advance climate change policies. (Return to table of contents) Secretary of defence Has someone been picked yet? No ASSOCIATED PRESS The Trump administration will have to deal with the rise in terrorism at home and abroad. Mr. Trump’s policies to fight terrorism and defeat Islamic State are vague. Initially, Mr. Trump said he knew more about IS than the generals and then said his plan would entail asking the military to devise a plan within 30 days to destroy Islamic State. Part of his plan is to temporarily ban immigration from certain regions that have a “history of exporting terrorism,” though he has not identified the regions. Some reported possibilities: Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser under President George W. Bush; Jon Kyl, former senator from Arizona; Duncan Hunter, representative from California and member of the House Armed Services Committee; Jim Talent, former Missouri senator who was on the Senate Armed Services Committee; Kelly Ayotte, outgoing senator from New Hampshire and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Trump win puts pressure on Ottawa to boost military spending U.S. leaders have tried to nudge Canada to do more in NATO for decades, but the Trump administration may escalate that, Steven Chase explains. (Return to table of contents) Attorney-general Has someone been picked yet? Yes BLUESTOCKING/iSTOCKPHOTO The country’s top lawyer and chief law enforcer will be instrumental in carrying out Mr. Trump’s promises to bring back “law and order” to the country. Mr. Trump also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Ms. Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server when she served as secretary of state. This raised concerns that Mr. Trump would use the powers of his office to go after his rivals. However, Mr. Trump appears to have softened his position, saying that the Clintons were good people and that he did not want to hurt them. Jeff Sessions: A Trump transition-team official said on Nov. 18 that U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions has accepted Trump’s offer to serve as attorney-general, Reuters reported. The Alabama lawmaker is a member of the judiciary committee and is known for his hardline positions on immigration. Mr. Sessions was one of the few Republican senators to actively campaign on Mr. Trump’s behalf. 'It will be devastating': Women’s rights at risk under Trump presidency Though he has voiced a pro-choice position in the past, his campaign – and the men surrounding him now – has women worrying about the president-elect, Erin Anderssen explains. (Return to table of contents) Energy Has someone been picked yet? No NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION This department is responsible for ensuring the safety of the country’s nuclear weapons. Under previous administrations, the department was also responsible for stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. But Mr. Trump has suggested that the U.S. would benefit if other countries like Japan and South Korea had their own nuclear weapons. Reported possibilities: Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources Inc.; Kevin Cramer, North Dakota congressman; Robert Grady, venture capitalist, partner in private equity firm Gryphon Investors; Larry Nichols, co-founder of Devon Energy Corp.; James Connaughton, CEO of Nautilus Data Technologies and a former environmental adviser to president George W. Bush. (Return to table of contents) Environment NASA Mr. Trump has said he would get rid of the country’s Environmental Protection Agency and has called environmental protection a waste of money.

No pricing details were given in the filing, other than the offering is valued up to $400 million. The company intends to list its American depositary shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol TRVG. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Cowen and Guggenheim. Trivago is a global hotel search platform. The company describes its mission as to “be the traveler’s first and independent source of information for finding the ideal hotel at the lowest rate.” The company is focused on reshaping the way travelers search for and compare hotels, while enabling hotel advertisers to grow their businesses by providing access to a broad audience of travelers via its websites and apps. Its platform allows travelers to make informed decisions by personalizing their hotel search and providing access to a deep supply of hotel information and prices. In the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, Trivago tracked roughly 1.4 billion visits to its websites and apps, resulting in 487 million qualified referrals, and offered access to approximately 1.3 million hotels in over 190 countries. This brand positions Trivago as a key starting point for travelers searching for their ideal hotel. Its fast and intuitive hotel search platform enables travelers to find their ideal hotel by matching individual traveler preferences with detailed hotel characteristics such as price, location, availability, amenities and ratings, across a vast supply of global hotels. In the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, comparing across all of its localized websites and apps, Trivago provided a range of prices per hotel with the cheapest advertiser offering a price on average 19% lower than the most expensive advertiser. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Keep in mind that Trivago is currently a subsidiary of Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE). This filing more or less says that Expedia is looking to simplify its corporate structure by spinning off Trivago while still holding a sizable ownership stake. Shares of Expedia were trading up 2.6% at 122.00 on Tuesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $141.42 and a 52-week trading range of $88.40 to $133.55.

The company, which runs the application allowing users to send “snaps” – video and photo messages that vanish within seconds – could go public as early as March, according to the Wall Street Journal. Read more Alibaba sets IPO record at $168 billion The deal will reportedly be led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, with JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Allen, Barclays, and Credit Suisse to be joint book-runners. Snap confidentially made the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent weeks, according to unnamed sources familiar with the issue. Firms with revenues of less than $1 billion can secretly file for the procedure, as it helps them test investor appetite while keeping their financials confidential. Going public would make Snap the highest-profile tech offering since China’s e-trade giant Alibaba went public with a valuation of nearly $170 billion two years ago. Launched in 2012 as a free mobile app, Snapchat has over 100 million active users, mainly aged 13 to 24, which makes the service attractive for advertisers. Snapchat expects to take in up to $350 million in advertising revenue this year, according to the company. Some experts predict that the messenger will raise that to about $1 billion in revenues in 2017, which would add to the company valuation when it goes public. However, some investors are worried that advertising sales are the company’s only sizeable income source. Earlier this month, Snapchat debuted its $130 video-camera sunglasses, which are equipped with a camera that links wirelessly to a smartphone to take and send photos and videos.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto US retail sales jump 0.8 pct. in sign of consumer health 11/16/2016 - 2:00 AM EST WASHINGTON >> American consumers ramped up their spending last month in a sign of robust health heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in October, after an upwardly-revised 1 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The two-month increase was the largest since the spring of 2014. The numbers suggest that the economy may grow more quickly in the final three months of the year than many economists had expected. Retail sales are closely watched as a sign of consumer health. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy. More Headlines Pottstown's Kiss Cycles closing after 103 years Legoland attraction to debut in spring at Plymouth Meeting Mall Ho, ho, hold up before you spend this season Region's businesses urged to fight data breaches Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs Steady hiring and emerging signs of solid pay increases have made Americans more confident and willing to spend. The unemployment rate fell last month to a low 4.9 percent and in October, workers saw the biggest annual pay gain since the end of the recession. And while many companies, such as Dunkin Donuts, blamed their own weak sales figures in the late summer and fall on consumer concerns surrounding the election, Tuesday's figures show that the presidential campaign had little impact overall. "If electoral uncertainty were restraining activity prior to last Tuesday, it is nowhere apparent in the consumer spending data," JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said. Revisions to September and August data indicate that consumers spent more than previously estimated in the July-September quarter, Feroli said. That means growth in the third quarter may have been as high as 3.2 percent, he estimated, above the 2.9 percent figure reported last month. Some of the biggest sales increases were in autos and gas, with higher prices boosting gas station sales. Even excluding those categories, however, sales rose 0.6 percent in October and 0.5 percent the previous month. Auto sales rose a healthy 1.1 percent, though many dealers relied on steep discounts. Sales of home and garden supplies also rose 1.1 percent in October, a positive sign that more Americans are remodeling and expanding their homes. Home Depot, the nation's biggest home improvement chain, upped its outlook for the year Tuesday after beating Wall Street expectations handily. Customer transactions jumped, as did the amount they spent on each visit, the company said. Most other retailers also saw healthy increases: Grocery stores, health and personal care outlets, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores, and online and catalog retailers all reported strong sales. Online and catalog retailers are continuing to seize market share from older-line outlets such as department stores. Online and catalog sales have increased 12.9 percent in the past year, much faster than the 4.3 percent gain for all retailers. Department stores, meanwhile, have seen their sales plunge 7.3 percent in the past 12 months. Furniture stores were one of the few to report a drop in October, with sales falling 0.9 percent. 1 2 next  last »

The labour market’s resilience was reinforced by another report on Thursday showing announced layoffs by U.S. companies tumbled 18 percent in February. The signs of sustained labour market strength were the latest indication the economy is regaining momentum after slowing in the fourth quarter. “Through some of the ups and downs in the weekly series, it looks like the trend in initial claims has improved over the past month, signaling that the labour market continues to improve despite weakness in several other recent economic reports,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Feb.27, the Labour Department said. Economists had forecast claims slipping to 271,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year. That is the longest period since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 270,250 last week, the lowest level since late November. In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc said U.S.-based companies announced 61,599 job cuts last month, down from 75,114 in January. It said layoffs remained concentrated in the troubled energy sector, which has been hit by a slump in crude oil prices, where employers announced 25,051 job cuts in February. But the firmer labor market picture was dimmed by a third report showing employment in the vast services sector contracting in February for the first time in two years. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of services industries employment fell 2.4 percentage points to a reading of 49.7 percent. That contributed to the ISM’s non manufacturing index dipping 0.1 percentage point to a reading of 53.4 last month. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies and U.S. stocks fell, also reflecting weaker oil prices. Prices for U.S. government debt fell marginally. While the claims data has no bearing on Friday’s employment report for February as it falls outside the survey period, it was the latest indication that the labour market remains on solid footing despite a recent tightening in financial market conditions sparked by worries of a recession. A report on Wednesday showed strong private sector hiring last month, suggesting a pick-up in overall job growth. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs last month after rising 151,000 in January. The unemployment rate is seen steady at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. The encouraging labor market data joins reports on manufacturing and consumer spending in suggesting economic growth picked up at the start of the year after slowing to an annual rate of 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter. In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods rebounded 1.6 percent after dropping 2.9 percent in December. That was the largest increase since June and followed two straight months of declines. The increase in factory orders was the latest suggestion that the worst of the factory slump was likely over. Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut exports. Spending cuts by energy firms in the wake of a plunge in oil prices are also a drag, as are efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut. The signs of a pick-up in economic growth, together with steadily rising inflation and improving financial market conditions could keep interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year on the table. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate at the March 15-16 meeting. The Fed hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity fell at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter and not the 3.0 percent pace it reported last month. Still, labour-related costs increased solidly as companies employed more workers to raise output. While weak productivity has boosted employment growth as companies hire more workers to increase output, sustained weakness could undermine Americans’ living standards.—Reuters Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSyria truce offers glimpses of normality Next articlePakistan would never rollback N-programme Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Top News Pak shoots down Indian Quadcopter Top News Pakistan ready to assist in reviving stalled dialogue Top News Masood to highlight Indian brutalities Digital Newspaper Social Diary 46th National Day of Sultanate of Oman Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: .....

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index dipped after hitting a near 14-year high on Wednesday while oil prices swung in a volatile session as traders were caught between a build in U.S. stockpiles and the chance of an output cut. Declines in bank stocks more than offset gains in the technology sector on Wall Street. The S&P 500 had ended on Tuesday at a 10-week high while the Dow industrials set a record close, fuelled by a post-U.S. election rally. "We had a pretty sharp rally off the election and it was pretty impressive, but it seems pretty clear to me that sort of emotional reaction, if you will, is now long off," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The dollar has surged in the past week, tracking Treasury yields higher on the expectation increased U.S government spending could trigger higher inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 72.62 points, or 0.38 percent, to 18,850.44, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 5.42 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,174.97 while the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 19.73 points, or 0.37 percent, to 5,295.35. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 0.21 percent, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> edged down 0.1 percent. VOLATILE OIL, STRONG GREENBACK Oil prices dipped in choppy trading as the market weighed Russia's comments about a possible meeting with Saudi Arabia about output cuts against a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude storage build. U.S. crude was last nearly flat at $45.84 a barrel and Brent traded at $46.90, down 0.1 percent on the day. Crude had risen more than 1 percent after a statement from the Russian energy minister. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending could boost economic activity while adding to the deficit, and his proposals to deport illegal immigrants and impose tariffs on cheap imports are seen driving inflation higher. That prospect triggered a selloff in U.S. bonds that lifted yields across the board, and raised expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise faster than previously anticipated, giving support to the dollar. U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in an 81 percent chance of a rate hike at the next Fed meeting, scheduled for December. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against a basket of currencies, hit 100.57<.DXY>, its highest since April 2003. It was last little changed on the day. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.0702, while the yen was little changed at 109.12 per dollar, having earlier fallen to 109.75. The greenback rose to an eight-year high against the Chinese yuan of 6.8798 yuan . "The market has gone a bit too far ahead of itself. It looks vulnerable for a short-term pullback," said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York, referring to the dollar rally. Weaker-than-forecast U.S. producer prices and industrial production data on Wednesday supported Treasury prices and capped dollar gains. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.2243 percent, down from 2.238 percent on Tuesday. Spot gold was little changed at $1,227.00 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 0.20 percent to $1,226.90 an ounce. Copper fell 1.3 percent to $5,456.00 a tonne.

An employee of a foreign exchange trading company is reflected in a monitor displaying the Japanese yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in Tokyo, Japan, November 9, 2016.  President-elect Trump's plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending would boost demand while his proposals to deport illegal immigrants and impose tariffs on cheap imports, if implemented, are seen likely to drive inflation higher. That prospect has given rise to expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise faster than earlier anticipated, making the dollar stronger, but investors are still trying to assess what opportunities a Trump presidency will bring. "The markets are having a bit of a pause at the moment. But people still want to do more of this trade," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. "If you look at the U.S. markets, investors are looking at coming infrastructure spending and so on and they are rotating to stocks from bonds." MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday, bouncing back from a four-month low touched earlier this week. The dollar's strength has fanned fears investors could shift funds to the United States from emerging markets. Emerging market stocks managed to rise 0.3 percent on Tuesday after having fallen 7 percent over the previous four sessions. Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to nine-month high on Wednesday, thanks to the dollar's retreat from a 5 1/2-month high against the yen. The dollar was trading at 109.03 yen in late morning trade in Asia, having slipped slightly off high of 109.34 yen struck on Tuesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.29 percent to a record high while the S&P 500 gained 0.75 percent. Since Trump's unexpected victory last week, U.S. shares have rallied while U.S. bond prices tumbled, pushing up their yields sharply. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped to 2.207 percent from Monday's 11-month high of 2.302 percent, although that is sharply above its levels around 1.86 percent before the election. U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in an 85 percent chance of a rate hike, compared to 75 percent before the election. The two-year U.S. notes yield fell to 0.989 percent on Wednesday, having hit a 10-month high of 1.029 percent on Tuesday. Nikko SMBC Securities estimates U.S. two-year notes are currently pricing in five Fed rate hikes in the next two years, said senior strategist Makoto Noji. "If we base our assumption on (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen's gradualist approach, which can be roughly translated as two rate hikes per year, we could say that the market has already priced in tightening they could reasonably imagine at this point," Noji said. "But of course if Trump's policies stoke inflation that cannot be contained by two rate hikes per year, the U.S. bond market could see big moves again," he added. Sharp gains in U.S. bond yields have drawn investors to the dollar, and its index against a basket of six major currencies hit its highest level in almost a year on Tuesday. It slipped slightly in Asia on Wednesday to 99.982, but was still just 0.5 percent away from reaching its highest level in more than 13-1/2 years. The euro traded at $1.0724, just above Monday's $1.0709, its lowest level in almost a year. The Chinese yuan also weakened to 6.8703 to the yuan, its weakest level since December 2008. Gold traded at $1,232.3 per ounce, not far from a 5 1/2-month low of $1,211.8 seen on Monday. In contrast, oil prices hovered near their highest levels in about two weeks after having jumped nearly 6 percent on Tuesday on bets OPEC members will agree to cut output when they meet later this month. U.S. crude futures stood at $45.67 per barrel, after having risen to $46.09 late on Tuesday, their highest since Nov 2.

Thanks for reading and your comments. See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:48pm on 16 Nov 2016 And just to leave you on a high note, you'll be *thrilled* to hear that the sharemarket float of messaging phenomenon Snapchat is likely to make chief executive Evan Spiegel and his Australian fiance, model Miranda Kerr, one of the world's richest young couples. Snapchat's parent, Snap Inc, filed paperwork for an initial public offering that may value the company as high as $US25 billion ($33 billion), The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr Spiegel, a 27-year-old co-founder, is the driving force behind the company. Having proposed to the 33-year-old Ms Kerr five months ago, the couple could be worth around $3.9 billion if the company lists at the top end of the valuation range. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been assigned as underwriters, the Journal reported. A notorious partier [much like your Eds] from a well-off Los Angeles family, Mr Spiegel founded Snapchat when he was a student at Stanford University five years ago studying product design and the social chair of a fraternity. Snapchat was initially designed for sexting - the app was used to send short video messages that erased themselves after a few seconds. But it became a hugely popular rival to Instagram and a popular medium for advertisers chasing hard-to-get younger people. The app is used by more than 150 million people daily, including 41 per cent of American 18 to 34-year-olds, Nielsen estimates. Miranda Kerr and Evan Spiegel got engaged in June. Photo: Andrew Harnik 4:35pm on 16 Nov 2016 A plunge in metal prices set the scene for a flat session on the ASX, as sharp falls in the major miners was only partially offset by gains in big banks and a strong showing from energy stocks. BHP Billiton fell 2.3 per cent, Rio Tinto 3.4 per cent and Fortescue 3.8 per cent after iron ore plunged 6.5 per cent on Tuesday night. Copper also fell sharply, continuing a retreat from a rally that saw its price jump 11 per cent last week. South32 lost 0.8 per cent. The wild swings in commodity prices have "got to be sentiment driven", Arnhem Investment Management portfolio manager Mark Nathan said. "The supply and demand balance doesn't drive a 5 per cent move on a daily basis." The S&P/ASX 200 Index was up by the barest of margins to 5328 points. The major banks provided much of the support to the bourse, as ANZ added 0.8 per cent, CBA 0.6 per cent and NAB 1 per cent, while Westpac could only manage a 0.1 per cent gain. But it was energy stocks which were the standout performers, climbing 2.3 per cent as a group, including a 2.4 per cent gain in Woodside Petroleum and a 3.4 per cent jump in Oil Search. Brent crude oil eased through the Asian trading session, but that came after a 5.7 per cent surge on Tuesday night. Wesfarmers added 1.2 per cent on reports that the conglomerate is looking to sell two coal mines, while Woolworths dropped 0.3 per cent following the surprise resignation of the chief executive of its Big W business. Global biopharmaceutical firm CSL lost 2.3 per cent, despite reporting a positive drug trial, as healthcare names came under pressure, with Mayne Pharma falling 5.2 per cent and Ramsay Health Care 2 per cent. Listed property stocks enjoyed some relief, managing to climb 0.1 per cent as a group as the intense recent selling in global bonds eased. 4:18pm on 16 Nov 2016 Online property classifieds business REA Group was one of the worst performers on the ASX today, dropping a hefty 4 per cent to $49.80. Since its recent peak at the end of July, the former market darling has lost close to a quarter of its market valuation. This fits a with the recent trend of a "huge derating of the technology sector," Arnhem Investment Management portfolio manager Mark Nathan said. That included "internet-type names such as REA Group, Carsales and Technology One," he said. Nathan said that names trading on high price-to-earnings multiples are particularly vulnerable to climbing bond yields, and this trend has only intensified since last week's US presidential election. That's because a high P/E suggests investors are paying a lot for futures earnings growth, and tomorrow's profits are worth less today once a higher discount rate, such as the long-term bond yield, is applied. But Nathan said he believes "most of those stocks offer pretty good entry prices now, given their long term growth potential". Broker analysts concur, with Deutsche Bank, Shaw & Partners and UBS all upgrading REA Group last week. REA Group's share price has been under pressure since bond yields started rising. Photo: Realestate.com.au 3:58pm on 16 Nov 2016 A Sydney insider trader has escaped a jail sentence after he pleaded guilty to trading on the tipoffs he received from his friend nearly a decade ago. At the NSW District Court on Wednesday, Judge Christopher Armitage sentenced Fei Yu to one year of good behaviour bond and ordered him to pay a $10,000 fine and a $17,000 donation to not-for-profit group Financial Literacy Australia. He faced the maximum of five years in jail and a $220,000 fine. Yu had pleaded guilty to one charge of insider trading in March, with a second charge of insider trading to be taken into account on sentence. According to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Yu invested $35,000 in Veda shares and contracts for difference in January 2007 after he received a tip-off about a proposed takeover of Veda by Pacific Equity Partners. The shares were held in the name of Yu's mother and an associate. Yu made more than $20,000 in profit from the trades. Meanwhile, CommSec has paid a $200,000 fine for allowing the relative of a deceased client to trade shares on the dead person's online account for months after the broker was told about the client's death. The failure to lock the dead client's online share-trading account was revealed by the corporate regulator, as it also highlighted broader problems in CommSec's handling of deceased estates. Here's more on the CommSec story A family member was able to make 59 trades on behalf of the deceased client. Photo: Jessica Hromas Back to top 3:24pm on 16 Nov 2016 Oil is hanging onto its strong overnight gains as OPEC members were said to be making a final diplomatic push toward securing a deal to cut output. Oil prices surged nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday, rebounding from an eight-week low on talk that Qatar, Algeria and Venezuela are leading the effort to finalise a deal. Brent, the global benchmark, was flat at $US46.92 a barrel in Asian afternoon trade. "We're looking at a combination of short covering and OPEC hopes," said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management. "There are great hopes that OPEC will be able to come up with some sort of an agreement before the end of the month; it's in their interest." OPEC agreed to an outline of a supply cutting deal in September but with two weeks to go before a November 30 meeting, disagreements persist among members and non-OPEC Russia on crucial details. OPEC secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo will travel to member nations, including Iran and Venezuela, over the next few days to discuss the deal. "Should an agreement to limit production come through, it will be the first in eight years," Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG, wrote in a note. "There remains event risks from US inventory reports in addition to non-OPEC members' stance that could jeopardise the current recovery pace of oilprices," Pan said. The US industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, after the market closed on Tuesday said crude stocks rose last week. 3:05pm on 16 Nov 2016 While the local market is struggling to stay up, just kept afloat by solid gains in the banks, most other regional bourses are posting healthier rises. Japan's Nikkei is up 1.2 per cent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong has added 0.6 per cent, Korea's Kospi is up 0.75 per cent, while the Shanghai Composite has slipped 0.2 per cent. Investors are questioning whether financial markets overreacted to Donald Trump's shock US election victory, which prompted a rout in global bond markets, in many emerging markets but also sparked gains in resource stocks on bets a Trump administration will ramp up public spending, fuelling inflation.  "Things might have got a little bit overdone with the market having got very excited about reflation and what it's going to mean," said Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment Partners. "Most of the sharp adjustment is behind us now and from here you'll need to see tangible evidence of some of those policy moves." Maybe markets got a bit carried away on the Trump trade. Photo: Anthony Kwan 2:36pm on 16 Nov 2016 Embattled online clothing retailer SurfStitch has vowed to rebuild despite forecasting an even sharper decline in operating cash flow because of legal costs. The company has warned a decline in cash from operations in the 2016-17 financial year is set to blow out from its previous forecast of $6-7 million to $9-10 million. SurfStitch made a net loss of $155 million in 2015-16 as it invested heavily in business changes and failed to achieve the strong sales growth it pursued. Aggrieved shareholders lashed out at co-founder Justin Cameron, blaming the former chief executive for the company's woes and a 90 per cent plunge in shareholder value over the last year. "Mr Cameron ... has gone rogue and disappeared in a puff of smoke," shareholder Andrew McPherson told the annual meeting.  "I believe Mr Cameron's actions very much depict a lack of good faith -  if it's shown he had a lack of good faith can he be taken to task personally -  can his golden coffers be brought back and shared with rightly disgruntled people?" Shares are up 2.8 per cent at 18.5 cents today. SurfStitch shareholders have vented their anger. Photo: Andrew Quilty 1:58pm on 16 Nov 2016 The cost of locking in a fixed-rate mortgage could rise thanks to a surge in global bond yields, which has gained momentum after Donald Trump's shock election win. A handful of smaller Australian lenders have already raised fixed interest rates in recent weeks, and there are predictions more will follow if current trends persist. Since the US election last week, global investors have placed growing bets the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner, in response to inflation unleashed by Trump's plans for an infrastructure spending spree and and tax cuts, lifting bond yields around the world. As a result, some experts predict Australian fixed home loan rates may have bottomed, after reaching a record low in recent months. A key benchmark used by banks when pricing fixed-rate loans, three-year swap rates, have lifted by about 20 basis points to more than 2 per cent since Trump's shock win. These rates had already been rising since September, but the trend has gained significant momentum in the past week, as markets try to assess the implications of a Trump presidency. Here's more Several smaller lenders have raised fixed interest rates in recent weeks as bond yields have risen. Photo: Glenn Hunt 1:20pm on 16 Nov 2016 GrainCorp boss Mark Palmquist has moved to temper investor expectations that a bumper crop will deliver easy profits this year after the company's financial performance for 2015-16 came in slightly ahead of expectations. The $2 billion company reported a 3.7 per cent fall in statutory net profit to $30.9 million in the year ended September 30, which was dragged down by $21.8 million in one-off costs. Underlying net profit of $52.7 million was 18.4 per cent higher than the prior year and just ahead of the consensus estimate among nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of $47.8 million. The company had given guidance in February for underlying net profit in the range of $40 million to $55 million.  Full-year revenue rose 1.8 per cent to $4.158 billion, just ahead of analysts' average forecast of $4.134 billion. Mr Palmquist said in the current financial year, to Tuesday, GrainCorp had received about 1.5 million tonnes of grain into its network. "While this year's larger crop is welcome, harvest is at least three weeks late this year and there is a long way to go before it is all stripped and in the bin," he said in a statement. "We are expecting a return to a stronger year in 2016-17, driven by larger volumes and the operational efficiencies delivered in storage and logistics over the past two years, partially offset by new port competition. "Conditions are likely to remain challenging for marketing, with ongoing competition from alternative supply origins, and a global oversupply of grain. These macro factors will continue to impact international grain flows and Australia's competitiveness." Mr Palmquist said the malt division would perform strongly due to customer demand and the oil division would benefit from improved crush margins "off the back of a larger Australian canola crop, and its expansion projects." Graincorp shares have gained 7 per cent over the past year and are slightly lower today at $8.58. The moved as high as $9.09 hit in June. The board declared a final dividend of 3.5¢ to be paid on December 14. There's been a bumper crop of canola this year. Photo: Jason South Back to top 12:58pm on 16 Nov 2016 This morning's wages index data was surprisingly bad, but it will only bother the RBA if it translates into lower inflation, write UBS economists. As an aside, they point out that on this ABS measure, annual wages growth of 1.9 per cent is well below the long-run average of 3.5 per cent. Here's more: Overall, wage rates have been showing signs of stabilising – which led the RBA's Statement on Monetary Policy to highlight less concern about labour costs as a key factor for the (bottoming) inflation outlook. However, the broad-based downside surprise for Q3 WPI – especially the wage bill concept including bonuses – suggests a risk that there could still be some drag on the inflation outlook. However, unless this actually translates to weakness in GDP-basis measures (like average earnings), and consequently to underlying CPI lurching down further from its current 1.5% year-on-year "trough", it probably won't shift the RBA. Given this, we still don't expect the RBA to cut rates any further. And here's JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy weighing in: At first glance the weakness in wage growth may seem odd given that employment growth remains decent and the jobless rate has fallen 0.4 percentage points to 5.6 per cent since January. However other measures of labour market slack such as the underemployment rate remain elevated, and may prove more instructive in deciphering the outlook for wage growth (see chart). Today's data are consistent with this view and suggest that the demand and composition of labour is still insufficient to generate a material pick-up in wage outcomes. The magnitude and breadth of today's weak wage data, coupled with ongoing pressure on corporate margins, underscores our view that core inflation is unlikely to move materially higher anytime soon. For this reason, we remain of the view that the RBA still has more work to do in 2017, with officials likely to be increasingly sensitive to any wobbles in the activity data given most of Australia's nominal indicators (CPI, wages, consumer and business inflation expectations) remain weak. The (high) underemployment rate, rather than the (low) unemployment rate, may prove more instructive in deciphering the outlook for wage growth. Photo: JP Morgan 12:27pm on 16 Nov 2016 Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said President-elect Donald Trump's policies would have a "broadly positive" effect on the US economy and that bond prices likely made a "30-year top". "There is a good chance that we are at one of those major reversals that last a decade," Dalio said in a LinkedIn post, likening the magnitude of possible changes to the shift from the 1960s period of non-inflationary growth to the 1970s decade of stagflation, or the 1980s shift to disinflationary strong growth. "We want to be clear that we think that the man's policies will have a big impact on the world. Over the last few days, we have seen very early indications of what a Trump presidency might be like via his progress with appointments and initiatives, as well as other feedback that we are getting from various sources, but clearly it is too early to be confident about any assessments," he wrote. Donald Trump's stunning victory for the White House wiped out more than $US1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide last week on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. "Donald Trump is moving forcefully to policies that put the stimulation of traditional domestic manufacturing above all else, that are far more pro-business, that are much more protectionist," Dalio said. "We believe that we will have a profound president-led ideological shift that is of a magnitude, and in more ways than one, analogous to Ronald Reagan's shift to the right. Of course, all analogies are also different, so I should be clearer.  "Whereas the previous period was characterised by 1) increasing globalisation, free trade, and global connectedness, 2) relatively innocuous fiscal policies, and 3) sluggish domestic growth, low inflation, and falling bond yields, the new period is more likely to be characterised by 1) decreasing globalisation, free trade, and global connectedness, 2) aggressively stimulative fiscal policies, and 3) increased US growth, higher inflation, and rising bond yields." 'There is a good chance that we are at one of those major reversals that last a decade,' Ray Dalio says.  Photo: Chris Ratcliffe 12:08pm on 16 Nov 2016 Wage growth is on fire - in the US, that is. The Atlanta Fed's wage growth tracker indicates that the median American worker saw her pay rise by 3.9 per cent year-over-year in October, the fastest rate of growth since November 2008. It's an interesting contrast with this morning's wage price index from the ABS, which pointed to the slowest annual wage growth since the statistician started recording it. It's a warning that while investors may be getting carried away with what is happening in the US, the downward pressure on inflation in our economy remains and will factor into the RBA's thinking. The Atlanta Fed's wage metric tracks the incomes of individual workers over time, and as such is not prone to the composition effects — like the exit of higher-paid baby boomers from the labor force — that have weighed on the usual measure of average hourly earnings this cycle. "Average hourly earnings are more susceptible to compositional and demographic changes in the labour force, while the tracker is comparing the wages of the same individuals over time, providing a unique insight into wage growth," said Bespoke Investment Group macro strategist George Pearkes. "That growth has been strong and accelerating recently despite very modest inflation and some remaining underemployment." Wage growth among college-educated employees also outstripped the headline figure — something it hasn't done for the most of the past year — demonstrating that wage pressures are broadening to the upper end of the income spectrum, which has been noted by economists like Macquarie Capital Markets' David Doyle "Today, there is some risk that wage growth is galloping higher as opposed to gradually moving higher," concludes Neil Dutta, head of US economics at Renaissance Macro Research. "There is some risk that wage growth is galloping higher" in the US. Photo: John Minchillo 11:48am on 16 Nov 2016 Annual growth in Aussie workers' wages has hit a new low of 1.9 per cent, ABS data show, suggesting there is still plenty of slack in the jobs market despite a low unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent. Seasonally adjusted, private sector wages grew 0.4 per cent and public sector wages grew 0.6 per cent in the September quarter 2016. Through the year, private sector wages continue to grow at a slower pace than the public sector, 1.9 per cent compared to 2.3 per cent, ABS reported. Annual wage growth is now below 2.5 per cent for all industries. In the September quarter, wage growth ranged from 1.0 per cent for mining to 2.4 per cent for health care and social assistance.  Australian wages rose by 0.4% in the September quarter, to be 1.9% higher over the year. Lowest level since at least 1998 #ausbiz #auspol pic.twitter.com/uqqkYDburl— Callam Pickering (@CallamPickering) November 16, 2016 11:19am on 16 Nov 2016 Not everyone is convinced the RBA's next move will be a rate hike (see post at 10.13am), in fact Macquarie believes the bank will cut twice in the first half of next year. The bank's economists have just lowered their economic growth forecasts for the next three year, saying political uncertainty in the wake of the unexpected US election outcome had, if anything, strengthened the case for more RBA easing. They now expect GDP to grow by 2.1 per cent in 2017 (previously 2.3 per cent), 2.6 per cent in 2018 (3.2 per cent) and 2.7 per cent in 2019 (2.8 per cent) and tip the bank will cut in February and May next year. "The key impact channel domestically is a further delay to the upswing in business investment we had anticipated in financial year 2018, stemming from the shock to confidence – globally and domestically – and anticipated ripple effects of uncertainty given the number of significant elections through 2017." The analysts say the US election result had also strengthened their "risk case" that the RBA might have to drag the cash rate as low as 0.5 per cent, especially if the dollar were to remain stubbornly high. "Confidence in the outlook for China, and commodity prices are likely to support the Australian dollar despite additional RBA easing," they say, adding a rise in the Aussie above $US78¢ would add conviction to their rate cut call. It's currently trading at US75.49¢, about 2 cents below multi-month peaks hit last week before a rally in the greenback weakened the locla currency. But the analysts admit  a lot would need to go wrong, and a lot would need to be done domestically for the RBA to cut below 1 per cent. "Below a 1 per cent cash rate the RBA is also likely to employ a combination of other policy tools," they write in a note to clients. "Specifically, to contain the impact of rate cuts and expected population inflows on Sydney house prices, a further tightening, and specific targeting, of macro prudential policy would be likely." Back to top 11:10am on 16 Nov 2016 Jeffrey Gundlach, co-founder of bond giant DoubleLine Capital, said the stock market is in for a 'bumpy ride' as expectations are dashed that President-elect Donald Trump can quickly spur growth. Gundlach, who first predicted the outcome of the election in January, said Trump doesn't have a magic wand to rapidly improve the economy. He said federal programs take time to roll out, rising mortgage rates and monthly payments aren't positive for the psyche of the middle class, and supporters of defeated Hillary Clinton are not in a mood to spend money. "Maybe liquor sales will go up," Gundlach said on a webcast. "The Trump win is not positive for consumer spending." The manager said the same bankers and economists who predicted that a Trump presidency would sink the economy are now saying his growth policies will fuel the stock market. "We disagree with that," said Gundlach, who urged investors to avoid the FANGs - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - in particular. He said Trump won the election mostly because wage growth has been negative since 1973 for median workers while the richest Americans have had huge gains. "Trump won because people felt abandoned and left behind," he said. Trump's victory dovetails with Gundlach's long-time allocation toward shorter-duration debt to reduce risk in a rising-rate environment, triggered by higher deficit spending. Gundlach has said that Trump, who plans to spend up to $US1 trillion on infrastructure improvements, is "bond unfriendly." Jeffrey Gundlach tips liquor sales might go up thanks to a Trump presidency, but otherwise expects consumer spending to be subdued. Photo: Givaga 10:48am on 16 Nov 2016 BHP Billiton is tipped to increase dividends by more than 60 per cent this financial year as stronger than expected prices for iron ore and coal swell the miner's coffers. BHP was making a profit margin of more than $US230 on each tonne of coking coal sold at Tuesday's market price of $US308 per tonne, and is making more than $US40 margin on each tonne of iron ore sold at Tuesday's price of $US77 per tonne. Stronger than expected commodity prices look set to boost free cash flow well above the $US3.4 billion seen in fiscal 2016, and give the BHP board some interesting decisions to make over spending priorities. While dividends will not return to the heights seen under the "progressive" dividend policy of the past, BHP's new policy introduced in fiscal 2016 gives the board a significant amount of discretion over how much to pay out to shareholders. The policy requires the board to pay out a minimum of 50 per cent of underlying attributable profit every six months, and then consider whether an additional payout is warranted. Analysts believe the company will significantly improve on the US30¢ total dividend paid in fiscal 2016, with market consensus according to Factset suggesting a dividend of US49¢. Individual analyst forecasts are varied and changing quickly with the trajectory of commodity prices; UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock was forecasting a US44¢ dividend for the full year, with US21¢ of that expected to be paid out in February. Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor was more cautious, predicting a US38¢ dividend for fiscal 2017, while BT Investment management analyst Brenton Saunders said it could be between US50¢ and US80¢ for the full year. While dividends may rise, BHP is expected to focus on paying down debt in the immediate future, having been downgraded by Standard & Poors to an A- credit rating in February. BHP prioritises the strength of its balance sheet over all other spending options, including dividends and new projects, and likes to maintain a credit rating of at least A-. The surprise rally in coal prices has been caused by a perfect storm of supply cuts in China and multiple supply interruptions in Australia. BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie. Photo: Paul Jeffers 10:31am on 16 Nov 2016 A steep drop in metal prices overnight wasn't enough to spoil an early sharemarket rally, as gains in the big banks and energy names more than offset weakness in miners. The ASX 200 is up 18 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 5344. The biggest single impetus for the positive start is a 2.2 per cent jump in Wesfarmers, after news broke last night that it was planning the sale of two coal mines. The big four banks are all higher by between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent, while Telstra shareholders can finally take a breath after some vicious selling in the stock - it's up 1.1 per cent as the post-Trump markets current finally showed signs of ebbing. Back to the miners, and BHP is down 1.1 per cent, Rio 1.4 per cent, while South32 is actually up 0.4 per cent. Those are much milder moves than overnight trade in their London-listed shares would have suggested would be the case. Fortescue is off 1.6 per cent. Gold diggers are well up - Newcrest by 3.1 per cent. Energy is the best performing sector, climbing 2.1 per cent as a group. Beach Energy, Santos and Oil Search are all among the morning's best. Listed property names are still under pressure, though, with Stockland and Mirvac both lower. Winners and losers in early trade. Photo: Bloomberg 10:13am on 16 Nov 2016 It's not by a lot, but for the first time in two years markets are betting that the Reserve Bank is more likely to lift rates than lower them next year. Index swaps are pricing in an about 8 per cent chance that over the next 12 months the cash rate will rise from its current record low of 1.5 per cent, according to Credit Suisse data. The momentous shift in the outlook was prompted by the recent rout in global bond markets where yields spiked over the past week on speculation that stimulus spending by a Trump administration will stoke inflation.  But markets had already been trimming the chances of another rate cut since early August, when the RBA last cut rates. Since then, a combination of rallying commodity prices, solid economic growth and worryingly high house prices had prompted the central bank to tone down its rhetoric on future easing. Last night, RBA governor Philip Lowe added to expectations the central bank is done with cutting interest rates. In a speech in Melbourne, Lowe hinted that he was worried further easing could push already elevated levels of household debt even higher. "It is unlikely to be in the public interest, given current projections for the economy, to encourage a noticeable rise in household indebtedness, even if doing so might encourage slightly faster consumption growth in the short term," Lowe said. Citi economist Paul Brennan said the speech showed the central bank is done with cutting interest rates, but added that the first rate rise was also a long way off due to inflation still hovering well below the RBA's target range. "In particular, even on the bank's relatively optimistic economic forecasts of above trend growth later next year and in 2018, the mid-point of the RBA's inflation forecast is for a rise only to the bottom of the 2-3 per cent target." Citi doesn't expect the first rate hike to be before mid-2018.   Market pricing of an RBA move over the next 12 months.  10:06am on 16 Nov 2016 SPONSORED POST If you want to see a Wall St rally, check out American small caps, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: US retail sales staged a mighty comeback last night, lifting the broader markets, with all major indexes trading into the green and new highs. The Russell 2000, more representative of the smaller companies end of the US equities, continued a staggering 8 per cent rise over the past 6 days and is eyeing a close at a record 1300 points. On the back of this the US dollar Index remains king and back over the all-important 100 level as the post-election Trump effect rolls on, with the December rate hike remaining an almost certainty. So the reversion to the mean, with iron ore settling back 6.5 per cent after a great run may see some profit taking in Australian miners today only offset with oil trading 5.5 per cent higher overnight prior to the coming OPEC meeting. This should have a positive offsetting effect for the energy sector in the Aussie market. Some good technical levels in the oilers showing up with Woodside holding above $28.00, last close $29.07, and Santos firmly above $3.80. Watch the Aussie dollar today with RBA Governor Dr Phillip Lowe stating of the three things they worry about the most, a black swan event in China tops the list, but also stated it was unlikely. From the RBA comments that housing is "complicated" and the statement that interest rates may have seen the lows, the immediate roll on effect was 10Y Aussie Bonds moved to yield 2.65 per cent while the AUD cross remains around US75.5c. This currency cross is worth watching as a move away from these levels will provide some great volatility opportunities for traders. Read more.

The dollar was in demand again too, rising to a one year-high against a basket of currencies as the euro hit a nine-month low of $1.07, and to an eight-year peak against the China's yuan. US President-elect Trump's plans to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending would boost economic activity while his proposals to deport illegal immigrants and impose tariffs on cheap imports are seen driving inflation higher. That prospect has given rise to expectations that US interest rates will rise faster than previously anticipated, boosting the dollar. As the Bank for International Settlements warned on Tuesday, a stronger dollar poses risks for global markets. But for now, investors are enjoying the ride, meaning stocks and the dollar are in favour at the expense of bonds. "With 10-year Japanese yields briefly edging back above zero, the market will at some stage focus on whether the Bank of Japan will defend the zero level, especially if the global yield sell-off gathers pace over the coming weeks and months," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said in a note on Wednesday. The BOJ announced in September it would cap the benchmark 10-year yield at zero as part of its long-standing battle against deflation and anaemic growth. "It would be a strange decision to abandon the new policy so soon after announcing it, so assuming global yields remain elevated they may be forced to buy more (bonds) than they thought when the new scheme was announced," Reid said. Japan's 10-year yield rose to 0.03 per cent, a nine-month high. Comparable US Treasury yields rose 3 basis points to 2.27 per cent, edging back up toward Monday's 11-month high of 2.302 per cent and up from around 1.86 per cent before the election. US interest rate futures are pricing in an 85 per cent chance of a rate hike in December, compared to 75 per cent before the election. DOLLAR RISES AGAIN In currency market trading on Wednesday, the dollar rose 0.3 per cent against the yen to a five-month high of 109.62 yen and a one-year high of 100.32 on an index basis. Sharp gains in US bond yields have drawn investors to the dollar, and the dollar index is just 0.5 per cent away from its highest level in more than 13-1/2 years. The yuan weakened to 6.8703 to the dollar, its lowest level since December 2008. "The narrative on the dollar is strong," said Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro. "A move higher in interest rates next month is now a near dead cert, with the implied path for rates next year also moving higher and providing further support for the dollar." In equities, the FTSEuroFirst index of leading 300 European shares followed Wall Street's lead from the previous day and was up 0.2 per cent, underpinned by commodity-related stocks. A 5 per cent fall in Bayer, however, weighed on Germany's DAX, which fell 0.2 per cent. The drugmaker fell after a placement of 4 billion euros of mandatory convertible notes. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent, bouncing back from a four-month low touched earlier this week, while the yen's slide toward 110 per dollar helped lift Japan's Nikkei by 1.1 per cent . The dollar's strength has fanned fears investors could shift funds to the United States from emerging markets. Emerging market stocks, which had fallen 7 per cent in the four sessions to Monday, also extended gains for a second day on Wednesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.29 per cent to a record closing high while the S&P 500 gained 0.75 per cent. Since Trump's unexpected victory last week, US shares have rallied while US bond prices tumbled, pushing up their yields sharply. In commodities gold was steady at $1,228 per ounce, not far from a 5 1/2-month low of $1,211.8 seen on Monday, while an oil industry report that showed an unexpected build in US crude stocks helped take this week's shine off oil prices. Brent futures, the global benchmark, fell 0.8 per cent to $46.55 per barrel. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
