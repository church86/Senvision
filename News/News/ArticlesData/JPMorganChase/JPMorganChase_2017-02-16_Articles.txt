By Mike Cohen and Renee Bonorchis. Added by Agency Staff on 16 February 2017. Saved under News Tweet A South African antitrust regulator has said it found that more than a dozen international and local banks colluded to manipulate foreign-currency trades and recommended some of them be fined 10% of their annual turnover. The Competition Commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings as having participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the commission said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing ANC step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “This could result in fines but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie Group, Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp, Standard Bank Group, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec said it would cooperate with authorities but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations. Barclays Africa Group also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesman for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and nonexecutive directors,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The Competition Commission on Wednesday referred a collusion case to the tribunal for prosecution against 17 banks, including three of South Africa's big banks. The commission said in a statement it has been investigating a case of price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. It has now referred the case to the tribunal for prosecution. The banks are Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc, HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc, Macquarie Bank Limited, ABSA Bank Limited (ABSA), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc (Respondents). The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act. Further, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that 14 of the banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, HSBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa, Commerzbank; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Nomura International and Macquarie Bank - are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover. More on This South African Authorities Crack Down on Banks for Rand Collusion Price Fixing - Punish Guilty Banks Harshly, Urges ANC Questions Over Timing of Banks' Collusion Case The commission said it found that from at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar / rand currency pair. It further found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. The commission said traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. "The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves," said Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele.

Absa Bank will be spared a stiff penalty by the Competition Tribunal for its part in international forex collusion after it earlier came forward and confessed to the Competition Commission what was going on. Commission spokesperson Sipho Ngwema confirmed to Moneyweb on Thursday night that Absa applied for corporate leniency as whistle blower and that one other bank that he did not name, might admit guilt and enter into an agreement with the Commission. The Commission on Thursday afternoon said in a statement it would proceed to prosecute 17 international banks it alleges were guilty of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand. Investec, Standard Bank of SA and Absa Bank are among those involved. The CompCom alleges that the practice has been ongoing since 2007 and has referred the matter to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The commission is seeking an order that the banks have contravened the Competition Act and want an administrative penalty of 10% of their annual turnover imposed on the banks. The banks accused of collusion are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited,  BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase & Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc., HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc., Macquarie Bank Limited, Absa Bank Limited (Absa), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc. Ngwema said the investigation is a leg of the international investigation into such activities and the Commission was working with other agencies in this regard. Bloomberg reported in January that four banks, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of Scotland pleaded guilty in May 2015 to rigging currency rates. “As part of an overall $5.8 billion settlement with multiple regulators, they agreed to pay the roughly $2.5 billion to the (US) Justice department. It was not immediately clear exactly how the local prosecution fits in with this process. Bloomberg reported that the US Justice department “isn’t finished probing global financial markets for collusion after years of investigating currency trading and interest-rate benchmarks that have resulted in more than $4 billion in criminal penalties.” Financial Times reported that global banks have now paid more than $10bn in relation to the forex scandal, exceeding the $9bn paid by a larger group of institutions to settle the Libor rigging claims. Calls have also recently been made in the US for the criminal prosecution of the individual traders involved in the collusion. The South African Competition Commission said in a statement that it found that from at least 2007, “the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/rand currency pair. “Further, the commission found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. “Traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform.  They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. “The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” said commissioner, Tembinkosi Bonakele. Standard Bank declined an invitation to comment. Investec said it will cooperate with the competition authorites. “Unfortunately at this stage we still do not have further detail with respect to the nature of the investigation and are thus not able to comment on the matter,” Investec said in an emailed statement. Absa also said it will continue to co-operate with the Commission and pointed out that that the Competition Commission has not sought any penalties against Absa. In response to the announcement former FNB CEO Michael Jordaan pointed out on Twitter that FirstRand and Nedbank were not among the accused banks.

The Competition Commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Chase & Co, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings and Nomura Holdings as having participated in price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Pretoria, South Africa-based commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing ANC step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. No disruption “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “This could result in fines but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered Plc, Commerzbank AG, Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp, Standard Bank Group Ltd, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Investec Plc said it would co-operate with authorities but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations. Barclays Africa Group also said it would cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Serious matter South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesperson for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors.,” said Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation. ”   Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Ramaphosa, Zuma cold war hits freezing point National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 National | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorial: Zuma’s fears erode democracy Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 Editorials | 2017-02-10 00:00:00 A not-so-proudly South African link to Trump's inner circle Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 Opinion | 2017-02-08 11:08:00 OkMalumKoolKat: The case of an escape artist Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 Music | 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ANC plans 'constitutional revolution' on land Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Politics | 2017-02-03 00:00:00 Most Read Client Media Releases Press OfficesAfroCentric HealthBarloworld LogisticsBoston City CampusCIO Council of South AfricaContinuitySACorporate TravellerDefencewebFaculty Training InstituteFCm Travel SolutionsFedGroup Financial ServicesFutureSenseGIBSHollardImperial LogisticsInternet SolutionsIpsosiStoreITWebJag MethodLime CapitalLottery ResultsKhulumani Support GroupMail and GuardianMandela Bay DevelopmentMiWayMiX TelematicsMessageLOUDMitelMTNNihilent TechnologiesNorth West UniversityOxbridge AcademyPragmaRosebank CollegeSANRALSAS InstituteSAP AfricaSentechSoarsoft InternationalTeraco Data EnvironmentsThe Innovation HubTiger BrandsVaal University of Technology North West University NRF recognises NWU professor's research Barloworld Logistics Paving the road ahead for young entrepreneurs Soarsoft International Lunch & Learn with Soarsoft International and iManage SANRAL SANRAL welcomes ConCourt judgment on N1/N2 Winelands iStore Introducing iStore Makers: the evolution of iPhoneography Want to publish your media releases here?

Three South African Banks have been accused of price-fixing They are accused by the Competition Commission of manipulating the price of the rand when selling and buying dollars through fictitious buy and sell orders to change supply of the currency. They are also accused of using trading chat rooms to co-ordinate times for the sale of rands or stop selling for a time in order to manipulate prices from 2007. “This is a big deal‚” said market commentator and trader Simon Brown. He said it was a major announcement because “our Competition Commission[ers] are good at what they do”. He also said the rand affected the petrol price and this is also why accusations of manipulating currency have implications and huge interest for South Africans. The commission said in a press release yesterday afternoon that it was “seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the respondents have contravened the Competition Act”. It is “seeking an order declaring that the Bank of America, Merrill Lynch International Limited‚ BNP Paribas‚ JP Morgan Chase & Co‚ JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A‚ Investec Ltd‚ Standard New York Securities Inc‚ HSBC Bank Plc‚ Standard Chartered Bank‚ Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd‚ Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited‚ Nomura International Plc and Macquarie Bank Limited are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover”. Of the three South African banks in the spotlight‚ it appears Absa may escape prosecution and fines because of its co-operation with the commission. While neither Standard Bank nor Investec had responded to the announcement by yesterday evening‚ Absa issued a brief comment that it would “continue to cooperate” with the commission during the prosecution. “It should be noted that the Competition Commission has not sought any penalties against Absa,” it said. Brown said: “That list of banks involved is so long‚ one almost asks ‘who is not the list?’” He said banking scandals had become common globally. “We have seen so many of them‚ with accusations of banks manipulating the gold price and Libor rates in Britain. There is a lot of dodgy stuff.” Libor, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is a benchmark rate that some of the world’s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans and is used to calculate interest rates on loans around the world. Banks never admit they were wrong but pay large non-admission of guilt fines‚ said Brown. Share prices for the three local banks barely moved after the announcement. Brown said this may be partly because the investigation by the tribunal would take a long time. “I am expecting a Twitter storm. The banks are under huge pressure in South Africa.” Most foreign banks had local financial assets and offices that could be attached if they were eventually fined, making it not so easy to ignore local competition authorities. — TMG Share this story: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Recommended Battered banks face tough year Banks now offering cheaper accounts Standard Bank‚ Absa face prosecution‚ huge fines over price fixing allegations Fifa bans Safa official Kika over match-fixing scandal SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGONUBIE – 3 Bedroomed House Next articleWhat Trump told Zuma in that phone call Katherine Child RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Car guard goes hi-tech to beat cash drought #FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile is ‘fine’ despite being on hunger strike Youth who ate poison fish dies NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply e-Edition DispatchLive publishes selected content from the Daily Dispatch.

The commission said on Wednesday it had referred the banks to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution in a case that could result in massive fines and lengthy jail time for their directors. It said that it had recommended fines against Nomura International, Standard Bank and Investec, among others, equaling 10 percent of their annual turnover for the collusion. The commission’s commissioner, Thembinkosi Bonakele, said the referral of the matter would allow the banks to air their side of their story. “The referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case, as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves,” Bonakele said. Last week, while delivering the State of the Nation address, President Jacob Zuma applauded the work done by the commission in uprooting collusion in the country. “The competition authorities have done excellent work to uncover the cartels and punish them for breaking the law. Last year I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on May 1. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years,” Zuma said. Besides Nomura, Standard Bank and Investec, other implicated banks include Absa, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard New York Securities, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Standard Chartered Bank, Barclays Capital, Macquarie Bank, Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank and Barclays Capital. Read also: Big four bank 'dominance must end' The commission’s probe followed the admission by Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland to the UK and US authorities in 2015 that they had cheated clients by using invitation-only chat rooms to co-ordinate trades. The four banks were fined close to $6billion (R79.3bn) for the collusion. The currency trading market is estimated to be worth $5 trillion a day. Last year, European antitrust regulators fined HSBC, Crédit Agricole and JP Morgan Chase a total of just over R6.8 billion for colluding to fix benchmark interest rates tied to the euro. The South African probe began in 2015 and focused on price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand. The commission said it had found that since 2007 the banks had agreements to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/rand currency pair. Absa said it must be borne in mind that the commission had not sought any penalties against it. “Following the decision of the South African Competition Commission to refer several banks including Absa Bank to the Competition Tribunal, Absa will continue to co-operate with the commission during the prosecution of this matter,” Absa said. The commission further found that the banks had manipulated the price bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fiction bids and offers at particular times. Investec said it was awaiting more details on the move by the commission, but would co-operate with the process. “Investec will co-operate with the competition authorities with respect to their investigation. “Unfortunately, at this stage we still do not have further detail with respect to the nature of the investigation and are thus not able to comment on the matter,” said Investec. The commission said it had found the implicated banks also used a complex method in their collusion, which included using the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg instant messaging. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by co-ordinating trading times. “They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform,” the commission said. Standard Bank spokesperson Erik Larsen said the bank would not be commenting. The South African Reserve Bank said it noted the decision and that it had already begun reviewing foreign exchange operations of authorised foreign exchange dealers in the domestic market. “The rand is a globally traded currency. Some 30 percent of daily turnover in the ZAR takes place in South Africa, and turnover with non-residents accounts for 57.5 percent of domestic turnover,” the Reserve Bank said.

 There's a hot new posting for Wall Street bankers Matt Turner Feb. 7, 2017, 9:50 AM 6,707 facebook linkedin twitter email print Guy D'Alema/FX Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to places like Seattle, Denver, and Atlanta. JPMorgan just hired Brennan Spry as head of corporate client banking and specialized industries in the South, for example. Spry previously worked in Barclays' investment banking division. Spry will be based in Atlanta, overseeing a team of bankers in the region who provide services to large companies with more than $500 million in annual revenues. In addition, the bank has hired Nina Sprinkle to the corporate client banking team in Atlanta as a senior banker responsible for serving companies in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. She previously worked in syndicated and leveraged finance at SunTrust and Bank of America. Matt Tugwell has also joined as a senior banker focused on the Carolinas. He was most recently at Bank of America in the leveraged finance group. JPMorgan isn't the only bank hiring staff for or moving staff to regional centers in the US. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider last year. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth."

Currency Competition Commission Competition Commission of South Africa Bank collusion Hardin Ratshisusu Email Print Tweet Share Thando Kubheka | one hour ago JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Commission has described traders linked to 17 banks, who have been referred to the Competition Commission Tribunal for manipulating its value, as highly skilled and sophisticated. It says the traders used many platforms, including Bloomberg's instant messaging service, to distort the market. Local banks include Standard Bank, Investec and Absa and international institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Nomura and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The commission found that from at least 2007 these banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids in relation to currency trading involving the rand and dollar. Deputy competition commissioner Hardin Ratshisusu says, “As long as a trader is linked to a particular bank and they were doing business for that bank, then that bank is involved in that collusive party.” The banks named in the case are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited BNP Paribas JP Morgan Chase & Co JP Morgan Chase Bank NA Investec Ltd Standard New York Securities Inc HSBC Bank Plc Standard Chartered Bank Credit Suisse Group Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd Commerzbank AG Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Nomura International Plc Macquarie Bank Limited ABSA Bank Limited Barclays Capital Inc Barclays Bank plc (Edited by Shimoney Regter) Timeline 'People buying rand would have been affected by bank collusion' 2 hours ago Political parties react to bank collusion case 3 hours ago Competition Commission confident of case against 17 banks 5 hours ago ANC: Collusion findings places doubt on trust in SA banks 14 hours ago More in Local ‘Don’t let his life go in vain,’ cops told after member killed 27 minutes ago Gautrain services between PTA & Hatfield suspended until further notice 40 minutes ago No compensation for families of Lily Mine collapse yet, creditors meet one hour ago Chikane: Allegations against my wife unfounded & slanderous one hour ago Health officials urged to remain vigilant for measles cases one hour ago Cops chase down suspects in Raymond Barras murder one hour ago Comments EWN welcomes all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here TOKYO: The dollar pulled back on Thursday after rising to one-month highs in the wake of upbeat US economic data, with demand for the greenback cooling as Treasury yields came off their peaks. Better-than-expected US inflation and retail sales data had backed expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since January 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asia session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 per cent at 113.84 yen. "The dollar is struggling as US Treasury yields retreated from highs," said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. US benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 per cent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 per cent on Wednesday following the upbeat US data. Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 per cent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 per cent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 per cent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. "Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption," said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. "Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week," added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two per cent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the US economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 per cent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since Nov. 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

Feb 16 2017 08:54 Mike Cohen and Renee Bonorchis Related Articles Price fixing: Punish guilty banks harshly, urges ANC Questions over timing of banks' collusion case How banks allegedly colluded on currency trades Competition Commission prosecutes banks for collusion   Cape Town – The Competition Tribunal will need to establish whether the manipulation of foreign-currency trades was done by rogue traders or whether it was more widespread at the 17 banks identified by the Competition Commission on Wednesday. That is according to Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in Cape Town. “We need to establish if it’s a rogue trader or if this more widespread,” said Rassou. “This could result in fines, but the Reserve Bank will ensure that it doesn’t cause disruption in our capital markets.” Asief Mohamed, chief investment officer at Cape Town-based Aeon Investment Management, said earnings and reputations could be at stake. “Collusive practices must lead to consequences such as termination of the services of key management, executive and non-executive directors,” said Mohamed. “The banks, if guilty, will most likely be fined and will have a negative impact on earnings and reputation.” READ: Punish guilty banks harshly, urges ANC Investec said it will cooperate with authorities, but was unable to comment further because it didn’t have details of their investigations.  Barclays Africa Group (which owns Absa) also said it will cooperate with the authorities, while noting that the regulator had not sought penalties against it. Credit Suisse said it is looking into the matter. Bank of America, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie., Australia & New Zealand Banking, Standard Bank, HSBC and BNP declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Banks manipulated the price of bids and offers On Wednesday, the Competition Commission recommended some of them be fined 10% of their annual turnover after concluding an investigation that began in 2015. “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Competition Commission said. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” READ: How banks allegedly colluded on currency trades The outcome of the investigation comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing African National Congress step up pressure to break the dominance of South Africa’s largest lenders and improve access to the economy that still alludes many of the country’s black majority almost 23 years since the end of apartheid. South Africa’s efforts to better regulate foreign-exchange trading follows a price-rigging scandal in which some of the world’s largest banks agreed to pay fines and plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate markets after being accused of using online chat rooms to collude. South Africa’s central bank said it viewed the allegations as a serious matter and would allow proceedings to run their course. The tribunal will now notify the banks of the complaint and ask them to respond, Chantelle Benjamin, a spokesperson for the body, said by phone. The banks will then file statements and attend a preliminary meeting to set a date for a full hearing, she said. The commission has previously uncovered collusion in the country’s bread and flour industry, among cement producers and by construction companies that bid to build stadiums for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Those involved were forced to pay hefty fines.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau Nestle While maintaining sell call on Nestle with a target price at Rs 5,650, CLSA says valuations are rich at over 45x one-year forward earnings. "We like company's increasing growth focus but it takes time to show up," the brokerage house says, adding it continued to build in ramp-up in revenue as Maggi noodles gain traction ahead. Credit Suisse has maintained underperform rating on the stock as company's valuations are expensive compared to peers. The research firm says it cut earnings by 3-4 percent as company finding it tough to get Maggi back to old form. 5-10 percent higher Q4 sales validate slowdown in ramp of Maggi, it feels. Phoenix Mills CLSA has retained its buy call on Phoenix Mills, with reduced target price at Rs 460 from Rs 479.

HDIL JPMorgan is overweight on HDIL, with a target price at Rs 140 as net debt continued to decline and thesis on the stock is intact. Pre-sales were weak in Q3 but the brokerage house expects a recovery in FY18. According to the research firm, market's focus on company's earnings is wrong. ICICI Prudential CLSA says insurance sector will be key beneficiary of shift in savings pattern from physical assets. Unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs) can be attractive given lower deposit rates and good return from capital markets, it feels. Mutual fund assets increased by 36 percent YoY, though it is debt funds that formed 67 percent of total, it says. CLSA expects new premium collections to see 16 percent CAGR over FY16-19. ICICI Prudential Life remains its key pick in the sector, the brokerage house says. Ajanta Pharma With recommending sell on Ajanta Pharma, Ambit says dream run led by strong growth in Africa would end with return of incumbents in FY18, no growth in donor funding over 2016-19, and re-alignment of portfolio in branded generics. These would result in a 3 percent decline in revenues in FY18 in Africa, it feels. In domestic, as Ajanta hits the ceiling in existing therapies, growth could taper but remain higher than IPM led by brand equity, it says. The brokerage house says US business will gain on cost arbitrage and low base, but both short-term opportunities at best. With margin/return on capital employed compression and premium valuations, Ambit sees downside risk to bull case Street expectations.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Dollar retreats as US Treasury yields come off highs Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Tokyo, Feb 16:   The dollar pulled back on Thursday after rising to one-month highs in the wake of upbeat US economic data, with demand for the greenback cooling as Treasury yields came off their peaks. Better-than-expected US inflation and retail sales data had backed the expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since January 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asian session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 per cent at 113.84 yen. “The dollar is struggling as US Treasury yields retreated from highs,” said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. US benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 per cent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 per cent on Wednesday following the upbeat US data. US economic data Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 per cent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 per cent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 per cent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. “Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption,” said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. “Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week,” added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed rate hike Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen had hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two per cent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the US economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 per cent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since November 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

Picture: EWN. Currency Competition Commission Competition Tribunal of South Africa Thembinkosi Bonakele Email Print Tweet Share Stephen Grootes | 5 hours ago JOHANNESBURG – The Competition Commission says it's confident of its case against 17 banks accused of manipulating the currency because it has evidence that they faked bids to distort supply and demand. It announced on Wednesday that it referred the case against the banks to the Competition Tribunal, but says it does expect settlements to be reached. The banks include local institutions like Absa Bank, Standard Bank and Investec as well as international banks like JPMorgan Chase, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC. Competition Commissioner Thembinkosi Bonakele says they're completely sure of their case. “It would not make sense at all to defend a case like this. It’s very strong and I would expect that a lot of banks would do the right thing and settle it.” He says they want to make sure this cannot happen again. “We always like it when we get into the industry that not only do we fine people, but that the conduct is stamped out completely, and this is what we would expect the banks to do.” The commission says the banks had been co-ordinating their trades, creating false bids, and communicating their intentions through the Bloomberg instant messaging service to distort the market. The banks named in the case are: Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited BNP Paribas JP Morgan Chase & Co JP Morgan Chase Bank NA Investec Ltd Standard New York Securities Inc HSBC Bank Plc Standard Chartered Bank Credit Suisse Group Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd Commerzbank AG Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Nomura International Plc Macquarie Bank Limited ABSA Bank Limited Barclays Capital Inc Barclays Bank plc (Edited by Tamsin Wort) Timeline Traders in bank collusion ‘highly skilled’ & ‘sophisticated’ one hour ago 'People buying rand would have been affected by bank collusion' 2 hours ago Political parties react to bank collusion case 3 hours ago [BREAKING NEWS] Bank collusion case referred to Competition Tribunal 18 hours ago More in Local ‘Don’t let his life go in vain,’ cops told after member killed 24 minutes ago Gautrain services between PTA & Hatfield suspended until further notice 37 minutes ago No compensation for families of Lily Mine collapse yet, creditors meet one hour ago Chikane: Allegations against my wife unfounded & slanderous one hour ago Health officials urged to remain vigilant for measles cases one hour ago Cops chase down suspects in Raymond Barras murder one hour ago Comments EWN welcomes all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.

The Spectator Seattle University's student newspaper since 1933. About Contact Jobs Staff Advertise Galleries Home News A & E Features Opinion Sports Comics Columns Go to...Home News A & E Features Opinion Sports Comics Columns Opinion Op-Ed: Who Will Answer to Standing Rock? Nicolás Cruz No Comments » Feb 15th, 2017 Last week the Army Corps of Engineers issued the final easement for Energy Transfer Partners to dig the remaining portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This final stretch will be laid horizontally under Lake Oahe half a mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The Army Corps decision came at the behest of President Trump’s executive order pushing this pipeline and the already dead Keystone XL pipeline through without proper review. Construction has already begun and the pipeline could carry oil in as little as 30 days. Meanwhile, a federal judge has denied the tribe’s request to halt construction, arguing that the damage can’t be done until oil begins flowing. But the police violence, private security attacks, and mass arrests have already done great harm to Standing Rock and their allies. And with Federal, State, and County governments intent on continuing the colonial assault on Indigenous land, water, and life by working unabashedly for the oil companies and banks funding this pipeline, who will answer to Standing Rock? The president won’t. In fact, it is yet unclear if either president will. Congress won’t. The soon-to-be-gutted EPA won’t. So how do we respond to the call by Standing Rock for a last stand, which if anything will be the beginning of merely a different form of resistance? We stop giving money to the banks that are funding DAPL. If you have accounts with Wells Fargo, Citibank, US Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Compass Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC Bank, or one of the other 9 banks that have given Dakota Access $3.75 billion in credit, consider closing your account. Go to a local branch or call customer service and tell them you want to close your account specifically because of their support for the pipeline. Remember that bank tellers aren’t the enemy so be nice to them but be firm; they might try to talk you out of it. Take your money to a credit union like Salal or BECU (they also charge less exorbitant fees). Encourage your friends and family to also take their money out of the 17 banks that fund DAPL. We cut institutional ties with those banks. Look at your SU ID card and flip it over, see the logo on the bottom right? “US Bank.” Why? Because SU has a deal with US Bank for the latter to provide ID cards in exchange for a monopoly on banking services on campus, rights to advertise to students, and access to “significant on-campus activities and events.” In fact, SU receives royalties depending on the “Penetration %” of the student body by US bank account creation. Student Government could present a resolution to urge Connie Kanter, VP of Finance and Business Affairs, to severe this agreement in response to the bank’s support of this pipeline. Divesting from banks is the most direct institutional route of action that takes away money from the projects that harm our communities. The City of Seattle just did this with Wells Fargo to the tune of $3 billion, so why can’t we? We support those who are on the frontlines. Water protectors have been arrested and charged with egregious crimes such as inciting a riot, which is a felony charge. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has taken on a heavy financial and environmental burden of hosting the protest camps. If you or your families can afford to, donate it to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe itself (standingrock.org), a legal defense fund for water protectors (https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/11B5z8), or the legal team fighting to stop the pipeline in court (lakotalaw.org). We stop investing in the companies that will profit off the oil flowing through this pipeline. You’ve heard it from me before but now is the time for Seattle University to divest from fossil fuels. Urge the university to commit to divesting and to inform its investment manager to remove our comingled funds that ultimately fund projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sundborg says it is too hard but we must show him that the alternative is not only much harder on those who will face the detriments but is also morally wrong. Sign the petition, come to our next event in March, and join the movement. Check out SSA’s website: divestsu.weebly.com for more information. We put our bodies on the line through direct action. The partial victories that have come against the pipeline, including the original plan for an Environmental Impact Statement, did not come from either negotiating alone or from the goodwill of those in power. It was the direct action of the water protectors at Standing Rock and activists across the globe that are targeting banks, oil companies, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other guilty parties that have had the biggest impact. Now with the government’s obvious support of the pipeline, direct action takes on an even more crucial role. Stay tuned for how to get involved in direct action! —Nicolás Cruz Contact Nicolás with questions or to get plugged in at cruzn@seattleu.edu.

Better-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales data had backed expectations of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, sending the dollar index to 101.76 on Wednesday, a peak unseen since Jan. 12. It has since retreated to 100.92 in the Asia session on Thursday. The dollar also came off from a 2-1/2-week high of 114.95 marked on Wednesday against the yen, touching a low of 113.73. It was last down 0.3 percent at 113.84 yen. "The dollar is struggling as U.S. Treasury yields retreated from highs," said Junya Tanase, chief currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields slipped to 2.484 percent on Thursday, after climbing to a three-week high of 2.524 percent on Wednesday following the upbeat U.S. data. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest gain in nearly four years, jumping 0.6 percent in January. Retail sales also outpaced expectations, increasing 0.4 percent last month compared to the analysts' poll of 0.1 percent. But some analysts also noted that the data may not be as strong as it appears, while industrial output and a gauge on home builder sentiment took unexpected spills. "Retail sales seemed to have been boosted by higher prices rather than an increase in the real consumption," said Shin Kadota, senior forex strategist at Barclays. "Investors also took profit as the dollar was trading high this week," added Kadota. Up until Tuesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak. Fed Chair Janet Yellen offered no additional insight on the timing of the central bank's next rate hike in her second day of economic testimony before Congress on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Yellen hinted more rate hikes were on the way as the jobs market has improved and inflation has shown signs of nearing the Fed's two percent goal. Markets will get another chance to check the U.S. economic pulse from another batch of data, including housing starts, building permits and the Business Outlook Survey by Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The euro edged up 0.15 percent at $1.0614, recovering from a five-week trough of $1.052 touched on Wednesday. Elsewhere, the Australian dollar hovered near a three-month high following a slightly better-than-expected reading in the country's January employment data. The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7709 after touching $0.7732, its highest since Nov. 10. Sterling last stood at $1.2460, edging up from a one-week trough of $1.2384 touched on Wednesday, knocked by slowing wage growth in the fourth quarter - bad news for British consumers facing a surge in inflation in the months ahead.

The EUR/USD pair bottomed for the day at 1.0521, its lowest level since January 11th, but the greenback changed course during the US afternoon, suddenly entering negative territory daily basis against all of its major rivals. Dollar's reversal came in spite of another strong tax headline from US President Trump, who said that a massive tax plan will see the light in the "not-too-distant future," when speaking with retail executives. The pair set a daily high of 1.0608, but settled a few pips below 1.0590. In the US, January Retail Sales rose by 0.4% when compared to the previous month, while the core reading, ex-autos, advanced 0.8%. Inflation in the same month surged by the most in four years, up by 0.6%, doubling expectations of 0.3%. The annual inflation rate printed 2.5%, above the 2.4% expected and previous 2.1%. Additionally, the New York Empire State Manufacturing index for February surged to 18.7, a strong bounce from previous 6.5, and the highest reading in over two years. The late recovery was not enough to revert the negative tone of the pair, as in the 4 hours chart, the recovery stalled right around a still bearish 20 SMA. Furthermore and in the same chart, technical indicators have posted moderate bounces from their mid-lines, but remain well into negative territory. The pair has briefly broke below the 1.0565 Fibonacci support before recovering above it, but renewed selling interest below the level will likely result in fresh weekly lows, particularly if hopes about the upcoming US tax reform keep fueling sentiment. Additional gains beyond 1.0625, the immediate resistance, could result in a recovery up to the 1.0660 region, en route to the critical 1.0705 price zone. Support levels: 1.0565 1.0520 1.0470 Resistance levels: 1.0625 1.0660 1.0705 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair retreated from a fresh weekly high of 114.95 to close the day flat in the 114.20 region. The greenback got a boost from much better-than-expected inflation and retail sales January data, but was unable to sustain gains and plummeted to 113.85 as the dollar index suffered a sharp reversal after printing a 4-week high of 101.73. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda spoke early Wednesday, but said nothing new, noting that policy makers have no plan to raise the central bank's bond yield targets, and that inflation is still far from the 2% target. There are no major economic releases scheduled for this Thursday. From a technical point of view, the pair still has to firm up above 114.55, the 23.6% retracement of the November/December rally, to be able to recover further. In the 4 hours chart, the price is struggling around a bearish 200 SMA, whilst technical indicators turned south from near overbought readings, indicating that buying interest is still limited. The 100 SMA in the mentioned char stands flat around 113.35, with a break below it most likely resulting in a bearish extension during the following sessions. Support levels: 113.85 113.35 112.90 Resistance levels: 114.55 114.90 115.40 GBP/USD The GBP/USD pair closed the day marginally lower around 1.2445, with the Pound hit by mixed employment data coming from the UK. According to official numbers, the employment rate rose to 74.6% in the three months to December, the highest rate on record, whilst the unemployment rate remained steady at an eleven-year low of 4.8%. Average hourly earnings including bonus, however, rose 2.6% in the same period, below previous 2.8%, the slower pace in almost two years. In January, unemployment claims fell by 42.4K much better than the 0.8K expected. Weak earnings in a rising inflation environment, may affect overall economic growth during the upcoming months. The pair traded as low as 1.2382 before settling around 1.2440, and the 4 hours chart shows that a late spike was contained by selling interest around a bearish 20 SMA, whilst technical indicators maintain modest bearish slopes within negative territory. The pair has an immediate support at 1.2430, the 38.2% retracement of its latest bullish run, followed by the mentioned daily low. Below this last, the pair has scope to extend down to the 1.2330/50 region a major support area that will likely hold on a first attempt to break lower. Support levels: 1.2430 1.2380 1.2345 Resistance levels: 1.2500 1.2535 1.2585 GOLD Spot gold bounced sharply from a daily low of 1,216.64, ending the day around $1,231.60 a troy ounce. The recovery was limited, as US data released this Wednesday backed Yellen's Tuesday comments about being risky to wait too long to raise rates, as inflation pressures are increasing. Dollar bulls rushed to take profits after the currency reached some critical levels against its major rivals, resulting in a strong intraday reversal that anyway is not enough to confirm an interim top. In the case of stop gold, the daily chart shows that the price bounced sharply after testing its 20 DMA, still advancing below the 100 DMA, whilst technical indicators are attempting to recover after a modest downward correction from overbought readings. In the 4 hours chart, the price is slightly above a flat 20 SMA whilst technical indicators head higher around their mid-lines, with limited upward strength. While further gains are not technically confirmed the risk of a bearish move seems well-limited according to technical readings, with only a break below the 1,200 level indicating a steeper decline afterwards. Support levels: 1,221.80 1,210.10 1,200.00 Resistance levels: 1,237.10 1,244.70 1,252.90 WTI CRUDE West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures closed flat for a second consecutive day a few cents above $53.00 a barrel, as large US stockpiles builds dented optimism about OPEC's output cut. US crude stocks rose 9.5 million barrels according to the EIA, much more than the 3.7 million expected, while gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.8 million barrels, also far beyond market's expectations. A decline in distillate stocks and crude oil imports partially offset the headline reading. Technically, the daily chart maintains the neutral stance seen on previous updates, with the price still stuck around a flat 20 SMA and technical indicators heading nowhere around their mid-lines. In the 4 hours chart, the price is trapped within horizontal moving averages, the Momentum indicator is flat below its 100 level, whilst the RSI indicator has turned south around its mid-line. Overall, the fundamental background favors a bearish extension, but it will take a break below 52.60 to confirm such move, with WTI then poised to test the key 50.00 figure. Support levels: 52.60 52.00 51.40 Resistance levels: 53.70 54.40 55.20 DJIA The positive momentum of US equities sent the three major indexes to all-time highs for a fifth consecutive session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 107 points to close at 20,611.58. The Nasdaq Composite added 36 points, to end at 5,819.44 whilst the S&P settled at 2,349.25, up 0.50%. The unstoppable rally was fueled by comments from US President Trump, who reaffirmed a massive tax reform will come in the "not-too-distant future." Banks were again among the best performers, with JP Morgan Chase up 1.15% and Goldman Sachs adding 0.47%. The DJIA daily chart shows that technical indicators keep heading sharply higher, despite being in extreme overbought territory, with the RSI indicator at 81, whilst the index is far above a bullish 20 DMA, a reflection of the ongoing buying fever. In the 4 hours chart, the technical picture is quite alike, with the RSI indicator still heading north around 87, the Momentum barely retreating within extreme overbought readings and the benchmark far above bullish moving averages. As long as optimism about upcoming policies aimed to boost growth and inflation in the US persist, equities will continue rallying, despite whatever extreme readings indicators mark. Support levels: 20,609 20,552 20,506 Resistance levels: 20,650 20,700 20,750 FTSE 100 The FTSE 100 closed at 7,302.41, up by 33 points or 0.47%, with the banking sector leading the way higher across the region. The index reached an almost one month high, further fueled by a weakening Pound. Ashtead Group was the best performer, up 3.20%, followed by Barclays that added 2.97%. Standard Chartered gained 2.66% while Royal Bank of Scotland closed 2.07% higher. The mining sector ended mixed, with BHP Billiton up 2.90%, but Antofagasta down 1.98% and Anglo American closing 1.03% lower. The index retains the bullish tone in its daily chart, holding above a flat 20 SMA and with technical indicators heading north within positive territory, still poised to retest the record high posted last January at 7,354, now the immediate resistance. In the 4 hours chart, the index is well above a bullish 20 SMA, but the Momentum indicator continues diverging lower within positive territory, whilst the RSI lost upward strength in overbought territory, none of them enough to confirm a bearish move, but acting as an immediate warning over a possible correction. Support levels: 7,296 7,254 7,208 Resistance levels: 7,354 7,390 7,425 DAX European equities closed with modest gains, with the banking sector leading the way higher following hawkish comments made by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. The German DAX added 22 points or 0.19% to close at 11,793.93, with Deutsche Bank leading gainers' list, up 2.06%. Commerzbank added 2.01%. The German benchmark advanced to a fresh 3-week high of 11,848, and despite the lack of clear momentum coming from technical readings, sentiment favors a bullish extension for the upcoming days. In the daily chart, the DAX continues developing above a horizontal 20 DMA, but far above bullish 100 and 200 DMAs. Indicators in the mentioned chart are flat, with the Momentum around 100, but the RSI at 62, supporting the bullish case. In the 4 hours chart, the 20 SMA continues advancing below the current level, with an approach to it having been quickly reverted, whilst technical indicators are aiming higher after correcting overbought conditions reached earlier this week.

Taxes are going up. And staff are terrified of Brexit. by Richard Vines @Richardvines More stories by Richard Vines February 16, 2017, 12:01 AM EST London restaurateurs are looking to the future. And many don’t like what they see. “As a restaurant operator, 2017 terrifies me,” said Russell Norman, co-owner of the Polpo, a popular mini-chain of Italian restaurants. “It really could be a perfect storm.” London’s dining scene is arguably more vibrant and successful than it’s ever been, and by one measure, at least, 2016 was a record year for openings. Many chefs think business will still improve this year, but they see strong headwinds. First there was Britain’s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, which sent chefs into a spin: Restaurant owners rely heavily on hosts, waiters, and cooks from Spain, Italy, and France, and they fear Brexit will mean restrictions on the right to work in the U.K.  When the British pound tanked after the vote, restaurants had to pay more for imported food and wine. Some wine prices have increased as much as 10 percent, Norman says, and certain staples, such as olive oil, are at their highest prices in years in the U.K. Now they will have to swallow another increase: higher property taxes, known as business rates, that kick in in April. The size of the increase varies. The bill for Café Murano in Covent Garden, for example, will jump 46 percent, to £157,000 ($196,000). In Hoxton, Merchants Tavern’s bill will advance 27 percent, to £70,000. Café Murano in Covent Garden. Photographer: John Carey/Cafe Murano Covent Garden Some restaurants will be passing costs along to diners or squeezing other expenses where they can find pennies to save, said Chris Yates, managing director of Angela Hartnett restaurants, which include Café Murano and Merchants Tavern. “Why do you think we don’t see uniforms, tablecloths, etc., in restaurants any more?” he said. Des Gunewardena, whose D&D London group owns more than 25 London bars and restaurants, said he could be facing a tough year. “The reality of the Brexit deal is going to emerge,” he said. “There is a lot of pressure of costs on all fronts. The impact of the property-rates revaluation and the increasing cost of staff are likely to have as much, if not more, impact than the rising cost of ingredients.” Gunewardena said that corporate spending still increased last year but was noticeably less than exuberant. “If people are concerned that their business may be badly affected, they are not going to throw swanky parties,” he said. Restaurant managers are most worried about their staffing, though there’s little hard evidence that they’ll have trouble hiring. While it may be too soon to tell, there are some signs: Figures released Wednesday from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of EU workers in the U.K. fell the most in five years during the final three months of 2016. Galvin at Windows, atop the London Hilton on Park Lane, employs more than 70 people as hosts, waiters, bartenders, and other front-of-house positions. Two are British. At Grain Store, in King’s Cross, it’s eight out of 70. At the Wolseley, on Piccadilly, 62 percent of employees are from Europe. “I wonder what will happen,” said Fred Sirieix, the French-born general manager of Galvin at Windows. “I still cannot find any British people. It is not a profession people think of doing. It is seen as subservient.” Jeremy King, whose Corbin & King group owns several of London’s most fashionable restaurants, including the Wolseley, the Delaunay, and Zedel, is just as worried. Leonid Shutov Photographer: Darren Gerrish/Getty Images for David Collins Studio “Brexit has had a terrible effect on the morale of our European staff,” he says. “Many have felt unwelcome in the country and have left. Let there be no misunderstanding: The absence of free movement across Europe will be a disaster for the hospitality industry.” One restaurateur who remains upbeat is Leonid Shutov. He owns the fancy Bob Bob Ricard in Soho, where diners can press a button at their table to order an emergency bottle of Champagne. He’s planning to open a 400-seat restaurant in the City financial district. How does he feel now that JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, and other banks are starting to outline plans to move staff overseas? Very relaxed, it seems. He’s not even concerned about the employment situation, though he estimates that about 80 percent of his staffers hold foreign passports. “I'm not worried,” he says. “I’m sure the U.K. and the EU will come up with a fair and equitable agreement that allows migration and is in everyone’s economic interest.” Let’s hope so.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:00 AM, February 16, 2017 TOKYO - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T> on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Fortress Investment Group LLC <FIG.N> for about $3.3 billion, looking to add investment expertise as it prepares to launch the world's largest private equity fund. The all-cash deal is SoftBank's first major investment in an asset manager and represents yet another unpredictable gambit for a group that has to date focused on telecoms and technology. It comes after founder Masayashi Son made the surprise announcement in October that SoftBank is teaming up with Saudi Arabia to set up a $100 billion technology fund. Buying private equity and alternative investment heavyweight Fortress could help SoftBank move to financing investments with private equity cash instead of debt, said Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan, a consultancy. "Son's strategy appears to be to use Fortress's know-how to move from debt financing to private equity. It's a logical progression for the company," he said. SoftBank hired one of Fortress's senior executives, Rajeev Misra, in 2014. Misra now runs the SoftBank-Saudi Arabia fund. New York-listed asset manager Fortress's investments span real estate, hedge funds and private equity. It had $70 billion in investments under management at the end of September 2016, and is one of few global foreign investors with funds that are targeted at Japanese assets. In the wake of the global financial crisis, Fortress bought bad loans in Italy and has a track record in Japan, where it bought hotels held by Lehman Brothers after the bank collapsed in 2008. "DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT" SoftBank's Son said in a statement that the deal would "accelerate our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world-class execution to drive sustainable long-term growth". SoftBank executives were not available to comment further on the deal. Though Fortress' performance in Japan may have impressed SoftBank, its broader growth has been lackluster. The first among the major U.S. alternative asset managers to go public 10 years ago, Fortress was then valued at $14 billion. Despite its diversification into a range of hedge fund strategies, from bitcoin to timber, Fortress failed to keep up with the growth in assets under management of bigger peers such as Blackstone. The companies said Fortress principals would continue to lead the investment manager, which will operate within SoftBank as an independent business, based in New York. Senior fund managers would also remain with the group, it said. Fortress shareholders will receive $8.08 per share, a premium of 38.6 percent to the closing price on Feb. 13. Fortress plans to maintain its current base dividend of 9 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, the company said in a statement.

The all-cash deal is SoftBank's first major investment in an asset manager and represents yet another unpredictable gambit for a group that has to date focused on telecoms and technology. It comes after founder Masayashi Son made the surprise announcement in October that SoftBank is teaming up with Saudi Arabia to set up a $100 billion technology fund. Buying private equity and alternative investment heavyweight Fortress could help SoftBank move to financing investments with private equity cash instead of debt, said Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan, a consultancy. "Son's strategy appears to be to use Fortress's know-how to move from debt financing to private equity. It's a logical progression for the company," he said. SoftBank hired one of Fortress's senior executives, Rajeev Misra, in 2014. Misra now runs the SoftBank-Saudi Arabia fund. New York-listed asset manager Fortress's investments span real estate, hedge funds and private equity. It had $70 billion in investments under management at the end of September 2016, and is one of few global foreign investors with funds that are targeted at Japanese assets. In the wake of the global financial crisis, Fortress bought bad loans in Italy and has a track record in Japan, where it bought hotels held by Lehman Brothers after the bank collapsed in 2008. "DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT" SoftBank's Son said in a statement that the deal would "accelerate our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world-class execution to drive sustainable long-term growth".
