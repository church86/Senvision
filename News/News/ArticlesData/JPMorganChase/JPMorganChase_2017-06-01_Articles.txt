"Following" : "Follow"}} June 01, 2017 11:57am   Comments Share: Related FN 20 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Tuesday 25 Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session The valuation of Fabrinet (NYSE: FN) led JPMorgan to add the tech manufacturer to the firm's focus list Thursday. JPMorgan has an Overweight on Fabrinet and raised their price target on the stock from $55 to $57. “We believe the recent sell-off (down 28 percent since Feb. 21 peak/S&P up 2 percent) presents an attractive GARP entry point. We are buyers here," analyst Paul Costersaid in a note. Why A Top Pick? 100G deployments in North America have been driving growth for optical components, and Chinese demand is set to pick up soon, Coster said. Fabrinet is likely to benefit from this upgrade cycle, the analyst said. Fabrinet's operating leverage should increase “as opex grows slower than revenues with management indicating capacity for improvement driven by scale and as new facilities begin to ramp," according to the JPMorgan note. Fabrinet has developed a larger footprint with their campus in Santa Clara and with Exception EMS in the UK. These locations provide “turnkey solutions and prototypes getting in early during the design cycle," Coster said. Fabrinet Chief Financial Officer Toh-Seng Ng had a positive tone at JPMorgan’s TMT conference, according to the firm's note. Fabrinet was trading up 4.6 percent late Thursday morning.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Italy leads Europe shares up after data highlights recovery Shares0 Thu, 1 Jun 2017-07:11pm , Reuters Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U. S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. European stocks rose on Thursday with Italy setting the pace after a big upward revision in first-quarter economic growth, while the dollar rose after forecast-beating U.S. private sector jobs data. Wall Street was expected to open higher, according to index futures , after the jobs numbers which are likely to feed into the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this month. The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged up 0.3 percent, led higher by industrials and consumer staples companies. Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U.S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Italy's FTSE MIB index was the top gaining national market, up 0.6 percent and fractionally outperforming France's CAC 40. Italy's national statistics bureau said strong domestic demand helped the economy grow 0.4 percent in the first quarter, twice as much as indicated by preliminary data issued last month. The euro zone economy as a whole grew 0.5 percent in the period and, in a further sign of recovery, data on Thursday showed manufacturing grew in May at its fastest rate in six years. Stronger euro zone data has helped push the euro higher against the dollar of late, contributing to the U.S. currency's worst fortnight since March 2016. However, the greenback rose 0.4 percent on Thursday, hitting session highs after data showed the private sector added 253,000 jobs in May, above economists' forecasts. The ADP data comes a day before the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report and a fortnight before the Fed is expected to raise interest rates. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday that suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.8066 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.2 percent to $1.2866 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.1209, having fallen as low as $1.1201 after the ADP data. The Japanese yen was down 0.5 percent to 111.32 per dollar. Oil prices initially rose, lifting off Wednesday's three-week lows, after data showing a big drop in U.S. crude stocks last week, but pared gains as some participants doubted output cuts by OPEC would be enough to rebalance an oversupplied market. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, was down 13 cents at $50.63 a barrel at 1243 GMT. President Donald Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on measures to fight climate change. Phillip Futures' investment analyst Jonathan Chanes said a U.S. withdrawal would signal Trump's intention to further roll back emission regulations. "That would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels," Chanes said.

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street little changed as financials drop, defensive stocks gain Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet June 1, 2017:   US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 per cent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 per cent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 per cent on the year. “All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people dont believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. “That is why youve seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks.” Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The US stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 per cent, while Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 per cent and telecoms, up 0.35 per cent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 per cent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. US crude settled down 2.7 per cent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 per cent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 per cent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 per cent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 per cent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

This Alice-in-Wonderland world of sub-zero interest rates – bonds which, if held to maturity, result in a loss for investors as bondholders effectively pay governments for the privilege of lending them money – appeared to be slowly returning to normal towards the end of last year. Yet in its latest negative yield index monitor, published last month, which tracks and analyses the international stock of sovereign bonds offering yields below zero per cent, JPMorgan notes that the share of negative-yielding debt in its benchmark index for government bonds in developed markets has been rising again over the past few months. The increase, moreover, is attributable to the renewed decline in bond yields in Europe, a region that has been enjoying surprisingly robust economic growth this year and which, under the normal circumstances, ought to be experiencing a rise in yields as economic conditions improve. However, according to JPMorgan, while the stock of negative-yielding bonds in the index for government bonds in developed markets has fallen significantly from a peak of nearly US$13 trillion in July 2016, it started rising again in March, increasing from just over US$8 trillion in February to nearly US$10 trillion by mid-April before retreating to US$9.2 trillion in early May. The main reason for the renewed increase is a reduction in perceived political risk in the euro zone following the victory of pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election last month. Since the first round of the election in late April, when it became clear that Macron was a virtual shoo-in for the presidency, the stock of negative-yielding debt in France shot up by US$60 billion, according to JPMorgan, helping drag down yields elsewhere in the euro zone, especially in Italy which, given the country’s political and banking-sector woes, would have suffered the most from a victory for the far-right in France’s election. France’s 10-year yield, which was above 1 per cent in mid-March, has sunk to 0.7 per cent (pretty much where it stood at the beginning of this year) while its two-year equivalent is once again falling deeper into negative territory, dropping to minus 0.5 per cent. What is more disturbing, however, is that even short-term borrowing costs in Italy – the next focal point of investor concern in Europe following the favourable outcome of France’s election – are back in negative territory after being positive for most of this year. It borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years According to JPMorgan, as much as US$450 billion of Italian government debt is now trading with a negative yield, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the 35 per cent or so of bonds in JPMorgan’s benchmark euro-zone government bond index currently in negative territory. That even in the euro zone – whose economy grew by a faster-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year (outpacing the US) and which is expected to expand by an even brisker 0.7 per cent in the second quarter – more than a third of government debt still trades in negative territory shows just how distorted global asset prices have become. Much, if not all, of the blame lies with central banks, especially the European Central Bank and its Japanese counterpart, whose aggressive quantitative easing programmes are keeping bond yields anchored at historically low levels despite a pick-up in growth and inflation in both regions, most noticeably in the euro zone. In last month’s global fund manager survey produced by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a record number of respondents claimed that global monetary policy had become too loose. While the ECB’s caution over withdrawing stimulus is justified, given the persistently subdued level of core inflation (which excludes volatile energy and food prices) in the euro zone, it borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years. Quite aside from the damaging effects of negative yields on the performance of long-term institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurers, sub-zero-yielding debt has allowed market sentiment to become dangerously detached from countries’ underlying fundamentals. France may have averted a full-blown crisis by electing Macron as president, but Italy may not be as fortunate when it holds a crucial parliamentary election, possibly as early as this autumn. In the coming months, negative-yielding Italian bonds may emerge as the most conspicuous case of mispricing in global markets.

US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 percent on the year. "All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don‘t believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in," said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "That is why you have seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks." Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 percent while Bank of America was down 1.9 percent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities , up 0.46 percent and telecoms , up 0.35 percent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks , down 0.4 percent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 percent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 percent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 percent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. tags #Business #markets #Wall Street Related news Business Against sale of JK House to Raymond promoters: Gautam Hari Singhania Jun 02, 2017 12:05 PM Business Expect 15% growth in June; GST will not lead to price hike: Blue Star Jun 02, 2017 12:03 PM Business FY18 exports will be better than last year: Bajaj Auto Jun 02, 2017 11:07 AM Business Bajaj Auto May sales disappoint, fall 10% to 3.14 lakh units Jun 02, 2017 10:17 AM Business FY18 looks good with complete range of products, says Atul Auto Jun 02, 2017 09:58 AM Business LIVE: At least 35 dead, 70 hurt in botched robbery at Philippines casino Jun 02, 2017 09:21 AM Business Big Deal: The investment landscape Jun 02, 2017 08:39 AM Business This day, that year: India's greatest showman takes his final bow Jun 02, 2017 08:09 AM Business Wall Street rises as data points to accelerating economy Jun 02, 2017 07:15 AM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets 100 stocks which pared debt in last year gave multibagger returns of up to 600% Market Live: Sensex, Nifty near record highs; Bharti Airtel, Hero top gainers Why this apparel stock could be a good bet in the long-term Trump withdraws US from Paris accord; says deal not tough enough on India, China see more Video of the day Short-term correction in the market likely; select pharma cos positioned to rally: Quantum Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring." Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market," according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it's obviously not translating to more sales." “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that's down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that's much faster than any rise they've likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election. When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8, Reuters reported.

In an emailed statement to CNBC, Dimon said, "I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue." He added, "But we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Win McNamee | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the Economic Club of Washington September 12, 2016 in Washington, DC. Dimon is one of the CEOs to participate in White House councils and in his statement he did not indicate if he would remain in that post. On Thursday, Disney CEO Robert Iger said he quit the business advisory council over the decision, while Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also said he'll leave his positions on presidential councils. The president said he would start talks to re-enter the agreement, but with terms that he called a more "fair" deal to his country. His comment was rebuked by several European governments. Many business leaders in the U.S. said they were disappointed by, or disagreed with, the decision, including Apple chief Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Last month, at JPMorgan's annual shareholder meeting, Dimon had urged the business community and the administration to work together to find meaningful solutions to critical issues confronting the U.S. In response to a question on Trump's tighter immigration policy, Dimon had said, "He is the president of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our plane. I would try to help any president of the United States because I am a patriot." — CNBC's Dawn Giel contributed to this report.

The twin-fuselage aircraft, the baby of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, was pulled out of its Mojave Air and Space Port hangar in California to begin fueling tests -- the first of many ground tests.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales. Marathon Petroleum approved an additional $3 billion to its shares repurchase program. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Changing the Face of Technology Through Diversity & Inclusion: A Top Priority for Organizations Working to Support Entrepreneurship LOS ANGELES, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Organizations focused on women and minority entrepreneurs gathered in Los Angeles at the La Kretz Innovation Campus to discuss strategies to increase support, access to capital, job creation and a more inclusive environment for diverse entrepreneurs in the tech industry. In partnership with The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) and sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America featured a panel of experts highlighting strategies for diverse entrepreneurs to enter the tech ecosystem, including initiatives underway through the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). Maria Contreras-Sweet, a member of President Obama’s Cabinet and the 24th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), was honored at the event for her dedication to enforcing the need for diversity in small business and helping to launch LACI’s Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. Under Contreras-Sweet’s leadership, SBA loans to women rose 42% and loans to minorities increased 36%, a momentum in critical need of being upheld. The award was presented by LACI Chief Operating Officer, Neal Anderson. Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America- Back row (L-R): Eileen Sanchez, Economic Director LA Mayor’s Office, former U.S. SBA Head of International; Jessie Draper, Founding Partner, Halogen Ventures; Daniel Tellalian, Managing Partner, Avivar Capital; Sky Kelley, Founder and CEO, Avisare, an LACI portfolio company; Neal Anderson, LACI Chief Operating Officer. Front row: Judy Hackett, SVP, Dun & Bradstreet; Connie Evans, President and CEO, Association for… The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) „There is a powerful economic opportunity to seize by taking steps to be intentionally focused on inclusive entrepreneurship,” said Connie Evans, President and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. „Our latest report, The Tapestry of Black Business Ownership in America: Untapped Opportunities for Success, points out the need to reduce barriers faced by Blacks and other diverse groups by transitioning from their concentration in low-revenue growth industry sectors to higher performing sectors, such as tech. Doing so will require greater access to capital but also greater access to training programs and the funding that makes that possible.” The program included strategies to bring a more diverse pipeline of entrepreneurs into LACI and the technology industry more broadly. A panel of experts representing financial services, entrepreneurship and investment capital shared insights to supporting these entrepreneurs. Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics.

Maria Contreras-Sweet, a member of President Obama’s Cabinet and the 24th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), was honored at the event for her dedication to enforcing the need for diversity in small business and helping to launch LACI’s Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. Under Contreras-Sweet’s leadership, SBA loans to women rose 42% and loans to minorities increased 36%, a momentum in critical need of being upheld. The award was presented by LACI Chief Operating Officer, Neal Anderson. Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America- Back row (L-R): Eileen Sanchez, Economic Director LA Mayor’s Office, former U.S. SBA Head of International; Jessie Draper, Founding Partner, Halogen Ventures; Daniel Tellalian, Managing Partner, Avivar Capital; Sky Kelley, Founder and CEO, Avisare, an LACI portfolio company; Neal Anderson, LACI Chief Operating Officer. Front row: Judy Hackett, SVP, Dun & Bradstreet; Connie Evans, President and CEO, Association for… The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) „There is a powerful economic opportunity to seize by taking steps to be intentionally focused on inclusive entrepreneurship,” said Connie Evans, President and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. „Our latest report, The Tapestry of Black Business Ownership in America: Untapped Opportunities for Success, points out the need to reduce barriers faced by Blacks and other diverse groups by transitioning from their concentration in low-revenue growth industry sectors to higher performing sectors, such as tech. Doing so will require greater access to capital but also greater access to training programs and the funding that makes that possible.” The program included strategies to bring a more diverse pipeline of entrepreneurs into LACI and the technology industry more broadly. A panel of experts representing financial services, entrepreneurship and investment capital shared insights to supporting these entrepreneurs. Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics.

PERELMAN HEART INSTITUTE LAUNCH #HandsOnlyCPR CAMPAIGN WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE: EVERYONE CAN SAVE A LIFE Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Changing the Face of Technology Through Diversity & Inclusion: A Top Priority for Organizations Working to Support Entrepreneurship LOS ANGELES, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Organizations focused on women and minority entrepreneurs gathered in Los Angeles at the La Kretz Innovation Campus to discuss strategies to increase support, access to capital, job creation and a more inclusive environment for diverse entrepreneurs in the tech industry. In partnership with The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) and sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America featured a panel of experts highlighting strategies for diverse entrepreneurs to enter the tech ecosystem, including initiatives underway through the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). Maria Contreras-Sweet, a member of President Obama’s Cabinet and the 24th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), was honored at the event for her dedication to enforcing the need for diversity in small business and helping to launch LACI’s Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. Under Contreras-Sweet’s leadership, SBA loans to women rose 42% and loans to minorities increased 36%, a momentum in critical need of being upheld. The award was presented by LACI Chief Operating Officer, Neal Anderson. Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America- Back row (L-R): Eileen Sanchez, Economic Director LA Mayor’s Office, former U.S. SBA Head of International; Jessie Draper, Founding Partner, Halogen Ventures; Daniel Tellalian, Managing Partner, Avivar Capital; Sky Kelley, Founder and CEO, Avisare, an LACI portfolio company; Neal Anderson, LACI Chief Operating Officer. Front row: Judy Hackett, SVP, Dun & Bradstreet; Connie Evans, President and CEO, Association for… The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) „There is a powerful economic opportunity to seize by taking steps to be intentionally focused on inclusive entrepreneurship,” said Connie Evans, President and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. „Our latest report, The Tapestry of Black Business Ownership in America: Untapped Opportunities for Success, points out the need to reduce barriers faced by Blacks and other diverse groups by transitioning from their concentration in low-revenue growth industry sectors to higher performing sectors, such as tech. Doing so will require greater access to capital but also greater access to training programs and the funding that makes that possible.” The program included strategies to bring a more diverse pipeline of entrepreneurs into LACI and the technology industry more broadly. A panel of experts representing financial services, entrepreneurship and investment capital shared insights to supporting these entrepreneurs. Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics.

April and May didn’t deliver Hugh Son, Laura J. Keller and Dakin Campbell, Bloomberg, Bloomberg News | June 1, 2017 | Last Updated: Jun 1 11:31 AM ET More from Bloomberg News Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo? More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Many crises could’ve erupted in the world during the second quarter, and then didn’t. That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually — it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview. “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans — typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust — declined globally by 28 percent, the data show. Equities trading — a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market — may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil — and thus trading — revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Bloomberg’s Jenny Surane contributed.

The arrangement takes effect Jan. 1, Hilton said Thursday in a statement that didn’t disclose terms. AmEx shares had struggled after the company lost out to Citigroup in a bidding war for Costco Wholesale Corp.’s card portfolio and failed to renew its partnership with JetBlue Airways Corp. in 2015. The lender also has been buffeted by intensifying competition for its wealthy clients, prompting Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault to shuffle top managers, boost spending on marketing and sweeten rewards to keep customers. Read more: Buffett says AmEx is up to the challenge from JPMorgan “This announcement is clearly positive for American Express as this breaks a string of defections,” Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst, said in a note to clients. “It also potentially signals a peak in the competitive intensity of these deals.” American Express climbed 0.7 percent to $77.46 at 11:29 a.m. in New York. The shares have gained 4.5 percent this year, compared with the 0.3 percent decline of the 65-company S&P 500 Financials Index. AmEx’s Starwood Preferred Guest card, which accounts for about 4 percent of the company’s loans and 2 percent of total spending, is at risk after Marriott International Inc.’s takeover of rival Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Marriott has a co-brand deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. credit-card lender, and Visa Inc., the world’s biggest payments network. Co-Brand Pressure The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up AmEx winning the Hilton portfolio takes some of the sting out of losing its agreement with Costco, a much bigger partnership that accounted for 20 percent of worldwide loans and 8 percent of card spending. The largest U.S. warehouse chain decided in 2015 to end its 16-year relationship with AmEx after the firms couldn’t agree on card fees. Last year, Citigroup became the exclusive credit-card issuer for the retailer. Citigroup said the terms of the Hilton deal didn’t make economic sense for a relatively small portfolio. Hilton represents about 1 percent of the bank’s $126.4 billion U.S. credit-card loans. “For over 15 years, Citi and Hilton enjoyed a terrific co-brand credit card partnership, however during negotiations it became clear that terms of exclusivity, given the relatively small size of the portfolio, were not economically viable,” Jud Linville, CEO of Citigroup’s global cards business, said in a phone interview. Citigroup intends to focus on "core" co-brand partners including Costco, American Airlines Group Inc. and AT&T Inc., he said. AmEx, Hilton Chenault said at an investor conference Thursday that the Hilton deal won’t have a material effect on earnings and probably won’t have any bearing on its chances of keeping the Starwood partnership. When Hilton opened the bidding for its co-brand portfolio a year and a half ago, it received “tremendous response” from issuers, said Mark Weinstein, global head of customer engagement, loyalty and partnerships at the hotel chain. Ultimately, it was AmEx’s focus on innovation that sold Hilton, he said, adding the hotelier has 63 million members in its Hilton Honors program. “We’re not announcing any new benefits at this time, but I think Hilton Honors members can look forward to new cardmember benefits,” said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at American Express.

But it is not often that the seller is the central bank of a brutal, cash-strapped regime faced with protests; the buyer, a bulge-bracket American investment bank; and the size of the deal in the billions of dollars. A report in the Wall Street Journal on May 28th that Goldman Sachs had bought bonds with a face value of $2.8bn issued by Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, for 31 cents on the dollar (ie, for $865m) caused a stink. Julio Borges, an opposition politician and president of the National Assembly, lambasted Goldman on May 29th in an open letter to its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, for its decision to “aid and abet Venezuela’s dictatorial regime”. For all its sins, that regime has met its obligations to bondholders. Mr Borges vowed to advise future Venezuelan governments not to repay the bonds in question. Protesters gathered outside Goldman’s headquarters in New York. The bank acknowledged buying the bonds but said it had done so from a broker, not directly from the government, and invested because it believed that life in Venezuela would get better.

Nor is Venezuela the first dictatorship to give priority to debt service over providing necessities to its people. But one factor that has changed is the role of indices in directing investment. Just days before this transaction came to light, Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan minister now at Harvard, had argued that JPMorgan Chase should exclude Venezuelan-government bonds from the emerging-market bond indices it compiles. Investors, he alleged, were profiting from the suffering of Venezuelans by buying what he called “hunger bonds”. In some indices, such as JPMorgan’s EMBI+ or Morningstar’s “emerging-markets high-yield bond” one, Venezuelan-government and PDVSA bonds represent only a small slice of the portfolio (around 5%), but are so cheap they contribute nearly a fifth of yield. Bloomberg also includes Venezuelan bonds in its indices. But JPMorgan’s is the most widely quoted, and drew Mr Hausmann’s ire. Such indices serve both as a benchmark for active managers (ie, those that seek to beat an index for their investors) and to determine the allocation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) run by such firms as BlackRock or Vanguard. America’s largest ETF for emerging-market bonds is a BlackRock one with $11.6bn under management. It tracks a different JPMorgan index but holds nearly $275m-worth of Venezuelan bonds at current market prices, and derives over 10% of its total yield from them. Goldman’s big bet has drawn a lot of attention. But indexmakers, ETF providers, asset managers and, of course, their investors have all been happy to make money out of Venezuela’s unsavoury debt.

President Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. President Donald J. Trump being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on January 20th, 2017. President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time on February 28th, 2017. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at The White House. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bank stocks surged after Donald Trump was elected on the hopes that he would scale back some of President Obama's Wall Street reforms and boost the economy with a massive stimulus package. And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton's ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn't turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley's stock is down slightly too. Citigroup's stock is actually in the black, but it's only up 2% -- less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch -- despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market's brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That's yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump's stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a "quite subdued and challenging trading environment." Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan "are reflecting reality and I don't think we're very different." He added that "we all have similar clients, if not the same clients." Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That's known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it's also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either -- or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump's stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it's now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it's not going to help Trump's friends on Wall Street.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales. Marathon Petroleum approved an additional $3 billion to its shares repurchase program. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn’t turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley’s stock is down slightly too. Citigroup’s stock is actually in the black, but it’s only up 2% — less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch — despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market’s brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That’s yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump’s stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a “quite subdued and challenging trading environment.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different.” He added that “we all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That’s known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it’s also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either — or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump’s stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it’s now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it’s not going to help Trump’s friends on Wall Street.

Barclays Plc reached a long-term target for shrinking its stake in its African unit earlier than expected as the bank boosted the size of a share sale by more than 50%. The London-based lender is selling 285.7 million shares of Barclays Africa Group, equal to a 33.7% stake, at R132 each, it said in a statement on Thursday. The bank previously planned to sell a 22% stake and said it boosted the size of the offering “due to strong investor demand.” The sale will raise about R37.7 billion ($2.9 billion) and is part of plans by chief executive officer Jes Staley, 60, to reduce the lender’s presence on the continent in favor of supporting a trimmed-down investment bank focused on London and New York. The British bank, which has had a presence on the continent for more than 100 years, first bought a controlling stake in the Johannesburg-based lender in 2005 when it was still called Absa Group. The placement accelerates Barclays’s plan to gradually sell down its stake and deconsolidate the unit from its accounts, releasing capital that can be invested elsewhere in the business. Barclays had initially paid $5.4 billion for a 60% holding. That stake increased to more than 62% in 2013 as part of a reshuffle that saw Absa take over Barclays’s operations in eight African countries. JPMorgan upgrade The Public Investment Corporation, South Africa’s largest money manager, will buy a 7% stake in Barclays Africa as part of the sale once it has obtained regulatory approvals, the Johannesburg-based lender said in an emailed statement. That will help cut the stake held by Barclays, which currently owns 50.1%, to 16.4%. The British lender’s stake will drop to 15% — reaching its target level and allowing the bank to deconsolidate the unit from its capital calculations — after the completion of a transaction aimed at boosting the participation of black investors in Barclays Africa, it said. Barclays shares jumped 2% to 214.1 pence at 8:16am in London. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Raul Sinha upgraded their rating on Barclays shares to overweight following the larger sale, saying it narrowed the firm’s gap to peers on capital ratios and could provide the ability to boost dividends. The securities are being sold at an almost 10% discount to Barclays Africa’s closing price on Tuesday. Barclays Africa rose 2.4% to R142.32 in Johannesburg after tumbling 4.8% on Wednesday. Second sale The second sale follows the disposal of a 12.2% stake to fund managers in South Africa and abroad in May 2016. The latest phase was said to have been delayed after South African President Jacob Zuma fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan at the end of March, replacing him with Malusi Gigaba. Gordhan had given provisional approval to a separation agreement that involves the UK lender paying its subsidiary 765 million pounds ($987 million). Deconsolidating Barclays Africa and including the proceeds from the sale will boost Barclays’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, the key measure of capital strength, by at least 0.73 percentage point, the lender said. The share placement is being coordinated by Barclays itself, aided by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS Group, according to the statement. Barclays can’t sell any more Barclays Africa stock for 90 days after the latest placement is settled, a provision known as a lock-up restriction.

Darren Boey Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Photo: Bloomberg Hong Kong: Morgan Stanley chief executive officer James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines as competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., which said second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10%. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and US President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Passive investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business. The results marked the fourth straight quarter Morgan Stanley posted bond-trading revenue exceeding $1 billion after Gorman said the business could produce at least $4 billion annually. The fixed-income division—crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve company-wide returns—was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25% of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually -- it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” ‘Idiosyncratic Events’ At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Read more: Stress-free markets in calmest run since 2014 Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview.  “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. Underwriting Down In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans -- typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust -- declined globally by 28 percent, the data show.

Sign Up Equities trading -- a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market -- may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. Read more: Banks’ bond-trading boom to end, JPMorgan says JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil -- and thus trading -- revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Even the names of nearby boat basins were reminders of Britain’s lost empire and postwar decline: the West and East India docks. George Iacobescu arrived in 1988, sent to oversee what at the time seemed like a bold, verging-on-insane idea: the creation of a financial district that would supplant the winding lanes and low-slung stone of the City, London’s traditional banking hub. Maintaining the City’s historical character and its views of St. Paul’s Cathedral made building skyscrapers there all but impossible then. Canary Wharf, as the development would be called, would offer bright, modern office towers and cutting-edge telecommunications, allowing London to compete with New York as a center of global finance. For the first few years, Canary Wharf looked like a colossal failure. Then, in the late 1990s, it began taking off, slowly at first and soon with dizzying speed—transformed, like London as a whole, by the power of international finance. On the 30th floor of its tallest skyscraper, Romanian-born Iacobescu, now the chief executive officer of Canary Wharf Group Plc, beams with pride as he surveys his domain, where 100,000 workers arrive every weekday at Chevron, HSBC, Intel, and JPMorgan Chase, among others. In an adjacent room, a forest of architectural models the size of small children shows its 16 million square feet of towers, malls, and underground rail links. Iacobescu gravitates to one in particular, illustrating the plans for a new district under construction east of the original site. Canary Wharf has changed so much that now people want to live there, and its tallest building will be residential. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work,’ ” Iacobescu boasts. “The world wants to come here.” Perhaps, though, not as much as it did a little more than a year ago. The city that breathed life into Canary Wharf faces a fight for its future. Last June pollsters and investors confidently ruled out the possibility that British voters would decide to leave the European Union. The morning after 52 percent of them rebuked everything Canary Wharf stands for by voting to leave, the pound plunged to its lowest level in 30 years. By 9 a.m., Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his resignation. Within weeks, banks such as Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan were weighing how many staff they would have to relocate to Frankfurt or Dublin, threatening the engine of London’s $490 billion economy. Airlines slashed flights, universities reported plunging European applications, and—truly shocking—house prices slid. Its economic foundations under assault, the idea that London could ever, as then-Mayor Boris Johnson suggested in 2012, be the “capital of the world” sounded suddenly like a bad joke. At the rate things were going, the city would be lucky to even stay the capital of the United Kingdom if the Scots made good on renewed threats to secede. And that was before a pair of recent terror attacks—a March vehicle assault on Westminster Bridge and a suicide bomb on May 22 at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people—gave London another reason to be on edge. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work’ ” But while the ubiquity of the “Keep Calm and Carry On” mantra may have diluted the brand a little, that’s exactly what London is doing. A loose grouping of London business and political leaders has coalesced to make the case that with the right mix of policies, the city’s economy can thrive despite Brexit. Earlier this year, TheCityUK, the main lobbying group for the all-important financial industry, called leaving the EU “a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reorient trade and investment links to new markets. Mayor Sadiq Khan is using the tumult to try to wrest more autonomy over transport, infrastructure, and perhaps even immigration. And the booming tech sector is pushing to turn the crisis into an opportunity to overhaul regulations to make the U.K. the preferred jurisdiction for testing uncharted inventions. Those plans are taking shape in an environment of continued political turbulence. Cameron’s Conservative Party successor, Theresa May, is fighting an unexpectedly fierce battle in the June 8 general election against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. After a series of missteps by May and her advisers—including a perceived U-turn on a key plank of her party’s manifesto on social care—her once seemingly unassailable lead is under threat as voters fret about her ability to deliver a “strong and stable” Britain. M by Montcalm, a hotel near the Silicon Roundabout. Photographer: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Getty Images May is still expected to win a majority of seats, and whatever the U.K.’s immediate political future, economic apocalypse is nowhere in sight. More skyscrapers are under construction than ever, and residential asking prices have hit a record. Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google have announced major expansions of their London footprints since last summer, the latter becoming a principal tenant in a massive redevelopment of the once slightly seedy King’s Cross neighborhood. Next year the ribbon will be cut on the Elizabeth Line, or Crossrail, a 13-mile, ultrahigh-capacity express subway linking Heathrow to the heart of the city and beyond. The airport itself is midway through an ambitious expansion, with shiny new terminals largely complete and a long-contested third runway finally moving forward. Indeed, what some supporters of the “Remain” camp warned of seems to be coming to pass: The places likeliest to suffer badly from Brexit are the U.K.’s troubled industrial heartlands, regions that overwhelmingly supported leaving but have far less ability to adapt to its effects than the dynamic capital. London “has a global and particularly European competitive advantage that has been built over decades,” says John McFarlane, the chairman of banking group Barclays Plc. “It cannot be replicated easily in other centers.” It’s impossible to overstate the intensity of the U.K.’s ties with the rest of Europe, and those pulling for London still have deep concerns about what’s to come. Nonetheless, as Iacobescu’s experience at Canary Wharf shows, the global metropolis that’s contemporary London didn’t just spring fully formed from the damp Thames clay. It had to be made, by people, capital, and policies. That means it can be remade, too. By the turn of the 21st century, London was the economic center of Europe. Ambitious Scandinavian bankers, German architects, and Italian lawyers arrived in droves, able to move to the U.K. without so much as filling out a form, thanks to the EU’s free-movement rules. At one point, Mayor Johnson claimed there were a quarter-million French citizens in the capital, more than in the city of Bordeaux. It’s not exactly verifiable, but the fact that many Europeans accepted it as received wisdom served as further evidence of London’s dominance. At the same time, the city prospered from the expansion of emerging markets. It was where the multiplying elites from Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and elsewhere came to spend their money, educate their children, start fashion lines, and occasionally race their custom Lamborghinis through the streets of Knightsbridge. As its internationalization intensified, the city came increasingly unmoored from the country as a whole, as if it had achieved escape velocity from the very idea of national borders. Many businesspeople use the U.K. “as a place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in,” says John Browne, former CEO of BP Plc, who now leads a Russian-backed global investment fund from offices in—where else?—London. The city’s success had many ingredients. The English language helped, as did a legal system of impartial courts and enforceable contracts, elite universities, and a tolerant attitude toward foreigners that dates back centuries. (It was London that gave Karl Marx a place from which to unpack capitalism’s evils after Germany, Belgium, and France expelled him.) Less talked about, but essential, is a degree of semi-deliberate government indifference to the precise sources of money flowing in from Moscow, the Middle East, and elsewhere—a stance unimaginable in the more prosecutorial U.S. That’s made investing in London far more attractive to emerging-country oligarchs eager to avoid taking chances with the IRS and U.S. Department of Justice. Despite London’s global appeal, the U.K.’s European status also has offered huge advantages. The EU is the destination for almost half of U.K. exports and the source of the same proportion of foreign direct investment. EU law allows a bank established in any member state to operate freely in any of the others, an advantage that U.S. and Asian lenders used to locate their European headquarters overwhelmingly in the U.K. Despite being outside the euro zone, the City came to dominate the market for euro-denominated derivatives, worth hundreds of billions of dollars daily, and to rival New York as the heart of investment banking and trading of all kinds. Just a mile up the road, a tech sector clustered around the ugly junction half-jokingly called Silicon Roundabout thrived as well, sustained by City investment and workers from throughout Europe and beyond. The victory of the nationalist Brexit campaign seemed to put all this at risk. How great a risk is hard to say. Some financial jobs will almost certainly have to relocate to meet EU regulatory requirements, depending on the shape of a final settlement with Brussels, and banks are making contingency plans. Estimates range from as few as 4,000 or so, according to management consultant Oliver Wyman, to a worst-case scenario of 232,000 detailed by Xavier Rolet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, in January to a parliamentary committee. In other words, no one has a clue. “A place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in” How can London be saved from the worst predictions? As it happens, in addition to the Little England fantasies of cream teas and village cricket with which the “Leave” vote was often associated, there was always a liberal vision for Brexit, espoused by Johnson and others. The plan was a form of doubling down. Broadly, it entailed making the post-EU U.K. a sort of giant, cold Singapore—rabidly pro-capital, lightly taxed, and hospitable to innovation. The Brexit twist: a focus on connecting tightly to emerging markets. Within the EU, the U.K. benefited from the bloc’s network of trade agreements but was prohibited from negotiating any on its own. Now, the slightly wishful theory goes, it can do so with enthusiasm and speed—while winning a post-Brexit deal that preserves access to the EU’s huge economy. May began earlier this year to at least pay lip service to this notion of “Global Britain” and got away with it, despite the apparent desire of half the country’s citizens for exactly the opposite, in part by stoking a bit of indirect nostalgia for the bygone age of empire. Speaking in January to top-tier investors and CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she pledged to make the U.K. “the strongest and most forceful advocate for business, free markets, and free trade anywhere in the world.” If May follows through, implementing that vision shouldn’t, theoretically, be too difficult. The U.K. has a highly centralized system of government in which American-style gridlock is a virtual impossibility. Within reason, what the prime minister wants, she gets. Her government has already hinted that if it receives an unfavorable deal in negotiations with Brussels, it could retaliate by slashing its corporate tax rate—which at 19 percent is already far lower than those of the U.S., France, and Germany—to poach companies from neighboring countries. The U.K. has a track record of this sort of thing. Fiat Chrysler, Liberty Global, Aon, and other businesses, attracted by low taxes, have relocated operations to London in recent years. City Hall, the “glass gonad.” Photographer: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock One of the architects of London’s emergence as a financial capital is among those urging May to make some version of Global Britain a reality. Lord Nigel Lawson of Blaby, now 85 and ensconced in the oak-paneled sanctum of the House of Lords, oversaw the “Big Bang”—the U.K.’s sudden move to deregulate financial services—as chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher. He figured that a gradual removal of rules that benefited incumbents would foment too much opposition, so the decision was made to implement the changes on a single day in October 1986. It opened up the London Stock Exchange, previously run something like a not-very-lively gentlemen’s club, to a rush of overseas capital and brainpower. Sitting in an overstuffed red leather chair in one of the Palace of Westminster’s ubiquitous private bars, morning sun streaming in from the Thames through tall, neo-Gothic windows, Lawson advocates a similarly aggressive approach for prospering from Brexit. He rejects the charge that he’s anti-European; after all, he says, he lives most of the time at his country estate in southwest France, flying in to Heathrow for Lords debates. “London’s success owes nothing whatever to being in the European Union,” Lawson says, as if it should be obvious, but rather to “this huge collection of expertise” in finance and related industries that he argues will never pick up and go. The picture he paints of post-Brexit Britain is of a nation shorn of unhelpful multilateral entanglements, with “complete autonomy over our tax system,” which “should be, en principe, a low-tax system.” He speaks optimistically of restructuring immigration to remove the current distinction whereby bricklayers from Slovenia face no visa restrictions, yet American Ph.D.s must fill out miles of forms and cross their fingers—treating “citizens from anywhere in the world on an equal basis.” And proving the notion that to scratch a Brexiteer is to quickly uncover fond memories of the last time there was such a thing as Global Britain, Lawson says that as Europe’s economy stagnates, “it’s the emerging world which is really going places. And a large part of the emerging world is the former empire”—India, Nigeria, Malaysia, and so on, with which Britain still enjoys close cultural and political ties. Indeed, there’s an argument to be made that the emerging economies need London as a stable venue for making deals and protecting assets. For its part, TheCityUK has suggested reimagining trade deals to focus on the sale of services, which the U.K. exports in spades, rather than just goods, which are less important to its economy. Another possibility being floated in the City: scrapping or loosening the EU-imposed cap on bonuses for bankers. Limiting windfalls to twice a person’s fixed pay, the gap is understandably unpopular there. The tech industry has also been active. In December a collection of local players, including Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom and Sonali De Rycker of venture capital company Accel, wrote an open letter to May calling on her to preserve maximum access to the EU’s “single market” and to provide automatic visas for tech graduates as part of a post-Brexit immigration strategy. The group had other, more unusual suggestions. The most eye-catching was that the U.K. should engage in “regulatory arbitrage” for technologies such as drones and blockchain. In the words of Mattias Ljungman of venture firm Atomico, which he co-founded with Zennstrom, the country could use its nimble system of government to become a “neutral zone” for testing ideas that other places restrict. There are some indications this is already happening. The U.K.’s main financial watchdog has created a “regulatory sandbox” that allows fintech firms to do real-world tests of products that normal rules might not allow. And Amazon is conducting trials of its delivery-by-drone program near Cambridge after complaining the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration wasn’t moving fast enough to change American flight rules. The task of marshaling these forces has fallen to Mayor Khan. The 46-year-old’s biography couldn’t be further from the usual Eton-and-Oxbridge CV of British politics. His parents were immigrants from Pakistan who raised Khan and his seven siblings in public housing. After university he became a lawyer, working on racial discrimination and police brutality cases, before entering Parliament in 2005. Last year he became the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. Khan is often discussed as a future prime minister, and his political standing is in direct contrast to his physical presence. He’s quite short, and the navy blue suits he wears—always without a tie—as an unvarying uniform can look at least half a size too big. At one recent event, a photo op with high school students who towered over him, Khan’s dark-brown leather belt was cinched to the sixth notch. The mayor’s first year at City Hall, a riverside orb that Johnson dubbed “the glass gonad,” has been consumed by the fallout of the referendum. Like a lawyer making arguments before an all-powerful judge, he’s relentlessly made the case to business leaders not to give up on London and sought to counter the Britain-first message of Brexit with a nonstop calendar of speeches, international trade missions, and slickly produced ads showing off the city’s diversity. There’s substance behind the marketing blitz. To protect London’s appeal, Khan is pursuing even more heavy-duty infrastructure, including Crossrail 2, another massive rail line through the heart of the city. He’s also suggested the creation of a “London visa,” whereby a foreigner with a job offer from a local company could be given permission to live and work in the capital and not elsewhere. That’s not as crazy as it sounds. Canada and Australia have regional visa policies for some migrants. And it’s hard to argue with the idea’s inherent logic. Unlike much of the rest of the country, diverse London has no problem with newcomers. What these prescriptions for a vibrant metropolis all share is a focus on talent, a conviction that London can’t hope to succeed without brainy immigrants. Politically, that happens to be the most difficult item on the wish list to deliver. The Brexit vote was widely interpreted by politicians as a backlash against immigration, and May has said repeatedly that gaining control of the borders—i.e., ending freedom of movement for European citizens—is a nonnegotiable red line for her government in talks with its European counterparts. What will replace the open-door policy is anyone’s guess. So, too, is the evolution of the current, less permissive system for non-EU workers. While May in January said that “openness to international talent must remain one of this country’s most distinctive assets,” she’s not a likely candidate to champion a relaxed approach. In her previous role as home secretary, she was the public face of a pledge, never fulfilled but recently reiterated as Conservative policy, to reduce annual inflows to the “tens of thousands.” Despite pleas from business groups and members of her own party, she’s also refused to formally guarantee that EU citizens already in the U.K., who number in the millions, will be able to stay—even though no one realistically expects any other outcome. “If you really want to understand what’s behind the success of London, it’s that the city is a powerful magnet for international talent. It’s all based on people,” says Gregor Irwin, the chief economist at political consultant Global Counsel. Politicians who want to preserve that will have to contend, he says, “with a prime minister who’s still hellbent on bringing down the overall numbers.” Free trade and a permissive attitude to technological disruption weren’t what, say, underemployed pipe fitters in Stoke-on-Trent had in mind when they voted for Brexit. Telling them the country must continue to prioritize the interests of footloose international capital to prosper is a lot to ask of May, who leans more populist than many Conservatives. Perhaps more daunting, a swashbuckling, neo-Elizabethan vision of a Britain dedicated to conquering new markets ignores that U.K. companies have prioritized the giant bloc on their doorstep for decades. As an alternative, reorienting the economy toward emerging markets would mean “a quantum shift in terms of our trade strategy,” says Martin Sorrell, CEO of London-based advertising giant WPP Plc. If the U.K. loses its links to the EU and fails to develop ones with other regions, the risk is that “we become an isolated island instead of a connected one,” he says. As London’s business elites weigh how to sell politicians on their vision, what they view as sensible economic policy can feel hard to reconcile with the demands of an angry populace. On a chilly early March evening, a crowd of bankers, corporate executives, and diplomats filed past a military string ensemble in formal red uniforms as a crier in an elaborate sash shouted entering guests’ names. The occasion was the annual Business and Investment Dinner at Mansion House, the City’s ceremonial heart—a Palladian pile that since the 1700s has been where deals are struck, successes are celebrated, and postprandial port is passed to the diner on one’s left. “The pound is down,” began the grace as guests sat down to smoked-and-peppered mackerel terrine. But “stocks are up, so let us be thankful as we sup.” As dinner moved on past the roast rib-eye served with mushroom panna cotta and a full-bodied 2001 Pessac-Léognan, Lord Mayor Andrew Parmley, the City’s official leader, rose to address the subject on everyone’s mind. Next to him was Business Secretary Greg Clark, a member of May’s cabinet responsible for economic policy, representing the national government. “Free trade, ambition, openness to new ideas, techniques, and talent,” Parmley recited, glancing occasionally at his neighbor. “They can power the future success of what is, what has always been, and indeed in my opinion always will be, the world’s greatest city.” It was meant as a confident affirmation of the obvious. Instead, it sounded a little like a plea. Canary Wharf. Photographer: Incamerastock/Alamy Stock Photo At Canary Wharf, Iacobescu talks up London’s advantages with the zeal of a convert, which he is—before he arrived, he lived in Toronto and then New York, helping build the World Financial Center. “Why are all the institutions here?” he asks. “Because of the language, because of the regulatory regime, because of the time zone, because of the infrastructure, because of the know-how. All these things haven’t disappeared.” Banks and companies that depend on them, he says, have no intention of abandoning a city that helped make them rich. Yet even the optimism of a man whose job it is to sell London to the world has its limits. As Iacobescu circumnavigates his largest architectural model of the district, reciting from memory the addresses of companies such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and American Express, one tower makes him wince slightly: the European Medicines Agency, the EU equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a major Canary Wharf tenant. Like every other EU institution with a U.K. presence, it will almost surely soon depart, perhaps for Milan, perhaps Copenhagen. It’s a small example of an important reality: If London is no longer the “gateway to Europe,” he says, losing growth to Frankfurt, Paris, or New York is inevitable. While Iacobescu believes in London as much as anyone, he concedes that without enlightened leadership, its strengths may not be enough to overcome harsh political reality. “London is a great city,” he says. “But the effort should be to keep it the capital of the world.” —With Stephen Morris   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Hugh SonDakin Campbell Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income. Photo: Bloomberg New York: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America, the two biggest US banks, said June-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10% because tranquil markets are curbing demand. Bank shares slid after the revenue updates and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower. Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. A top Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive agreed that clients’ trading remains “subdued,” while, on Thursday in Beijing, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing a similar trend. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” In rates trading, clients are cautious because of conflicting signs from unemployment and inflation data, Lake said. In corporate bonds, “people have cash but no conviction” as spreads are tight, she said. Equities, corporate derivatives and the prime brokerage were sources of strength in the quarter, she said. “Client activities, which were more subdued in the first (March) quarter, have in these first two months, continued in a comparable fashion in the second (June) quarter,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs’s co-president, said at the same conference, declining to project the impact on the firm’s revenue. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 3.3% to a six-month low of $211.26 in New York on Wednesday, while JPMorgan slid 2.1% to $82.15. The pair were the day’s worst performers in the Dow. Bank of America, which isn’t in the index, dropped 2.2% to $22.41. At JPMorgan, the last three quarters of 2016 generated record trading revenue, so the comparisons this year are harder for traders to live up to, Lake said. “If I look to June, I don’t see any particular reason for that to change,” Lake said. “But anything can happen in a month.” Speaking to Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday, Morgan Stanley’s Gorman said the estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America reflect the reality in the present trading environment. “I don’t think we’re very different,” he said. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and US tax reform have led corporate executives to be cautious, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals, and said the environment has felt a little better in the past month or two than it did earlier in the year. Separately, analysts also asked about expense discipline. Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Marty Chavez, speaking at the same event as Solomon, told investors that when the firm’s revenue does climb, compensation will rise at a slower rate. Bank of America will take a charge of about $300 million to speed up data-center consolidation, and will report $125 million in severance, about double what’s typical, Moynihan said. The expenses are part of the firm’s goal of cutting total annual costs to $53 billion by the end of 2018. “We’re trying to accelerate opportunities, and so this quarter we’ll do a couple things to push some stuff through and really position us to make that $53 billion without a problem,” he said.

Kshitij Anand Moneycontrol News The Nifty is likely to open flat on Thursday, tracking muted handover from Wall Street. The index closed flat, but with a negative bias at 9,621 on Wednesday. But during the session, it hit a fresh record high of 9,649.60. The index failed to sustain at a higher level and pared most of its intraday gains to close in negative which made a small bearish candle on the daily candlestick charts, after rallying for four straight sessions. If the index manages to defend 9,600 this week, bullish momentum remains intact, but a close below this level could fuel further profit booking decline. Traders are advised to lighten up long positions if Nifty slips below 9,580-9,600, suggest experts. Stay tuned with Moneycontrol to find out what happens in currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines from across news agencies. GDP expands at 7.1% in FY17 The Indian economy grew at 7.1 percent in 2016-17, the government said in new estimates on Wednesday, identical to the expansion projected in February, but slower than the previous year’s 8 percent growth. A 6.1 percent growth in January-March quarter, however, indicated that the economy is still smarting under the demonetisation shock that the sudden flush out of high-value notes and restricted cash access had caused on household spending and corporate investment. SGX Nifty The Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 8 points lower at 9,629 indicating a flat opening for the domestic market. Wall Street ends flat US stocks closed flat as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year, said a Reuters report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Petrol price hiked by Rs 1.23/litre, diesel by 89 paise Petrol price was today hiked by Rs 1.23 per litre and diesel by 89 paise a litre in sync with rising international fuel rates. Petrol price in Delhi will cost Rs 66.91 per litre as against Rs 65.32 a litre. Similarly, a litre of diesel will be priced at Rs 5.94, as compared to Rs 54.90 at present. Delhi Assembly passes state GST bill The Delhi Assembly today passed the state Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pitched for capping the tax rate at a maximum of 10 percent, said a report. A special session of the Assembly, which saw clashes between a few AAP MLAs and sacked minister Kapil Mishra, cleared the bill following an extensive discussion while also adopting a resolution on lowering tax slabs. Government meets 3.5% fiscal deficit target in 2016-17 The government on Wednesday said it has achieved the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2016-17. For 2017-18, the government aims to further bring down the fiscal deficit gap between expenditure and revenue up to 3.2 percent, said a report. "Fiscal deficit is 3.51 percent of GDP or Rs 5.35 lakh crore in 2016-17," the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) said while releasing the provisional accounts for the last financial year. Dollar wobbles on U.S. political tension The dollar slid to two-week lows against the yen and a more than one-week trough versus the euro amid growing political tension in Washington said a report. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar ended the month with its largest monthly percentage loss since January. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 110.67 yen after earlier falling to two-week lows. The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.1236, while the dollar index fell 0.3 percent to 96.99. India, Spain sign 7 agreements India and Spain on Wednesday decided to widen defence partnership, conclude a civil nuclear deal and share best practices to jointly fight terror, said a report. PM Modi and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy held talks to strengthen strategic partnership amid signing of seven agreements, including on cyber security and transfer of sentenced persons. Rupee logs 1st gain in 3 days The rupee endured a sharp reversal in fortunes against a resurgent US dollar after a two-day fall and recovered by 15 paise to end at 64.51 on fresh selling of the American currency by banks and exporters. 3 stocks under ban period on NSE Security in ban period for the next trade date under the F&O segment include companies in which the security has crossed 95% of the market-wide position limit.Securities which are banned for trading today include names like JP Associates, Reliance Communications, and Reliance Capital. tags #Market Cues #Nifty #Sensex Related news Business Market Live: Sensex, Nifty near record highs; Bharti Airtel, Hero top gainers Jun 02, 2017 09:15 AM Business See Nifty gain 37 points at opening: Maximus Securities Jun 02, 2017 08:59 AM Business Nifty to open on positive note led by strong global cues: ICICIdirect Jun 02, 2017 08:49 AM Business Buy, Sell, Hold: 3 stocks and 1 sector are on analysts’ radar today Jun 02, 2017 08:49 AM Business Nifty to open gap up by 43 points at 9674: Dynamic Levels Jun 02, 2017 08:44 AM Business Ganeshaspeaks: Nifty prediction for June 2 Jun 02, 2017 08:38 AM Business Strong support for Nifty at 9540-9580: Prakash Gaba Jun 02, 2017 08:11 AM Business Resistance for Nifty at 9660-9713; L&amp;T, Bosch bullish plays: Prakash Gaba Jun 02, 2017 08:11 AM Business F&amp;O cues: Nifty 9600 Put adds 3.6 lakh shares in Open Interest Jun 02, 2017 07:57 AM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets 100 stocks which pared debt in last year gave multibagger returns of up to 600% Market Live: Sensex, Nifty near record highs; Bharti Airtel, Hero top gainers Why this apparel stock could be a good bet in the long-term Trump withdraws US from Paris accord; says deal not tough enough on India, China see more Video of the day Short-term correction in the market likely; select pharma cos positioned to rally: Quantum Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, though first-half results should be stronger, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Read more about Lake and Moynihan’s comments. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The U.K.’s exit from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fueling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Morgan Stanley's Gorman Says Growth in India Is Exciting Passive Investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” The most important market news of the day.

Sign Up In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business.

The fixed-income division -- crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve companywide returns -- was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25 percent of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 10:46 AM Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision Musk said that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord. — Reuters Tesla Inc chief executive officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after US President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from US allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc chief executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with US$5.4tril (RM23.1tril) under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the US from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realise that this was not really about climate, this was about US money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem."

David Shepardson Elon Musk says climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru/Washington/New York: Tesla Inc chief executive officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after US President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from US allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump’s manufacturing jobs council. Musk said on Wednesday that he had done “all I can” to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a US exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that “as a matter of principle, I’ve resigned from the President’s Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal.” He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Also Read: Donald Trump dumps Paris climate deal arguing pact benefits India, China Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc chief executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump’s CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. “I accepted the invitation to serve on the President’s CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors,” Fink said in a statement. “I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world,” said Fink, whose company is the world’s largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. “I do not agree with all of the president’s policies and decisions, including today’s announcement to exit the US from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change.” Asked about Musk’s resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that “anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about US money going to other countries and it didn’t solve the climate problem.” Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans.

The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it “will not waver from our commitment to the environment.” It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co’s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump’s panel.

PHOTO: REUTERS [WASHINGTON] Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after US President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Mr Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from US allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Mr Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Mr Trump's manufacturing jobs council. sentifi.com Market voices on: Mr Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Mr Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Mr Trump announced a US exit from the accord. SEE ALSO: Trump asks Supreme Court to reinstate Muslim travel ban Mr Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal". He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies. Mr Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Mr Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. "I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Mr Fink said in a statement. "I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Mr Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with US$5.4 trillion under management. "I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the US from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change." Asked about Mr Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about US money going to other countries and it didn't solve the climate problem." Mr Musk has met with Mr Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said chief executive officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues". In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment". It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Mr Trump's panel. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No 2 US automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities".

And a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the so-called gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job. This volatility helps unravel a persistent puzzle: why a below-average jobless rate — 4.4 percent in April — is still producing an above-average level of economic anxiety. Turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime. Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter “Since the 1970s, steady work that pays a predictable and living wage has become increasingly difficult to find,” said Jonathan Morduch, a director of the U.S. Financial Diaries project, an in-depth study of 235 low- and moderate-income households. “This shift has left many more families vulnerable to income volatility.” Ever-changing schedules at Victoria’s Secret, for example, make it difficult for Ms. Casares, 27, to find care for her 2-year-old and 6-year-old and to cover the bills. “The lowest hours I’ve gotten is 15 and the highest I’ve gotten is 39,” said Ms. Casares, who started in October, earning $10 an hour. The schedule is usually posted a month in advance, she said, but there are frequently last-minute changes. Stability is worth a lot to workers. On average, employees are willing to give up a fifth of their weekly wage to avoid a schedule set by an employer on a week’s notice, according to a field experiment where workers were offered a range of alternative hours at different pay levels. “That is totally the story,” said Mr. Morduch, who watched household incomes in his study rise and fall. “And that instability and insecurity are increasingly a part of middle-class life, too.” In the course of a year, for example, the monthly income of a California family with one child that Mr. Morduch’s team tracked jumped to $5,279 from as low as $1,175. (Strict ethics protocols prohibit the release of participants’ names.) The husband supplemented his steady $400-a-week salaried construction job with extra remodeling work that could add from $323 to $1,588 a month to his total. His wife picked up from zero to $1,824 a month from babysitting, and from selling jewelry, clothing and flowers. Monthly expenses can pendulum as much as income, but the two do not necessarily move in tandem. An analysis of 250,000 bank accounts by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the bank, found that roughly 80 percent of households had an insufficient cash buffer to manage the mismatch between income and expenses in a given month. Few people can comfortably ride out the inevitable financial bronco ride. “Only households that earn $105,000 or more a year are secure against the volatility they are exposed to,” said Diana Farrell, the institute’s president and chief executive. “It’s not just about the unemployed or the poor.” Middle-income households, for example, saw their monthly expenses deviate by nearly $1,300, the equivalent of a month’s rent or mortgage payment. And one uh-oh expense — usually in the form of a medical, tax or car repair bill — can wreck a family’s balance sheet for a year or more. Even a single month’s volatility can have a cascading effect. One month, a family copes by using the money earmarked for, say, the utility bill to cover the cost of replacing a busted water heater. The next month, it’s the telephone company that goes unpaid as the family struggles to make up the missed utility bill plus late fees and interest — and so on. Emergencies are not the only source of expense spikes. So are bridal showers, Christmas gifts and outgrown winter coats.© Mark Lyons for The New York Times Tomika Waggoner, a nursing home aide, in Newport, Ky. Her work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her son. May turned out to be an expensive month for Tomika Waggoner, 44, a nursing home aide in Newport, Ky. Her daughter was graduating from high school, and she needed a few hundred dollars to pay for her cap and gown, commencement fees, a prom ticket and a dress. Ms. Waggoner’s work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her 15-year-old son, who has epilepsy. So sometimes she works a weekend at $17 an hour and sometimes three $15-an-hour weekdays. For the Waggoner family, and many others with low and moderate incomes, a tax refund offered a once-a-year lifeline. That $700 check and a contribution from her mother covered most of the graduation costs and helped pay off the debt on some furniture. (Doctor’s visits and medical payments are frequently scheduled to coincide with tax refunds, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute.) “I also went to a couple of food pantries,” Ms. Waggoner added. “We ate a lot of bologna.” Rather than causing jolts in income, the gig economy is, for many people, what smooths them out. Only about 0.5 percent of the labor force is working in the gig economy. And while bonuses, extra commissions and overtime bump up a worker’s average income, unwelcome reductions in hours, particularly at the lower end of the income ladder, more often shrink an expected paycheck. “Stable, predictable work schedules are essential to economic security,” said Susan J. Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago who is studying new data supplied by the General Social Survey, a respected national survey that began asking in-depth questions about work schedules only last year. The latest data shows that 41 percent of all hourly workers say they are not given more than a week’s notice of their schedule; nearly half have little or no say on their work hours. “It’s not just service, or female-dominated jobs, but some of the most challenging schedules are production and construction jobs,” Ms. Lambert said. The ubiquity of the phenomenon has frequently been masked by annual measures of income and spending or one-time snapshots of savings and debt that fail to capture fluctuations week to week or month to month. Ms. Casares said that when she had to turn down an inconvenient shift at Victoria’s Secret, like staying until midnight to close, her schedule the following week would suffer. “I would be facing fewer hours,” she said. To supplement the light weeks, Ms. Casares started picking up a shift as a part-time server at Olive Garden ($5.39 an hour plus tips). The number of Americans living comfortably or doing all right financially has grown since the recession. Still, the new Fed report found that 30 percent — roughly 73 million adults — say they are finding it difficult to get by financially, or are just getting by. To Mr. Morduch and his co-author, Rachel Schneider, the rise in income volatility is an indication of how businesses in an era of advancing technology and global competition have shifted risk onto employees. Consider the cost of saving for retirement and medical care. When health insurance premiums for employers soared between 2003 and 2013 (before the Affordable Care Act went into effect), workers picked up 93 percent of the extra cost. Asked whether her job at Victoria’s Secret provided benefits, Ms. Casares said it did: “We’re given three bras and a bottle of Bombshell, their No. 1 selling perfume.” Health or retirement contributions are not part of the package.

Just after noon, a man in a cowboy hat and sunglasses entered a J.P. Morgan Chase Bank at 1405 South Voss, where he approached a teller and whipped out a pistol before displaying a device with lights and wires that he claimed was a bomb.  The would-be robber threatened to detonate the device if tellers did not immediately hand over cash.  The FBI and Crime Stoppers are searching for a suspect who robbed the Prosperity Bank at 9155 W. Sam Houston Parkway on Tuesday, May 16, 2017. Media: Houston Chronicle But as it happened, the teller draws were empty so the aspiring bandit left without any loot, the FBI said in a press release.  Investigators believe the so-called bomb was a hoax, and no one was hurt in the heist.  The robber was last scene fleeing the scene in a gray 2007 Ford Mustang with a paper plate on the back and a hard plate on the front. He's described as a 6-foot white man in his mid-50s with a thin build. He may have a tattoo on his right forearm.  Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.

Thanks for reading and your comments.        Have a great and relaxing weekend and see you all again Monday morning from 9. 4:25pm Shares bounced solidly higher on Friday, with strong performances across most sectors helping the index recoup losses made earlier in the week. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 opened very strongly on Friday, after a strong Wall Street session and rising iron ore futures. It closed up 0.9 per cent at 5788.1, a narrow 0.6 per cent gain for the week. It's the second weekly gain for the index, which might suggest it's leaving the doldrums of May behind. But AMP Capital's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver warned shares remained "vulnerable ot a short-term setback". "We are now in a weaker seasonal period for shares with risks around Trump, North Korea, Chinese growth and the Fed's next rate hike providing potential triggers," he said. "However, with valuations remaining okay – particularly outside of the US, global monetary conditions remaining easy and profits improving on the back of stronger global growth, we continue to see any pullback in shares as an opportunity to 'buy the dips'. Shares are likely to trend higher on a 6-12 month horizon." Energy stocks were hard hit over the week, comprising many of the ASX200's biggest losers over the five sessions. Most other sectors traded into the black, with the heavyweight big four banks finishing up, recovering some of their outsized losses in May. Commonwealth Bank and Westpac both gained 0.3 per cent over the week, ANZ was up 0.2 while NAB jumped 0.8 per cent over the five sessions. Shares in Macquarie added 1.3 per cent over the week, as sources from the millionaire factory hinted the company could be moving off-shore to avoid the bank levy imposed in the budget. Iron ore futures halted a six-day fall, climbing 2 per cent on Friday to provide some support to the big miners. BHP gained 1.4 per cent on Friday and 0.3 per cent over the five sessions. Rio Tinto also had a good Friday but couldn't reverse the week's falls, closing down 1.3 per cent from Monday's open. The materials sector as a whole rose 0.4 per cent over the week. The week's best performance among the top 200 stocks was Janus Henderson Group, a newly-completed merger between Henderson Global Investors and Janus Capital, which surged 5.4 per cent on Friday and 11.5 per cent over the week. Meanwhile logistics giant Qube left a trading halt on Friday after completing a $350 million capital raising to fund a new Sydney freight exchange. It was up 0.8 per cent on Friday. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this week. Photo: Bloomberg 3:57pm Don't panic about housing - at least not yet, Capital Economics recommends. "While the latest figures support the view we laid out in March that the housing market is past its peak and that it will slow during this year and next, they aren't as bad as some of the headlines suggest," economist Paul Dales says. House prices fell 1.1 per cent in May, led by falls of 1.3 per cent in Sydney and 1.7 per cent in Melbourne. These prices are influenced by the normal peaks and troughs in activity during the calendar year, Dales says, adding that historically prices tend to drop in May. But while a housing market crash has not begun, a slowdown is almost certainly underway, he says, pointing to a drop in auction clearance rates from 85 per cent in January to 75 per cent in May, or slower growth in new home sales. And that's before either of these indicators had time to respond to the latest rises in mortgage rates or APRA's new lending rules. "It probably won't be long before a further softening in demand drags house price inflation even further below 5 per cent," Dales says. Looking further ahead, Capital Economics predicts that prices probably won't increase much next year and could start to fall in 2019 and 2020 as the RBA raises interest rates from their current record low. Sydney prices could receive a boost from this week's stamp duty concessions, but Dales reckons it's unlikely to outweigh rising mortgage rates and tightening credit conditions.   3:38pm Chinese iron ore futures climbed more than 2 per cent on Friday, snapping a six-day fall and buoying local miners, although the outlook for the steelmaking raw material remained bleak amid ample supply. Weaker steel prices also capped gains in iron ore, with Shanghai rebar futures down for a seventh session in a row. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was up 2.1 per cent at 431 yuan ($85) a tonne. The contract touched a six-month low of 415 yuan on Thursday and has lost about 5 per cent for the week so far. "Restocking demand was also subdued with reports that several Chinese steel mills were reselling iron ore cargoes procured via long-term contracts," Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. "Elevated Chinese port stocks also weighed on prices." Imported iron ore at China's ports reached 136.6 million tonnes on May 26, the highest since SteelHome consultancy began tracking the data in 2004. That is enough to build the Eiffel Tower in Paris more than 13,000 times over. Spot iron ore fell 1.8 per cent to $US55.97 a tonne overnight, the lowest since October. The spot benchmark has declined 41 per cent from this year's peak. Also on Friday, the most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 1.4 per cent to 3,052 yuan a tonne, marking the seventh straight day of declines. Steel had been holding up much better than iron ore over the past months, but that seems to have changed. "In the long run, China's steel demand will trend down despite short-term volatility," Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report, citing a view by the China Iron and Steel Association. There's enough iron ore at China's ports to build 13,000 Eiffel Towers. Photo: extravagantni 3:24pm Former Primary Health Care chief executive Peter Gregg has strongly denied he is working with major shareholder and possible suitor Chinese firm Jangho Group. Despite a 6 per cent jump in Primary share price on Thursday and rumours swirling of a possible takeover, Gregg rebuffed the idea he has teamed up with the CHY12.3 billion ($2.43 billion) Shanghai-listed Jangho, which is looking to build its presence in Australian healthcare assets.  "I categorically deny I'm working with Jangho," Gregg told The Australian Financial Review.  "I'm not working in any capacity with them. I'm restricted from this. This is not true at all .... your sources are wrong." Gregg exited Primary on May 22 after talking with chairman Rob Ferguson. The AFR revealed on May 1 that Primary had hired Malcolm Parmenter from Sonic as its new head.    Gregg had formally stepped down from his role as CEO in January when it was revealed that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission charged him with two counts of falsifying documents in 2011 while he was CFO at what was then Leighton Holdings (now CIMIC). He has denied the charges.  Shares are up 0.2 per cent at $3.92. Back to top 2:52pm Telstra hasn't exactly been a portfolio rocket this year, with shares down nearly 12 per cent due to concerns that increased competition will hit earnings and eventually the dividend. But the worst seems to be over for the stock, which has gained about 13 per cent since its mid-April low of $4.00 to trade at $4.51 today. In another welcome boost for investors, Goldman Sachs has upgraded Telstra to 'buy', with a price target of $5.00, saying the stock offers good value. Goldies reckons the telco has the best network, will deliver higher cost cuts than flagged and, not least, has the means for a decent sized share buyback as well as dishing out a higher dividend. "We believe the combination of Telstra's dominant networks (the fastest in Australia), its vast scale, and a clear, domestic focused strategy has put the company in a strong position to successfully navigate an increasingly competitive market," the analysts write. They also say the telco's $1 billion productivity program looks conservative relative to global peers. "At current pricing, Telstra's valuation is attractive, with a dividend yield that is amongst the highest in the market – while the capital allocation review provides further optionality to crystalize significant value," the analysts say. They estimate that if Telstra were to securitise its NBN payment stream at a discount rate of 4.55 per cent and buy back stock, it would add about 20 per cent to earnings-per-share across financial years 2019-21, supporting a dividend of 34 cents (currently: 31 cents).  "We believe this could be announced at Telstra's full-year result on August 17, along with an update on the performance of its productivity program – something which we view as critical for the company's long-term earnings profile," the analysts write in a note to clients. Goldman sees long-term earnings flow as well as increased competition - particularly if TPG's performance is better than expected - as the main risks for the telco. 2:39pm Logistics giant Qube has completed the institutional phase of a $350 million capital raising that will fund development of its new Sydney freight interchange. Qube said it has raised $118 million at $2.35 a share in an institutional entitlement offer that was 99 per cent taken up, and $122 million in a placement to institutions that was oversubscribed at $2.42 a share. That compares to a share price of $2.622 when the stock was placed in a trading halt earlier this week. Qube will use $80 million to pay for warehouse construction at the Moorebank Logistics Park in southwest Sydney, and will allocate the balance to other investments and future growth. The company will open a $110 million retail entitlement offer next Wednesday. Shares in Qube came out of a two-day trading halt this morning and are currently up 1.3 per cent at $2.675. 2:03pm The Australian dollar remains on track for another weekly loss amid broad strength in the greenback and on lingering concerns from an unexpected slump in China's manufacturing activity. The Aussie is hovering just above a three-week low of US73.72¢, and is poised to end the week around 0.9 per cent lower, its sixth week in the red out of the past seven. The currency is struggling to recover ground after the private Caixin purchasing managers' survey yesterday showed that China's manufacturing activity had contracted for the first time in nearly a year. "It was a week that brought out the bears, the markets (over-)reacting to every weak print (Caixin PMI) but glossed over any good news such as the Chinese official PMIs remaining solid and a surprise +1 per cent bump in retail sales in April," said TD Securities Asia-Pacific chief macro strategist Annette Beacher.  Adding to pressure on the Aussie, the US dollar rallied overnight on upbeat US private sector job figures as investors await the closely-watched non-farm payrolls report for another potential boost. "Throw in another near-2 per cent fall in iron ore prices and growing expectations that ... Australian growth could come in negative, and the makings of a depreciating AUD are there," said Jason Wong, currency strategist at BNZ Bank, referring to Australia's first quarter gross domestic product data due out on Wednesday. A week that brought out the Aussie bears. Photo: Bloomberg 1:34pm Japan's Nikkei share average has shot through the 20,000-point barrier for the first time since December 2015 after a batch of strong US economic data lifted Wall Street and the US currency against the yen. The Nikkei swept through 20,000 in early trade making a 1.3 per cent advance to 20,115.23, its highest level since August 2015. The index was poised to post weekly gains of 2.1 per cent. The threshold of "20,000 is a big technical and psychological level for traders, so we should be not be surprised if we see some resistance at this level," said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading. Traders added that when there is a recovery seen in the global environment, there is a greater focus on Japan Inc earnings which saw profit growth of 16 per cent in the fiscal year through March. "Japanese stocks would have risen to this level earlier if we did not see global risks and the rising yen," said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. But US political turmoil could unnerve investors next week again, Fujito said, as former FBI director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a US Senate panel investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. "The market is worried that the allegations against Trump over his interference with a federal investigation would delay his efforts on tax cuts and economic policy," Fujito said, adding that there is also a risk that the US dollar will fall against the yen, hurting Japanese stocks. Cyclical sectors were pushed up by recovering risk appetites, with financials and exporters outperforming. Nomura has jumped 4.7 per cent, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group has soared 3.1 per cent, while insurer T&D Holdings surged 3.6 per cent. Subaru Corp added 3.3 per cent and Kyocera Corp advanced 2.7 per cent. The Nikkei has topped 20,000 for the first time in 18 months. Photo: Eugene Hoshiko 1:23pm And while we menton rates: Three of the country's big banks have cut interest rates paid to many customers with savings accounts in the past month as lenders try to protect their profit margins. In a move likely to save banks money but attract little public attention, both Westpac and ANZ lowered the "base" rates they on pay online savings accounts during May, while increasing short-term "introductory" rates by the same amount. The changes mean the advertised rates for these products are unchanged, even though long-term customers will receive lower rates of interest on their money. Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank also cut the rates it pays on its bonus savings accounts by 0.1 percentage points for balances of up to $50,000 during May, while lifting rates on higher balances.  The cuts come as new figures from financial comparison site Mozo show all of the big four banks have cut interest for online savings accounts by more than the 0.5 percentage point reduction in official interest rates over the past year. Mozo figures show Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank have lowered base rates on online savings accounts by 0.75 percentage points in the last year, ANZ has cut its base rate by 0.8 percentage points, and NAB lowered its base rate by 0.6 percentage points. The big four banks have over the past year cut rates on savings accounts more than the RBA's easing over that period. Photo: Paul Rovere Back to top 12:57pm Here's the latest by the AFR's Chris Joye on 'how to invest like the professionals': Most investors hold bank shares and deposits, which book-end a rich capital structure. Yet few have exposure to the assets that reside in between — including senior bonds, subordinated bonds, hybrids and securities like AAA rated "covered bonds", which rank ahead of, and are actually safer than, wholesale deposits. Years ago my team developed a plan to launch a passive exchange traded fund (ETF) that would invest in senior-ranking, floating-rate notes issued by Australia's top banks. The idea was to furnish punters with a liquid and divisible medium through which to access the superior interest rates on offer in the $1.6 trillion unlisted bond market, which trades in minimum $500,000 parcels. We shelved the plan because the economics did not stack up for an active manager. The good news is that ETF provider BetaShares is this week launching a strikingly similar product called the Australian Bank Senior Floating-Rate Bond ETF (ASX code: QPON) that could presage a revolution in fixed-income investing. BetaShares already has a cash deposit ETF (ASX: AAA) that has grown to more than $1.1 billion in size given its attractive at-call interest rate (currently 2.02 per cent). The new bank floating-rate note ETF will pay materially higher gross interest of 2.87 per cent, or 2.65 per cent after the 22-basis-point management fee, which comfortably beats the best at-call and term deposit rates. (Net interest will be lower — perhaps around 2.5 per cent — after round-trip retail brokerage, which most institutions should be able to minimise.) Eighty per cent of the ETF will be allocated to senior floating rate notes issued by the four majors, with the remaining 20 per cent invested with smaller banks, which approximates the distribution of market capitalisation weights. The bonds will have a typical maturity of four years with a strong weighted-average A+ credit rating. Here's more at the AFR Australian super funds have the second lowest allocation to cash and bonds in the developed world behind only Poland.  Photo: 12:34pm Downer EDI has again extended its offer for takeover target Spotless Group, with the hostile bid now stretched to June 29. Downer announced the extension today, also saying it will accelerate payments to accepting Spotless shareholders if its stake in the target passes 50 per cent by June 16. Chief executive of Downer, Gran Fenn, said the company was maintaining its offer at $1.15 a share and described the price as "full and fair" and representing a 59 per cent premium to Spotless's share price when the bid was launched in March. "The alternative for Spotless shareholders is to put their faith in a company which saw a share price decline of almost 70 per cent in the two years prior to the announcement date and which has acknowledged the risks around the execution of its strategy reset," Fenn said. Spotless's board has urged shareholders to reject Downer, saying they can do better in future by retaining their ownership as the company goes through a strategy reset to boost earnings growth. Downer has declared its $1.15 bid - which values Spotless at $1.3 billion - as final in the absence of a higher competing bid.It will now waive outstanding defeating conditions if it reaches 50 per cent acceptances by June 16, with accelerated payments to start on June 19. Spotless shares are up 2.2 per cent at $1.145 while Downer have added 0.6 per cent to $6.435. Downer has once again extended its bid for Spotless. Photo: Angela Brkic 11:51am Sales of new homes rose slightly in April, new figures show, but the housing industry remains concerned the improvement will not halt a continuing weakening in construction and buying activity. The New Home Sales report from the Housing Industry Association shows new home sales rose 0.8 per cent nationally in April, with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia all recording increases in sales of detached housing. HIA senior economist Geordan Murray warned the April rise would not negate a continuing downward trend, pointing to policy changes including the NSW government's move this week to increase taxes for foreign property investors, as creating uncertainty and threatening activity. 11:39am Bankwest will today announce a 76 basis point interest rate rise for principal and interest home buyers, the latest twist in lenders' attempts to slow borrowing and lower risk of bad debt on loan books as market sentiment sours. The CBA subsidiary is creating a new category of low deposit lenders for those with less than 5 per cent deposit by raising rates to 5.29 per cent, up from 4.53 per cent. The new rate is inclusive of expensive lenders' mortgage insurance. The comparative rate, which takes into account all fees and charges, will rise from 4.94 per cent to 5.69 per cent. For a $1 million home buyer with a 30-year, principal and interest $950,000 loan, the new rate of 5.29 per cent will mean an increase in monthly payments of $439 to $5269, according to analysis by finder.com, which monitors fees and charges of financial service products. The higher rates apply to higher loan-to-value owner-occupied, principal and interest borrowers, which until now have largely avoided big increases as lenders focused on interest-only. Many lenders, including Westpac and ANZ, are lowering rates for owner occupier principal and interest borrowers, who pay down the loan principal in addition to interest. They are also providing incentives for switches from interest-only, such as waiving new loan fees. Bankwest has hiked mortgage rates. Photo: Glenn Hunt 11:17am First-home buyers in NSW will applaud Premier Gladys Berejiklian's decision to axe stamp duty for all properties cheaper than $650,000 - but the relief is unlikely to last as the step could well provide the next boost to already sky-high house prices. First-home buyers have been struggling to get a foot into a market dominated by cashed-up investors, and one of their biggest gripes has been having to pay stamp duty. In a recent report by CoreLogic, across NSW the largest proportion of respondents (48%) identified that stamp duty was the most significant obstacle to housing affordability. And almost three-quarters of respondents felt that removing or reducing stamp duty would be an effective way to improve housing affordability in NSW. But CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless warns that abolishing stamp duty may just cause different headaches for first home buyers. "We can expect first home buyer activity to stall before surging higher on July 1. The long-term outcome may be self-defeating due to higher demand pushing up prices," he said.  The current policy provides a stamp duty exemption to first home buyers purchasing a new home with a price tag under $550,000.  The new policy has substantially broader scope, providing an exemption for both new and established housing with a price tag under $650,000 and sliding discounts up to $800,000. CoreLogic notes that over the past 12 months, 45.4 per cent of dwellings sold across NSW had a price tag of $650,000. In the Sydney metropolitan area the proportion of properties that meet the exemption criteria falls away sharply, as just 25.8 per cent of dwelling sales over the past twelve months were at a price of $650,000 or less. Breaking that down further, just 20 per cent of detached houses in Sydney sold for $650,000 or less while unit sales comprised just over one third of all sales at or below this price. But Lawless says that a rise in first time buyer demand could prop up the overall housing market, filling the "hole" left by fewer investors in the market and offseting the recent slowdown in the pace of capital gains. Back to top 11:01am Donald Trump has spoken: the US will exit the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. And clean-energy investors shrugged it off, for now. Solar stocks barely budged after the announcement overnight. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Large Solar Energy Valuation index of 16 companies gained 0.8 per cent at the close in New York. JinkoSolar, the world's biggest panel producer, climbed 2.7 per cent, and that was one of the bigger swings. Canadian Solar, the top North American supplier, gained 0.8 per cent, and US rival SunPower Corp rose 1.5 per cent. Seoul-based Hanwha Q Cells posted one of the larger losses, and that was just 2.1 per cent. Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement— Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017 The muted response is a sign that investors expect demand for clean energy will continue go grow, in the US and around the world. "Trying to make a short trade on a long-term trend is risky," SunPower chief executive Tom Werner said in an interview. The reaction followed a more volatile Wednesday, suggesting that investors have already moved beyond their gut reactions, said Joseph Osha, an analyst at JMP Securities. Most solar shares declined, with Canadian Solar and JinkoSolar both down more than 5 per cent, on the first reports that Trump intended to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. "It's sentiment," said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research. "Will Trump exiting the Paris-climate accord have an impact on solar demand in the next nine to 12 months? Probably not." Michael Liebreich, the London-based founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, put it another way: the Paris accord is "nothing more than an international framework for discussion and expectation-setting. There's nothing binding about Paris other than discussions." In the US, federal tax credits and state-level renewables mandates have been key drivers of wind and solar growth. It's not clear how Trump's plan will affect these policies, if at all. "The US is so hedged around the initiatives at the state level," Liebreich said. "As long as those are not dismantled on an accelerated time frame, nothing appreciably will change." Investors expect demand for clean energy will continue go grow, even in the US. Photo: AP 10:48am Janus Henderson's Australian shares are the top gainer in the ASX200 this morning, rising more than 6 per cent to $45.44. It comes as Credit Suisse started coverage with a "neutral" rating of the asset manager and a price target of $33, saying there is a cross-sell opportunity for Henderson in the US and Japan. Additionally, Fitch assigned the company a 'BBB' credit rating with a positive outlook. Three of nine brokerages rate the stock a "buy" and six a "hold", with an average price target of $42.30. British-Australian asset manager Henderson Global Investors last year agreed to buy US fund firm Janus Capital and dual list the $US6 billion giant in New York and Sydney, cancelling the London listing. Earlier this week the two announced the completion of the all-stock merger. 10:31am Shares have bounced higher at the open, with gains across most sectors bar utilities, as Wall Street's recod-busting mood catches on. The ASX is up 0.6 per cent at 5774.7, putting the benchmark index on track for a modest weekly gain of around 0.5 per cent. This week's data flow has so far painted a picture of robust US economic growth but possible moderation in China, CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner notes. "This has combined to put pressure on the Aussie dollar. However a solid overnight performance by US markets should deliver a firm start for trading in the ASX 200 this morning." The S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent and closed on its high with buyers in charge and led up by the financial sector. That's helped the local banks, which are all up around 0.5 per cent. Telstra is another strong performer, rising 1 per cent after the stock was upgraded to a 'buy' by Goldman Sachs. Macquarie Atlas continues to outperform, rising 3 per cent to take its gains since mid-March to more than 30 per cent. Like other bond proxies, the stock has been profiting from the falls in global yields. Among the losers are yesterday's biggest winners: utilities, led by a 1.9 per cent drop in AGL. 9:59am on 2 Jun 2017 SPONSORED POST The leads from Wall Street suggest we close out the week on a more positive note, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 pushing to new all-time highs and the Dow looking like it just needs a good payrolls report tonight to join this camp, IG strategist Chris Weston says: The focus of the night has really been three-fold. Firstly, much discussion has centred on Trump's confirmation he will take the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and looking to "renegotiate" a new deal more in the interests of the US. Of course, House Speaker Paul Ryan was quick to jump on this and applaud the great man, as it is of course a raw deal for the US. Every other global leader will condemn this action and the likes of Al Gore has said the American people will continue to work with the ideology that climate change is real and will set an example. As a market reaction, it's been a whippy night in the oil markets, and while we saw a sizeable 6.42 million barrel drawdown in official crude inventory data and a sizeable 2.8 million draw in gasoline, the move away from the Paris Accord has caused a few oil traders to sell given Trump's actions could in theory, lead to increased oil production. Traders have also been keen to play the oil move in FX markets, with USD/CAD breaking the May downtrend and I'd be happy to hold longs here into $C1.3600 in the very short-term. We have also seen some focus on the confirmation that former FBI Director James Comey will testify on 8 June before the Senate Intelligence Panel. It actually promises to be a fairly hectic day, with the market keen to hear any key revelations from Comey, while we also get the ECB meeting and UK election exit polls in the early hours of the Fridays Asia trade. Thirdly, US data has given the equity bulls some inspiration, although they seem to have gone it alone and there was hardly any move in corporate credit markets or US Treasuries on the day. In fact the US yield curve is currently sitting at 91 basis points and hardly thematic of a market wanting to load up on US banks, which is what we saw, with the S&P 500 financial sector closing up over 1%. The ADP private payrolls reported 253,000 jobs created in May, well above consensus and it gives us hope at least that tonight's non-farm payrolls will be close enough to the consensus print of 182,000 (economists estimate range from 245,000 to 130,000). Of course keep an eye on average hourly earnings too, with consensus calling for a 2.6% increase in wages. Here's more Markets so far have shrugged off Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Accord. Photo: AP 9:51am on 2 Jun 2017 Former RBA governor Glenn Stevens has endorsed a crackdown on tax concessions for negative gearing in his first major public report since leaving his old job.  Stevens in a report on the NSW government's housing affordability package blamed negative gearing for the lack of investment by corporates in rental housing. He said Australia's rental stock was in the hands of individuals rather than corporate investors at least in part because of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. "Individuals are prepared to accept very low rental yields because of the tax concessions. Institutional investors are unlikely to find those yields attractive. It would be a bad mistake to offer them a separate round of tax concessions or subsidies in order to secure their involvement. It would be better to lessen the generosity of the concessions to individuals." He said the Commonwealth tax experts should investigate the matter. The remarks will provide support to the federal opposition's call for an end to negative gearing and they are consistent with concerns expressed during Stevens' time at the RBA that the tax system was encouraging speculative investment in property. Stevens also expressed concerns about state government subsidies to investors. He called for research on how many home owners grants go to those buying investment properties and questioned why NSW wanted to subsidise that investment strategy. Ex-RBA chief Glenn Stevens has taken a shot at negative gearing. Photo: Dominic Lorrimer Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Arrow Electronics Prices $500 Million Notes Offering June 01, 2017 04:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time CENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW) announced today the pricing of one series of the company’s senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million maturing on January 12, 2028 and bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.875% (the “Notes”).

KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC-40 gained 0.5 percent to 5,308.60 and Germany’s DAX advanced 0.4 percent to 12,660.42. London’s FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 percent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India’s Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers’ index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April’s 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Today’s PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin’s survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. “The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy,” said Evans-Pritchard. “We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived.” TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to “a lot of people both ways.” Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers’ index declined to 51.6 from April’s six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday’s 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.

No? Neither does Wall Street. The Dow popped 136 points to 21,144 on Thursday, landing at its first record close since March 1. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also finished at all-time highs. While many American were focused on the fallout from President Trump's decision to withdraw from the climate deal, market analysts said Thursday's march higher on Wall Street was linked to healthy signals from the U.S. economy. "It's not because of the climate accord. People expected that," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Investors were instead fired up by a report from ADP showing the U.S. added 253,000 private-sector jobs in May. Wall Street is betting that's a very good sign ahead of Friday's more closely-watched government jobs report. "It was a very strong reading and helps reduce worries the economy had lost momentum," Kelly said. The Dow is now up more than 500 points since the Trump-fueled selloff on May 17. Solid jobs numbers on Friday should clear the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. They would also reassure investors that the rebound in corporate profit growth can continue. In many ways, the Dow is just playing catch-up with the other indexes that were already in record territory. While the Nasdaq is up 16% this year and the S&P 500 has rallied 8.5%, the Dow is up a more modest 7%. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said Wall Street's better mood is partly because Trump's scandals are getting less attention.

It did it this time without the stocks that fuelled the strongest stretches of the Trump trade. The 120-year-old Dow became the last major US equity gauge to snap out of a malaise that was underscored by a 373-point rout on May 17, when questions arose about the president's dealings with his FBI director.

While it's axiomatic on Wall Street that rallies never get anywhere without banks, some see reason for optimism when the advance is carried by companies that may not need President Donald Trump's policy agenda to succeed. "It's a good sign," Marshall Front, who manages $US800 million at Front Barnett Associates in Chicago, said by phone. "People got crazy and went overboard on the Trump agenda. This is a shift away from that reflation play." The Dow's reliance on consumer shares this year epitomises the dramatic shift in investor psychology over the last six months. Banks and oil companies took the spotlight in the wake of the November election as investors prepared for higher inflation and regulatory rollbacks from the Trump administration. Such hopes are on life support as gridlock and disarray grip Washington and rebounding earnings lift tech stocks. Rising corporate profits are consistent across the biggest winners in the Dow. McDonald's just posted its eighth straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings, and Apple beat forecasts for the fourth time on its last report. Caterpillar stock surged 7.9 per cent when it reported earnings on April 25. Due to its slower climb, the Dow has fewer stocks trading at elevated levels than its peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 57 per cent of its members are trading above their 50-day average, compared with 87 per cent at the last record. In the S&P 500, about 65 per cent are trading higher.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files NEW YORK Second-quarter trading revenue trends at Citigroup Inc (C.N) were "in line" with recent descriptions by competitors, Chief Executive Mike Corbat said on Thursday. Corbat spoke at an investor conference after executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said at conferences on Wednesday that trading revenue was down from a year ago on lower volatity and weaker client activity. Corbat said the bank will give more details in a presentation later this month. JPMorgan described a decline so far of about 15 percent. Bank of America described a 10-to-12 percent decline. Year-earlier results were boosted by trading ahead of the United Kingdom's vote on Brexit.

"I used to study the 'fives' to see why they liked us and the 'ones' to see why they hated us," Moore said. "But you have to pay as much attention to the twos, threes and fours. Look at everyone and study why they didn't give us a higher score.” In her two and a half years as head of digital, the bank’s active mobile users increased by about 50%. "We have 22 million users. It is not just an expense play, it is an experience play, it is a revenue play, it is a building-connections play," she said. "All roads lead back to mobile.” Be sure to check out this separate interview on the nonwork stuff, like family and personal goals. Solid, not stellar: JPMorgan Chase is concentrating on growth in its credit card and mortgage businesses this year as it awaits more interest rate hikes to help boost profit margins, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. She expects a “solid, not stellar” second quarter and is hopeful for relief on capital requirements and stress testing. “Consumers are in very good shape, their balance sheets are repaired, they’re pretty liquid,” she said. So far regulatory relief has yet to emerge, though “key open roles” in the Trump administration, once filled, could result in some progress on that front, Lake said, without specifying which roles. “Nothing has actually changed,” she said. “And so when we come into work every day right now, we still need to work very hard to comply with the rules as they currently stand.” Not for sale: Aggressive restructuring moves and stock buybacks are buying CIT time, but it will need to show growth in its core banking business to stave off calls for the company to sell itself. The turnaround plan laid out by Chief Executive Officer Ellen Alemany calls for CIT to hit a target of 10% return on equity by 2018. Falling short surely would make investors restless, but a CIT spokeswoman said it’s making “tremendous progress” toward its goal. The ROE was at 7.4% as of March 31. Diversity problems: The founder and president of Anthemis Group, Amy Nauiokas, gets a first look at early stage fintech ideas and said, like any good investor, she takes her chances on people, not ideas. So many early stage companies fail that it's important to focus on people's ability to lead a company and foster a culture. And founders are “almost always” men, she pointed out, which is why it’s important to ask every company about their diversity plans. “If you started yesterday… you’re a founder… you don’t fix your problem, I’ve got no time for you,” said Nauiokas (who, incidentally, is an investor in Payoff, the company behind Joy, the all-male run PFM app for women, which you may recall reading about here last week.) “Goldman Sachs has done probably better than anyone at trying to bring more women to the table, but it is a multi-hundred-year-old organization from a time women weren’t in the workforce. We’re living in a different world and there’s no excuse for selling a product to a population that holds more than 50% of purchasing power and not having a female voice on your board or in your C-suite.” Be sure to also read Nauiokas’ BankThink piece on the gender imbalance in the startup sector. The curvy career ladder: TIAA’s Kathie Andrade and BMO Financial’s Ann Marie Wright spoke at the Women in Banking LEAD conference in New York last week sharing their experiences on how to prosper in a challenging market. Advancing at work is often “more like a rock climb than a career ladder,” Andrade said. Sometimes the best move isn't necessarily directly one rung above. Similarly, Wright talked about the importance of considering positions that perhaps aren't part of your own grand plan. If she didn't listen to the people who led her to such opportunities, she wouldn't be where she is now, she said. Kathie Andrade, TIAA’s chief executive officer of retail financial services, spoke at the Most Powerful Women in Banking LEAD conference. Role call HarborOne Bank in Brockton, Mass., announced today that Linda Simmons has been named chief financial officer. Simmons succeeds Joseph Casey, who was appointed president in February. She joins HarborOne from the Cooperative Bank of Cape Cod, where she had been CFO since 2012. She also is a member of the advisory board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. In case you missed it On the front lines: As technology has changed consumer expectations and lowered their attention spans, banks have a lot of adjusting to do. The onus isn’t just on bank tellers to create deep personal connections with customers. There has to be an effort made in the branch, on the website, in the mobile app, on social media and everywhere else the customer spends time, said Jennifer Breithaupt, Citi’s recently appointed global consumer marketing chief. She also talked about virtual reality and her personal goals with moving into a new role. When bigger isn't better: Citi recently unveiled an agreement with Nasdaq that allows Citi to link its business payments services to Nasdaq's blockchain platform. It’s significant to witness a blockchain solution in the wild — banks often work in large consortia that require agreement by so many parties that it impedes the ability to ship a product quickly. What “helped translate the theoretical thinking to actual application” was to work in a “minimal viable ecosystem” of just a few trusted partners — to be able to get a product to market faster, and focus on scaling the network later, said Morgan McKenney, Asia Pacific head of core cash management, at Citi's treasury and trade solutions arm. “Everyone is used to a minimum viable product, how do you extend that thinking to something that’s going to involve multiple players?” Beyond banking Gender complex: The general thinking is that venture capital firms with female senior investing partners are more likely to invest in companies founded by women. But that is not the case, at least among 17 top venture firms in this Bloomberg analysis. Michelle Zatlyn suggested one reason might be that, with so few women in the industry, they are concerned more with trying to fit in than they are with betting on female-led companies. “For a long time, I didn’t want to be a part of any of the female stories,” said Zatlyn, co-founder and head of user experience at Cloudflare. “I didn’t want to be labeled.” However, now, “It feels like there’s a point of view that’s missing,” she said. Others agreed that their gender helps them see value in different companies. “I consider it a competitive advantage,” said Jess Lee, who joined Sequoia last year after years leading Polyvore, the online fashion company. Compared to her male venture counterparts, “I have an advantage in understanding the female consumer.” Pissing pug: #FearlessGirl was trending on Twitter again this week, after sculptor Alex Gardega — upset about the statue being placed across from Wall Street’s “Charging Bull” — decided to retaliate with a work of his own. Gardega created a statue of a small dog, titled “Pissing Pug,” taking aim at the girl’s left leg. “This is corporate nonsense,” Gardega said of “Fearless Girl,” referring to the fact that it was placed there by State Street Global Advisors. “It has nothing to do with feminism, and it is disrespect to the artist that made the bull.” THIS is DISGUSTING. Peeing on the little girl?! Misogynistic, pathetic bastard. Doesn't deserve the title Artist. #AlexGardenia #pissingpug https://t.co/JMdv0oCQXH — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) May 30, 2017 Wonder, men: Some men are upset about a women-only screening of the movie “Wonder Woman” at a theater in Austin, Texas.

The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, CEO Brian Moynihan said at a separate event.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Share prices of the biggest U.S. banks reportedly are flirting with bear-market territory amid fears of weak trading revenues and fading hopes for President Donald Trump’s ambitious economic agenda. “Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were among the biggest beneficiaries of the stock rally in the weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, as investors looked forward to a profit-boosting mix of higher interest rates, lower taxes and lighter regulation,” the Financial Times reported. “But some of those underpinnings have fallen away since then, as Trump’s early setback over healthcare policy cast doubt over his ability to implement other promised reforms,” the FT explained. Shares in Goldman Sachs dropped 3.3 percent Wednesday, bringing the total fall from its closing high on March 3 to 16.5 percent — within reach of the 20 percent drop that commonly defines a “bear market.” Goldman shares rebounded Thursday, rising more than 1 percent to $214. Share prices of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have all tumbled more than 10 percent from their post-election peaks, the FT reported. Bank analysts have been switching “blue-sky earnings scenarios” of late last year with “more cloudy” outlooks, Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, told the FT. He explained that the hopes of corporate tax reform happening any time this year have almost evaporated. “Tax reform was difficult enough in 1986, when you had bipartisan support and an extremely popular president,” he said. “Without either, it always looked like a bit of a long shot.” To be sure, in an even more disturbing sign, CNBC reported that the financial sector "just gave up all of this year's gains, and some strategists say that's sending the broader market a message about the health of the economy." The sector, composed of a range of financial services firms such as insurance companies and banks, was leading the market for part of the year to date and was up 9 percent as of the beginning of March, CNBC explained. The drop is a function of rates falling, along with ongoing concerns about global growth, said Oppenheimer head of technical analysis Ari Wald.  Financials underperforming in a falling-interest-rate environment flashes a "lacking vote of confidence about economic growth," he wrote Wednesday in an email to CNBC. However, many respected economic voices have also urged caution about the liberal mainstream media's biased smear-campaign attacks on Trump, which have hindered full implentation of the president's plans to truly "Make America Great Again." David Horowitz, author of the best-selling book "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," has told Newsmax TV that the market rally since Republican Donald Trump won the election has more room for gains as the president pushes his pro-business agenda. “There's more upside. Starting from when he was president-elect he started this stock market boom,” he recently told “The Income Generation Show.” “I don't think Trump's agenda is going to be stopped in its tracks. What people forget, I mean, it's all this inside-the-beltway chatter, all of it hysterical. The anti-Trump forces are truly deranged. You can't forget how he resonates with the people,” Horowitz said on "The Income Generation," which airs on Newsmax TV every Sunday at 10 am ET. Meanwhile, veteran financial guru and former Ronald Reagan adviser Larry Kudlow is urging any impatient investors to just give Trump a chance to fully enact his strategies to reform healthcare, spark economic growth and redesign the tax system. After all, Trump has been in office a relatively short time and has inherited a mountain of problems from the past two decades. “He's trying to fix a lot of problems that have gone unfixed in the last 20 years,” Kudlow explained to CNBC. Trump “still wants tax reform and healthcare reform. Those are big issues for him.” the Newsmax Finance Insider said. “Give him a chance,” said Kudlow, who advised the Trump campaign on economic issues.

Foreign investors move beyond sovereign debt to issues from banks and corporations The Gulf's market in international bonds is deepening as foreign investors move beyond sovereign debt to issues from banks and corporations - a shift that could change the way some issuers choose to structure their bonds. Traditionally, foreign investors in Gulf debt have focused almost entirely on sovereign bonds because of their greater safety and liquidity. But a surge of sovereign issuance in the past 12 months, as Gulf governments cover budget deficits caused by low oil prices, is changing that pattern. It has put the region on the map for some foreign institutions, making them boost allocations to the six GCC states. Institutions that fail to satisfy their appetite for GCC debt entirely with sovereign bonds look a few notches down the credit rating curve at bank and corporate issuers. Meanwhile, expanded sovereign issuance has created a complete yield curve for the region, making it easier for banks and companies to price bonds at levels which a range of investors accept. "This is a market that attracts both investment grade and emerging market investors," said Hani Deaibes, head of Middle East debt capital markets at JPMorgan. "What is happening is that the large issuances from sovereigns have made this market more relevant to investors. This has increased the interest in corporates and banks from the region. There's more understanding of the market." In 2016, GCC bond volumes totalled a record $69 billion, more than double the usual level since the mid-2000s, Thomson Reuters data shows. Over $40 billion has been issued so far this year. Jumbo sovereign deals include Saudi Arabia's $17.5 billion debut international bond last year, the largest issued in emerging markets, plus an $8 billion bond from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's $9 billion international sukuk, or Islamic bond, this year. Allocation statistics for at least one recent Gulf issuer suggest the balance of demand by geography and investor type is changing. A $750 million senior secured bond issued in May by Kuwait's largest commercial lender, National Bank of Kuwait, was mostly bought by US-based investors. Some 57 per cent of the paper went to them, followed by Middle East investors with 26 per cent, Europe with 13 per cent and Asia with four per cent. By contrast, 43 per cent of a $700 million bond issued by NBK in 2015 went to Middle East investors; US buyers took only two per cent. "From an emerging markets perspective this region has become more relevant, in particular in the US, simply by virtue of the sheer volumes issued since last year," said Iman Abdel Khalek, Citigroup's head of regional debt capital markets. "NBK has been the first bank to take advantage of this. The pricing outcome was exceptional and was a direct outcome of the bid from US investors, who also bought the Kuwait sovereign bond earlier in the year."

Morgan: Re-Think Business Chatty bots and AI bank managers: getting inside fintech’s future What’s next for the rapidly evolving world of money, banking and finance? The first article in the WIRED / J.P. Morgan Re-Think Business series explores the big trends in fintech’s future 1 day ago In partnership with J.P. Morgan Private Bank Marcus Marritt Thursday 1 June 2017 Fintech might have started life as a buzzword, but now it’s a powerful reality. The ongoing digital revolution and the irresistible rise of technologies such as machine learning and cloud computing are on course to disrupt one of the world’s most complex sectors: banking and financial services.   Tech startups on shoestring budgets are increasingly carving a space for themselves in the financial-services industry, developing apps or online tools that provide new and engaging ways of saving or investing.   Although many recent fintech successes – such as Funding Circle and Transferwise – mainly focused on optimisation rather than wholesale transformation, this is the calm before the storm. Over the next five years financial services are going to be revolutionised, as the sector’s large incumbents seize the opportunity to embrace change.   “Typically, fintech organisations are very mission-driven – they have a single, pinpoint goal and do a great job solving one issue,” says Kelli Keough, ‎global head of digital wealth management at JPMorgan Chase. “The role for large financial institutions is to provide holistic experiences: people still come to large financial institutions asking them to solve multiple financial needs for them, they expect an integrated experience.”   “We think about financial integrated experiences using what we can from fintech companies, by incorporating the great technology they bring to the marketplace.”   Here, we explore four key areas of innovation that are powering today’s fintech insurgency – and explore how they will reshape our financial services of the future.   The bank manager as an AI It comes as no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) tops the list of potentially disruptive technologies. Vast amounts of processable data and techniques such as machine learning have made it possible to create algorithms capable of outperforming humans at detecting trends, making predictions and taking appropriate action. In the financial sector, legions of smart machines are taking over a wide range of tasks that were once the preserve of human workers.   Robo-traders have been buying and selling stocks for some time (their super-fast reaction times have triggered “flash crashes” on the markets), but in the last few years AIs have also started working as financial-fraud detectives.   “Banks and financial organisations have been pushed by regulators to be more sophisticated in tackling issues such as money laundering and any sort of criminal behaviour,” explains Mark Atherton, vice president for financial services at computer-technology corporation Oracle. “Humans just can't process all the information involved. AI can look at patterns, how money is moved around, and is very good at spotting any sign of suspicious activity. Since an AI learns as it goes, we don't have to programme everything into the system.”   Jörn Leogrande, vice president mobile services at payment platform Wirecard, says that while machine learning still requires humans to be involved in some of the more complex decisions, these tools are increasingly being used for customer-facing activities. “Providers of financial services are using AI to make predictions about customers’ behaviour, which can then be used to push certain products, reduce churn and create market insights for product and brand development,” he says.   Marcus Marritt Rise of the chatty robots Many business units are already in the process of being swarmed by another kind of virtual agent: the chatbot. Easy to access through apps such as Facebook Messenger or Slack, chatbots are algorithms able to process financial information and discuss it with customers in natural written language. Customers can turn to chatbots for such tasks as checking their accounts or tracking expenses. ADVERTISEMENT “Chatbots can help banks lower the cost of advice and support for customers,” explains Harry Armstrong, head of futures at London-based think tank Nesta. “The ability to access and process large amounts of data and provide services and advice on the back of it could help consumers better navigate between different products and offers. This could potentially help people manage their finances in better ways.” The industry-wide chatbot bandwagon is picking up momentum, partly because chatbots are perceived as a way to engage with younger generations—who as a demographic cohort don’t think too much about saving. That is why Mastercard and Capital One have both launched conversational agents which provide 24/7 customer service at the tap of a finger; and consultancy Accenture has forecast that chatbots will become the primary way for customers to interact with banks within three years – it’s also released a proof-of-concept virtual mortgage adviser, named Colette. Chetan Dube, president and CEO of IPsoft, which created a cognitive agent called Amelia, explains that customer-service-by-bot is just the start. “Chatbots were initially incorporated to provide limited FAQ support, but we now see sophisticated virtual agents such as Amelia taking on full advisory and service support roles,” he says. “Importantly this evolution places emphasis on virtual agents to understand a wider ranging and more complex conversation and independently determine the right steps to take in order to execute a request, end to end. “ Amelia cut her teeth on an internal tech-support desk, but has since migrated to front of house, where she now talks to customers. ADVERTISEMENT The blockchain: boom or bust? If chatbots are going to be taking over financial institutions’ front desks, another technology – one that was, ironically, originated by an online anarcho-libertarian effort – is destined to radically alter the back end. Enter the blockchain, the digital scaffolding for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The blockchain is a distributed virtual ledger running on thousands of machines, on which every transaction is immutably recorded by network consensus. These transactions originally involved bitcoins, but the same infrastructure can be leveraged to reliably and securely exchange any kind of assets, from bonds to equities. Banks, insurers and other financial institutions have already started investing in blockchain-technology research and are excited about the ledger’s potential uses. One obvious advantage is the speeding up of procedures such as interbank transfers, which can be lengthy, involve lots of paperwork and can require intermediaries. The blockchain promises to be a tamper-proof, speedy way to carry out that task – and cut out the middleman in the process. ADVERTISEMENT Its supporters argue that its areas of application – from faster, fee-free international payments to credit-score automation and certification of digital-asset ownership – are endless. “Things like insurance and risk management will change profoundly. By using reputation systems based on a person’s economic and social capital, insurers will be able to make better-informed decisions,” explain Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, co-authors of Blockchain Revolution and co-founders of the Blockchain Research Institute. “Or think of the OTC [over-the-counter] derivatives market: it has a notional value of $600 trillion [£469tn], but is paper-based, opaque and relies too heavily on centralised clearing houses. Moving all derivatives to the blockchain would reduce counter-party risk and systemic risk by making settlements instant and transparent.” Over time, the blockchain could have another, systemic, effect: allowing banks and financial-service providers to dramatically expand their client base. “Blockchain embeds trust into financial systems, providing transparency without sacrificing privacy and information security,” says Jesse Lund, vice president for global blockchain market development at IBM. “Improved transparency will promote trust between consumers and institutions and help increase the financial inclusion of nearly half of the world’s population who remain ‘unbanked’.”   Its detractors, however, claim that blockchain systems aren’t scalable, and that the sector is underfunded by wary VCs. However it pans out, the Bitcoin back-end isn’t going away any time soon. Marcus Marritt Keeping the bad guys out The irresistible rise of fintech is exciting, but it also presents challenges. Distributed ledgers and blockchain-like networks have to carefully balance security and decentralisation with the need for privacy and scale banks need (the original Bitcoin blockchain is publicly visible and can manage about seven transactions per second). AI and cognitive agents will vastly benefit the industry, but seeing them as a panacea has its risks, as Douglas Merrill, CEO and founder of machine-learning-driven underwriting platform ZestFinance, explains. “As the human brain experiences blind spots, so too is AI prone to certain errors,” he says. “We often see this with data: you can deploy the best machine-learning models, but if they’re trained on bad data, they’ll produce bad results.” Beyond that, the digitisation of banking and finance has another consequence: hackers and cyberattackers will have the capacity to inflict damage on a much larger scale than before. “While security breaches in other sectors can have devastating consequences for both the company and the consumer, these consequences are often limited to loss of data and consumer confidence,” explains Alex Rice, co-founder of cybersecurity firm HackerOne. “The financial sector does not have that luxury: insecure services hit their bottom line and threatens the livelihood of the impacted consumer. When it comes to security, the stakes are among the highest in the financial sector.”   New threats, Rice continues, go from “boutique malware” – such as the virus which cheated a Bangladeshi bank of $81 million through a compromised SWIFT terminal – to phishing and ATM skimming. The recent attack on the NHS also showed how vulnerable public institutions are to ransomware. But the fintech sector is responding. Solutions range from AI-fuelled cybersecurity tools to stronger encryption and bug bounties – rewards for the finder of a vulnerability in an institution’s system. Yet, one of the more effective ways to pre-empt disaster (or handling it adequately), Rice says, is sharing information among financial-services providers themselves. ADVERTISEMENT “Financial-services companies were some of the first to embrace and leverage information sharing to powerful effect,” he explains. “In the US, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center has significantly improved the security posture of the sector by openly sharing best practices and lessons learned from attacks.” Fintech has become part of the mainstream infrastructure and is likely to evolve quickly and splinter into even more financial sub-sectors. So, it is crucial for those involved in financial services to be aware of new developments and risks – ultimately, to get inside fintech’s future. - For more from J.P.

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 01, 2017 10:55am   Comments Share: Related XLF Best Sector ETFs For June: Powering Up Fast Money Picks For May 31 Mivtachim The Workers Social Insurance Fund Ltd. ... (GuruFocus) Financial stocks were the initial beneficiary of the "Trump rally" but have now lost all momentum, and many notable names are even trading in the red for 2017. For example, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) are now lower by nearly 5 percent since the start of 2017; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) is lower by more than 11 percent. Financial stocks were higher by more than 9 percent going back to the beginning of March, a CNBC "Trading Nation" segment noted. But now that the sector has given up all of its gains and then some, is it a time to buy the dip? Expert's Take Max Wolff of 55 Institutional was a guest on the "Trading Nation" segment and explained why he isn't a buyer right now. Many investors thought financials would be a winner from economic growth, reflation around the world, deregulation, along with interest rate and balance sheet normalization. Yet here we are months into President Donald Trump's administration and the investment thesis derived immediately following the election might not hold true today. In fact, financial stocks may have "leap-frogged into aggressive space" in hopes of support from White House policies, particularly in areas such as economic growth and deregulation which remains uncertain. "We still don't have clarity," Wolff said in reference to future policy changes. "Getting closer — but not quite there yet." Since Election Day, Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF) is up 16.57 percent; year to date, the ETF is up just 0.17 percent.

He previously worked at Reuters and Forbes. Follow @LionelRALaurent Facebook Twitter Email Print Share June 1, 2017 10:02 AM EDT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO +0.91 At Closing, June 1st 83.06 USD Wall Street executives aren't usually a gloomy bunch. Recently, though, they have taken to bemoaning the lack of action on financial markets that's depriving their traders of healthy profits. Dwindling Volatility The VIX index has fallen over the past 18 months Source: Bloomberg Just yesterday, JPMorgan's CFO blamed dwindling volatility, low rates and a lack of political shocks for a decline in markets revenue in April and May. Stake sold $2.9 billion But it's precisely this lack of volatility that gave Barclays Plc a big helping hand when it sold $2.9 billion of shares in its African unit this week. The British bank had initially planned to sell a 22 percent stake but increased the offering to 34 percent, citing strong demand from investors. The sale came against a backdrop of rising emerging-market equities -- which saw inflows for ten straight weeks through the end of May, according to Bank of America -- and reduced expectations of an imminent rise in U.S. interest rates. Does that mean Barclays Africa was an easy sell? Not really. The process of cutting Barclays's stake in the Africa business would have been far easier had other banks or investors been willing and able to take majority control in one go. And while South Africa's economy is set to grow at a faster pace in 2017 than last year, when it expanded at the slowest rate since 2009, the country has had its fair share of political shocks. Barclays Africa was one of several banking stocks hit when S&P cut the country's credit rating after President Jacob Zuma fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Emerging Rebound The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has gained ground this year Source: Bloomberg But calmer markets and growing investor appetite for bank shares this year have helped Barclays to hit its target of paring its stake in the Africa business to less than 20 percent ahead of schedule. The latest batch of shares were sold for 132 rand each, a narrow discount to the stock's previous closing price of 139 rand and still higher than the 126-rand price achieved in a previous sale last year. For Barclays, the benefits are twofold. Firstly, the sale will bolster the bank's balance sheet, lifting the core Tier 1 capital ratio by 73 basis points. That should help to reduce the pressure on CEO Jes Staley to raise capital. Secondly, it will leave the bank focused more sharply on its investment banking operations in New York and London. A Year to Forget Barclays is Britain's worst-performing bank stock this year Source: Bloomberg Will that be enough to successfully compete against Wall Street's finest, some of whom are perhaps already preparing investors for a more tepid financial performance this summer? Fixed costs are stubbornly high, while Barclays' first-quarter results showed a below-average performance for its investment bank. And that was in an otherwise healthy quarter for U.S. rivals, who now seem a bit more downbeat on trading performance. Becalmed markets have helped Barclays exit Africa and deliver on a key plank of its strategy. They may prove less helpful, however, in boosting the performance of its major engine of future growth.   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Bank shares underperformed rising European stocks, after two major US lenders warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, rose off Wednesday's three-week lows in anticipation of the United States quitting the Paris accord. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his decision later on Thursday. "If he actually withdraws the U.S from the climate accord, this would signal his intention to further roll-back emission regulations that would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels, thus giving a much needed boost to oil prices," said Jonathan Chan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. A fall in US crude inventories also supported prices. Brent last traded at $51.39 a barrel, up 64 cents, having touched a low of $50.31 on Wednesday. The wider STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 percent, led higher by industrials. European manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in more than six years in May, according to a euro zone purchasing managers' index. European bank stocks were flat. Financial sector shares fell on Wall Street on Wednesday after JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent fall in trading revenue and Bank of America said second-quarter trading revenue was on track to be 10-12 percent down on last year. The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 ended Wednesday at 10.41, its lowest end-month close. Despite a stumble in recent days, especially banks and miners have led global stocks steadily higher since Trump's election in November, limiting the market swings from which traders profit. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after the a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday which suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.7996 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. The Chinese data also hit the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Australia's currency fell 0.2 percent at $0.7416, having earlier fallen to $40.7384, its weakest since May 12. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.1 percent to $1.2874 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 percent. The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1228 while the Japanese yen fell 0.3 percent to 111.11 per dollar.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Ivory Coast has sold 940,000 T of 2017/18 cocoa crop Next Asia Coffee-Vietnam premium tightens as trade slows, Indonesian supply rises Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Menu Stocks Stocks to Buy Stocks to Sell Dividend Stocks Penny Stocks Hot Stocks Stock Market Today Funds Mutual Funds ETF Investing 401k & Investing Tips Retirement Financial Advisor Center Trading Trading Advice Trade of the Day Trading Report How to Trade Options Market Insight IPO Playbook Gadgets, Smartphones & Tech Weird Street InvestorPolitics Financial Advisors Premium Services Stocks to Buy Stocks to Sell Dividend Stocks Penny Stocks Hot Stocks Stock Market Today DOW- NASDAQ- S&P 500- Trump pulls U.S. from Paris climate agreement; Tesla at risk? >>> READ MORE Breaking news sponsored by Home > Stock Picks > Stock Market Today > Stocks Drift Lower as Bank Stocks Plummet Yet Nasdaq remains on a winning streak totalling seven months Jun 1, 2017, 7:24 am EDT  |  By Anthony Mirhaydari, InvestorPlace Market Strategist Get AMZN alerts: Submit     U.S. equities moved lower in relatively quiet trading on Wednesday as bank and energy stocks weakened. Bank stocks were hit by worries over trading revenues and the net interest margin pressure for a flattening yield curve. Energy names were pushed lower as crude oil weakened on reports of weakening compliance by OPEC nations in their recently extended output freeze agreement. Big names in both sectors are now at risk of significant downside support breaks, setting up further losses in the days to come. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite gave back 0.1% and the Russell 2000 ended the day 0.1% lower. Treasury bonds climbed higher, the dollar was broadly weaker, gold gained 0.8% and oil fell 2.7%. Breadth was mixed to slightly negative, with 1.1 decliners to every advancer on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume was extremely heavy — suggestive of distribution, a negative sign — with 1,433 million shares traded representing 168% of the 30-day average in the most active day of trading since March 17. Defensive utility stocks led the way with a 0.5% gain while financials and energy were the laggards, down 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) fell 2.1% after its CFO said second-quarter market revenue was down about 15% from last year. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) fell 1.9% after its CEO said Q2 trading revenue will be down on an annual basis. BAC, as shown above, is now testing critical “neckline” support of a massive six-month head-and-shoulders reversal pattern. The pattern is about as perfect as you’ll find in the wild. And it traces a downside target of $18.50, which would take the stock below its 200-day moving average to return it to levels not seen since early November — nearly completely reversing the post-election rally. Edge Pro subscribers are enjoying a 121% gain in their June $23 BAC puts recommended earlier this week. Aside from the warnings on trading revenue, the financial sector is at risk as Treasury bonds move higher (and thus, long-term yields move lower) as the post-election “Trump-flation” trade fades. This amid the worst disappointment in the economic data relative to expectations since 2015, underwhelming inflation data, and a sense the healthcare reform, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending plans Wall Street had eagerly priced in following President Trump’s surprise victory are going to be long in coming. As a result, the iShares 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (NYSEARCA:TLT) has pushed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since last October. That’s boosted the ProShares Ultra 20+Year Tsury ETF (NYSEARCA:UBT) recommended to Edge subscribers to a 4.5% gain. Conclusion The area of the market to watch right now is energy. Oil is under fresh pressure with West Texas Intermediate testing below the $47-a-barrel level. JBC Energy reported falling OPEC production cap compliance (down to 92% from 96% in April) as it’s clear the oil sheiks — despite agreeing to a nine-month extension of their output freeze deal — are increasingly desperate as U.S. shale producers lower their cost structures and boost rig counts. Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch wrote in a note to clients that there “continues to be considerable skepticism about the effectiveness of the production cuts” amid an ongoing global oversupply situation and swollen inventories. This is terrible news for energy stocks which have been in a persistent six-month downtrend. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XLE) is already down nearly 16% from its December high. Today’s losses push the sector down to levels not seen since last July. Shares of oil majors like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) look extremely vulnerable here, readying a break out of multi-month consolidation ranges. Where this starts to matter to all investors is the bleed. Both bank and energy stocks are on the slide, and as a result, the broad market’s quiet strength – bolstered by overheated sentiment and parabolic rallies in big-tech stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) — is unlikely to continue. Especially as we enter what is seasonally the most difficult part of the year for the market. “Sell in May” and all that. Check out Serge Berger’s Trade of the Day for June 1, 2017.

Traditionally, foreign investors in Gulf debt have focused almost entirely on sovereign bonds because of their greater safety and liquidity. But a surge of sovereign issuance in the past 12 months, as Gulf governments cover budget deficits caused by low oil prices, is changing that pattern. It has put the region on the map for some foreign institutions, making them boost allocations to the six Gulf Cooperation Council states. Institutions that fail to satisfy their appetite for GCC debt entirely with sovereign bonds look a few notches down the credit rating curve at bank and corporate issuers. Meanwhile, expanded sovereign issuance has created a complete yield curve for the region, making it easier for banks and companies to price bonds at levels which a range of investors accept. “This is a market that attracts both investment grade and emerging market investors,” said Hani Deaibes, head of Middle East debt capital markets at JPMorgan. “What is happening is that the large issuances from sovereigns have made this market more relevant to investors. This has increased the interest in corporates and banks from the region. There’s more understanding of the market.” In 2016, GCC bond volumes totalled a record $69 billion, more than double the usual level since the mid-2000s, Thomson Reuters data show. Over $40 billion has been issued so far this year. Jumbo sovereign deals include Saudi Arabia’s $17.5 billion debut international bond last year, the largest issued in emerging markets, plus an $8 billion bond from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia’s $9 billion international sukuk, or Islamic bond, this year. Allocations Allocation statistics for at least one recent Gulf issuer suggest the balance of demand by geography and investor type is changing. A $750 million senior secured bond issued in May by Kuwait’s largest commercial lender, National Bank of Kuwait, was mostly bought by US-based investors. Some 57 per cent of the paper went to them, followed by Middle East investors with 26 per cent, Europe with 13 per cent and Asia with 4 per cent. By contrast, 43 per cent of a $700 million bond issued by NBK in 2015 went to Middle East investors; US buyers took only 2 per cent. “From an emerging markets perspective this region has become more relevant, in particular in the US, simply by virtue of the sheer volumes issued since last year,” said Iman Abdel Khalek, Citigroup’s head of regional debt capital markets. “NBK has been the first bank to take advantage of this. The pricing outcome was exceptional and was a direct outcome of the bid from US investors, who also bought the Kuwait sovereign bond earlier in the year.” Bankers said Oman Electricity Transmission’s $500 million bond deal in May, and a $500 million bond issued by Qatari telecommunications company Ooredoo in 2016, also attracted unusually large demand from foreigners after issues by the firms’ respective governments. NBK’s bond was its debut dollar issue under the 144A format, which lets a non-U. S. issuer tap the US market without registering on a US exchange. To exploit higher US investor demand, more 144A issues are likely to occur in the Gulf, said Usman Ahmed, managing director for investments at Dubai’s Emirates NBD Asset Management. GCC issuers have traditionally favoured five-year bonds but some may start looking at seven or 10 years because foreign investors have more appetite for longer maturities. Apostolos Bantis, head of emerging market credit research at Commerzbank, said the trickle of foreign demand to banks and corporates was a sign of maturity in the GCC market. “The build-up of the GCC sovereign bond curves is opening the ground for more domestic corporates to come to the markets at more favourable funding terms. While historically local GCC investors were the main buyers of Middle East corporate and bank bonds, the trend is changing.” More from Markets Meraas Holding has issued $400m sukuk — sources Non-stop buying in insurance stocks on DFM Volatility boosts DGCX currency volumes Emerging stocks face new era Pakistan’s MSCI dream becomes dull reality Foreign holdings of Egypt debt reach $7.5b Bahrain fund hopes to invest in Aramco IPO Aramco arm hiring staff for Singapore push tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNOman follow this tag on MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGNGulf Cooperation Council follow this tag on MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMarkets tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNOman follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSaudi Arabia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGulf Cooperation Council follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDUBAI follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In MarketsMeraas Holding has issued $400m sukuk — sources Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Greed, panic surrounds Bitcoin traders 02Japan, South Korea drive global bitcoin prices 03Majid Al Futtaim starts work on giant facility Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 2Images China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet takes off May 05, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 International Commodity Prices Error - No Data As on 2017-05-26 01:10:13 Most Popular on Gulf News Our patience has limits, says UAE minister New housemaid rules in UAE: The key points Viral video girl performs for Shaikh Mohammad Fear as Muslim city Marawi burns 6 traffic accidents on first day of Ramadan 30 years apart, girl repeats dad's feat Your guide 2017 UAE holidays Indian grandma in UAE sets world record SRK pranked by Ramez on Ramadan show Close Recommended For You Luxembourg basks in a post-Brexit sunPUBLISHED ON Jun 02, 2017 Master class on economic integrationPUBLISHED ON Jun 02, 2017 Body of boy, 11, found on rooftop in Abu DhabiPUBLISHED ON Jun 01, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Morgan Stanley is about to augment its 16,000 financial advisers with machine-learning algorithms that suggest trades, take over routine tasks and send reminders when your birthday is near. The project, known internally as “next best action,” shows how one of the world’s biggest brokerages aims to upgrade its workforce while a growing number of firms roll out fully automated platforms called robo-advisers. The thinking is that humans with algorithmic assistants will be a better solution for wealthy families than mere software allocating assets for the masses. At Morgan Stanley, algorithms will send employees multiple-choice recommendations based on things like market changes and events in a client’s life, according to Jeff McMillan, chief analytics and data officer for the bank’s wealth-management division. Phone, email and website interactions will be cataloged so machine-learning programs can track and improve their suggestions over time to generate more business with customers, he said. “We’re desperately trying to pattern you and your behavior to delight you with something you may not have even been asking for, but based on what you have been doing, that you might find of value,” McMillan said in an interview. “We’re not trying to sell you, we’re trying to find the things you want and need.” Faced with competition from cheaper automated wealth-management services and higher expectations set by pioneering firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., traditional brokerages are starting to chart out their digital future. It turns out that the best hope human advisers have against robots is to harness the same technologies that threaten their disruption: algorithms combined with big data and machine learning. The idea is that advisers, who typically build relationships with hundreds of clients over decades, face an overwhelming amount of information about markets and the lives of their wealthy wards. New York-based Morgan Stanley is seeking to give humans an edge by prodding them to engage at just the right moments. “Technology can help them understand what’s happening in their book of business and what’s happening with their clients, whether it be considering a mortgage, to dealing with the death of a parent, to buying IBM,” McMillan said. “We take all of that and score them on the benefit that will accrue to the client and the likelihood they will transact.” Morgan Stanley will pilot the program with 500 advisers in July and expects to roll it out to all of them by year-end. Additional high-tech tools are coming: McMillan and others are working on an artificial intelligence assistant -- think Siri for brokers -- that can answer questions by sifting the firm’s mountain of research. (The bank produces 80,000 research reports a year.) The brokerage also is automating paper-heavy processes like wire transfers and creating a digital repository of client documents, such as wills and tax returns. Established advisers tend to be older, so Morgan Stanley is hiring associates to train those who need help. Read more: A QuickTake explains the debate about robo-advisers The technology means that for the first time in decades, the balance of power between financial advisers and their employers may shift. For years, top advisers could command multimillion-dollar bonuses by jumping to a competitor. That slowed to a crawl this year because of regulatory changes, and now the technological push will further the trend, according to Kendra Thompson, a managing director at Accenture Plc. Bonuses Obsolete Backed by a firm’s algorithms, “advisers are going to be part of a value proposition, rather than the service conduit for the industry,” Thompson said. “The cutting of the bonus check, it’s nearly over.” Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Morgan Stanley isn’t swearing off robo-advisers, either. It plans to release one in coming months, along with rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The technology was pioneered by startups Wealthfront Inc. and Betterment LLC and went mainstream at discount brokers Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Robos could have $6.5 trillion under management by 2025, from about $100 billion in 2016, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. An in-house robo-adviser and a learning machine that acquaints itself with rich clients might alarm advisers who plan to keep working for decades. McMillan is adamant that the flesh-and-blood broker will be needed for years to come because the wealthy have complicated financial planning needs that are best met by human experts. “When I talk to financial advisers, they’re always like, ‘Is this going to put me out of business?’” he said. “That’s always the big elephant in the room. I can tell you factually that we are a long ways away from that.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Bad news bears: Bank stocks, among the biggest beneficiaries of Donald Trump's election, are now heading toward bear market territory, "beaten down from their post-election peaks by talk of weak second-quarter trading revenues and fading hopes of a Trump-fueled stimulus," the Financial Times reports. Goldman Sachs, for example, is down 16.5% since its March 3 peak, Wells Fargo is down more than 14%, and Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both off about 12%.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon By Hideyuki Sano | TOKYO TOKYO Global stocks hit a record high on Friday and Asian markets rose to their best levels in more than two years as upbeat data on U.S. manufacturing and employment and buoyant European factory growth boosted investor optimism. The MSCI ACWI .MIWD00000PUS, an index of 46 stock markets in the world, rose 0.2 percent to a record high. It was on track for a gain of 0.6 percent for the week and close to 11 percent for the year to date. European shares were also expected to advance, with spread-betters looking at gains of 0.6-0.7 percent for Germany's DAX .GDAXI, France's CAC .FCHI and Britain's FTSE .FTSE. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS gained 0.6 percent, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 1.6 percent, topping the psychologically important 20,000-point mark and taking the benchmark to its highest level since August 2015. "Market sentiment is very good. The strength in Wall Street shares will be a tailwind for the Nikkei as well," said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Wall Street's volatility index .VIX, which measures implied volatility of stocks and is often seen as investors' fear gauge, fell below 10, near a decade-low touched last month, in another sign of investors' confidence that markets will be stable at least for the time being. The Institute for Supply Management said its barometer of U.S. factory activity edged up to 54.9 last month from 54.8 in April, while ADP reported private payrolls grew by 253,000 last month, beating analysts' median forecast of a 185,000 increase. Those numbers offset weakness in auto sales and set markets up for solid government payroll data due at 1230 GMT. "The U.S. slowdown in the first quarter was due to soft consumption. But consumer spending has started to recover already in March," said Haruka Kazama, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. "Labor market conditions are improving as we can see from yesterday's ADP data, which also supports consumption." Following the latest data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve upgraded its closely-watched GDP Now forecast for April-June growth to a 4.0 percent annualized pace from 3.8 percent. Further signs of solid U.S. growth led traders to almost fully price in the chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. They also supported the outlook for possibly another hike by the year-end, likely in September. That helped the dollar recover in the foreign exchange market, although traders said concerns about U.S. politics could cap its gains. Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. "People may be waiting for the payroll data. Or they may be looking beyond that and want to focus on political instability and next week's testimony," said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale. The dollar JPY= gained 0.3 percent to 111.65 yen, extending its rebound from Wednesday's near two-week low of 110.485 yen. The euro EUR= slipped to $1.1217 from Thursday's high of $1.1257, its highest in more than a week. Europe's manufacturing sector continues to expand at a solid pace. The IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose to 57.0 in May, up from April's 56.7 and its highest level since April 2011. Further signs of recovery could prompt the European Central Bank to sound a little more optimistic on the economy at its June 8 meeting. It could raise its assessment of risks to balanced or begin discussing shift from its bias to ease policy, a Reuters poll of economists showed. Elsewhere in currency markets, the offshore Chinese yuan CNH= eased 0.5 percent after having hit its highest level since October the previous day. The yuan stepped back to 6.7868 to the dollar from Thursday's high of 6.7245. The currency has surged since last week, when Moody's downgraded China's credit rating and Chinese authorities announced they were adjusting the formula used to set the daily yuan midpoint. The latter change has been seen as a signal that China will no longer tolerate much depreciation against the dollar and is setting the currency on a firmer path. Oil prices were dragged down by ongoing concerns over a global glut in crude supply despite a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories. The Brent futures LCOc1 fell 0.5 percent to $50.39 per barrel, near its three-week low of $49.81 set on Wednesday.

Global shares were mixed in trading, Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2015, with only some markets cheered by an overnight rally as investor sentiment grew cautious on lower oil prices. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Updated at 4:25 p.m. NEW YORK • A broad-based push higher for stocks sent indexes to records on Thursday following yet more signs that the job market continues to improve. The Standard & Poor's 500 index pierced the 2,420-point level for the first time during the morning and kept going. It ended at 2,430.06, up 18.26 points, or 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 135.53, or 0.6 percent, to 21,144.18, and the Nasdaq composite rose 48.31, or 0.8 percent, to 6,246.83. All three indexes set record highs. Smaller stocks had even bigger gains, and the small-cap Russell 200 index jumped 25.85, or 1.9 percent, to 1,396.06, though it remains shy of its record. Driving stocks higher was a report indicating that employers picked up their hiring last month. Payroll processor ADP said private businesses added 253,000 jobs in May, more than economists expected. It's a reassurance, particularly when growth of the overall economy has remained frustratingly tepid. The U.S. government's more comprehensive report on jobs, which arrives Friday morning, will include hiring by all non-farm employers. Economists expect it to show growth of 176,000 jobs in May. The data gave yet more encouragement to investors, many of whom were already looking to buy. "The market's ahead of itself, but I'm not surprised that the market is ahead of itself," said Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Investors. Duessel talks often around the country with financial advisers managing money for clients, and many tell her they see any pullback in stock prices as a quick opportunity to buy rather than as a source of concern. That hunger to buy means the S&P 500 has gained within just months what Duessel thought may take a year or so to achieve, given continued economic growth and few signs of a looming recession. "What you have, it would appear, is an acceleration in earnings with a low inflationary environment, which is Goldilocks," Duessel said. President Trump's announcement late in the trading day that the U.S. would withdraw from the worldwide agreement on climate change had little effect on markets. Other reports on the U.S. economy were mixed on Thursday. Manufacturing growth picked up last month and was stronger than economists were expecting, but construction spending unexpectedly weakened in April. A separate report showed that the number of workers filing for unemployment claims rose last week, which could be an indication that layoffs are on the rise. The number remains low by historical standards. The stock market's gains were widespread, and all 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 rose. Health care and financial stocks led the way. Producers of raw materials and companies that sell non-essentials to consumers were also particularly strong. Discount retailer Dollar General jumped to one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after it reported stronger earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its shares climbed $4.80, or 6.5 percent, to $78.19. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area Deere rose $2.24, or 1.8 percent, to $124.70 after it agreed to buy Wirtgen Group, a German maker of road-construction equipment for about 4.6 billion euros, or $5.2 billion, including debt. On the other end was Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which fell to the largest loss in the S&P 500 after it reported quarterly results that disappointed investors. Its shares fell $1.29, or 6.9 percent, to $17.52. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.21 percent. A stronger job market gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to raise interest rates, and its next meeting on rate policy is in two weeks. The central bank has been gradually pulling rates off their record low following the Great Recession, and it has raised them twice since December. The dollar rose to 111.33 Japanese yen from 110.57 yen late Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.1214 from $1.1246, and the British pound dipped to $1.2876 from $1.2892. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 4 cents to settle at $48.36 per barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 13 cents to settle at $50.63 a barrel. Natural gas fell 6 cents to settle at $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.50 per gallon and wholesale gasoline was close to flat at $1.60 per gallon. Gold fell $5.30 to settle at $1,270.10 per ounce, silver dropped 13 cents to $17.28 per ounce and copper added a penny to $2.59 per pound. In overseas markets, France's CAC-40 gained 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 percent and London's FTSE 100 added 0.3 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6 percent, and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent. AP Business Writer Joe McDonald contributed from Beijing.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UWOseA US President Donald Trump ALSO READ Wall Street and euro dip amid political, economic uncertainty Global stocks and dollar rise as investors eye earnings Global stocks touch record high, dollar fall deepens Oil at 3-month lows, global stocks edge up before US rate decision Wall Street hits record highs, dollar rises to 14-year peak Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifting energy company shares, on expectations the United States (US) will withdraw from a global pact to fight climate change, while China's yuan shrugged off weak factory data to hit a seven-month high against the dollar. Bank shares underperformed rising European stocks, after two major US lenders warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, rose off Wednesday's three-week lows in anticipation of the US quitting the Paris accord. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his decision later on Thursday. "If he actually withdraws the US from the climate accord, this would signal his intention to further roll-back emission regulations that would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels, thus giving a much needed boost to oil prices," said Jonathan Chan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. A fall in US crude inventories also supported prices. Brent last traded at $51.39 a barrel, up 64 cents, having touched a low of $50.31 on Wednesday. The wider STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 per cent, led higher by industrials. European manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in more than six years in May, according to a euro zone purchasing managers' index. European bank stocks were flat. Financial sector shares fell on Wall Street on Wednesday after JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent fall in trading revenue and Bank of America said second-quarter trading revenue was on track to be 10-12 per cent down on last year. The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 ended Wednesday at 10.41, its lowest end-month close. Despite a stumble in recent days, especially banks and miners have led global stocks steadily higher since Trump's election in November, limiting the market swings from which traders profit. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 per cent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 per cent after the a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday which suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since November 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 per cent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.7996 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. The Chinese data also hit the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Australia's currency fell 0.2 per cent at $0.7416, having earlier fallen to $40.7384, its weakest since May 12. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.1 per cent to $1.2874 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy, however, GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 per cent. The euro eased 0.1 per cent to $1.1228 while the Japanese yen fell 0.3 per cent to 111.11 per dollar.

On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Home  >   News  >   Market Infrastructure  >   BNY Mellon strengthens repo hold with new subsidiary MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE BNY Mellon strengthens repo hold with new subsidiary BNY Mellon is targeting enhanced capabilities in the US government securities clearance and tri-party markets with a new subsidiary. By Paul Walsh paul.walsh@strategic-i.com June 01, 2017 10:24 AM GMT BNY Mellon has formed a wholly owned subsidiary in a bid to increase efficiency of the US government securities clearance and tri-party repo markets. BNY Mellon Government Securities Services is designed to improve capabilities, governance, transparency and resiliency in the US government securities and US tri-party repo businesses. The move reinforces BNY Mellon’s position as the dominant provider in the repo market following the closure of JP Morgan’s GCF repo settlement division. JP Morgan revealed last July it was pulling back from certain government securities settlement functions for broker-dealers. Brian Ruane, current CEO for broker dealer services at BNY Mellon, will take over as CEO of the subsidiary to lead operations alongside newly appointed president and chief operating officer Andrea Pfenning. "The creation of BNY Mellon Government Securities Services further supports BNY Mellon's long-term track record of investing in this business to deliver continuous improvements in operational and technology resiliency," said Ruane. "This is an important business and a strategic differentiator for BNY Mellon, and with the establishment of BNY Mellon Government Securities Services, we will continue to enhance functionality to meet future client needs." In addition to these appointments, BNY Mellon has appointed three independent directors including former global treasurer and partner of Goldman Sachs Elizabeth Robinson who will act as chair of the board. Former chairman and CEO of FINRA Richard Ketchum has also joined the board along with former US country head for the LSEG David Weisbrod. The BNY Mellon Government Securities Services board of directors will also include Michelle Neal president of BNY Mellon markets and James Wiener, senior executive vice president and chief risk officer. "As the government securities clearing market has evolved, we have continued to invest in technology to increase capacity and enhance services to meet client and market demands,” said Gerald Hassell, chairman and CEO of BNY Mellon. “Our clients are also evolving, and we will continue to develop functionality to meet their changing needs. This subsidiary establishes a governance structure and operating model that will enable expert oversight for this important business."

Bank shares underperformed rising European stocks, after two major US lenders warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Paris accord Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, rose off Wednesday's three-week lows in anticipation of the United States quitting the Paris accord. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his decision later on Thursday. “If he actually withdraws the USfrom the climate accord, this would signal his intention to further roll-back emission regulations that would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels, thus giving a much needed boost to oil prices,” said Jonathan Chan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. A fall in US crude inventories also supported prices. Brent last traded at $51.39 a barrel, up 64 cents, having touched a low of $50.31 on Wednesday. The wider STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 per cent, led higher by industrials. Euro zone PMI European manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in more than six years in May, according to a euro zone purchasing managers' index. European bank stocks were flat. Financial sector shares fell on Wall Street on Wednesday after JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent fall in trading revenue and Bank of America said second-quarter trading revenue was on track to be 10-12 per cent down on last year. The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 ended Wednesday at 10.41, its lowest end-month close. Despite a stumble in recent days, especially banks and miners have led global stocks steadily higher since Trump's election in November, limiting the market swings from which traders profit. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 per cent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 per cent after the a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday which suggested growth remained steady. Yuan strengthens China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since November 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 per cent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. “The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.7996 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. The Chinese data also hit the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Australia's currency fell 0.2 percent at $0.7416, having earlier fallen to $40.7384, its weakest since May 12. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.1 per cent to $1.2874 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour Opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. “This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late,” David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 per cent. The euro eased 0.1 per cent to $1.1228, while the Japanese yen fell 0.3 percent to 111.11 per dollar.

The wider STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 per cent, led higher by industrials. European manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in more than six years in May, according to a euro zone purchasing managers' index. European bank stocks were flat. Financial sector shares fell on Wall Street on Wednesday after JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent fall in trading revenue and Bank of America said second-quarter trading revenue was on track to be 10-12 per cent down on last year. The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 ended Wednesday at 10.41, its lowest end-month close. Despite a stumble in recent days, especially banks and miners have led global stocks steadily higher since Trump's election in November, limiting the market swings from which traders profit. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 per cent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 per cent after the a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday which suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 per cent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.7996 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. The Chinese data also hit the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Australia's currency fell 0.2 per cent at $US0.7416, having earlier fallen to $US40.7384, its weakest since May 12. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.1 per cent to $US1.2874 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 per cent. The euro eased 0.1 per cent to $US1.1228 while the Japanese yen fell 0.3 per cent to 111.11 per dollar. © RAW 2017 United Kingdom Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Advertisement Home Article bonds MIDEAST DEBT-Gulf debt market deepens as foreign money trickles to banks, corporates 01 June, 2017 Mohieddine Kronfol, MENA bonds By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, June 1 (Reuters) - The Gulf's market in international bonds is deepening as foreign investors move beyond sovereign debt to issues from banks and corporations - a shift that could change the way some issuers choose to structure their bonds. Traditionally, foreign investors in Gulf debt have focused almost entirely on sovereign bonds because of their greater safety and liquidity. But a surge of sovereign issuance in the past 12 months, as Gulf governments cover budget deficits caused by low oil prices, is changing that pattern. It has put the region on the map for some foreign institutions, making them boost allocations to the six Gulf Cooperation Council states. Institutions that fail to satisfy their appetite for GCC debt entirely with sovereign bonds look a few notches down the credit rating curve at bank and corporate issuers. Advertisement Meanwhile, expanded sovereign issuance has created a complete yield curve for the region, making it easier for banks and companies to price bonds at levels which a range of investors accept. "This is a market that attracts both investment grade and emerging market investors," said Hani Deaibes, head of Middle East debt capital markets at JPMorgan. "What is happening is that the large issuances from sovereigns have made this market more relevant to investors. This has increased the interest in corporates and banks from the region. There's more understanding of the market." In 2016, GCC bond volumes totalled a record $69 billion, more than double the usual level since the mid-2000s, Thomson Reuters data shows. Over $40 billion has been issued so far this year. Jumbo sovereign deals include Saudi Arabia's $17.5 billion debut international bond last year, the largest issued in emerging markets, plus an $8 billion bond from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's $9 billion international sukuk, or Islamic bond, this year. ALLOCATIONS Allocation statistics for at least one recent Gulf issuer suggest the balance of demand by geography and investor type is changing. A $750 million senior secured bond issued in May by Kuwait's largest commercial lender, National Bank of Kuwait, was mostly bought by U.S.-based investors. Some 57 percent of the paper went to them, followed by Middle East investors with 26 percent, Europe with 13 percent and Asia with 4 percent. By contrast, 43 percent of a $700 million bond issued by NBK in 2015 went to Middle East investors; U.S. buyers took only 2 percent. "From an emerging markets perspective this region has become more relevant, in particular in the U.S., simply by virtue of the sheer volumes issued since last year," said Iman Abdel Khalek, Citigroup's head of regional debt capital markets. "NBK has been the first bank to take advantage of this. The pricing outcome was exceptional and was a direct outcome of the bid from U.S. investors, who also bought the Kuwait sovereign bond earlier in the year." Bankers said Oman Electricity Transmission's $500 million bond deal in May, and a $500 million bond issued by Qatari telecommunications company Ooredoo in 2016, also attracted unusually large demand from foreigners after issues by the firms' respective governments. NBK's bond was its debut dollar issue under the 144A format, which lets a non-U.S. issuer tap the U.S. market without registering on a U.S. exchange. To exploit higher U.S. investor demand, more 144A issues are likely to occur in the Gulf, said Usman Ahmed, managing director for investments at Dubai's Emirates NBD Asset Management. GCC issuers have traditionally favoured five-year bonds but some may start looking at seven or 10 years because foreign investors have more appetite for longer maturities. Apostolos Bantis, head of emerging market credit research at Commerzbank, said the trickle of foreign demand to banks and corporates was a sign of maturity in the GCC market. "The build-up of the GCC sovereign bond curves is opening the ground for more domestic corporates to come to the markets at more favourable funding terms. While historically local GCC investors were the main buyers of Middle East corporate and bank bonds, the trend is changing."

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Oil mixed; global crude glut drags despite big U.S. inventory draw ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Oil mixed; global crude glut drags despite big U.S. inventory draw Published June 01, 2017 Markets Reuters Facebook Twitter Comments Print Oil prices were mixed on Thursday, with Brent crude down on concerns that key producers were still adding to the global crude glut but U.S. crude up slightly after a larger-than-expected domestic inventory drawdown. Continue Reading Below U.S. crude futures <CLc1> settled up 4 cents at $48.36 a barrel, while Brent <LCOc1> ended down 13 cents at $50.63. After settlement, both benchmarks fell, failing to sustain the lift from the morning news of declining U.S. crude and gasoline stocks. "Eight straight weeks of declining crude and the market is barely up," said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The market is telling us that unless we have significant inventory draws, the idea that we’re going to have stronger prices doesn’t look to be realistic.” Weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude inventories dropped 6.4 million barrels, exceeding the 4.4 million-barrel drop forecast. Gasoline inventories also dropped sharply ahead of the start of the summer driving season, the EIA said. [EIA/S] On Wednesday, a Reuters survey found output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in May, the first monthly increase this year, as higher supply from two states exempt from a production-cutting deal, Nigeria and Libya, offset improved compliance with the accord by others.. U.S. production increased, and the expectation is that ongoing activity in U.S. shale will continue to boost output, offsetting OPEC efforts. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT OPEC and other producers, including Russia, have agreed to restrict output by 1.8 million bpd to drain stockpiles that are close to record highs in many parts of the world. U.S. production is closing in on levels from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. It hit 9.34 million bpd last week, highest since August 2015. In Libya, output has recovered to 827,000 bpd after technical problems were resolved at the Sharara field. On Thursday OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said to an economic forum in Russia that it was too early to say when production caps could be imposed on Libya and Nigeria as they have a lot of issues to solve. The group, however, last week discussed cutting output by a further 1 to 1.5 percent, and could revisit the proposal should inventories remain high and continue to weigh on prices, sources said.

Russia, which has cut production by 300,000 bpd under the deal, could increase production next year to as much as 11.07 million bpd, the country's deputy energy minister told Reuters.   (Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson and Ahmad Ghaddar in London, Aaron Sheldrick in Tokyo; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio) What do you think?

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) BEIJING (AP) — Global stock markets were mostly higher Thursday following Wall Street's decline while Chinese stocks fell after a survey showed manufacturing activity weakening. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC-40 gained 0.5 percent to 5,308.60 and Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 percent to 12,660.42. London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 percent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Weekly capital flows data showed Japanese investors bought 732 billion yen ($6.6 billion) of foreign bonds last week, bringing total buying in the past four weeks to 3.696 trillion yen ($33.3 billion). That suggests net buying in May is likely to hit the highest since last July, when they bought 5.449 trillion yen, and signals a major change from heavy selling from December to April. "In the new financial year, investment in foreign bonds is recovering. There will be more buying if the 10-year U.S. bond yields edge near 2.5 percent," said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Last year, Japanese investors piled into foreign bonds, with U.S. Treasuries and French government bonds the most popular because of their liquidity and relatively high yield compared with Japanese and German government bonds. But those investments turned sour. U.S. bond markets tumbled after Donald Trump's win in the U.S. presidential election raised expectations of reflationary stimulus steps, benefitting equities, while French bonds faltered early this year on worries over the outcome of the French presidential election. Selling continued even after the new business year began in April, when investors sold a record 4.256 trillion yen ($37.24 billion) of foreign bonds. Investors appear to be done with selling for now and are likely to rebuild their foreign bond portfolios, market players said. But the pace of buying seems slower than in recent years, said Hiroshi Yokotani, senior vice president of fixed income at AllianceBernstein. "In the past few years, we saw a big amount of buying at the start of the Japanese financial year, but that is absent this year. They have little reason to hurry in buying," he said. Worries about further falls in foreign bond yields and possible rises in currency hedge costs prompted Japanese investors to front-load their purchases in recent years. But both global bond yields and hedging costs are steadier now, giving Japanese investors less reason to buy in haste, he added. Their foray into corporate bonds may slow after massive buying last year, some market players said. U.S. Treasury Department data published in late April showed Japanese investors' holdings of U.S. corporate bonds jumped to a record $187 billion in 2016, after having held steady around $165 billion in the preceding three years. "It's not that everyone is bullish on credit products. Some investors who had been buying corporate bonds last year are taking a wait-and-see stance," said Tetsuaki Kobata, managing director of Citigroup Global Markets. "But the number of investors who buy credit products is clearly increasing at the same time," he said.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Donald Trump has pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Spoiler alert, the coal industry is pretty happy. But apart from that, there has been almost universal criticism from big business. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney boss Robert Iger have quit their advisory positions in the White House as a result. Image copyright Twitter And chief executives have been queuing up - or at least tweeting - to share their views too. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said the withdrawal was "bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk", while fellow dotcom billionaire Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter called the move "an incredibly short-sighted move backwards". So given President Trump's argument that the decision is good for the US economy, why is business - in the US and beyond - so opposed? Here are a few reasons: 1) The change has already happened Long before the Paris deal was signed, many of the world's biggest companies were addressing their impact on the environment and their role in tackling climate change. And in the hours after the announcement, major firms were quick to emphasise that whatever the US's official position on the Paris deal, their own environmental focus would remain. Facebook's Mr Zuckerberg said it would continue with plans to power every new data centre it builds through 100% renewable energy, while Amazon insisted it remained "committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment". Meanwhile Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai said he was "disappointed" and that his firm would "keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all". Even energy firms, whose businesses have depended heavily on oil and fossil fuels, have long been looking to the future, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into researching and developing more sustainable, clean sources of energy. US giants Exxonmobil and Chevron had urged President Trump to stay in the Paris deal. And a tweet from Anglo-Dutch giant Shell said "Our support for the #ParisAgreement is well known. We will continue to do our part providing more & cleaner energy". Image copyright Getty Images 2) The numbers add up Business decisions for the most part come down to dollars and cents, costs and benefits. And while fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal have traditionally been the cheapest form of energy, the cost of harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro and wind has dropped dramatically over the last decade. Granted, they often still receive large government subsidies. But some research shows it can be cheaper than grid electricity and it can even generate savings - so businesses find it increasingly appealing. Walmart, for example, claims it saves $1bn a year by getting a quarter of its power from renewable sources. Former US President Barack Obama summed up this idea in a response to Mr Trump's move, saying: " Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future". "For the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale. "The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created." Image copyright Simon Atkinson - Business 3) Climate change risk Putting aside the financial impact, several business leaders denounced the pull-out of the Paris deal as irresponsible. President Trump's decision was "wrong for our planet" according to Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. Whether you're a tree-hugger, a climate change sceptic or somewhere in between, there is hard and soft data to underscore the financial toll environmental change takes on business and society. That's why companies like Kellogg and General Mills, which depend on the weather to grow grains to make cereals for example, are looking for ways to protect their supply chain. What is climate change? Climate deal is essential, says UN chief Antarctic ice crack takes major turn And they're also mindful that their new and future customers are the millennial generation, which will make up half of the global workforce by 2020. The younger demographic is far more passionate and vocal about social and environmental issues, particularly on social media. What was agreed in Paris? The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. This requires signatories to: Keep global temperatures "well below" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing "climate finance" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy 4) It damages global reputations The Paris deal for the first time united most of the world in a single agreement on climate change. It was signed by 195 countries out of 197 (with only Syria and Nicaragua abstaining) and came into force last November. Image copyright Twitter Almost 150 of those countries has ratified the accord - including the US which is the world's second-largest carbon emitter behind China. So the US backing out now makes the deal far less effective, Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein has described the step as a "setback", not just for the environment but for "the US's leadership position in the world".

Eugene Hoshiko AP Photo Business June 01, 2017 5:21 AM Global stocks mostly higher as China falls By JOE McDONALD AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BEIJING Global stock markets were mostly higher Thursday following Wall Street's decline while Chinese stocks fell after a survey showed manufacturing activity weakening. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC-40 gained 0.5 percent to 5,308.60 and Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 percent to 12,660.42. London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 percent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.

Wall Street was expected to open higher, according to index futures , after the jobs numbers which are likely to feed into the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this month. The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged up 0.3 percent, led higher by industrials and consumer staples companies. Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U.S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Italy's FTSE MIB index was the top gaining national market, up 0.6 percent and fractionally outperforming France's CAC 40. Italy's national statistics bureau said strong domestic demand helped the economy grow 0.4 percent in the first quarter, twice as much as indicated by preliminary data issued last month. The euro zone economy as a whole grew 0.5 percent in the period and, in a further sign of recovery, data on Thursday showed manufacturing grew in May at its fastest rate in six years. Stronger euro zone data has helped push the euro higher against the dollar of late, contributing to the U.S. currency's worst fortnight since March 2016. However, the greenback rose 0.4 percent on Thursday, hitting session highs after data showed the private sector added 253,000 jobs in May, above economists' forecasts. The ADP data comes a day before the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report and a fortnight before the Fed is expected to raise interest rates. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday that suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.8066 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.2 percent to $1.2866 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.1209, having fallen as low as $1.1201 after the ADP data. The Japanese yen was down 0.5 percent to 111.32 per dollar. Oil prices initially rose, lifting off Wednesday's three-week lows, after data showing a big drop in U.S. crude stocks last week, but pared gains as some participants doubted output cuts by OPEC would be enough to rebalance an oversupplied market. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, was down 13 cents at $50.63 a barrel at 1243 GMT. President Donald Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on measures to fight climate change. Phillip Futures' investment analyst Jonathan Chanes said a U.S. withdrawal would signal Trump's intention to further roll back emission regulations. "That would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels," Chanes said.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil rises as trump decides on climate pact, yuan surges Shares0 Thu, 1 Jun 2017-03:04pm , Reuters Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifting energy company shares, on expectations the United States will withdraw from a global pact to fight climate change, while China's yuan shrugged off weak factory data to hit a seven-month high against the dollar. Bank shares underperformed rising European stocks, after two major U.S. lenders warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, rose off Wednesday's three-week lows in anticipation of the United States quitting the Paris accord. President Donald Trump is expected to announce his decision later on Thursday. "If he actually withdraws the U.S from the climate accord, this would signal his intention to further roll-back emission regulations that would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels, thus giving a much needed boost to oil prices," said Jonathan Chan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. A fall in U.S. crude inventories also supported prices. Brent last traded at $51.39 a barrel, up 64 cents, having touched a low of $50.31 on Wednesday. The wider STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 percent, led higher by industrials. European manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in more than six years in May, according to a euro zone purchasing managers' index. European bank stocks were flat. Financial sector shares fell on Wall Street on Wednesday after JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent fall in trading revenue and Bank of America said second-quarter trading revenue was on track to be 10-12 percent down on last year. The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility on the S&P 500 ended Wednesday at 10.41, its lowest end-month close. Despite a stumble in recent days, especially banks and miners have led global stocks steadily higher since Trump's election in November, limiting the market swings from which traders profit. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after the a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday which suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.7996 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. The Chinese data also hit the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. Australia's currency fell 0.2 percent at $0.7416, having earlier fallen to $40.7384, its weakest since May 12. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.1 percent to $1.2874 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of its peers, rose 0.2 percent. The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1228 while the Japanese yen fell 0.3 percent to 111.11 per dollar.

Eugene Hoshiko AP Photo National Business June 01, 2017 5:21 AM Global stocks mostly higher as China falls By JOE McDONALD AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story BEIJING Global stock markets were mostly higher Thursday following Wall Street's decline while Chinese stocks fell after a survey showed manufacturing activity weakening. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC-40 gained 0.5 percent to 5,308.60 and Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 percent to 12,660.42. London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 percent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.

X Green Property optimistic about Irish Brexit opportunities Stephen Vernon-led real estate group betting heavily on logistics for future growth Thu, Jun 1, 2017, 07:55 Charlie Taylor Stephen Vernon was awarded the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Industry award in October         Green Property, the Stephen Vernon-led real estate group that sold the Blanchardstown Centre last year, is continuing to bet heavily on logistics for future growth. It also remains optimistic about Brexit-related opportunities in the commercial property sector following JP Morgan’s recent decision to acquire an office block in Dublin’s docklands in a move that provides the US investment bank with the capacity to double its Irish workforce to 1,000. “We’ve got a very positive backdrop to logistics and I think it is something that will do particularly well in Ireland,” said Mr Vernon, speaking on the fringes of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year chief executives’ retreat, which is taking place in San Francisco this week. The property veteran is chairman of Green Property and director of Green Reit, the latter of which was the first real-estate investment trust listed in Ireland. It owns more than €1.3 billion worth of commercial property with an annual rent roll of €65.1 million. Taoiseach reaffirms pledge to protect North in Brexit talks Brexit art, BA misery and a very British queue Brexit has complicated foreign transfers – Manchester United “Logistics is doing well everywhere on the back of the strength of e-commerce transactions, and the economy has probably reached the point in Ireland where we should be developing our own logistics rather than just piggybacking off the UK,” said Mr Vernon. Large holding Logistics was the strongest-performing real-estate sector in Ireland last year and Green Reit has been investing heavily in the area, buying an additional 164 acres at its Horizon Logistics Park development near Dublin Airport last December to take its holding to 264 acres. Mr Vernon, who was awarded the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Industry award in October, said he also believes the firm and the wider property market in the State will gain as Brexit becomes a reality. “JP Morgan’s decision to expand in Ireland is important because it is a very powerful global leader and their imprimatur on the country as a location for Brexit-related activity will lead other banks and smaller companies in other sectors to consider Dublin,” he said. Green Reit this week signed an agreement with AIB to lease the entirety of its recently completed office building at Central Park in Leopardstown, Dublin. Mr Vernon said the company will shortly make a decision on Block I, an adjacent block that has full planning permission for a further 82,000sq ft over eight storeys. “It has been an exciting year for us in which we sold Blanchardstown, completed One Molesworth Street, and closed down our London office,” said Mr Vernon. “We are making good progress on income on the rest and are well-placed to withstand any possible turbulence that might come our way.”       Topics: Brexit Stephen Vernon AIB Green Property Read More Brexit shows need for Republic to improve cost competitiveness Brexit and solidarity gap cast pall over EU budget for 2018 Ruling on asylum-seeker work to have big impact on Brexit talks Sinn Féin: Britain must not be punished for leaving the EU Brexit: Central Bank reports ‘major increase’ in talks with UK firms Promises about no hard Border ‘illusory’, says Merkel ally Tourism group warns of Brexit hit if Border returns SDLP calls for Border poll on united Ireland after Brexit negotiations Ireland must lose ‘tax avoidance facilitator’ reputation, says O’Neill Legal challenge to Brexit struck out by High Court Britain’s supreme court judgement on exiting the European Union Ireland Beyond Brexit: An Irish Times/Guardian series Brexit: the UK enters the unknown UK prime minister formally notifies EU of Britain’s intention to leave the union.

But for the month, as Fred Katayama reports, the markets gained ground. Video Transcript Financial and energy stocks pulled down the markets on the last trading day of May. JPMorgan and Bank of America warned trading revenue in the current quarter would be weak. A 3 percent drop in oil prices pressured energy stocks. For the month, the major indexes gained ground. Newton Advisors technical analyst Mark Newton. NEWTON ADVISORS PRESIDENT MARK NEWTON, SAYING: "Lot of the yield curve flattening out has really caused financials a great deal of suffering over the last few months. That started in mid-March. With regards to energy, you could really pinpoint the fact that fewer countries seem to be participating in this output cut and so potentially that could be an issue." Michael Kors shares plunged nearly 9 percent. The handbag retailer swung to a quarterly loss, and it said it would close more than 100 full-price stores in a bid to turn itself around. Mylan shares fell 1 percent. The Health and Human Services Department said the government may have overpaid the drugmaker as much as $1.3 billion for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. European shares ended flat. A sharp drop in energy shares offset the rally in utilities. more from equities   Multimedia gallery Crazy World: Australia's odd-shaped rural mailboxes AUDIO How HR managers can help their employees understand Ramadan AUDIO Challenges governments face when implementing economic reform AUDIO How UAE hospitality industry fares during summer months gallery Kabul bombing: Anger builds up as city buries dead VIDEO NBA star LeBron James' property in L.A. vandalized with racial slur Advertisement Most Popular Videos Nokia relaunches classic 'brick' phone in home market Finland 2 days ago - Reuters Videos US Pfizer to buy Allergan in USD60bn deal 23 Nov 2015 - Reuters Videos Thousands take part in traditional cheese-rolling race in rural England 2 days ago - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2017 Zawya.

EARNS-UBER Uber posts $708M loss as revenue grows; finance head quits HONG KONG (AP) — Ride-hailing giant Uber has reported another multibillion dollar loss even as its revenues grow. The San Francisco-based company said Thursday that its losses in the first quarter narrowed to $708 million from $991 million in the previous three-month period. Uber told The Associated Press that it had $3.4 billion in revenue for the period, 18 percent higher than the final three months of last year. The company is not publicly listed but has been mulling an IPO.

PUERTO RICO-ECONOMIC CRISIS Puerto Rico budget unveils tax breaks, protects pensions SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s governor has unveiled a budget that promises tax breaks, sets aside more than $400 million for debt service and guarantees $2 billion in pension payments amid a deep economic crisis. The proposed $9.56 billion budget is more than a half million dollars larger than last year’s. Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Wednesday that for the first time in recent history the budget would be truly balanced. The U.S. territory is struggling to emerge from a 10-year recession that has prompted more than a half million Puerto Ricans to flee to the U.S. mainland. Rossello’s administration is now is in the midst of restructuring a portion of a $73 billion public debt load through a bankruptcy-like process in federal court. CANADA-BOEING Canada’s defense minister threatens Boeing deal in speech TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s defense minister is repeating a threat to cancel the purchase of 18 fighter jets from Boeing Co. because of the company’s trade complaint against Canadian plane maker Bombardier. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Wednesday that Boeing’s action against Bombardier is “unfounded” and “not the behavior of a trusted partner.” He says buying the Super Hornet fighter jets “requires a trusted industry partner.” Sajjan urged Boeing to withdraw the complaint. Canada’s foreign minister has also threatened to block the order. Boeing’s trade complaint prompted a U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping investigation that could result in duties being imposed on Bombardier’s new larger CSeries passenger aircraft. Boeing insists the plane receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. Canada’s threat is coming amid increasing trade disputes with America. KUSHNER-INVESTMENT VISAS Kushners used creative mapmaking to gain visa-tied funds NEW YORK (AP) — The Kushner Cos. engaged in a bit of creative mapmaking to qualify one of its buildings in a booming New Jersey waterfront neighborhood across from Manhattan for a federal visa-for-investment program targeting struggling areas. Emails obtained by The Associated Press show that the family of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner placed its 65 Bay Street building in Jersey City in a map stringing together three dozen other areas, some with high unemployment. The map was included in a 2015 application to the EB-5 visa program that allows overseas investors to obtain temporary U.S. residency in exchange for investments of $500,000 or more in areas with high unemployment. DENVER DRONE DOUGHNUTS Doughnut delivery by drone in Denver is a peek at the future DENVER (AP) — Doughnuts have been delivered by drone to Denver’s mayor and the city’s police and fire departments. The event provided a glimpse into what companies hope will be a quick, inexpensive way to get merchandise to customers. Denver’s LaMar’s Donuts hired Austin, Texas-based company Drone Dispatch to deliver four boxes of doughnuts Wednesday using piloted drones flown from parking lots within a block of the delivery target Wednesday. LaMar’s spokesman Tami Osifodunrin said Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit commercial drone pilots from losing sight of drones. The FAA said in a statement it is investigating to ensure the deliveries followed rules governing commercial drone use in populated areas. Amazon and other companies are testing autonomous drones for deliveries. Drone maker Flirtey last year began limited deliveries for 7-Eleven in Reno, Nevada. JAPAN-ROCKET-GPS Japan launches rocket with satellite to build its own GPS TOKYO (AP) — Japan is building its own GPS in hopes of reducing location errors for drivers, drone operators and other users. A rocket launched Thursday from southern Japan is carrying a satellite that will form part of a Japanese GPS. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plan to launch two more satellites by next spring to complete the system. Japan currently relies on an American GPS. Having its own system is expected to reduce location errors in Japan to a few centimeters (inches) from as much as 10 meters (30 feet) by some estimates. The more accurate information could be used for both driving and drone deliveries. Japanese media report it also may enhance the country’s defense capabilities. WILDERNESS MINE Federal judge overturns approvals for proposed Montana mine HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A federal judge has overturned government agency approvals to develop a copper and silver mine in a Montana wilderness area, saying the decisions violated laws meant to protect threatened grizzly bears, bull trout and their habitat. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy ruled Tuesday the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must reconsider their findings related to the Montanore Mine in Kootenai National Forest. Molloy said it made no sense for the wildlife service to say the project would not harm grizzlies and bull trout. The mine was proposed by Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based Hecla. Company officials have said they spent about $46 million to bring the project into compliance. A public information officer with the Kootenai National Forest said the agency was reviewing the decision and could not yet comment.

(The Canadian Press/Geoff Robins) Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press Published Thursday, June 1, 2017 3:05AM EDT Last Updated Thursday, June 1, 2017 5:21PM EDT TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index racked up a solid three-digit gain Thursday amid higher oil prices and boosts from tech firm BlackBerry Ltd. and Ski-Doo maker BRP Inc. In Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite index advanced 120 points to 15,469.91, as nearly all sectors finished in the black. Two of the biggest gainers were shares of BlackBerry (TSX:BB), which rose nearly eight per cent, and shares of BRP (TSX:DOO), which jumped nearly 13 per cent. BlackBerry stock rose following a report by online stock commentary website Citron Research that identified the company as a likely acquisition target. The Ontario-based former smartphone maker, which recently switched its focus to software, saw its shares climb $1.14 to $15.42 on the TSX. "Our belief was that the restructuring of BlackBerry was never going to lead to BlackBerry becoming a stand-alone, profitable company like they once were," said Kash Pashootan, a senior vice-president and portfolio manager at First Avenue Advisory, a Raymond James company. "Our belief was that the restructuring was simply to get the business packaged and looking the way it should for an acquisition to take place." He said it still remains "highly speculative" if or when a takeover might happen, but investors are buying the stock now on that bet. Meanwhile, shares in BRP climbed $4.17 to $37.03 after the Quebec-based company said it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of eight cents per share starting in July and plans to buy back up to $350 million of its shares by the end of July. South of the border, Wall Street was similarly strong, with all three indices finishing at record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average was ahead 135.53 points to 21,144.18, the S&P 500 index added 18.26 points to 2,430.06, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 48.31 points to 6,246.83. The gains were helped by optimism from a report by payroll processor ADP that saw private companies added 253,000 jobs last month in the United States, more than investors expected. A U.S. government report on jobs is set to be released on Friday, which economists expect to show growth of 176,000 jobs in May. A stronger employment market gives the U.S. Federal Reserve more leeway to raise interest rates, a move that is expected to happen in two weeks when the central bank meets to discuss rate policy. The Fed has already raised rates twice since December. In commodities, the July crude contract rose four cents at US$48.36 per barrel after settling at its lowest price in two weeks on Wednesday, helped by a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that showed crude inventories dropped 6.4 million barrels, more than expected. The Canadian dollar, which often trades in tandem with the direction of oil prices, was unchanged at an average price of 74.07 cents US. Elsewhere, the July natural gas contract was down six cents at US$3.01 per mmBTU, the August gold contract gave back $5.30 to US$1,270.10 an ounce, and the July copper contract gained a penny at US$2.59 a pound.

X Green Property optimistic about Irish Brexit opportunities Stephen Vernon-led real estate group betting heavily on logistics for future growth Thu, Jun 1, 2017, 07:55 Charlie Taylor Stephen Vernon was awarded the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Industry award in October         Green Property, the Stephen Vernon-led real estate group that sold the Blanchardstown Centre last year, is continuing to bet heavily on logistics for future growth. It also remains optimistic about Brexit-related opportunities in the commercial property sector following JP Morgan’s recent decision to acquire an office block in Dublin’s docklands in a move that provides the US investment bank with the capacity to double its Irish workforce to 1,000. “We’ve got a very positive backdrop to logistics and I think it is something that will do particularly well in Ireland,” said Mr Vernon, speaking on the fringes of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year chief executives’ retreat, which is taking place in San Francisco this week. The property veteran is chairman of Green Property and director of Green Reit, the latter of which was the first real-estate investment trust listed in Ireland. It owns more than €1.3 billion worth of commercial property with an annual rent roll of €65.1 million. Taoiseach reaffirms pledge to protect North in Brexit talks Brexit art, BA misery and a very British queue Brexit has complicated foreign transfers – Manchester United “Logistics is doing well everywhere on the back of the strength of e-commerce transactions, and the economy has probably reached the point in Ireland where we should be developing our own logistics rather than just piggybacking off the UK,” said Mr Vernon. Large holding Logistics was the strongest-performing real-estate sector in Ireland last year and Green Reit has been investing heavily in the area, buying an additional 164 acres at its Horizon Logistics Park development near Dublin Airport last December to take its holding to 264 acres. Mr Vernon, who was awarded the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Industry award in October, said he also believes the firm and the wider property market in the State will gain as Brexit becomes a reality. “JP Morgan’s decision to expand in Ireland is important because it is a very powerful global leader and their imprimatur on the country as a location for Brexit-related activity will lead other banks and smaller companies in other sectors to consider Dublin,” he said. Green Reit this week signed an agreement with AIB to lease the entirety of its recently completed office building at Central Park in Leopardstown, Dublin. Mr Vernon said the company will shortly make a decision on Block I, an adjacent block that has full planning permission for a further 82,000sq ft over eight storeys. “It has been an exciting year for us in which we sold Blanchardstown, completed One Molesworth Street, and closed down our London office,” said Mr Vernon. “We are making good progress on income on the rest and are well-placed to withstand any possible turbulence that might come our way.”       Topics: Brexit Stephen Vernon AIB Green Property Read More Brexit shows need for Republic to improve cost competitiveness Brexit and solidarity gap cast pall over EU budget for 2018 Ruling on asylum-seeker work to have big impact on Brexit talks Sinn Féin: Britain must not be punished for leaving the EU Brexit: Central Bank reports ‘major increase’ in talks with UK firms Promises about no hard Border ‘illusory’, says Merkel ally Tourism group warns of Brexit hit if Border returns SDLP calls for Border poll on united Ireland after Brexit negotiations Ireland must lose ‘tax avoidance facilitator’ reputation, says O’Neill Legal challenge to Brexit struck out by High Court Britain’s supreme court judgement on exiting the European Union Ireland Beyond Brexit: An Irish Times/Guardian series Brexit: the UK enters the unknown UK prime minister formally notifies EU of Britain’s intention to leave the union.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) Posted: Wednesday, May 31, 2017 7:08 pm Most Asian stock markets rise after Wall Street loss Associated Press | 0 comments BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while most other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,101.37 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1.1 percent to 19,867.93. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.3 percent to 25,749.34 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.14. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was little-changed at 5,730.90 and India's Sensex also was unchanged at 31,164.38. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 150-nation Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
