SOME': Comments of the week Why banks should consider taking a page from Facebook on security keys search goes here Why the JPM-Intuit partnership is a big step for data sharing By Robert Barba Published January 25 2017, 6:07pm EST More in Bank technology Data and information management Data ownership Data security Data sharing APIs Tax prep software PFM National banks Print Email Reprints Share Share on Jamie Dimon is arguably the most influential bank CEO in the U.S., so his endorsement of data sharing via API is major move within the industry. In his annual letter to shareholders last year, Dimon described his vision for a future where customers would be able to share their data with third parties in a more secured and managed fashion. The partnership the company announced on Wednesday with Intuit to share data over application programming interfaces makes good on that promise, essentially. Is this deal enough to settle the debate over screen scraping, who owns the data and if this conversation is really about security? Probably not, but it certainly helps. “This is the beginning of a long journey,” said Zach Perret, CEO of the financial technology infrastructure provider Plaid. “We see this as Chase saying that this should be an open and inclusive financial ecosystem, and consumers should be able to give access to their data to others and gain value from the broader system.” Perret said his firm has had conversations with JPMorgan, but was not involved in the deal with Intuit. Still, such moves by banks raise the profile for firms such as Plaid or MX — a financial data analytics company that partners with banks and fintechs — that are pushing for the industry to connect via APIs. “I think this is a good step in a series of them to building a strong more inclusive financial ecosystem,” Perret said. “We are excited to see the trend continue.” In a press release, Dimon said the “most important part of this is giving control to the customer.” So, what’s in it for JPMorgan? In some ways, the move speaks to a larger conversation happening within fintech circles about the value proposition to customers and the move away from products. Those types say the future of banking is in the data. “This helps free up this financial data so that people can enrich their lives and could lead to a stronger connection to Chase,” said Ryan Caldwell, the chief executive of MX. “They are playing the long game here and taking care of their customers.” JPMorgan said it would like to partner with other providers of financial management tools, too. “It is undeniable that our customers love to use these apps. Traffic is going up and up each year,” said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan. “If you think about how we’ve described the bank’s relationship to fintech, we’ve taken a ‘build, buy or partner’ model and this is a perfect example of partnering.” In some regards, the move is a safe one for JPMorgan. At 34 years old, Intuit is not exactly a fintech startup. But, as a well-entrenched company, Intuit has a lot of customers that are likely also JPMorgan Chase customers. Mint has 6 million active users — defined as those who’ve logged in once in the last year. QuickBooks Online has 1.6 million users — or 5 million if desktop users are included in the count. TurboTax has 34 million. “They have more joint customers with Intuit than they likely would with a startup,” said Kristin Moyer, a research analyst at Gartner. “They are dealing with the big ones first and will take it from there.” Given that there are thousands of different parties, Moyer said, the industry in the U.S. will eventually need to adopt standards that allow smaller providers to connect to banks. “Using an open standard approach reduces the development and support burden associated with proprietary API approaches,” Moyer said. “Many data formats and flows will remain bank-specific/non-standard, but API standards offer a framework for providing common infrastructure capabilities quickly and less expensively.” There is also the issue of bandwidth on JPMorgan’s servers. The company famously throttled account access to Intuit for several days in October 2015 because of a large volume of requests. In general, APIs should reduce some of the strain. “The API identifies what it needs to pull from Chase and does just that; it is a much more efficient system of bringing in the data,” said Stephen Sharpe, an Intuit spokesman. “It is accurate and secure, and given the pace at which data is being produced, it make sense to do this.” Wexler said the reduced load on the servers is one of the partnership's major benefits. Screen scraping carried out in massive batches “can and has crashed our website before,” she said. “Creating a secured pipe that is push rather than pull is something that is going to benefit us.” Moyer said there are still some risks involved in adopting this way of exchanging information. “They are moving to a new form of sharing data and there are great benefits to it, but there are always new risks, too,” Moyer said. “You’re handling security in different ways. You need different types of talent to support and build them.” In their announcement, the companies said the agreement aligns closely with the Center for Financial Services Innovation’s “Consumer Data Sharing Principles.” One of the principles is reliability. Financial data should be timely, consistent, accurate and complete, according to the principles. The "complete" part of that list is one of the things companies worry about when weighing APIs against screen scraping. APIs might be more secure, but they can also be more restrictive. A third party that may have previously been able to see everything, could be limited to account balances and transactions, not interest paid on loans and annual percentage rates. It’s debatable if some third parties need all of that information, but the key is putting that decision in the hands of the consumer rather than allowing banks to limit data access in the name of security. MX’s Caldwell said his team was encouraged by the bank's citation of the CFSI principles. “It is the thing that struck me as the most important,” Caldwell said. “When we talk about reliability, it means having it all available in a quick manner.” Wexler and Sharpe said customers of JPMorgan and Intuit will see the same information as before.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) NEW YORK — Bank customers who use Chase but also want to take advantage of financial tools like Mint or TurboTax will soon be able to send their data faster and more securely between the two companies. JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person's name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers' financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person's financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers' login information — which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank's online service, which put a strain on the bank's servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn't touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was "extremely concerned" about how much data they were gathering. "When we all readily click 'I agree' online or on our mobile devices ... it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party," Dimon said. USA TODAY JPMorgan pays $55M to settle mortgage discrimination lawsuit The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers' data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers.

The move of assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. is part of BlackRock’s strategy to exact lower fees, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bank said the deal was one of the largest shifts of custody assets ever. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, found a partner in JPMorgan, which has been growing its custody business and now services about $20.5 trillion in assets. The bank has invested in automation technology that helps it offer services more cheaply, said another person with knowledge of the situation. The bank is expected to make tens of millions of dollars in annual fees from the deal. “Many of BlackRock’s clients will experience cost savings through decreased operating expenses at the fund level,” Derek Stein, senior managing director and head of business operations and technology at BlackRock, said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. BlackRock has made no secret that it planned to put more pressure on vendors. President Rob Kapito said in a conference call last year that it would seek concessions as it tries to keep a lid on expenses. Profit Margins JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank chief Daniel Pinto has said he was focusing on the custody business because of its profit margins and steady fees. One priority is improving efficiency through automation technology, he said in a February presentation. That has helped the business generate margins of greater than 25 percent. Pinto said in a Wednesday statement that the deal is a “validation of the investments we’ve made and the resources we’ve added to the custody and fund services business.” The firm said it increased business with existing custody clients by 10 percent over the last 12 months. State Street investors saw the move as a blow. The company’s shares fell 4.3 percent as of 2:50 p.m. in New York, the most since June. This “may be the first inning of a trend of JPMorgan uniquely being able to grab business from the trust banks,” wrote Glenn Schorr, a senior banking analyst at Evercore ISI, in a client e-mail. The average fee rate for custody assets is 1.81 basis points, meaning that the loss to JPMorgan could sap about 3 percent of State Street’s earnings, he wrote. ‘A One-Off’ Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

You will now receive the Pursuits newsletter State Street Chief Executive Officer Jay Hooley said Wednesday that BlackRock approached the Boston-based custody bank as it sought to diversify its custodians. Hooley said that as BlackRock grew into a $5.15 trillion money manager it decided it needed another partner. The shift isn’t indicative of a trend in the industry because most companies are looking to use fewer providers, Hooley said on the company’s earnings conference call. “We appreciated where they were coming from," Hooley said. “It’s a one-off adjustment for BlackRock to get better diversified.” State Street had assets under custody and administration of $28.8 trillion as of the fourth quarter. It said in a presentation Wednesday that it would remain a service provider to BlackRock even after the move. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the largest custody bank, reported $29.9 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Fee Pressure Price competition is fierce among the top players in the industry. Improvements in technology are driving servicing costs lower and customers are demanding those savings be returned to them, Richard Bove, an analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets, said in an interview Wednesday. “It is a significant loss at a time when State Street’s fees are already under pressure,” said Bove. JPMorgan expects to take over administration of the assets during the next two years. Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend securities for institutional investors. They also manage money for individuals and institutions. “Shifts of this size are pretty rare,” Jonathan Watkins, editor of Global Custodian, a London-based publication that covers the industry, said in a telephone interview. “Big managers tend to keep these custody relationships in place for decades.”   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

State Street is the world's No. 2 custody bank with $28.8 trillion in assets under custody and administration, behind Bank of New York Mellon Corp. But the figure could shrink by more than 3 percent after JPMorgan said on Wednesday it was chosen by BlackRock Inc to be custodian for more than $1 trillion in assets being serviced by Boston-based State Street. "We're disappointed," State Street Chief Executive Officer Jay Hooley told Reuters. "But our relationship with BlackRock is still very global and growth oriented" as it continues to service BlackRock iShares exchange-traded fund assets. Hooley said asset managers are consolidating the number of custody providers in a move to lower costs. He said BlackRock is an exception, given that it manages more than $5 trillion in assets, the largest amount held by any financial institution in the world. He said BlackRock wanted to diversify its custody base. "I view it as a kind of one-time recalibration of their service providers," Hooley said. State Street has been BlackRock's custodian since 1988. Over the years, the two companies have grown together on a global scale and been "joined at the hip," as Hooley said on a conference call with analysts and investors. State Street also reported fourth-quarter revenue totaled $2.53 billion, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier. Earnings rose 2 percent to $557 million from $547 million a year ago. Assets under custody and administration declined 1.4 percent in the quarter from $29.18 billion in the third quarter. It will take about 18 months for the BlackRock assets to be moved to JPMorgan's platform. For JPMorgan, the deal is more of a feather in its cap than a windfall to its bottom line. JPMorgan's assets under custody, which it pegged at $20.5 trillion at the end of December, were boosted by about 5 percent. The new business is expected to add tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue, and be included in the company's securities services unit, which last year had about $3.6 billion in revenue. JPMorgan's total reported revenue for the entire company was $95.7 billion in 2016 and net income was $24.7 billion. Still, the deal is the kind of prize sought by Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's chief executive officer for corporate and investment banking. Pinto, speaking to investors in February, named custody and fund services as one of his most important business lines and a focus of management attention "with technology being at the core of it." Executives at State Street, meanwhile, said on a conference call the loss of BlackRock assets is not part of a broader trend. The bank said it won $1.4 trillion in new asset servicing commitments in 2016. The developments unsettled investors. State Street shares tumbled to $74.45 at the opening bell, before recovering some of the lost ground, rising to $77.56, off 3.7 percent.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday January 28, 2017 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode International men of mystery 13 Dec 2012, 2:09 p.m. It was an audacious crime, and its perpetrators may have got away with it – bar for one tiny slip-up.

Bad company: (left to right) Jamie Vincent, Arkadi Drisner and Dallas Fitzgerald. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit They were the Aussie Ocean's Eleven - no guns, no masks, no getaway cars. with the last of the crew behind bars, Kate McClymont details how a group of robbers staged one of history's biggest bank heists - without setting foot in a bank. It's lunch time on Christmas Eve 2003, and last-minute shoppers, jostling and rushing past to get everything done on time, pay scant attention to the two men entering a side door of Telstra's phone exchange in Dalley Street, in the heart of Sydney's CBD. Using his Telstra card to swipe himself through the security door, Barry Osborne, 42, a Telstra linesman, along with Ernst Hufnagl, 52, an underworld figure, confront a spaghetti-like network of phone cables covering a large swathe of the city. Osborne knows exactly what he's looking for. It only takes a matter of minutes for the wiring whiz to hack into cables connecting him to a special phone line at State Street Global Advisers (SSGA), an international financial outfit, housed in a skyscraper across town, that manages billions of dollars. Osborne needs this authorised line to send a fax containing investment instructions to JPMorgan Chase, another banking monolith located only a stone's throw from the Telstra exchange. Once Osborne has hot-wired the line, and he has the two financial giants "talking" to one another, Hufnagl sends a five-page fax through to JPMorgan, purportedly from SSGA, requesting a $150 million transfer from account number 28966, belonging to the superannuation funds of federal public servants. The first page of the fax goes through without a hitch. But when the remaining pages stall, there are several minutes of white-knuckle panic. After multiple failed attempts, and with precious minutes slipping away, the two are forced to switch to a generic Telstra fax line, figuring it will be the number on the title page that counts. Over in a secure room at JPMorgan, a fax machine spits out the first page, then suddenly stops. Although a senior clerk puts in a call to SSGA about the missing pages, this is the day before Christmas, and no one calls back. And sure enough, soon the remaining pages roll out of the machine, full of dollar signs in stark black and white. A $150 million transfer, into four nominated overseas bank accounts. Two of the accounts are with the HSBC bank in Hong Kong: one, for a company registered in the British Virgin Islands used for depositing money into gambling cruises, is to receive $30 million; the other, for a company involved with gambling in Macau, is to get $20.6 million. The third account, in the name of a Richard Kurland at Switzerland's Banque Cantonale Vaudoise, is to receive $26.7 million. The fourth account, in the name of Stylianou Georgios Ltd at Greece's Laiki Bank, is to be injected with $71.9 million. While transfers of this size are hardly unusual in today's globalised banking world, had anyone at JPMorgan bothered to look closely at the names on these four accounts - including those two companies associated with gambling - alarm bells would have rung out loud. Meanwhile, the two swindlers still have their biggest security hurdle to cross - the "confirmation call back". Using the SSGA line that Osborne has hacked into, and posing as Craig Slater, an authorised signatory to the Commonwealth Super account, Hufnagl calls Greg Bourchier, an assistant treasurer at JPMorgan. In his best attempt at impersonating a banker, Hufnagl asks Bourchier, a pudgy, rather nervous man, to complete the "call back" to the designated line at SSGA, confirming that all details in the faxed instruction are correct. Everything appears to be proceeding to plan. The two men are jubilant as they pack up their tool kit and gear. And there is a spring in Hufnagl's step as he walks the short distance to a seedy strip joint on Market Street called Lady Jane's, to report back to his boss, underworld legend "Teflon" Tony Vincent, who has masterminded the operation. In sheer daring, the Vincent plan is in a class with some of the best heist movies ever made - an Australian "Ocean's Eleven", if you like. But for now, all Hufnagl can think about is what he'll do with his cut. Later that afternoon, senior bank staff from JPMorgan return from their festive Christmas lunch, eager to get away on their four-day holiday. Despite noticing that the people from SSGA have mistakenly dated the fax November rather than December, they authorise the release of a colossal $150 million. Within minutes, four overseas bank accounts with next to no money in them - two in Hong Kong, one in Switzerland and one in Greece - are bursting with balances each in the tens of millions. The tiniest of slip-ups It's now late on Christmas Eve 2003, and a posse of topless strippers in stilettos listlessly perform their raunchy routines for a sad throng of lonely, glassy-eyed men. In a private room at the back of the club, crime boss Tony Vincent, a bullet-headed brute of a man in his mid-60s, is nervously moving his blue-tinted glasses up and down the ridge of his nose. Word has come through that the whole sting, for which he had assembled a diverse crew of criminals of different nationalities and skills, and which promises to make them all rich beyond their wildest dreams, is at risk of becoming unstuck by the tiniest of slip-ups. A tiny, three-letter slip-up, to be precise. Some time earlier, when the bank manager of the Laiki Bank in Athens was going through his accounts on Christmas Eve - at that time of year, Greece is nine hours behind Australia - he was astonished to see $71.9 million suddenly deposited into the bank account of Georgios Stylianou, a man of very modest means. And so he called Stylianou personally. "Were you expecting such a sum of money?" he enquired. Stylianou declared he most certainly was. Apologetic, the bank manager explained that the funds could not be cleared because a "Ltd'' appeared beside Stylianou's account name. Stylianou would need to get JPMorgan to remit the funds to the correct account name - minus the offending "Ltd". After hanging up, the bank manager took the added precaution of sending a fax through to JPMorgan, double checking that such a vast sum was really meant for Stylianou's account. Meanwhile, a panicked Stylianou was on the phone to Vincent in Sydney, informing him of the "Ltd" glitch. But Vincent, knowing that the bank staff in Sydney have left for their Christmas break, and will not return until the following Monday, has time to plan a crisis strategy. He and the Ocean's Eleven crew will have five days' grace until the bank will be alerted to any kind of mistake, but it also means they'll have to wait until Monday to send another fax purporting to come from JPMorgan. Sending a fax any earlier may be too risky, as the overseas banks will be suspicious as to why they are receiving a fax from a bank in Australia closed for the Christmas break. Vincent immediately summons three of his loyal lieutenants to a crisis meeting at the strip club, including a man nicknamed "Mr Pink". (In the film Reservoir Dogs, Mr Pink is one of the criminals planning a diamond heist.) Mr Pink is Dallas Fitzgerald, the 22-year-old son of one of the country's scariest men, bikie boss Felix Lyle. Also at hand is Garry Peterson, nicknamed ''Fat Bastard'' by his criminal mates, and Matthew Terreiro, who helped set up the fraudulent Greek bank account. Meanwhile, a bank account in Switzerland that has lain dormant for 10 years with the paltry sum of $90, is suddenly brimming with $26.7 million. The account belongs to Richard Kurland, a 56-year-old South African-born solicitor and fraud investigator who moved to Australia some 20 years earlier and settled in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Some months earlier, Kurland agreed to his Swiss bank account being used by a friend, Leon Kuris, who insisted he was about to receive a great deal of money from an investor. As Kuris was unemployed - and full of crazy get-rich-quick schemes - Kurland assumed it would amount to nothing. So you can imagine his astonishment on Christmas Eve when he receives a call from Kuris asking him whether "the money" has arrived. He gets an even bigger shock when he rings to check his account balance at the Banque Cantonale Vaudoise in Lausanne. A bank staffer confirms that Kurland's account is now bursting with $26.7 million. Kuris hastily explains that the money is from an "investor" named "Dallas O'Hara" (actually Fitzgerald), introduced to him by his old friend Alexandr Roizman. Kuris gives instructions to Kurland that the funds are to be immediately transferred to other accounts across the globe. Because Kurland's account has been dormant for 10 years, and is now awash with money that he immediately wants to transfer, the Swiss bankers want to ask a few questions. To buy time, they tell Kurland that because he wants to transfer such a large sum of money, he'll need to come to Switzerland to do it in person. While Richard Kurland is up for much of the night dealing with the Swiss, and trying to get the money transferred on behalf of his friend, over in Hong Kong other members of the syndicate are busy trying to launder the $30.5 million that has been sent to an account held with HSBC in the name of Hong Kong Power Limited. Kuris's friend Alexandr Roizman, a 48-year-old invalid pensioner rumoured to be ex-KGB, is on his way to Hong Kong to spend the night on a gambling ship. This is money laundering at its most basic. Gamblers deposit money into their account before the ship sets sail. Once on board, these funds are issued as gambling chips. At the end of the cruise the gambler's funds are returned by way of a receipt, which can be easily converted into untraceable cash in Macau the following morning. On the night of December 29, having previously sailed rich American tourists around the Caribbean, the Captain Omar III is about to embark on its maiden voyage as an ocean-going gambling den. By the time the ship sets sail at 8.30 that evening, the penniless Roizman has the astronomical sum of $30.5 million sitting in his gambling account. Gambling with him on this night is a friend from Sydney, 37-year-old Jian Ping Wang, who was a public relations liaison officer at a casino in Macau, before coming to Sydney to work as a cook. Roizman and Wang have to wait 1 1/2 hours - until the ship gets into international waters - before the gambling begins in earnest. Roizman sips some of the fine cognac on offer and wolfs down food from the generous buffet. He pops his head into the mahjong room on deck 5, looks through the duty-free shops and whiles away some time watching a lame Las Vegas-style show in the bordello-red lounge room. Unlike Roizman, Wang, a professional gambler, isn't fazed by the croupier's rapid-fire hand movements as she flicks the cards onto the green felt table. For hour after hour the pair gamble at baccarat. As dawn is breaking over the calm expanse of the South China Sea, the pair have lost a colossal sum - more than $3.4 million. But they don't care. The receipt for the rest of their money is in excess of $27 million. As the Captain Omar III is cashless, all they have to do now is redeem their receipt at the famed Casino Lisboa in Macau. The ship makes its way back to the Ocean Terminal in Hong Kong, at the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula. Although it's still early, the wharf, flanked by an enormous modern shopping centre, is already busy. With his dark hair parted in the middle and tied back in a pony-tail, Dallas Fitzgerald stands waiting. He has a million and more reasons to be pumped with adrenalin, but the young man maintains his trademark inscrutability. Armed with a receipt entitling them to collect $27 million, the trio catch a high-speed ferry for Macau, known as the Monte Carlo of the Orient, where the huge Stanley Ho-owned Casino Lisboa is located. They are about to be rewarded with the mother of all Christmases. Any residual Christmas cheer among JPMorgan staff swiftly evaporates when they return to work on Monday, December 29. First, there's the fax from Laiki Bank querying the multimillion-dollar deposit into Stylianou's account. Then the JPMorgan people responsible for the Commonwealth Super fund are aghast when they discover account 28966 is catastrophically overdrawn. There are ashen faces all around as they trace the $150 million back into four overseas accounts, now converted into Hong Kong dollars, Swiss francs and euros. The treasury staff ring Craig Slater, from SSGA, an authorised signatory to the Commonwealth Super account. When Slater says he doesn't know what they're talking about, there is rising panic at JPMorgan and they forward him the fax. To their horror, he swiftly declares it to be a forgery. The two financial institutions then check their phone records. JPMorgan has a recording of the call which Hufnagl, posing as Slater, made to Bourchier. But at their end, SSGA has no such recording. Clearly the voice is not Slater's. And JPMorgan has no record of a ''call back'' from their office to SSGA. Facing the potential embarrassment of being the victim of Australia's most audacious bank fraud, JPMorgan immediately contacts the foreign banks and puts a temporary freeze on the four accounts while the bank obtains the necessary court orders. Not long after, police from the nearest station, The Rocks, arrive. While JPMorgan and SSGA engage in a series of crisis meetings, the Ocean's Eleven syndicate is also busy. Osborne and Hufnagl are back at the Dalley Street exchange armed with a bodgied-up letter on JPMorgan letterhead to correct the ''Ltd'' mistake on Stylianou's account. But it's too late. The account has been frozen by the bank. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald, Roizman and Wang are making their early-morning dash to Macau, the pulsating neon-lit gambling mecca, their destination the once-grand Casino Lisboa. But when Roizman presents the receipt to withdraw the $27.4 million, the trio are informed the account has been frozen. Fitzgerald demands that the cashier try again. The answer is the same. Fitzgerald immediately jumps on a ferry back across Victoria Harbour to Hong Kong's business district, where he attempts to withdraw funds from the other Hong Kong account used in the sting. But to his dismay it, too, has been frozen. A series of tense phone calls ensues between Fitzgerald and Jamie Vincent - Tony's son - back in Sydney. The normally taciturn Fitzgerald is beside himself. He screams down the phone complaining that the money can't be accessed and that he is surrounded by "a bunch of angry f...ing Chinamen". Minutes later, sounding deflated, Jamie rings back to say it is "all kind of f...ed". The Ocean's Eleven sting is dead in the water. Organised crime's dark heart A fortnight passes, and as the mammoth, meticulous scale of the bank heist becomes more and more apparent, the Australian Federal Police is called in. The team leader assigned to the investigation, which becomes known as Operation Riparian, is Brad Kirwan, a fresh-faced 33-year-old, who has only been with the AFP for two years, after 14 years of service in remote outback communities and a stint as a detective on the Gold Coast. His deputy is Scott Miller, a tall 36-year-old, who worked in customer service for Telstra for 13 years and the finance sector until a mid-life crisis of sorts propelled him to join the police. As fate would have it, Miller's background will be a perfect fit for the investigation. But at this point both men are not to know that this case will take over their lives for the next two years, leading them into the dark heart of organised crime in Australia. The task for the pair of relative ''newbies'' is daunting. Their main leads are a fax, which was sent from the Telstra exchange, and an unknown voice purporting to be SSGA's Craig Slater's saying, ''How are you going, mate? ... Not too bad" as he confirmed the instructions regarding the transfer of the $150 million. Identifying that mysterious voice would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. The investigation has two distinct arms: the actual fraud and the laundering of the money once it had been stolen. Kirwan and Miller slog away for more than a month before their first breakthrough: JPMorgan's treasury officer. Greg Bourchier took the call from the fraudsters, and JPMorgan phone records indicate that he didn't make the compulsory ''call back'' to SSGA. When police trawl through his personal phone records, they discover an intriguing connection - and start joining the criminal dots. Bourchier is a family friend of Garry Peterson, the former secretary-manager of Newtown RSL club in Sydney. Peterson is the ''Fat Bastard'' on phone intercepts for another investigation under way, into illegal drug activity - Strike Force Westbank. Peterson is a close associate of both Dallas Fitzgerald and Tony Vincent. For the past 18 months, members of Tony Vincent's criminal network have been the subject of a covert joint investigation by the NSW Crime Commission and the NSW police who suspect the group of being involved in large-scale drug distribution and money laundering. As it turns out, on December 24, 2003, undercover police attached to Strike Force Westbank were at their posts watching and listening to Vincent and his crew, although they had no idea about the bank heist. They interpreted the panicked talk of cash transfers as referring to the importation of drugs. After listening to hundreds of hours of telephone intercepts of Vincent's crew, Kirwan and Miller hit the jackpot. There - on a call to Peterson - they listen to a voice saying, ''How are you going, mate? ... Not too bad." It is Ernst Hufnagl. More intercepted calls confirm that the phrase is Hufnagl's trademark ''phone tic''. They now have the man who rang Bourchier at JPMorgan the previous Christmas Eve pretending to be Craig Slater. Hufnagl's phone records provide their next major breakthrough. As they match up all the numbers Hufnagl has phoned, they stumble across the number of Barry Osborne. ''Hey, that's the Telstra guy!'' Miller calls out excitedly to his colleagues. The Telstra phone exchange just around the corner from JPMorgan was one of the first ports of call for the police. Although he had never worked as a Telstra technician, Miller's time with the organisation makes him familiar with how phone lines worked, and he revisits the Dalley Street exchange line to determine just how a fax could have been sent from there. That's when he makes another discovery: Osborne's use of his Telstra swipe card to come in the side door. The exchange was being renovated at the time, so if the linesman had bothered to use the front door, there would have been no record of him in the building that day. Mysterious figure As the police team of 14 sift through material, they discover that Osborne didn't work at the Dalley Street exchange, and on December 24, 2003 he was on a rostered day off from the Waverley depot, where he normally worked. Using the surveillance and intercept material from Strike Force Westbank, Kirwan and Miller are able to reconstruct the key movements of the gang leading up to the bank heist. And as they trawl back over surveillance records, they discover customs have secretly copied the contents of a bag owned by a mysterious figure suspected of being an international drug trafficker. Arkadi Drisner, an Israeli citizen who is on Interpol's intelligence reports, but has no convictions, first turned up on intercepted calls on Tony Vincent's phone in May 2003. In September of that year, customs officers at Sydney airport searched Drisner's luggage and copied everything they could find. Among the documents in his bags were faxes on JPMorgan letterhead relating to foreign-currency bank accounts. There were also handwritten notes about how to transfer money around the world. The notes also had some dates identifying public holidays in Australia and overseas. When Kirwan checks the handwriting on these faxes, he identifies it as that of the strangely anxious Bourchier - he has found the insider at JPMorgan. Then another big break: they obtain footage from an earlier search, on a drug-related matter, of Dallas Fitzgerald's inner-city apartment. Fitzgerald has JPMorgan documents lying on a table, again with Bourchier's handwriting plastered all over them. In August 2005, after 20 months of a painstaking investigation that has led them through a maze of international money laundering and local mob activity involving drugs and sex parlours, Kirwan and Miller have amassed enough evidence to get the Feds to swoop. By this time, however, many of the Ocean's Eleven crew are already in jail for unrelated offences. If there is any lingering doubt about the sheer cunning and bold planning of the whole Ocean's Eleven sting, it's swiftly dismissed by police following the first wave of arrests. Sitting in a paddy wagon are Osborne and Hufnagl, who although plainly anxious about what lies ahead for them in criminal charges, manage to swap some friendly small talk. Opposite them sits a clearly agitated man, the bank insider Bourchier. The pair have no idea who this frightened man is. What happened to the “Ocean’s Eleven” ■ ''Teflon'' Tony Vincent was already doing a six-year-stretch for drug supply when he was charged with the Ocean's Eleven offences. He was given a three-year sentence, which he served at the same time as his drug matter. ■ Dallas Fitzgerald, who told the jury he was called "Mr Pink" because this was his favourite colour, received a three-year sentence in November last year for his role in the money-laundering aspect of the heist. ■ Alexandr Roizman was sentenced to a five-and-a-half-year minimum sentence in February 2010 for dealing in the proceeds of crime. ■ Gregory James Bourchier, the JPMorgan insider, was given a two-and-a-half-year minimum jail sentence in 2008. ■ Jamie Vincent was jailed for 20 months in 2010. He had only been out of jail for a short time, having already served five years over drug offences. ■ Barry Osborne Ernst Hufnagl received minimum jail terms of three years in 2008. ■ Matthew Terreiro was arrested for his part in organising the Greek bank account. The charges against him were dropped in April 2009. ■ Jian Hua Chen, a well-known gambler at Sydney's Star casino, received a three-and-a-half-year sentence for helping to set up one of the Hong Kong accounts. ■ Jian Ping Wang, who along with Roizman gambled away $3.4 million on the Captain Omar III, received a six-and-a-half-year jail sentence in 2010. ■ Richard Kurland, who had the dormant Swiss bank account, had charges dropped after the court ruled he didn't know the funds were from the proceeds of crime. ■ Leon Kuris also had charges dropped on the basis he did not know the funds were derived from fraudulent activity. ■ Arkadi Drisner flew out of Sydney on Christmas Day 2003, the day after the fraud. He hasn't been seen since.

Boston-based State Street is the world's No. 2 custody bank with $28.8 trillion in assets under custody and administration. But that figure could shrink more than 3 percent after JPMorgan announced on Wednesday that it was chosen by BlackRock Inc to be custodian for more than $1 trillion in assets. The announcement came as State Street reported total revenue of $2.53 billion in the fourth quarter, a 3.4 percent decline from the year-earlier period. State Street shares tumbled to $74.46 at the opening bell, a 7.5 percent drop from Tuesday's close of $80.52. But the stock recovered some of that lost ground, rising to $77.48.

The companies will use technology that will allow customers to authorize Chase to electronically share financial data securely with Intuit’s financial management applications, such as Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online. Both Chase and Intuit continue to pursue similar agreements with other industry players seeking to give customers more control of their financial information while enhancing security. Chase and Intuit will use a business-to-business, data-sharing connection called an application-programming interface (API) to download the information quickly and safely. It uses a token to authorize Intuit to download the requested account information on behalf of the customer without requiring customers to give Intuit their Chase user name and password. “The most important part of this is giving control to the customer,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. “Customers will get to decide what they want to share and when they want to share it – without having to hand over their password.” “We’re pleased to deliver a great experience for our shared consumer and small-business customers,” said Brad Smith, Intuit’s Chairman and CEO. “Intuit products, such as Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online, provide tens of millions of people with a complete picture of their finances, so that they can make informed decisions for themselves or their business.” The Chase-Intuit agreement embodies five core attributes: Security: Customers will give explicit consent to share their data with Intuit. Once authorized, Chase will provide a secure token to Intuit to access customer data. Convenience: Chase customers will see their banking information safely populated into the Intuit applications quickly. Customer control: Customers will give explicit consent for Intuit applications to use specific account information, and will be able to turn on and off access for Intuit applications. Privacy: Chase and Intuit will strive to maintain industry best practices for data privacy and security. No data reselling: Consistent with its Data Stewardship Principles, Intuit won’t sell customer data to third parties. Routing the data traffic through the secure API will provide information directly to the Intuit applications while freeing up server capacity on Chase’s website. That will improve the experience on both sites for the companies’ joint customers. This new agreement aligns closely with the Center for Financial Services Innovation’s “Consumer Data Sharing Principles,” released in October 2016. These principles create a roadmap for secure collaboration between the financial services and technology industries to help consumers manage their financial lives and improve financial health. As part of ongoing enhancements, the companies will introduce Open Authentication, and will exchange data through the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) 2.2 API. The functionality will be delivered in phases, starting with new Mint users. “In partnership with Intuit, we’re launching a fast, simple and secure method for customers to selectively share their data,” said Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer & Community Banking at Chase. “We encourage all financial institutions, aggregators and application service providers to join us in helping consumers and businesses use technology tools to understand their financial lives, identify new needs and make better decisions about their money. “We will continue to pursue technology and industry advancements that place consumers and businesses at the center, allowing them to control who has access to their financial information in a way that prioritizes ease of use and transparency for all,” he said.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Credit Suisse Group have given price data to the startup, New York-based Vista Capital Advisors, which rolled out the latest version of its pilot initiative this month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Vista has been working on the project for the past few years with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. The firm plans to use that data to create indexes of mortgage securities, which in turn would become the basis for the derivatives, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Those three banks may not ultimately participate in writing the eventual derivatives, the person said. Representatives for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Credit Suisse declined to comment. The derivatives would work much like ones created in the run-up to the U.S. housing crisis. Those products, known as the ABX indexes, were blamed for amplifying risks as big traders like American International Group wagered that subprime mortgage bonds would perform fine. After losses surged and the government had to bail out the financial system, demand for ABX bets faded. The new derivatives, however, would be tied to higher-quality mortgages that are less likely to default. The indexes Vista is building are linked to mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac known as "credit-risk transfer" securities, which force investors to bear losses when borrowers default on their loans, said Richard MacWilliams, Vista's co-founder. The underlying loans are safer, but the bonds are still riskier for their owners than standard Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds, which are fully supported by the government. Derivatives linked to these notes could be a test for how open investors are to new mortgage products a decade after the financial crisis. Fund managers in recent years have shown some signs of being willing to re-embrace risky securities and derivatives tied to home loans, such as subprime mortgage bonds. But these markets are still a fraction of their size pre-crisis. Vista Capital, which calls itself a "financial products innovation company," has some high-profile backers, including: • David Booth, co-founder and co-chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors; • John Reed, former chairman of Citigroup; and • Robert Merton, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work on the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options. Vista was previously known as eBond Advisors. To be successful, derivatives linked to the indexes would have to help major banks manage their capital requirements, said Mike Edman, a former Morgan Stanley executive who helped invent credit derivatives on subprime mortgage bonds. "At a high level, it can make sense, but it seems regulatory capital is what the big banks focus on most," Edman said. » Next page...

GOP lobbying and public affairs firm CGCN added Juliane Sullivan, previously staff director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee under former Chairman John Kline (R., Minn.), as its 10th partner. The firm has doubled in the past two years. On the Education and Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care and labor, Sullivan helped pass a major pension reform bill and a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law. Sullivan previously worked as a senior policy adviser at Akin Gump and as policy director to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas). “Juliane has a tremendous track record of success, working both on and off the Hill,” Kline said. “I chose her to be staff director at the Education and the Workforce Committee because she is hard-working, smart, tough, fair and well-liked. On the Committee, she navigated choppy political waters to enact policies that are good for American workers, families and children. She will make CGCN better, and they’re already pretty darn good.” — The firm just landed Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. — Microsoft dropped Bloom Strategic Counsel and Subject Matter, while Amazon tapped Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck to focus on “issues related to taxes, trade, telecommunications, and technology,” Tony Romm reports for POLITICO Pro. ‘TONE DEAF’: PhRMA’s multimillion-dollar five-year advertising campaign titled “Go Boldly,” which is “designed to get people excited about the science” and push back on the industry’s image as price gougers, is falling flat with lawmakers, drug pricing critics and policy wonks, Sarah Karlin-Smith reports for POLITICO Pro. “This is [PhRMA] trying to change the subject and to try and divert people’s attention away from drug pricing,” said Rodney Whitlock, former health policy adviser to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) of ML Strategies, who lobbies and speaks on behalf of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing. LAWYERS ALERT: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals banned paid line standers.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 24, 2017 at 8:28AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Given how challenging things have been for banks over the past decade, it's easy to forget just how much money they earn. But while all four of the nation's biggest banks rank among the most profitable companies in the country based on their bottom lines, there's one bank that earns more than the others: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). In 2016, JPMorgan Chase earned an astounding $22.6 billion in net income applicable to common stockholders. I'll be the first to admit that adjectives like "astounding" are overused, but it's an appropriate choice of words here. You can get a sense for how much this is by comparing it to the net income of the three other multitrillion-dollar banks: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C): Wells Fargo ranked second, with 2016 earnings of $20.4 billion. Bank of America ranked third at $16.2 billion. Citigroup ranked fourth at $14.9 billion. And it's not just that JPMorgan Chase earns more on an absolute basis, which isn't a huge surprise given that it is the biggest bank by assets. JPMorgan Chase is also the most profitable when you normalize for the size of these banks' balance sheets. You do this by dividing a bank's net income applicable to common stockholders (net income less dividends on preferred stock) by its tangible common equity. This shows how much profit a bank squeezes out of every dollar's worth of high-quality capital on its balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan Chase's return on average tangible common equity came out to 13.9%. That handily exceeds the 10% mark that analysts and investors cite as the threshold between creating and destroying value after factoring in an investor's opportunity cost of not stashing their money elsewhere. Here's how that compared to its peers: Wells Fargo came in second, with a return on average tangible common equity of 13.2%. Bank of America was third at 8.7%. Citigroup was fourth at 8%. This is an impressive feat for a number of reasons. But most of all because it means that JPMorgan Chase has, at least temporarily, eclipsed Wells Fargo as the most profitable big bank in the country. There's no question that JPMorgan was helped in this regard by Wells Fargo's troubles over the past year. It was revealed in September that the California-based bank had opened up millions of fake accounts for customers in order to boost its cross-sell ratio. And soon thereafter, the Federal Reserve announced that Wells Fargo would be subjected to additional regulatory scrutiny after its living will failed to live up to regulators' expectations. Yet, Wells Fargo's missteps shouldn't take away from JPMorgan Chase's own efforts. Given that interest rates are finally on the rise, the New York-based bank's bargain basement acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008 are finally beginning to materialize in a much more meaningful way. JPMorgan's stock isn't cheap, but it could very well end up being one of the bank industry's biggest winners this year. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

JPMorgan Chase agreed Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disputes with more financial data companies. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Bank customers who use Chase but also want to take advantage of financial tools like Mint or TurboTax will soon be able to send their data faster and more securely between the two companies. JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person's name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers' financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person's financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers' login information — which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank's online service, which put a strain on the bank's servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn't touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was "extremely concerned" about how much data they were gathering. "When we all readily click 'I agree' online or on our mobile devices ... it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party," Dimon said. The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers' data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church A Trump supporter was charged with voting twice.

NEW YORK >> Bank customers who use Chase but also want to take advantage of financial tools like Mint or TurboTax will soon be able to send their data faster and more securely between the two companies. JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person’s name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers’ financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person’s financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers’ login information — which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank’s online service, which put a strain on the bank’s servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn’t touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was “extremely concerned” about how much data they were gathering. “When we all readily click ‘I agree’ online or on our mobile devices … it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party,” Dimon said. The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers’ data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers.

JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person's name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers' financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person's financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers' login information — which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank's online service, which put a strain on the bank's servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn't touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was "extremely concerned" about how much data they were gathering. "When we all readily click 'I agree' online or on our mobile devices ... it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party," Dimon said. The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers' data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers. _____ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

 JPMorgan just landed a $1 trillion win in a growing business Prashanth Perumal Jan. 25, 2017, 12:36 PM 11,050 facebook linkedin twitter email print Daniel Pinto, the CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.JPMorgan State Street's pain has turned out to be JPMorgan's gain. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, announced that it would move over $1 trillion of its assets from the custody of State Street to its rival JPMorgan to cut costs for clients. JPMorgan said it expected to take charge of BlackRock's assets over the next two years. "We think the transfer was triggered by a better overall value proposition from JPMorgan for both Blackrock's clients and Blackrock corporate, which includes both pricing and client service," Credit Suisse said in a note responding to the news. The bank has been working on growing its Custody & Fund Services business, and the BlackRock deal provides a huge boost to these efforts. Custody involves things like settlement, safekeeping and asset servicing of securities, and accounting and administration services for funds. "This historic deal expands our relationship with BlackRock and is a validation of the investments we've made and the resources we've added to the custody and fund services business," Daniel Pinto, the CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, said in a press release on Wednesday. JPMorgan's business with existing custody-services clients has grown by 10% in the past 12 months, and 95% of its clients also use the bank's investment banking or markets business. The unit enjoys a healthy operating margin of about 25%. J.P.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:50 PM, January 25, 2017 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Intuit Inc <INTU.O> said on Wednesday they had reached an agreement to allow the bank's customers to quickly put account information into Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online financial management applications without turning over user names and bank passwords. The agreement "aligns closely" with a set of consumer data-sharing principles announced in October by the industry through the Center for Financial Services Innovation, the companies said in a statement. It appears to resolve a conflict between the companies over how to allow customers to use their account information as they like without increasing the risk of someone fraudulently getting into their accounts. Under the plan, JPMorgan customers will give explicit consent to share their data with Intuit while the bank will provide a token, or unique key, to Intuit to access the data, the statement said. The arrangement is a step toward allowing individuals to use their mobile phones to track details of their day-to-day spending habits, which some experts believe could help some individuals save more money. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and Intuit offers some of the most widely established personal financial management tools. The companies said they will each pursue similar agreements with others in the industry. The Center for Financial Services Innovation is funded by financial industry companies and charitable foundations.

The data access debate is about to get a lot more interesting BankThink One-off data-sharing deals aren't enough Slideshow 'Some bankers. SOME': Comments of the week search goes here JPMorgan Chase and Intuit partner to share data via API By Mary Wisniewski Published January 25 2017, 10:14am EST More in Bank technology Data and information management Data ownership Data sharing Data security APIs Tax prep software PFM National banks JPMorgan Chase Print Email Reprints Share Share on JPMorgan Chase is making it easier — and more secure — to share data on digital apps like Mint and QuickBooks. On Wednesday, the New York company and Intuit announced they have formed a partnership to make sharing financial data easier and safer through an application programming interface. The companies said they will introduce Open Authentication and will exchange data through the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) 2.2 API. The functionality, which will be delivered in phases, is an alternative to screen scraping, a practice that requires sharing usernames and passwords with third-party apps and one that Chase’s top execs have condemned in the past. Instead, the new model will use a token to authorize Intuit to download the requested financial data. “Customers will get to decide what they want to share and when they want to share it – without having to hand over their password,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon about the company’s partnership with Intuit that uses APIs rather than screen scraping. Bloomberg News “The most important part of this is giving control to the customer,” JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in the press release. “Customers will get to decide what they want to share and when they want to share it – without having to hand over their password.” Finding alternatives to screen scraping has long been a discussion in the industry. Wells Fargo, for instance, made a splash last year when the San Francisco bank announced it created an application programming interface so small businesses can have their bank account data poured directly into the accounting software provided by Xero. In his annual letter to shareholders last year, Dimon expressed his support for third parties and the bank to connect via API rather than screen scraping. "In the future," Dimon wrote in the April 2016 letter, "instead of giving a third party unlimited access to information in any bank account, we hope to build systems that allow us to 'push' information — and only that information agreed to by the customer — to that third party." The subject of data access has been getting much more attention in recent months. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking a request for information on consumer access to data records, and the agency’s director has been vocal about warning banks not to limit access to data. The Chase-Intuit partnership is not exclusive; the companies said they continue to pursue similar agreements. Mary Wisniewski Mary is the deputy editor of the BankThink blog.

Morgan to become custodian for $1 trillion in BlackRock assets By Emily Glazer Published: Jan 25, 2017 9:31 a.m. ET Share Move elevates bank to No. 2 player in the custodial business, after Bank of New York Mellon Reuters By EmilyGlazer J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. struck a deal to be the custodian for more than $1 trillion of BlackRock Inc.’s assets, poaching the business from State Street Corp., the companies confirmed Wednesday. J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.21%  will spend around two years bringing the assets into its existing $20.5 trillion platform, the bank said. That may elevate the New York bank to the No. 2 player in the business, second to Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, +0.00% which has about $28 trillion assets under custody, according to recent company filings. Opinion Journal: The Fed’s Power Vacuum (3:58) Money Strong President Danielle DiMartino Booth on why President Trump should move quickly to fill vacant positions at the central bank. Photo: Getty State Street’s STT, -0.76%   assets under custody were $21.7 trillion as of Wednesday when it reported fourth-quarter earnings, though it is unclear if the change was reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. State Street noted in an earnings slide presentation Wednesday that BLK, -1.15%  ad moved some of its assets “as a result of a decision to diversify service providers,” but remains a client of the bank. J.P. Morgan is likely to garner roughly tens of millions of dollars in annual fees in one of the largest-ever custody deals. The sticky business is becoming rare in banking where firms have been cutting costs to boost revenues in a low-interest-rate environment.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By David Henry | NEW YORK NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Intuit Inc (INTU.O) said on Wednesday they had reached an agreement to allow the bank's customers to quickly put account information into Mint, TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online financial management applications without turning over user names and bank passwords. The agreement "aligns closely" with a set of consumer data-sharing principles announced in October by the industry through the Center for Financial Services Innovation, the companies said in a statement. It appears to resolve a conflict between the companies over how to allow customers to use their account information as they like without increasing the risk of someone fraudulently getting into their accounts. Under the plan, JPMorgan customers will give explicit consent to share their data with Intuit while the bank will provide a token, or unique key, to Intuit to access the data, the statement said. The arrangement is a step toward allowing individuals to use their mobile phones to track details of their day-to-day spending habits, which some experts believe could help some individuals save more money. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and Intuit offers some of the most widely established personal financial management tools. The companies said they will each pursue similar agreements with others in the industry. The Center for Financial Services Innovation is funded by financial industry companies and charitable foundations.

Ogg January 25, 2017 8:55 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks rallied on Tuesday and were indicated higher on Wednesday. In fact, the Boeing report may even help the Dow challenge the elusive 20,000 mark on Wednesday. Despite the bull market being almost eight years old, investors are still willing to buy the pullbacks, and they are still looking for new and overlooked opportunities. Regardless of the start of 2017, there is still a path to DJIA 21,422 in late 2017 or early 2018. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, while some others cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Most of the following analyst calls include some color, and Thomson Reuters was used for consensus analyst price target data. Oddly enough, none of Tuesday’s Keystone pipeline winners were in the upgrades and downgrades. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, January 25, 2017: Alcoa Corp.

AK Steel has a 52-week trading range of $1.85 to $11.39, and it had a consensus analyst target price of $10.14. CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL) was raised to Hold at Jefferies, and the target price was raised to $26 from $20 (versus a $25.57 prior close). The Level 3 acquisition is said to make the dividend more secure in the near-term, and the combination was shown to be leading to meaningful financial benefits and earnings accretion. CenturyLink has a 52-week range of $22.86 to $33.45, and the consensus target price is $28.08. Coach Inc. (NYSE: COH) was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at Atlantic Equities.

Upheld: A New York State appeals court reinstated the conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer, accused of stealing computer code for the bank's high-speed trading business before taking a job with a hedge fund. The court overturned a decision by a state trial judge, who threw out Aleynikov's 2010 conviction on the grounds that the 1967 law he was convicted under wasn't applicable, since computer software didn't exist at the time. But the appeals court said the law was drafted broadly enough to cover the crime.

"On 2017, we see an upward bias to numbers on an operational basis based on the ongoing product cycle," analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "With President Trump's drug pricing commentary over the past few weeks, we have seen renewed investor focus on this topic. Nonetheless, we do not see any wholesale shift in the current healthcare market structure in the foreseeable future." The analyst did cite the risk of a rising U.S. dollar, which may hurt drug companies as 55 percent of the industry's sales are international.

Wall Street Said to Test New Mortgage Index (DreamsTime) Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 12:53 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A bond-market startup is a step closer to reviving crisis-era derivatives that let investors bet on U.S. homeowner defaults. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG have given price data to the startup, New York-based Vista Capital Advisors, which rolled out the latest version of its pilot initiative this month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Vista has been working on the project for the past few years with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. The firm plans to use that data to create indexes of mortgage securities, which in turn would become the basis for the derivatives, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Those three banks may not ultimately participate in writing the eventual derivatives, the person said. Representatives for JPMorgan, Bank of America and Credit Suisse declined to comment. The derivatives would work much like ones created in the run-up to the U.S. housing crisis. Those products, known as the ABX indexes, were blamed for amplifying risks as big traders like American International Group Inc. wagered that subprime mortgage bonds would perform fine. After losses surged and the government had to bail out the financial system, demand for ABX bets faded. The new derivatives, however, would be tied to higher-quality mortgages that are less likely to default. The indexes Vista is building are linked to mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac known as "credit-risk transfer" securities, which force investors to bear losses when borrowers default on their loans, said Richard MacWilliams, Vista’s co-founder. The underlying loans are safer, but the bonds are still riskier for their owners than standard Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds, which are fully supported by the government. Testing Demand Derivatives linked to these notes could be a test for how open investors are to new mortgage products a decade after the financial crisis. Fund managers in recent years have shown some signs of being willing to re-embrace risky securities and derivatives tied to home loans, such as subprime mortgage bonds. But these markets are still a fraction of their size pre-crisis.  Vista Capital, which calls itself a "financial products innovation company," has some high-profile backers, including David Booth, co-founder and co-chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors; John Reed, former chairman of Citigroup Inc.; and Robert Merton, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work on the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options. Vista was previously known as eBond Advisors LLC. To be successful, derivatives linked to the indexes would have to help major banks manage their capital requirements, said Mike Edman, a former Morgan Stanley executive who helped invent credit derivatives on subprime mortgage bonds. "At a high level, it can make sense, but it seems regulatory capital is what the big banks focus on most," Edman said. Reducing Exposure Credit-risk transfer notes are an important mechanism for the government to reduce its support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were bailed out by taxpayers during the crisis after losing access to funding. While it is unclear how U.S. President Donald Trump will look to reform the two companies, Steven Mnuchin, nominee for Treasury Secretary, said in his confirmation hearing last week that "we shouldn’t just leave Fannie and Freddie as is for the next four or eight years under government control without a fix." Since 2013 when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began selling credit-risk transfer notes, the companies have offloaded nearly $40 billion of risk to bond investors. Derivatives could help boost these sales and lower taxpayer risks, ultimately, by making it easier for dealers to hedge their exposure to the notes, and by increasing the trading activity in the securities, Barclays Plc wrote to housing regulators last year. Freddie Mac’s Mike Reynolds, a vice president in the credit-risk transfer program, agreed that the idea has merit. A tradeable index could be "favorable, as it could alleviate the capital constraints that broker dealers currently have," and serve policy makers’ goal of stepping back from the two government-backed housing companies, he said. But there is also a potential drawback to the derivatives, he said: investors may decide to bet on the credit-risk transfer using derivatives instead of the cash securities, which could end up reducing demand for the bonds. The U.S. government could end up detracting from securities’ popularity if it were to endorse derivatives.  "That’s definitely a risk," Reynolds said.   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

português suomeksi svenska Two index options added to Nationwide New Heights fixed indexed annuities J.P. Morgan, Roger Ibbotson's Zebra Capital provide index options unique to New Heights News provided by Nationwide Jan 24, 2017, 11:37 ET Share this article COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The recent addition of two indices unique to Nationwide New Heights® fixed indexed annuities (FIAs) provides clients with more options to help with growth potential in a variety of market environments. The J.P. Morgan Mozaic IISM Index is a momentum-based index that strategically rebalances every month among a diverse range of global asset classes, with the aim to capture the continued performance of asset classes that have exhibited recent strong returns. The rebalancing process provides the flexibility to adapt to a variety of market environments and create consistent returns. Nationwide New Heights are the only FIAs to offer J.P. Morgan Mozaic II as an index option. The NYSE® Zebra Edge™ Index, developed by economist Professor Roger Ibbotson and his team at Zebra Capital Management, is the first index founded on Ibbotson's behavioral finance research on popularity. It's also the first NYSE index to be featured in a FIA and is exclusively available in Nationwide New Heights. By removing the stocks that are popular with investors and often the most volatile, the index seeks to identify stocks that are less popular yet historically provide higher returns with less risk, according to Ibbotson's research. "Both of these indices have average back-tested, hypothetical performance of more than 5.25 percent annually, and their low volatility allows for index allocations that can be higher than 100 percent in some New Heights products," said Mike Morrone, associate vice president of fixed annuity product strategy at Nationwide. "In today's low interest rate environment, these additional index options offer more risk-averse clients the accumulation opportunities that they want." Both new indices are available on all new Nationwide New Heights FIA contracts. "Nationwide is committed to helping advisors meet their clients' retirement income needs, whether that is growing and protecting savings, creating a stream of lifetime income or securing a legacy for loved ones," said Eric Henderson, Nationwide senior vice president of life insurance and annuities. "Nationwide will continue to evolve its New Heights line because we feel that there will be continued demand for the role fixed indexed annuities fill in today's market environment." Visit www.nationwidenewheights.com or ask your financial professional for more information about the New Heights FIAs. IMO advisors should contact their Annexus representative with questions about New Heights.

Here in the United States, the world's largest ETF market, ETFs gathered $279 billion in new assets on their way to a record assets under management tally of $2.549 trillion at the end of the year, according to ETFGI, a London-based ETF research provider. “At the end of 2016, the U.S. ETF/ETP industry had 1,969 ETFs/ETPs, assets of US$2.549 trillion, from 105 providers listed on three exchanges,” said ETFGI. While previously released data suggest ETFs are a hit among investors across multiple age groups, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK)'s BlackRock ETF Pulse Survey released last week indicates Gen X and millennials are major contributors to ETF growth. Survey Says “The survey also reveals that one in four investors already use ETFs, and that these investors tend to be younger, more engaged in managing their finances, and optimistic about their financial futures than the overall investment population. More than 8 in 10 (82 percent) of financial advisors currently use ETFs in the portfolios they manage,” said BlackRock in a statement. New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager and parent company of iShares, the world's biggest ETF sponsor. Data also suggest that among various generations, millennials are most engaged with ETFs, though millennials and Gen X actively sought additional ETF education last year. “More Millennials are currently invested in ETFs than investors on average (33 percent vs. 25 percent). Millennials investors (45 percent) and Gen X investors (38 percent) also took the biggest “learning steps” with ETFs last year, and plan to continue learning more in 2017,” said BlackRock. A third of millennials and 26 percent of Gen X investors are currently invested in ETFs compared to 24 percent of baby boomers, according to BlackRock data. An average of 58 percent of millennial and Gen X investors plan to learn more about ETFs this year compared to just 48 percent of baby boomers. Among individual investors surveyed by BlackRock, reasons widely cited for embracing ETFs include low fees, low costs to buy and sell the products and the ability to easily diversify while reducing risk. In October, BlackRock unveiled fee cuts for 15 of its 20 iShares core ETFs, a suite of ETFs aimed at cost-conscious, long-term investors.

REUTERS January 24, 2017 (Reuters) — JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $55 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit accusing it of discriminating against minority borrowers by allowing mortgage brokers to charge them more for home loans, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The U.S. Justice Department complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, accused the bank of willfully violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act between 2006 and 2009 and showing “reckless disregard” for the rights of at least 53,000 African American and Hispanic borrowers. “We’ve agreed to settle these legacy allegations that relate to pricing set by independent brokers,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said. “We deny any wrongdoing and remain committed to providing equal access to credit.” A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara had no immediate comment. The alleged discrimination involved so-called wholesale loans that were made through mortgage brokers the bank used to help originate loans, the complaint said. Chase allowed brokers to change rates charged for loans from those initially set based on objective credit-related factors, the complaint said. As a result of that discretion, minorities were charged more for home loans than white borrowers with the same credit profile, paying tens of millions of dollars in additional mortgage costs, the complaint said.

Sign Up An African American taking out a $191,100 loan on average paid $1,126 more over the first five years of the loan than a white borrower. An Hispanic borrower with a $236,800 loan paid on average $968 more than a non-Hispanic white borrower. Chase did not require mortgage brokers to document the reasons for changing rates and failed to address racial discrimination, encouraging it to continue, according to the complaint. The Justice Department has been pursuing a number of banks over alleged discrimination. From 2010 to 2014, the agency’s Civil Rights Division obtained more than $1.4 billion in relief under fair housing laws, an August report revealed. Cities around the country, including Miami, Baltimore and Los Angeles, also have filed lawsuits claiming that major banks targeted minorities for high-cost loans that often ended in foreclosures. The bank first disclosed Bharara’s lawsuit in a quarterly filing in 2015. 4 comments Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. *Your email address will not be published MAria Weidinger 01/24/2017 at 12:45 pm Great but will the homeowners get the money generated by the fine?

Reply EMM 01/24/2017 at 4:34 pm This type of systemic discrimination is one of the key reasons why African-Americans struggle economically. It’s very hard to identify and weed out systemic discrimination and by the time it’s weeded out, the damage is already done.

The company has also sent out the so-called request for proposals to lenders including Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley, the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. Aramco, as it’s known, is targeting the second or third quarter of 2018 for the IPO and expects to select banks later this year, two of the people said.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Aramco has also shortlisted New York-based boutique investment bank Moelis & Co. and Evercore Partners Inc. as potential financial advisers for the IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said. Aramco had been seeking a boutique to help it select banks to underwrite the offering, decide on venues for the listing and ensure the IPO’s smooth execution, people familiar with the plans had said in September. Saudi Arabia plans to sell less than 5 percent of the company as part of plans by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to set up the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund and reduce the economy’s reliance on hydrocarbons. The sale’s estimated size of $100 billion would make it the largest ever, dwarfing the $25 billion raised by Chinese internet retailer Alibaba in 2014. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Michael Klein, the former Citigroup Inc. investment banker who runs his own advisory firm, have already been selected to advise on the IPO, people familiar with the matter said in April. Klein is providing strategic advice to the government, while JPMorgan is working on preparations for the IPO and may be among the banks that underwrite the listing, the people said. Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said the company may list on two or three exchanges and, to make the sale more attractive to investors, Saudi Arabia will reduce the company’s overall tax rate. Read more on Saudi Arabia’s plans for the IPO of Aramco here. Prince Mohammed’s plan envisions the Aramco IPO as the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia’s biggest economic shakeup since the founding of the country in 1932. Although details of what exactly will be sold remain unclear, Nasser has said the IPO will be based on the company maintaining the so-called concession, which gives it the right to exploit the kingdom’s oil and gas reserves. Saudi Aramco and Evercore didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment. Representatives for Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Moelis declined to comment, while Goldman Sachs wasn’t immediately available for comment. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Finance Search Dow tops 20,000 mark on Trump hopesAAP – Thu, Jan 26, 2017 10:18 AM AEDT The Dow Jones Industrial Average index's has popped over 20,000 crowning a frenetic post-U.S. election rally that featured the second fastest-ever climb between 1,000-point milestones in the index's 120-year history. The rally, driven by enthusiasm over pro-growth policies from newly-minted U.S. President Donald Trump and an optimistic start to earnings season, has led to some speculation that stocks have run up too far. Analysts and investors, however, remain optimistic that the nearly nine-year bull run in equities will continue as long as the economy and corporate profits continue to show growth. "While the Dow hitting 20,000 is one of the least meaningful data points on my screen, it does suggest that the equity rally is pretty broad based," said Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of derivatives research at Weeden & Co. "What's important is that the Dow is going up." The 42-session surge from the first close above 19,000 was driven by financial stocks, specifically Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which were together responsible for more than 20 percent of the move. The fastest move between these thousand point milestones was 24 trading days between 10,000 and 11,000, from March 29 to May 3 of 1999. The rise from 18,000 to 19,000 took the Dow 483 trading sessions. Much of the gains have come from stocks expected to benefit as the administration moves to put its policies in place. Banks have been among the best performers since the November 8 US presidential election, as investors bet that Trump's expected fiscal stimulus will trigger inflation and bring higher interest rates. The largest contributor to the index's run from November 22 was Goldman, which has single-handedly added more than 170 points. Goldman is the only Dow component stock that trades above $US200, so its influence in the price-weighted index is naturally larger. The president expressed his enthusiasm over the milestone, with a "Great!" tweet on the official Twitter account of the office. The advance has also been fuelled by a solid start to quarterly earnings season, which has encouraged investors and helped equities resume their upward trajectory after consecutive weeks of modest declines. "In our view, investors have focused too much on Trump," said Maximilian Kunkel, Ultra High Net Worth Investment Strategist at UBS Wealth Management. "But it is clearly earnings that are driving the rally." Fourth-quarter earnings are now expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, marking the strongest growth in two years. The rise from November 22, when the Dow first closed above 19,000, has been so steep that the Dow is just over two percent away from hitting the level analysts expected at the end of 2017, according to the most recent Reuters poll. The pace of gains has caused some concern and increasingly cautious moves by some traders. The Dow's trailing price-to-earnings valuation is at 20.6 - the highest level in over seven years. "The big question for us is how much of that better earnings growth, or the anticipation of it, is already reflected in prices," said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. "We need that earnings growth to justify the multiples where they already are," he said. Some analysts have cautioned that stocks could also be held back if the administration's policies become bogged down in the political process as the year rolls on. Other potential pitfalls would be a strengthening US dollar and a Federal Reserve that may move more aggressively than anticipated. "To the extent that there is room for disappointment on the policy side, we may see the market back away from these exuberant highs," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, in Cleveland. Even if the Dow remains the proxy for stocks' performance for the person on the street, its importance as a benchmark has withered over time. A total of just $35.9 billion is indexed against it, compared with $2.1 trillion indexed against the S&P 500, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. Market watchers played down the significance of the round number hit as a psychological milestone but not a particularly meaningful one. "It's like watching your odometer cross over 100,000 or peeking up at the clock and noticing that it's exactly noon," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. "There are no magic numbers, but we like to pretend that there are."

The blue-chip average sailed past what had been an elusive milestone Wednesday after President Donald Trump demonstrated in recent days he is serious about fulfilling campaign promises. The Dow’s march toward the psychologically-significant level captivated Wall Street ever since Trump’s surprise election in November, and it finally broke through just 64 days after crossing the 19000 threshold for the first time ever. It was the second-fastest 1,000 point run in history. But the Dow flirted with the milestone for weeks, and came within a fraction of a point of 20K  on January 6, stalling as investors awaited more concrete evidence the president would follow through on the issues he championed on the campaign trail, including lower taxes and less regulation. The Dow has rallied nearly 1,700 points since Election Day with help from its biggest gainers during that period, Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and American Express (AXP). On Wednesday, the index leaped as much as 163 points, or 0.82% to 20076 as Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), and Apple (AAPL) led the gains. Strength in the materials and financial sectors helped push the Dow across the threshold after Trump on Tuesday gave the green light for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines – two projects that stalled under President Barack Obama’s administration. In recent days, Trump has also met with U.S. business leaders, including the chief executives of the Big Three American automakers amid a push for more domestically-built automobiles. Financial-sector stocks have also been a key element in the post-election rally that has led not only to Dow 20K, but fresh records on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes. While action in the sector cooled in recent weeks, improving global economic growth and consolidation in the U.S. dollar/U.S. Treasury yields has been a support for risk assets, said Dennis DeBusschere, senior managing director at Evercore ISI. “A weak U.S. dollar and an accommodative Fed are in the new administration’s best interest and as long as a significant policy ‘mistake’ is avoided, risk assets should move higher as economic growth improves,” he said. Trump’s fiscal policies, though, are just one piece of the 2017 market puzzle. With expectations of added stimulus from Washington, policymakers down the road from the White House at the Federal Reserve are calculating the pace at which the short-term federal funds rate will need to increase to keep up with a growing economy while also not allowing it to overheat. The Fed in December said it expects three 0.25 percentage point rate increases this year, which it believes will allow inflation to move closer to the 2% target while the job-creation rate remains steady. In that environment, investors may stand to benefit from putting more weight on cyclical stocks including financials, energy, consumer discretionary and real estate, rather than in defensive sectors that include health care and utilities. “What we’re likely to see in 2017 is a resumption of an earnings-driven market where there’s tangible earnings growth. That’s going to be essential to sector performance,” said U.S. Bank Private Client Group Chief Investment Officer Bill Northey. With fourth-quarter earnings season underway, he explained energy stocks could see positive yearly earnings thanks to the rise in benchmark oil prices over the last year, while the landscape for financial services stocks has also improved thanks in part to the outlook for a relaxation of the onerous Dodd-Frank financial reform law. “There are some tangible elements likely to transpire in 2017 that warrant the kind of reaction we saw in 2016, but broadly speaking, we saw index levels run beyond what the underlying fundamentals were doing,” Northey added. Though the overall economy is on solid footing, headwinds for both equities and the economy are beginning to emerge warned Ameriprise Chief Market Strategist David Joy. “[We’re seeing warnings that] higher rates are a drag on housing, that the stronger dollar is a drag on exports and that wage gains are being eroded by rising inflation,” he explained while also outlining worries that a lack of skilled workers threatens to stand in the way of the ongoing recovery. Still, it’s also worth looking at 2017 in a way that detaches the economy from company-to-company performance as investors weigh the prospect of new fiscal policies, said Ralph Bassett, head of North American Equities at Aberdeen Asset Management. “Lower tax rates are a great thing for domestic companies that we’ll see a greater benefit from. While our economy is very much domestic and service-related, companies are headquartered here and generate jobs here. They are impacted by our trade policy, which is the biggest question mark through the new year,” he said.

 The startup that was supposed to be the first tech IPO of 2017 pulled a shady move on some of its own bankers Portia Crowe Jan. 25, 2017, 4:03 PM 13,361 facebook linkedin twitter email print AppDynamics CEO David Wadhwani.Dan Frommer, Business Insider It looks like AppDynamics' last-minute deal to sell itself to Cisco — rather than go public as planned — was a surprise to more people than just investors. Some of the bankers working on the initial public offering, or IPO, were kept out of the loop until "moments before" the press release, according to Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and Alex Barinka. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan were the lead banks on the IPO, according to an SEC filing, with Barclays, UBS, Wells Fargo, William Blair, and JMP Securities also acting as underwriters. But AppDynamics hired the boutique bank Qatalyst to work on a sale behind the scenes, according to the the report. During the IPO roadshow they held late-night meetings in hotel rooms after underwriters and investors had left for the day, Bloomberg reported. Fortune's Erin Griffith reports that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advised on the sale along with Qatalyst. While Cisco has been interested in a deal with AppDynamics for months, Fortune reports that it wasn't until late last week that the company decided to go after a merger "aggressively." Qatalyst founder Frank Quattrone is a long-time adviser to Cisco, which frequently acquires companies. It's worth noting Cisco has made this sort of play before. Back in 1999, the company paid about $7 billion to buy Cerent shortly before that company was to go public. Credit Suisse First Boston, whose head of technology at the time was Quattrone, advised on that sale.

Who Will the Big New York Lenders Be in 2017? Jan 25, 2017 Ely Razin EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement In an uncertain world like the one 2016 brought us, commercial real estate is typically seen as a pretty safe bet—and New York City as a pretty stable place to make that bet, offering prestigious trophy properties as well as many lower-profile multifamily, office, retail and hospitality options. So who will the big New York City lenders be in 2017? Well, let’s take a look back for a moment. New York City-based lenders Signature Bank and New York Community Bank were among the top 10 originators of commercial real estate loans in the city in the first nine months of 2016. In that time, local New York banks took the third-largest piece of New York City's commercial real estate pie, originating the most commercial real estate dollars in the Big Apple after U.S. national banks and foreign banks. Will the locals, then, rule the roost in 2017? Not necessarily. We’re already seeing that Signature and NYCB originations have been dipping a bit. A CrediFi analysis of third quarter 2016 found that both banks saw overall quarterly originations drop roughly by half. Much of the drop appears to be driven by a decrease in multifamily lending. Multifamily origination in New York City (by dollar amount) declined not only from the second to the third quarter of 2016, but also from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016. Both declines were in the range of 20 percent. The reduction in third quarter multifamily lending follows statements in the summer by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC warning that loan underwriting standards have relaxed for commercial real estate overall. Both government agencies singled out the multifamily market as potentially facing weakness ahead, following extensive multifamily construction and potential oversupply. Other New York lenders If commercial real estate financing by Signature Bank and New York Community Bank is inching down—for the time being, at least—who else is lending in New York City? Challengers to local lenders include more traditional contenders, as well as lenders that might not automatically spring to mind. The more traditional players include big national and foreign banks such as Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One and Morgan Stanley, each of which originated commercial real estate financing in New York City totaling between $1 billion and $5 billion for January through September 2016, according to a CrediFi analysis. All these banks were among the top 10 lenders in that period, and loans from U.S. national and foreign banks combined constituted about half of all New York City commercial real estate lending in the first nine months of 2016. Within the city, Brooklyn-based Dime Bank emerged in the third quarter as a smaller local competitor to the big locals. Dime more than doubled its financing in Queens in the third quarter, to over $130 million, significantly outpacing both NYCB and Signature in the borough. Yet Dime remains smaller overall, issuing just under $400 million in commercial real estate loans in the city in the third quarter, spread over dozens of loans—hundreds of millions of dollars less than either NYCB or Signature. But it would be a mistake to stop there. Commercial real estate players interested in New York City need to look more closely at the less obvious sources of financing, not just smaller local originators like Dime, but also regional lenders from outside of New York City. Non-New York banks that were among the top 50 New York City lenders in the first nine months of 2016 include those close to New York City, such as Buffalo-based M&T Bank and New Jersey-based Investors Bank, as well as lenders in Arkansas (Bank of the Ozarks), Florida (BankUnited), Pennsylvania (Customers Bank) and San Francisco (First Republic Bank). Regional U.S. banks based outside New York constituted 15 percent of the city’s commercial real estate lending in the first three quarters of 2016 by dollars originated, according to a CrediFi analysis, based on a sample of $60 billion in financing. That’s only a few percentage points less than the proportion of commercial real estate dollars that New York City-based banks dedicate to properties in their hometown. Let’s start with M&T Bank, also known as Manufacturers & Traders Trust Company. Based in Buffalo, N.Y., M&T was one of the top 10 New York City lenders in the first nine months of 2016, issuing more than $1 billion in commercial real estate loans in that time. Its New York City loan origination (by dollar amount) increased about 20 percent from the second to the third quarter. The deals included a $135 million loan for an 11-story industrial-turned-office property at 20 Jay Street in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn that houses creative tenants such as digital media design and production studio Brooklyn Digital Foundry and branding agency Red Antler, and a $75 million loan for the Flatiron District office building at 162 Fifth Avenue. Nationwide, commercial real estate loans issued by M&T Bank (excluding construction loans) increased by 10 percent in the first nine months of 2016, reaching $32 billion at the end of the third quarter, according to the bank’s SEC filings. Over in Little Rock, Ark., we’ve got Bank of the Ozarks, which has issued more than $800 million in commercial real estate loans in New York City. This out-of-town lender dipped its toes into New York waters in early 2013, and was a top 10 commercial real estate lender in the city in the first quarter of 2016. Bank of the Ozarks' loans in 2016 included $200 million for two rental towers-turned-condos: the Luminaire Gramercy, at 385 First Ave., and 389 E. 89th St. on the Upper East Side. Developer Magnum Real Estate started selling units in both projects in early 2016 as “affordable luxury” starting at around $1 million. The Arkansas lender also issued a $92 million acquisition loan for the NYLO New York City, an Upper West Side hotel at 2178 Broadway and W. 77th St. Florida’s BankUnited, a leading multifamily lender in the Big Apple, was also a top 10 lender in in the first quarter of 2016. BankUnited was one of the biggest banks to fail during the 2008 financial crisis, but made a comeback after it was bought in 2009 by private equity funds including Blackstone and Carlyle and had a successful initial public offering in 2011. In the first three quarters of 2016, BankUnited issued more than $100 million in loans for cross-collateralized multifamily properties, including 4123 Gleane St. in Queens and multiple buildings on W. 49th Street in Manhattan. During the same period, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank’s New York City loans included $90 million in financing for a luxury Upper East Side apartment building at 800 Fifth Ave. that overlooks Central Park. So as Signature and NYCB originations dip, commercial real estate players with an eye on New York City—whether lenders who want to know more about their competitors’ activity, or current or prospective property owners who are looking into their financing options—should not overlook the financing role of regional U.S. banks based outside the Big Apple.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: This Budget could be the toughest test of Modi's life. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage MUMBAI: Billionaire Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta Resources, state-run NTPC and Jain Irrigation have raised $1 billion, 500 million euros and $200 million respectively through offshore bond-sales, as corporate houses are hurrying to tap the global bond market ahead of an expected steep rise in US rates. Vedanta raised $1 billion by selling bonds to overseas investors as the London-headquartered metals and mining company is looking to refinance its existing debt, a move, which according to analysts, should help lower the company's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the nation’s biggest power producer, NTPC, raised 500 million euros in what could be the first longest tenor euro-denominated issuance by an Indian company. Vedanta offered securities at 6.375% with five year maturity and the company will be refinancing a part of its 2018 and 2019 maturities and extended average debt maturity, it said in a statement. This is the largest single tranche G3 high-yield bond issue ex-Japan since 2015, it added. G3 bonds are issued in US dollars, yen and euro. The bond was subscribed mostly by global asset managers, sources told ET. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays were some of the banks that helped the company to raise funds. The company has obtained an order book of $2.3 billion, of which it has retained the target of $1 billion. NTPC sold euro-denominated bonds with 10-year maturity, the longest in the currency. The issue got bids for $2.4 billion, or nearly five times the targeted size. Securities have been priced at 200 basis points over Euro Treasury. “The company has obtained a tighter pricing from its initial guidance (225 bps spread),” said Shashikant Rathi, head of treasuries and markets, Axis Bank. “Investors have showed stronger appetite for good quality Indian credit.” Axis Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays are some of the investment bankers to the NTPC deal. Jain International Trading B.V, an offshore subsidiary of Jain Irrigation raised $200 million via its debut green bonds sold to overseas investors. ET reported on January 11 about the NTPC bond sale while Vedanta’s and Jain Irrigation's issuances were reported on January 17. Vedanta has some loans maturing next year and the company is selling the paper to refinance those. Vedanta plans to use the proceeds from this offering primarily to fund its offer to purchase its outstanding $750 million, 9.50%, bonds due 2018 and $1.2 billion 6.00% bonds due 2019, and to repay its other existing indebtedness, Goldman Sachs said in a note. “This is a positive for the stock as it should take down the average interest payable which reduces pressure on cash flow and highlights the company’s resolve to actively manage its upcoming maturities and term out its debt,” Goldman told its clients on Wednesday. Shares in Vedanta were trading 1.1% higher on London Stock Exchange, while NTPC closed 0.8% lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange, underperforming the benchmark Sensex that gained 1.2%.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The Dow blew past the 20,000 mark Wednesday morning. The blue chip index reignited the rally that began with Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November. Catapulting the Dow this day: strong earnings from jet maker Boeing. But the real star of this recent rally was financial stocks. Goldman Sachs' and JPMorgan Chase's mercurial climb accounted for about one fifth of the Dow's gain. Investors are betting that the fiscal stimulus President Trump has promised will boost inflation and interest rates, thereby fattening banks' bottom lines. Economist Maria Fiorini Ramirez says Wall Street is keen on Trump's commitment to deregulation. SOUNDBITE: MARIA FIORINI RAMIREZ, CEO, MARIA FIORINI RAMIREZ, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Companies may have less cost related to whether it's compliance or regulation and that frees quite a bit of the earnings at the bottom line. They're going to use some of that to reinvest and invest in capital, and dividends go to shareholders." If the Dow manages to close above 20,000 Wednesday, it will have taken the index just 42 sessions to climb 1,000 points ... the second fastest time ever.

By Philipvan Doorn Investing columnist To some, Dow 20,000 is a cause for celebration. To others, it’s just a fascination. For shrewd investors, it’s an opportune time to consider how expensive stocks are. This chart shows that the price-to-earnings ratio for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04%  has never been higher (going back 15 years), while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.09%  was considerably higher in 2002: FactSet So we thought it would be helpful to see which of the 30 Dow stocks are cheapest, according to consensus 2018 earnings estimates. After that, we’ll review which stocks have posted the fastest growth in sales per share and the ones most beloved by Wall Street analysts.

After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The Dow climbed 156 points to 20,069 and was joined in record territory by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up more than 1,700 points since President Donald Trump's victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. "The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again," said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump's plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. Related: The Dow's long road to 20,000 But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank's massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. "The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it's a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Related: Biggest threats to the Trump market rally Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing "greed," a vast improvement from "extreme fear" mere days before the election. The VIX (VIX), a gauge of volatility in the markets, has dropped to the lowest level since July 2014. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: "Dow Almost 20,000." One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. "We've scaled this peak. We're going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button," said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Related: Today's Dow is a lot different from just 20 year ago Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan's Kelly worries that "markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives" such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump's anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. "We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly," Quinlan said. Yardeni said the jury is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. "Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that's bullish for the economy?" he asked. "The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don't want to bet against him."

By Philipvan Doorn Investing columnist To some, Dow 20,000 is a cause for celebration. To others, it’s just a fascination. For shrewd investors, it’s an opportune time to consider how expensive stocks are. This chart shows that the price-to-earnings ratio for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04%  has never been higher (going back 15 years), while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.09%  was considerably higher in 2002: FactSet So we thought it would be helpful to see which of the 30 Dow stocks are cheapest, according to consensus 2018 earnings estimates.

After that, we’ll review which stocks have posted the fastest growth in sales per share and the ones most beloved by Wall Street analysts.

 We asked an investing legend if mutual funds are doomed and his answer was just brutal Rachael Levy Jan. 25, 2017, 12:13 PM 27,962 facebook linkedin twitter email print Vanguard founder John Bogle. Vanguard Active investment managers — investors that try to beat market indexes — are in a tough spot. There's one man that could take most of the blame, Vanguard founder John C. Bogle, whose behemoth firm, now with $3.9 trillion under management, continues to attract assets, all while costing clients a tiny fraction of the cost of active management. That's great for Main Street investors, who can reap market gains on the cheap but bad for Wall Street managers who need to be paid for their analysis and trading costs. Last year, investors pulled $2oo billion from active US equity funds, the largest divestment from active management, while passive equity funds attracted $150 billion, according to JPMorgan data. A lot of that has to do with lousy performance. In a recent extensive interview with Business Insider, Bogle laid out the bleak future for active managers, and where there still might be opportunities. Here's an excerpt from the interview (emphasis added): Levy: Vanguard's CEO, Bill McNabb, recently said that active managers have a chance to survive and prosper, but with lower fees. Do you agree? Bogle: I'm not about to disagree with the head of our company. The question that hangs out here is how much they have to cut their fees. The average fee is about 1%, give or take, and you can buy an S&P 500 index fund at Vanguard for five basis points [0.05%]. If you cut fees 50%, you'd still have fees 10 times as high as Vanguard. I'm not sure how much that would help you. Levy: Are active-asset managers such as traditional mutual funds doomed then? Bogle: The active managers have a philosophy they can win. They come into the office every day and say, "Boy, Mark, I’m going to beat the heck out of you today," and they don't. When they have a bad year, they say it’s that year; I’ll do it next year. It’s a hard business and it’s not the expense ratios that have to be cut, but also the trading. The transaction costs are very high – they’re hidden; they’re not going to tell you what they are – they are there and they are large. The active managers have their work cut out for them. One thing they could do is put in an incentive fee. Get 10 basis points or five [0.10% or 0.05%], unless they beat the market. We're paying people to beat the market when they aren't doing it, and when you think about it, that doesn't make sense. They can put their expense ratio at 5 [basis points, 0.05%] and get another 1% if they beat the market by X. But they have to, under the SEC rules, be symmetrical. So if they lost to the market by 1%, they would be out of pocket. Managers, at least in this context, are not stupid. They know perfectly well they are going to lose that bet. There's some hope for active managers, but not much, according to Bogle. "If you’re very talented and keep winning, you’ll do just fine. It may take a while. But the talent is hard to identify and talent is hard to tell from luck," he added. "There's an awful lot of luck in this business." Here's more from Bogle (emphasis added): "I was just looking at a chart here we did for the Bogleheads. We took the top quintile of funds for the five years ending in 2010 and looked where they ranked over the next five years, 2010 to 2015.Only 16% of top-performing active funds remained top performers five years after 2010, according to a Vanguard study.Vanguard The highest quintile, 16% of the funds remained in the highest quintile, and 24% went to the lowest quintile. If you look at the lowest quintile from 2010, 15% went to the highest quintile, and only 9% stayed in the lowest quintile. It's a very discouraging chart if you're an active manager. It's reversion to the mean, and it happens everywhere." Read the full Business Insider interview with Bogle here.

JPMorgan Chase agreed Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disputes with more financial data companies. Chase and Intuit will develop software to let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes without using their Chase user name and password. Federal News Radio conducted an exclusive data center survey to assess how agencies are storing data. Download the results. Mint and other popular budgeting sites pull data from a bank’s online services. But some banks resisted, worried the data could be intercepted and put them at risk for identity theft or fraud.

Without that financials sector, the S&P 500 would be less than 2 percent above an old record hit Aug. 15, 2016, rather than posting the more than 4 percent gain it's had since then, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. His data show that Goldman Sachs alone has accounted for 22 percent of the Dow Jones industrial average's gains since the election. The financial sector — which includes banks and insurance companies — is seen as almost a necessary component for a rally with staying power. "It's very difficult to get a sustained rally without the financials rallying," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told CNBC in December. Financial stocks declined by 0.47 percent between the end of 2014 and Election Day 2016, and the S&P 500 took more than a year to make a new high during that time. By December, the sector had rallied more than 18 percent since election day in November, to hit its highest level in about nine years. The S&P 500 was up nearly 5 percent over the same period, setting all-time highs. Now, the sector is recovering. Financial stocks led the S&P 500 higher Wednesday as the index traded at all-time highs and the Dow crossed the psychologically key 20,000 level for the first time. Boeing was the top contributor to gains in the Dow, while Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the top 10 stocks with the greatest positive impact on the index. Ablin findings confirm that the S&P 500 tends to follow the performance of the financials sector, which has the second-greatest weighting in the index. Banks are "really advancing on the back of higher interest rates. It's probably the one sector that benefits from higher rates. I think investors are not only gravitating to it, but they are using it as a hedge," Ablin said. Higher interest rates increase banks' profit margins. The financial sector is watched as an indicator of economic growth. The more business activity there is, the more loans are taken out, and the more money banks can make. "It's typically healthy that the financials are leading. It's suggesting the economy is in good shape. It's not something we've had" over the last few years, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. Financials were already on the rise ahead of the U.S. presidential election, as the economic outlook improved, as trading volumes picked up, and as global central bank monetary policy tightened. A 'major shift' show chapters Fed is more important to bank stocks than you think: FBR analyst    Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 3:30 PM ET | 05:45 Since the election, Treasury yields have jumped on expectations of economic growth stemming from Trump's promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The Trump administration is also expected to roll back some of the regulations imposed on banks after the financial crisis. "What we ultimately get is stimulus and regulatory rollback," said Tom Wright, director of equities at JMP Securities. He said those policies should have a much bigger effect than would a 25 basis point rate hike (0.25 percentage point) from the U.S. Federal Reserve. "Generally, investors have been underweight (banks) for a long time, in the broader brush of things, since the financial crisis in '09," he said. "This is a major shift, and there are larger pools of money that are going into financials." For example, in the week after the election, RBC Capital Markets began recommending financial stocks as the firm revised its views on seven S&P 500 sectors. Bespoke Investment Group predicted in a December note that the sector still has room to run higher. "Financials dropped more than 80 percent during the financial crisis, while the energy sector fell 40 percent from mid-2014 through January of this year," the note said. "So while sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials have also rallied sharply higher since the election, they have exploded higher into new all-time high territory. Financials and energy, on the other hand, both still need to gain roughly 30 percent to get back to their prior all-time highs." Meanwhile, the rally has spread. Not only have the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite hit records, but so have the small-cap Russell 2000 index and the Dow transports. The S&P and Nasdaq closed at records Tuesday. "From a technical standpoint, the situation has improved, even though valuations are stretched," said Ablin, who played down the concerns of investors "equaling this to a tech bubble of the late '90s." "Now it's just a matter of waiting for the fundamentals to catch up with what the expectations are," he said. show chapters Mnuchin: Regulation is killing community banks    Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 | 11:25 AM ET | 03:23 Evelyn ChengWriter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change GS --- S&P 500 --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

(Bloomberg) By Bloomberg News Published Wed, Jan 25, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL By Lu Wang and Joseph Ciolli Thinking too hard about investing doesn’t get you anywhere, wrote Jesse Livermore, legendary trader of the Roaring ’20s. To make the really big money, you just need to “be right and sit tight.” Rarely has Livermore’s advice been harder to take than in the last 12 months. Between the worst start to a year ever, the violent reversals of last March, then Brexit and the U.S. elections sending stocks into the biggest tailspins since the flash crash, almost everyone lost their nerve at some point. Now, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sailing past 20,000, the virtues of patience, of tuning out the crowd, are on display once more. “Conventional wisdom didn’t have a big year,” said Howard Silverblatt, the 62-year-old senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow rose 0.5 percent, or 99.08 points, to 20,011 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, as corporate earnings and signs that President Donald Trump will push through pro-growth policies reignited the equities rally that stalled a month ago. Even accounting for the stasis that has afflicted global markets for more than a month, the latest thousand-point surge in the Dow was the second-fastest ever, with shares jumping on Trump’s Wall Street embrace. Led by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, almost $2 trillion has been added to U.S. equities in fewer than 90 days. The rally punctuates an eight-year bull run in which the century-old gauge managed to rise more than 200 percent without ever drowning out the naysayers. “The bearish camp always sounds more intelligent than the bullish camp, but there’s something in between, and that’s being opportunistic and pragmatic,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, which oversees about $1.3 trillion. “Above all else, you can’t fight momentum.” To be sure, gains have settled down after velocity in the stock market reached some of its highest readings ever. The Dow had fallen in eight of the prior 11 days. That’s a far cry from December, when one measure of price momentum, the relative strength index, touched its highest level since 1996. For anyone who saw Brexit or Trump as the bull market’s death knell and sold, the rally since Election Day highlights a principal danger of investing: bailing too early. A study by Bank of America Corp. on periods before and after every market peak since 1937 shows that being uninvested in the last year of an advance meant missing out of one-fifth of its return. At the same time, investors can be forgiven for being anxious. While the market rupture that followed Britain’s June 23 vote to exit the European Union proved temporary, it was one of five instances in just two years of what Deutsche Bank AG categorizes as a historical shift in equity volatility. Before that, it took two decades to record five such events. The Dow has advanced 11 percent since just before Trump’s election, at times posting the fastest rally for a new president since 1900. With valuations on the 30-stock gauge near the highest in a decade at a time when earnings growth is close to nonexistent, the question for investors is how much is left. Round-number milestones are customarily dismissed by institutional investors, especially in the Dow, whose importance as a market barometer ranks a distant second to the S&P 500 Index with professionals. They nevertheless matter to individuals, according to Dan Veru of Palisade Capital Management, who sees Dow 20,000 as a clarion call to a class of investor that has largely been absent to date. In 2016 alone, a net $77 billion was yanked from mutual and exchange-traded funds that invest in U.S. stocks. That brings the tally to about $180 billion since the bull market began, data compiled by Bloomberg and Investment Company Institute show. “This was the first month where they opened their statement and asked, ‘What the heck happened?’” said Veru, who helps oversee $3.7 billion as chief investment officer at Fort Lee, New Jersey-based Palisade. “They’re underweighted to equities, so it’s like a party they weren’t invited to.” Click here to see the comments.

By Allen Cone and Doug G. Ware   |   Jan. 25, 2017 at 4:01 PM Follow @upi Comments 1 of 4 | License Photo Jan. 25 (UPI) -- For the first time in history, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 20,000-mark on Wednesday -- a milestone that experts have expected for weeks, fueled by the post-election surge on Wall Street. The blue chip index closed Wednesday's trading with a daily gain of 156 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 20,068.51. The Dow surpassed the historic barrier after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange and rose to a intraday high of 20,082.00 -- the loftiest point in the NYSE's 120-year history. RECOMMENDEDTrump to CEOs: Expect a rollback of regulations and a tax on goods made outside U.S. The index of 30 stocks was led by Boeing and IBM during trading Wednesday. The Dow rose from 19,000 to 20,000 in just 64 calendar days -- the second-quickest 1,000-point jump, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 1999, the index jumped from 10,000 to 11,000 in 35 days. "It's a nice mile marker," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners, told USA Today. Analysts have been anticipating 20,000 for weeks, with some believing it would happen before the end of 2016. The index got within 50 points of the record mark on multiple occasions but could never crack the boundary until Wednesday. The S&P 500 climbed 18 points Wednesday to close at 2,298.37, and the Nasdaq gained 55 points to 5,656.34. The Dow's spectacular 1,700-point incline over the last 11 weeks has been steady since President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8, a night of uncertainty that saw the index temporarily fall 800 points. Since then, Trump's business acumen and anticipated policy changes have fueled positive speculation on Wall Street that's driven the index to historic levels. Amid the financial crisis in March 2009, two months after Barack Obama took office, the Dow was at 6,440. "The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it's a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago," David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told CNN. Traders have been bullish on Trump's economic plan to slash taxes, ease regulations and introduce a sweeping infrastructure package worth $1 trillion. "Clearly, this has become a buy-high-sell-higher market with the Dow breaking above 20,000," Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told CNBC. "Out of the gate, President Trump is moving along with his agenda." RELATEDNovember: Dow passes 19,000 for first time in history "More importantly, earnings have been on the cusp of increasing, and that's going to be key to hold these valuations," he added. On Tuesday, Trump signed executive orders to make it possible to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota and restart the process for the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. "There's no question that some of the executive orders he's signed are good, especially deregulations," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "Anything else should be seen as a question mark. We don't know what a wall on the Mexican border would mean for NAFTA." However, investors expect a potential dropoff from the record levels, Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, told CNBC. "If funds continue to shovel capital into equities in advance of an inevitable reprise of an undesirable bout of skittishness, then shares may suffer a selloff greater in magnitude and duration than I anticipate," he said.

NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 is finally here. After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up a stunning 1,667 points since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. “The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump’s plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. “The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it’s a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index is flashing “greed,” a vast improvement from “extreme fear” mere days before the election. The VIX, a gauge of volatility in the markets, has dropped to the lowest level since July 2014. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: “Dow Almost 20,000.” One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. “We’ve scaled this peak. We’re going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan’s Kelly worries that “markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives” such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. “We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly,” Quinlan said. Yardeni said the verdict is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. “Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that’s bullish for the economy?” he asked. “The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don’t want to bet against him.” Filed in: News Topics: Dow Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google Email Reddit Tumblr Popular Johnston Teacher Placed on Leave Amidst Police Investigation Pipeline Rupture Spills 138,600 Gallons of Diesel in Northern Iowa Latest News Virginia Man Donates Kidney to Wife on 20th Wedding Anniversary John Hurt Dies: Legendary ‘Harry Potter’ Actor was 77 Reaction to Des Moines Water Works Loss of Nitrates Supreme Court Case Thousands Gather for 44th Annual March for Life to Protest Legalization of Abortion Politics Wall Street Welcomes Trump With a Bang News Politics The ‘Yuge’ Donald Trump Market Rally Continues Politics Global Markets Tank as U.S. Election Results Shock Politics What Trump Tax Report Could Mean for his Campaign Politics Donald Trump, Mitt Romney to Meet this Weekend Politics Ford Cancels Mexico Plant, Will Create 700 U.S. Jobs in ‘vote of confidence’ in Trump Politics Trump Offers Branstad China Ambassador Job, Governor Accepts Politics Donald Trump’s Historic Moment Arrives Politics Delta CEO: Trump’s Win Helped Our Bottom Line Politics Washington Prepares for Donald Trump’s Big Moment News Politics Presidential Debate: What to Watch For in the Last Clinton-Trump Face-Off News Politics Protest Movements Surge Ahead of Trump’s Inauguration Politics Donald Trump Becomes 45th President of the United States Mobile Apps 13Now News App for iPhone & iPad 13Now News App for Android 13WarnMe Weather App for iPhone & iPad 13WarnMe Weather App for Android Facebook Twitter Instagram About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1801 Grand Ave. Des Moines, IA 50309 • Copyright © 2017, WHO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

To make the really big money, you just need to “be right and sit tight.” Rarely has Livermore’s advice been harder to take than in the last 12 months. Between the worst start to a year ever, the violent reversals of last March, then Brexit and the U.S. elections sending stocks into the biggest tailspins since the flash crash, almost everyone lost their nerve at some point. Now, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sailing past 20,000, the virtues of patience, of tuning out the crowd, are on display once more. “Conventional wisdom didn’t have a big year,” said Howard Silverblatt, the 62-year-old senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow rose 0.5 percent, or 99.08 points, to 20,011 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, as corporate earnings and signs that President Donald Trump will push through pro-growth policies reignited the equities rally that stalled a month ago. Even accounting for the stasis that has afflicted global markets for more than a month, the latest thousand-point surge in the Dow was the second-fastest ever, with shares jumping on Trump’s Wall Street embrace. Led by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, almost $2 trillion has been added to U.S. equities in fewer than 90 days. The rally punctuates an eight-year bull run in which the century-old gauge managed to rise more than 200 percent without ever drowning out the naysayers. “The bearish camp always sounds more intelligent than the bullish camp, but there’s something in between, and that’s being opportunistic and pragmatic,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, which oversees about $1.3 trillion. “Above all else, you can’t fight momentum.” To be sure, gains have settled down after velocity in the stock market reached some of its highest readings ever. The Dow had fallen in eight of the prior 11 days. That’s a far cry from December, when one measure of price momentum, the relative strength index, touched its highest level since 1996. For anyone who saw Brexit or Trump as the bull market’s death knell and sold, the rally since Election Day highlights a principal danger of investing: bailing too early. A study by Bank of America Corp. on periods before and after every market peak since 1937 shows that being uninvested in the last year of an advance meant missing out of one-fifth of its return. At the same time, investors can be forgiven for being anxious. While the market rupture that followed Britain’s June 23 vote to exit the European Union proved temporary, it was one of five instances in just two years of what Deutsche Bank AG categorizes as a historical shift in equity volatility. Before that, it took two decades to record five such events. The Dow has advanced 11 percent since just before Trump’s election, at times posting the fastest rally for a new president since 1900. With valuations on the 30-stock gauge near the highest in a decade at a time when earnings growth is close to nonexistent, the question for investors is how much is left. Round-number milestones are customarily dismissed by institutional investors, especially in the Dow, whose importance as a market barometer ranks a distant second to the S&P 500 Index with professionals. They nevertheless matter to individuals, according to Dan Veru of Palisade Capital Management, who sees Dow 20,000 as a clarion call to a class of investor that has largely been absent to date. In 2016 alone, a net $77 billion was yanked from mutual and exchange-traded funds that invest in U.S. stocks. That brings the tally to about $180 billion since the bull market began, data compiled by Bloomberg and Investment Company Institute show. “This was the first month where they opened their statement and asked, ‘What the heck happened?'” said Veru, who helps oversee $3.7 billion as chief investment officer at Fort Lee, New Jersey-based Palisade. “They’re underweighted to equities, so it’s like a party they weren’t invited to.” Featured Image: (c) 2017, Bloomberg - #breaking now Trump promises ‘great rebuilding of the Armed Forces’ while signing executive order at the Pentagon President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to launch what he called a “great rebuilding of the Armed… 0 Comments 2287 Views Trump: It’s ‘very early’ to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday that it is “very early” to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia, suggesting… 0 Comments 3369 Views Trump suspends refugee entry, vows priority for Christians WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday that Christians will be given priority to come to the United States… 0 Comments 2927 Views With Pence On Hand, March for Life Draws Major Crowd WASHINGTON – Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in cold, blustery weather near the Washington Monument on Friday and heard… 0 Comments 5440 Views Lawsuit alleges Baylor football rape scandal more widespread than reported A federal lawsuit filed Friday alleged that at least 31 football players at Baylor University committed at least 52… 0 Comments 8698 Views Seattle approves safe sites for addicts to inject drugs Officials in Seattle on Friday approved the nation’s first “safe-injection” sites for users of heroin and other illegal drugs,… 0 Comments 15046 Views Mexico digs in and Trump lashes back as border wall standoff deepens MEXICO CITY — White House warnings of a possible punitive trade tariff had Mexican business leaders and politicians digging… 0 Comments 15351 Views LIVE: President Trump Holds Joint Press Conference With UK PM Theresa May 0 Comments 40122 Views #connect Never Miss Breaking News - Follow Breaking911 Follow us on Facebook likes Follow us on Twitter 172,028 followers #trending Miami-Dade Mayor Complies With Pres.

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:30 PM, January 25, 2017 Updated: 11:50 PM, January 25, 2017 BOSTON - State Street Corp <STT.N> on Wednesday reported a 3.4 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue and said it lost more than $1 trillion in custody assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc <JPM.N>, sending State Street stock tumbling as much as 7.5 percent. State Street is the world's No. 2 custody bank with $28.8 trillion in assets under custody and administration. But the figure could shrink by more than 3 percent after JPMorgan said on Wednesday that it was chosen by BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> to be custodian for more than $1 trillion in assets. Boston-based State Street, BlackRock's custodian since 1988, will continue to service the asset manager's fast-growing iShares ETF assets. Over the years, the two companies have been "joined at the hip," as one State Street executive put it during a conference call with analysts and investors. The announcement came as State Street reported total revenue of $2.53 billion in the fourth quarter, a 3.4 percent decline from the year-earlier period. For JPMorgan, the deal is more of a feather in its cap than a windfall to its bottom line. The deal boosts JPMorgan's assets under custody, which it pegged at $20.5 trillion at the end of December, by about 5 percent. The new business is expected to add annual revenue on the order of tens of millions of dollars and be included in the company's securities services revenue, which last year amounted to $3.6 billion. JPMorgan's total reported revenue for the entire company was $95.7 billion in 2016 and its net income was $24.7 billion. Still, the deal is the kind of prize sought by Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's chief executive officer for corporate and investment banking. Pinto, speaking to investors in February, named custody and fund services as one of his most important business lines and a focus of management attention "with technology being at the core of it." Executives at State Street, meanwhile, said on a conference call that the loss of BlackRock assets is not part of a broader trend. The bank said it won $1.4 trillion in new asset servicing commitments in 2016. Still, the developments unsettled investors. State Street shares tumbled to $74.45 at the opening bell, before recovering some of the lost ground, rising to $77.43.

NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 is finally here. After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by crossing over that key level for the first time ever. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up a stunning 1,667 points since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. “The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump’s plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. “The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it’s a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: Dow Almost 20,000. One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. “We’ve scaled this peak. We’re going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan’s Kelly worries that “markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives” such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. “We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly,” Quinlan said. Yardeni said the verdict is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. “Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that’s bullish for the economy,” he said. “The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don’t want to bet against him.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Watch our free movie channel KPLR’s digital channel 11.1 shows hit movies.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: This Budget could be the toughest test of Modi's life. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage MUMBAI: Billionaire Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta Resources, state-run NTPC and Jain Irrigation have raised $1 billion, 500 million euros and $200 million respectively through offshore bond-sales, as corporate houses are hurrying to tap the global bond market ahead of an expected steep rise in US rates. Vedanta raised $1 billion by selling bonds to overseas investors as the London-headquartered metals and mining company is looking to refinance its existing debt, a move, which according to analysts, should help lower the company's borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the nation’s biggest power producer, NTPC, raised 500 million euros in what could be the first longest tenor euro-denominated issuance by an Indian company. Vedanta offered securities at 6.375% with five year maturity and the company will be refinancing a part of its 2018 and 2019 maturities and extended average debt maturity, it said in a statement. This is the largest single tranche G3 high-yield bond issue ex-Japan since 2015, it added. G3 bonds are issued in US dollars, yen and euro. The bond was subscribed mostly by global asset managers, sources told ET. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays were some of the banks that helped the company to raise funds. The company has obtained an order book of $2.3 billion, of which it has retained the target of $1 billion. NTPC sold euro-denominated bonds with 10-year maturity, the longest in the currency. The issue got bids for $2.4 billion, or nearly five times the targeted size. Securities have been priced at 200 basis points over Euro Treasury. “The company has obtained a tighter pricing from its initial guidance (225 bps spread),” said Shashikant Rathi, head of treasuries and markets, Axis Bank. “Investors have showed stronger appetite for good quality Indian credit.” Axis Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays are some of the investment bankers to the NTPC deal. Jain International Trading B.V, an offshore subsidiary of Jain Irrigation raised $200 million via its debut green bonds sold to overseas investors. ET reported on January 11 about the NTPC bond sale while Vedanta’s and Jain Irrigation's issuances were reported on January 17. Vedanta has some loans maturing next year and the company is selling the paper to refinance those. Vedanta plans to use the proceeds from this offering primarily to fund its offer to purchase its outstanding $750 million, 9.50%, bonds due 2018 and $1.2 billion 6.00% bonds due 2019, and to repay its other existing indebtedness, Goldman Sachs said in a note. “This is a positive for the stock as it should take down the average interest payable which reduces pressure on cash flow and highlights the company’s resolve to actively manage its upcoming maturities and term out its debt,” Goldman told its clients on Wednesday. Shares in Vedanta were trading 1.1% higher on London Stock Exchange, while NTPC closed 0.8% lower on the Bombay Stock Exchange, underperforming the benchmark Sensex that gained 1.2%.

By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Dow 20,000 is finally here. After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The Dow climbed 156 points to 20,069 and was joined in record territory by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up more than 1,700 points since President Donald Trump's victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. "The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval.

CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing "greed," a vast improvement from "extreme fear" mere days before the election.

The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. “The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it’s a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index is flashing “greed,” a vast improvement from “extreme fear” mere days before the election. The VIX, a gauge of volatility in the markets, has dropped to the lowest level since July 2014. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: “Dow Almost 20,000.” One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. “We’ve scaled this peak. We’re going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan’s Kelly worries that “markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives” such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. “We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly,” Quinlan said. Yardeni said the jury is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. “Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that’s bullish for the economy?” he asked. “The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don’t want to bet against him.” 40.712784 -74.005941 Related stories Trump Signs Executive Orders on Building US-Mexico Border Wall, Punishing ‘Sanctuary Cities’ Trump Calls for ‘Major Investigation’ Into Unproven Voter Fraud Claims Trump’s Election Win in Church of Scientology’s East Hollywood Neighborhood Was Rare GOP Victory in L.A.

After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The Dow climbed 156 points to 20,069 and was joined in record territory by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up more than 1,700 points since President Donald Trump's victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. "The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again," said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump's plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. Related: The Dow's long road to 20,000 But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama.

Bloomberg News and Reuters Published Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 9:32AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 3:54PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canadian stocks climbed to a record on Wednesday, joining a global rally in stocks amid expectations of stronger global growth as U.S. President Donald Trump tries to shift the U.S. economy into higher gear. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose as much as 0.4 per cent to 15,674.30, topping the previous closing record of 15,657.63 set on Sept. 3, 2014. The intraday record is 15,685.13 points. The Canadian benchmark surged 18 per cent last year, tops among the world’s developed markets, and has added about 2.4 per cent this year. The Canadian stocks rally follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge past 20,000 for the first time, with investors counting on a Trump administration to usher in lower taxes and boost spending on infrastructure, stimulating the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump’s moves on Tuesday to advance construction of TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast has given added vigor to energy stocks. “It seems to be the Trump effect,” Ian Nakamoto, equity specialist with Raymond James Ltd., which manages about $34-billion in assets, said. “He’s attempting to grow the U.S. economy. Canada does well when economic growth improves in the U.S. We’re more economically sensitive to financial services, materials, and energy. And these are all sectors that have come back to life.” David Rosenberg: What Trump’s victory really means for the markets (for subscribers) Ian McGugan: Markets become doubtful that all will be rosy under Trump (for subscribers Rob Carrick: TSX at record: Why it’s time to adjust your portfolio as optimism reigns (for subscribers) The equity rally also reflects renewed optimism for the Canadian economy as oil and commodity prices rally. Canada created 53,700 jobs in December, shattering economists’ forecasts, and the country recorded its first trade surplus in more than two years. Canada is poised to benefit from U.S expansion, driving growth closer to 2 per cent in 2017 and 2018, from about 1.3 per cent in 2016, according to economists’ estimates. Natural resources led the way to the record, with raw-materials and energy the two top industries in the S&P/TSX in the past 12 months with gains of 66 per cent and 42 per cent respectively. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., the Vancouver-based metals miner with projects in Africa, is the top stock in the index over that time frame, up more than seven-fold. Crude prices also remain buoyant after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to production cuts on Nov. 30 for the first time in eight years. West Texas Intermediate for March delivery slipped 39 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $52.79 a barrel at 10:38 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and has gained about 74 per cent in the past 12 months. Oil’s rebound puts more than two years of hardship for Canada’s oil patch in the rear view mirror, as prices plummeted since 2014 to a trough of $26.21 last February. The wildfires near Fort McMurray, Alta., in May also hampered Canada’s oil-sands production, weakening the nation’s economic output and spreading its impact to other industries, including the lenders. Mr. Trump’s signing of an executive order to advance Keystone, which would ease the flow of Canadian crude to the U.S., has also stoked the energy sector, sending TransCanada’s shares up as much as 1.6 percent to a record on Wednesday. The nation’s financial stocks have also been on a tear of late, leading the benchmark gauge with a 12 percent advance in the past three months after posting largely improving earnings at the end of last year. The results show the strength of Canada’s banking system, with lenders emerging little scathed from a low oil-price environment. The market rally has stretched valuations in Canada. The companies in the index trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 24, levels not seen since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, the record-setting S&P 500 in the U.S. trades at 21 times earnings. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets who a year ago accurately called for a year-end level of 15,300 for the TSX, sees more modest gains in 2017. He calls for the index to end 2017 at 16,000, implying a 4.7-per-cent gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended gains in late morning trading after hitting 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday as strong earnings and President Donald Trump’s pro-growth comments and initiatives reignited a post-election rally. Trump has taken several business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday, including signing executive orders to clear the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes also hit record intraday highs, amid gains across sectors. The Dow came within a point of the historic mark on Jan. 6, as investors banked on pro-growth policies and tax cuts many expect from the new administration. However, the index had struggled in recent weeks as investors grew cautious as they looked for clarity on the new administration’s policies. “It’s a milestone,” said Thomas Roth, head of U.S. Treasury trading at MUFG Securities in New York. “It reflects the belief that the pledged tax cuts, deregulation and other fiscal stimulus is going to be more business friendly and grow profits.” Trump tweeted “Great!#Dow20K”. Sentiment has also been helped by better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Of the 104 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, nearly 70 per cent have beaten expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Earnings (growth) hasn’t been bad and there is some surprise to the upside too,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. If the Dow remains above 20,000 by closing time, the 42-session surge from the first close above 19,000 would mark the second-shortest length of time between such milestones. The most rapid rise was between 10,00 and 11,000 from March 29 to May 3, which took 24 days. The rise from 18,000 to 19,000 took the Dow 483 trading sessions. The surge since Nov. 22, when the index closed above 19,000 for the first time, has been spearheaded by financial stocks - with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan accounting for about 20 percent of the gain. On Wednesday, Boeing rose 4 per cent after its earnings and IBM gained 1.7 percent, helping to push the index over the top. Goldman rose 0.9 percent. The Dow was up 153.51 points, or 0.77 per cent, at 20,066.22. Of its 30 components, only five stocks were lower. The S&P 500 was up 15.27 points, or 0.67 per cent, at 2,295.34 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 45.47 points, or 0.81 per cent, at 5,646.42. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by a 1.05-per-cent rise in financials. Utilities, real estate and telecom services - defensive parts of the market - were the outliers. Oil prices fell on Wednesday after builds in U.S. inventories reinforced expectations that increasing shale output this year would reduce the impact of production cuts by OPEC and other major exporters. Benchmark Brent crude was down 52 cents a barrel at $54.92. U.S. light crude was down 40 cents at $52.78. The U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude, gasoline and diesel stockpiles rose, confirming a report from the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, late Tuesday, which was seen as bearish. The EIA data, however, showed a substantial build in gasoline stockpiles of 6.8 million barrels, exceeding analysts expectations and the API’s report. U.S. gasoline crack spreads, or refining margins, fell to a session low of $12.20 a barrel after the data was released, the lowest since Dec. 14. Oil prices have found support in recent weeks from plans by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to reduce output. Around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) has already been removed from the market of the 1.8 million bpd agreed by oil major producers starting on Jan. 1, energy ministers said on Sunday, as producers look to reduce oversupply. Bernstein Energy said global oil inventories declined by 24 million barrels to 5.7 billion barrels in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous quarter. The amount remaining equates to about 60 days of world oil consumption.

The Dow crossed 19,000 on Nov. 22 and continued to gain, as the Trump trade swept the market higher. The best performing Dow stocks since then are Goldman Sachs, Disney and Boeing. Gains in Caterpillar, Boeing, JPMorgan and Travelers helped push the Dow across the 20,000 marker on the opening Wednesday. "Individual investors have started buying again, really since the election," said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. "A psychological number like 20,000 helps to continue that trend, helps to bring in investors that have been sitting in cash and it really helps to keep the money flow coming in. We see this as a positive year, largely because of the individual investor, and not just corporations buying back stock any more." Kleintop added that he sees modest gains for the market. The move higher was not a straight line. Stocks lost some momentum in the last several weeks while the market consolidated gains. "We do think bigger picture, this bull market, out into next year should continue," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. "It took a little bit longer than I expected to get to 20,000, and the recent consolidation was nice to work off the overbought conditions coming into this year." Detrick said while 20,000 is getting the attention, the action under the surface is encouraging and in some ways more important. He said the rally in small caps Tuesday and Wednesday signals that they may regain leadership which would be a plus for the overall market. Detrick said the previous record for a 1,000-point gain was 24 days from the time the Dow first crossed 10,000 to 11,000, in 1999. "Normally it takes 24 months to go from each thousand-point level. We did it in two months," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The Dow has closed at record highs 17 times since Election Day. It came within 0.037 point — 19,999.63 — during the Jan. 6 trading day. The first trip to to a five-digit number was a big event for the stock market, when the Dow reached 10,000 in 1999, the height of the tech bubble. But it was a failed start, and the Dow crashed back to the 6,547 in the depths of the financial crisis in March 2009 before returning to 10,000 later that year. "It took 17 years. That's a long time to double in value," said Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel. "We were at the top of the biggest bubble at the end of 1999 that we've ever been in. This is nowhere like the bubble we had before. I think the market is much more reasonably valued than when we hit 10,000." Siegel expects the market to keep moving higher on the back of promises from President Donald Trump to cut taxes and regulations, but it will have to see action to keep moving. "I don't think we're going to get to 21,000 as fast as we went from 19,000 to 20,000. It's going to take a quarter," said Siegel. Trump has suggested tariffs for companies that move out of the U.S. and has said he wants to change trade deals. Those things concerned investors during the election, and traders are eyeing his moves on trade. "That is a risk out there. Probably if we knew for sure he wasn't going that way, the market would be even higher than it is," said Siegel. Analysts say the market could consolidate after it hits 20,000 and while it waits to see more signs that the economy is stronger and will support improving earnings. Reaching 21,000 too quickly would be a negative. "I would really get scared if that were the case. We're already in the beginning of a 'FOMO' environment — fear of missing out," said Stovall. Stovall said on average, the market rose another 4 percent over the next 2½ months after the Dow reached a new 1,000-point milestone. Then it would decline by 5 percent or more. There were two times when it did not digest gains before reaching the next 1,000 threshold. Once was the move to 11,000 in 1999, and then again in 2007. "The longer we go, it's more borrowed time," said Stovall. "I would say that we would experience a pullback, or a correction but definitely not a correction." Stovall points out the bull market is set to enter its eighth year on March 9. "Bull markets go out with a bang, not a whimper. It makes me feel confident that we're not coming to the end of a bull market," he said. Detrick said he expects to see Dow 21,000 in 2017. "You don't want it to make 21,000 too fast. That could be some sort of blow off equity top." Stovall said big numbers don't really mean much but they can excite investors. "It's like a gigantic magnet that pulls investors towards it, and sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The question is what happens once we eclipse it?" He said the millennium levels are like rusty doors, requiring several pushes before they break open. "Usually that honeymoon period lasts for 100 days, and interesting that the honeymoon ends in April, the traditional sell-in-May period," he said. It's a positive that financial stocks are leading the Dow's gains, but it's because there are expectations of higher rates and that some banking regulations will be lifted. "The financials is much more of a Trump situation because of the expected lifting of regulatory pressures, combined with the Fed's effort which would steepen the yield curve and improve their net interest income prospects," said Stovall. Stovall said the financials are an early-cycle mover. "They're sort of like the Dow Transports, from a Dow theory perspective. They have to confirm upward moves," he said. Since just before the election on Nov. 1, the financial sector was up 18 percent, followed by materials, up 12.5 percent and industrials, up 11 percent. Consumer discretionary is up 8.6 percent. Those sectors could continue to gain. "Since 1990, the cyclical sectors, materials and discretionary and tech have traditionally outperformed the S&P 77 percent of the time in the November through April period," he said.

After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The Dow climbed 156 points to 20,069 and was joined in record territory by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up more than 1,700 points since President Donald Trump's victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. "The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again," said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump's plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. Related: The Dow's long road to 20,000 But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank's massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. "The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it's a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Related: Biggest threats to the Trump market rally Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is flashing "greed," a vast improvement from "extreme fear" mere days before the election. The VIX (VIX), a gauge of volatility in the markets, has dropped to the lowest level since July 2014. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: "Dow Almost 20,000." One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. "We've scaled this peak. We're going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button," said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Related: Today's Dow is a lot different from just 20 year ago Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan's Kelly worries that "markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives" such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump's anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. "We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly," Quinlan said. Yardeni said the jury is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. "Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that's bullish for the economy?" he asked. "The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don't want to bet against him."

Investors should buy JetBlue shares because the company is significantly undervalued compared with other airlines with similar fundamentals, according to JPMorgan, which upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral. "JetBlue continues to pursue a more returns-oriented strategy with separate fare classes and first-checked-bag fees, which in turn drives healthier margins," analyst Jamie Baker wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "We also applaud the JetBlue management team's willingness to not only participate in industry pricing increases led by other airlines but also to initiate fare increases of its own." JetBlue has a "very favorable valuation on both an absolute and a relative basis when compared to Southwest and Spirit," he added. "We believe JetBlue shares can outperform its peers." The airline will report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, according to its website.

Revenue also exceeded forecasts. The company's full-year outlook fell short of Street estimates, however. Boeing also expects to deliver 760 to 765 jets this year, compared to 748 last year. United Technologies — United Technologies matched estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.56 per share. Revenue was also in line with expectations. The results were improved over a year ago, helped by better sales at the Pratt & Whitney engine unit. Textron — The maker of Bell Helicopters and Cessna aircraft reported adjusted quarterly profit of 80 cents per share, missing estimates by 7 cents a share. Its full-year outlook also fell short of Street forecasts. Separately, Textron announced a deal to buy recreational vehicle maker Arctic Cat for $247 million, or $18.50 per share in cash. Apple — Apple is close to striking a tax and incentives deal with Indian government officials to manufacture products in India, according to The Wall Street Journal. Gap Inc. — The apparel retailer announced the departure of Banana Republic unit president Andi Owen late next month. The apparel retailer's CEO, Art Peck, will oversee Banana Republic while the company searches for a successor. JetBlue — JPMorgan Chase upgraded the airline's stock to "overweight" from "neutral," while downgrading Southwest to "neutral" from "overweight," based on current valuations and near term passenger revenue figures. Alcoa — Alcoa reported adjusted quarterly profit of 14 cents per share, 10 cents a share below estimates. The aluminum producer's revenue was above estimates on higher prices.

Michaels Cos. — Michaels gave weaker-than-expected guidance, as well as announcing a secondary stock offering of 18 million shares. The shares are currently held by company stockholders, with the arts and crafts retailer intending to repurchase eight million of those shares. Texas Instruments — Texas Instruments beat estimates by 6 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 88 cents per share. The chipmaker's revenue also exceeded Street forecasts. Texas Instruments was helped by particularly strong results in its automotive and industrial markets. Capital One Financial — Capital One fell 15 cents a share shy of consensus estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.45 per share. The credit card company also saw revenue fall short. The shortfall was due in part to a 27 percent jump in the company's provision for credit losses. Discover Financial — Discover reported quarterly profit of $1.40 per share, 2 cents a share above estimates. The credit card issuer's revenue was slightly higher than forecasts. Discover saw strong loan growth, although its customer delinquency rate also rose. Intuitive Surgical — The company exceeded Street forecasts by 10 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $6.09 per share. The surgical products maker's revenue beat consensus, as well. Revenue rose by double digits, although the company is also accelerating its spending. Stryker — Stryker beat estimates by 2 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.78 per share. Revenue was very slightly above forecasts, however the medical device maker said sales and profits would improve at a slower pace in 2017. Cree — Cree doubled estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 20 cents per share. The LED lighting products maker also saw revenue exceeding estimates. Seagate Technology — Seagate reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.38 per share, 30 cents a share higher than forecasts. The hard disk maker's revenue came in above estimates, as well. Seagate is seeing strong demand for cloud-based products, shifting emphasis away from traditional storage. Cisco Systems — Cisco announced a deal to buy software maker AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. AppDynamics was in the process of planning an initial public offering and had been expected to price tonight. Cisco made the deal with an eye toward boosting its enterprise software product lineup. Wells Fargo — The bank's branch managers were warned at least 24 hours in advance when internal inspections were about to take place, according to The Wall Street Journal. The story focused on how the improper sales practices that recently came to light could have gone on for as long as they did. Bob Evans Farms — Bob Evans is selling its restaurant business to private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital for $565 million. Bob Evans will now focus on its packaged food business. Plains All American Pipeline — Plains is buying a crude oil gathering system in the Permian Basin from Concho Resources for about $1.22 billion.

Gone were the skyscrapers and subways. In their place was a corporate campus with a pond and vast parking lots, flanked by rows of new town houses, some inhabited by employees. The on-site culinary options? A cafeteria and some food trucks. Suddenly, Slover had to relearn to drive. “It’s hard—it’s not Manhattan,” says Slover, 52, who spent her career in the Northeast before becoming the regional head of the bank’s operations in Jacksonville and Cary, N.C. “Indian food at 11:30 at night does not exist.” Transplants from the city that never sleeps may feel at first like aliens in this northern Florida city 35 miles south of the Georgia border, but their numbers are growing. Global financial companies including Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and Sydney-based Macquarie Group have been moving executives here and hiring locally, even while paring staff elsewhere. It’s part of a Wall Street trend known as nearshoring, in which banks are moving operations away from expensive financial centers like New York to places such as Jacksonville and North Carolina’s Research Triangle. Also in Jacksonville are more than 19,000 employees of Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has established operations in Salt Lake City, and UBS has a site in Nashville. It’s a way to improve profitability without going overseas. Conveniently, it also happens to comport with President Trump’s demands that employers keep good jobs on U.S. soil. In the early days, investment banks mainly transplanted back-office workers such as accountants, technology staff, and lawyers. But in Deutsche Bank’s case, the Jacksonville campus has grown into the company’s second-largest U.S. location. The bank has about 2,000 employees there—up from 1,400 in 2013—and plans to add more in 2017. Increasingly, the site is a microcosm of its U.S. business, even the trading functions. On campus, in a building alongside the man-made pond, a young team recruited from universities such as Emory and Vanderbilt sells securities in tandem with their counterparts in New York. When a client calls in an order, a Jacksonville salesman glances at a live video feed of desks at 60 Wall St., finds a trader standing by, and relays the order. Slover says the technology allows the two locations to function like one seamless floor. She’s come to enjoy living in Florida, noting it has more elbow room than Manhattan and the people are unusually nice. According to Jones Lang LaSalle, high-end corporate office space in Jacksonville can be leased for about $22 a square foot, cheaper than all but four major U.S. cities tracked by the company. That’s about a quarter the rate in New York. Banks pay Jacksonville employees about 30 percent less on average than those in New York, according to Cathy Chambers, a senior vice president with the JaxUSA Partnership, a division of the local chamber of commerce. A financial analyst, for example, might earn $67,000 in Jacksonville, compared with $99,700 in New York. The local and state governments also offer tax incentives to lure companies. Illustration: Caroline David For Anthony Glenn, who runs an office Macquarie opened in Jacksonville last year, advantages include escaping for late-afternoon surf sessions at a local beach. Another perk is his 15-minute drive to work. He says his office includes people from 21 countries, plus big U.S. cities such as Houston, New York, and Philadelphia. Many of them came to escape punishing commutes from far-flung suburbs. “In most cases, it’s been a lifestyle decision,” Glenn says. “They’re weighing a compensation change vs. a huge increase in quality of life.” Macquarie’s Jacksonville office employs people whose jobs might otherwise have been filled in India. It provides a support staff that’s more convenient for its U.S.-based employees, while its Indian operation continues to focus on the Asia business. Jerry Mallot, president of JaxUSA, brushes aside criticism that Jacksonville can’t cater to big-city tastes. “We’re not New York, but we wouldn’t want to be New York,” he says. He points out that the city has its own NFL team, craft breweries, and “more golf courses than you could play in 10 years.” There’s a Tesla Motors store, too. Companies are eager to establish operations in a place with year-round sunshine and no state income tax, Mallot says. They typically start by transferring managers to the region, then build staffs by hiring from the area. The salaries are attractive by Jacksonville standards.

In a county that George W. Bush carried by more than 15 percentage points in two presidential elections, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percentage point. “In a lot of ways, Florida is the inverse of America: The more north you get, the more South you are,” Binder says, referring to cultural and political preferences. “But slowly this is changing, like a lot of the urban cities in the New South.” The bottom line: Former Wall Streeters are adjusting to Jacksonville, and they may be changing the city, too.

 GOLDMAN SACHS CEO: The markets were already great before Trump's win Portia Crowe Jan. 18, 2017, 3:57 PM 8,409 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman Sachs Stock markets have been on a tear since Donald Trump's electoral victory in November, but at least one Wall Street titan says the president-elect can't take all the credit. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Wednesday told CNBC that the market had been on the right path before the election and that the "Trump effect" simply added to the momentum. "I think one of the reasons why the election had such a dramatic effect is because it was drawing people in the direction that it was already heading," Blankfein said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "I think the markets were improving, you know, the Fed's focus on the likelihood of them raising rates, the growth was already in it," he said of the Federal Reserve. "We were already getting at or near full employment." Those factors, he said, were already "baked in" and provide a tailwind for Trump's "stimulative" platform. Goldman's own stock has helped lead the rally and is currently up about 26.7% since the election. His comments contrast those of other Wall Street CEOs who appear more bullish on Trump's plan for the economy. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan told CNBC that "some people are starting to spend in anticipation" of tax reform and repatriation resulting from Trump's election. "I've heard some CEOs here say, 'I'm going to invest faster now,'" he said. Of course, Blankfein said, Trump's message has filled investors with greater confidence. The president-elect has promised lower corporate taxes, more infrastructure spending, and less regulation, among other things. Blankfein added that the Trump effect did not result just from the difference between the new expectations and the status quo, but rather from the difference between the new expectations and what had been built in for a Hillary Clinton win. Blankfein said before the election that he was backing her bid for president. That said, Blankfein referred to the president-elect as simply "part of the macroenvironment." "It was going in this way, you know, the basic bones of the US economy is good," Blankfein said. "The balance sheets of companies and balance sheets of individuals had been fixed. Again, we've talked about full employment, wage growth ... so this is pushing in the direction of the momentum." When asked if he wished he had backed a different horse, given that Clinton had pushed for higher taxes and more regulation, Blankfein said there was more to it than just those two factors. "Let me put it this way: I am dying to look back at this and like the outcome of it, and I'm certainly going to behave in as supportive of a fashion as I possibly can to make sure that I like it," he said. Goldman Sachs reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat analysts' expectations.

The issue will be disclosed in the annual report to securities regulators, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said Tuesday. Lockheed said it hasn't identified any material errors in its financial results or balance as a result of the "control deficiencies" at the Black Hawk helicopter-maker. Lockheed's profit forecast for 2017 provided an additional source of disappointment. The outlook for 2017 of $12.25 to $12.55 a share missed the average analysts' estimate by about 50 cents and reflected an unexpected drop in pension income, Seth Seifman, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, said in a note to clients. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The defense company has a track record of providing an initially conservative assessment of the year and then beating its guidance, said Douglas Rothacker, a defense analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Lockheed tumbled as much as 3.3 percent, the biggest intraday decline since Dec. 12, the day Trump first took aim at the costs of the F-35 in a Twitter outburst. After Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson provided an update on her discussions with the president, the stock began to recover. The shares were down 1.8 percent to $252.94 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. "The meetings that we've had have been very productive, very good dialogue," Hewson told analysts on a conference call. "He asked excellent questions and is really focused on making sure that the costs come down on the program." Lockheed is working with its suppliers to lower expenses for the most popular F-35 variant to $85 million per jet by 2019. Hewson said she suggested to Trump ways to save even more by changing the Pentagon's acquisitions process. "It's not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions," she said. As the largest U.S. government contractor, the company sets the stage for peers including Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics, which all report financial results later this week. Lockheed is typically a steady performer and has missed analysts' estimates only twice since 2008. Fourth-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates as the company delivered more Joint Strike Fighter, F-16 and other military aircraft. Earnings from continuing operations were $3.25 a share, the defense contractor said in the statement. That compared with the $3.05 predicted by analysts. Revenue was $13.8 billion, while analysts anticipated $13 billion, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net sales for Lockheed's aeronautics unit, its largest division, rose 23 percent to $5.41 billion in the fourth quarter. About $640 million of the sales gain came from higher aircraft production for the F-35 and retrofits of existing aircraft. The results and forecast provide a better look at Lockheed's performance and core businesses after a series of transactions that reshaped its business model to focus on military aircraft. Lockheed acquired Sikorsky, the largest defense helicopter manufacturer, while shedding non-government information technology units. During its first assessment of the financial reporting controls after the purchase, Lockheed found that its new business unit didn't "adequately identify, design and implement appropriate" internal controls for its processes and information technology systems, according to the earnings statement. The manufacturer expects to fix the issues this year. » Next page...
