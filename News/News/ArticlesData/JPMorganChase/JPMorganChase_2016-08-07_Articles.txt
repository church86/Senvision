 TOP IPO BANKER: We have 'a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch' Portia Crowe Aug. 8, 2016, 4:29 PM 3,806 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan's Liz Myers. Screenshot/Bloomberg TV It's been a slow year for the initial public offering, or IPO, market — but things could start to really pick up soon. That's what JPMorgan's global head of equity capital markets, Liz Myers, expects. She said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that JPMorgan has more than 20 IPOs slated for launch globally in September, and a "full pipeline" for 2017. "It's a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch," Myers said. She also noted that the firm expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Those will mainly be smaller deals in software, Myers said, although we'll start to see larger tech IPOs in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, she added, we can expect to see activity in the virtual-reality, artificial-intelligence, and robotics spaces. She also said that Asia will see some larger IPOs toward the end of 2016 and into 2017. The largest tech IPO this year was the Japanese messaging app Line, which raised about $1 billion in its July debut on the Tokyo and New York stock exchanges. In addition to the tech sector, Myers said to expect more deals in the financial-services, healthcare, and consumer-retail sectors. She said that investors right now are not overly worried about the outcome of the US presidential election in November, nor are they overly cautious about the activities of the Federal Reserve. "Right now the reception [to IPOs] has been pretty good across a multitude of sectors," Myers said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:45 PM, August 7, 2016 LONDON - Italy's troubled lenders are offering lucrative opportunities for investment banks, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> set to pay some of the highest fees in Europe this year to arrange its high stakes rescue plan. The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros ($278.43 million) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank's market value currently stands at 747 million euros. "The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial," said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy's largest lender, UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi's poor showing in the tests - which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn - came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly $304 million for its 5 billion capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> paid about 119 million euros ($133.18 million) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank's rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hoover up Monte dei Paschi's bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan - which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility - is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. RISKY DEAL The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi's history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone's third largest economy. "It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction," said a London-based analyst who stressed the "country risk" adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday "this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment." The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world's oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. The absence of financial support from the government also pushes up the size of the fees. Freeman consulting estimates the fees will be between 2.5 and 4 percent of the overall equity raised compared to 0.5 to 1 percent if the government were to intervene. Adding to the overall uncertainty in Italy is a referendum on constitutional reform that Renzi called for October. He has said he will stand down if he loses support - a gamble that could revive market turbulence in Italy just before the planned November cash call. FIGHTING FOR BUSINESS For large investment banks Monte dei Paschi is seen as a portal to other lucrative deals including the upcoming capital hike for UniCredit. "Industries that restructure and reconfigure create lots of fees and it's important to be there," said Hahn. Until June, UBS and Citigroup had acted as Monte dei Paschi's main advisors. For the past two years they have tried to find the bank a merger partner without success. The Swiss bank, under its charismatic investment bank president Andrea Orcel, also acted as global coordinator for Monte dei Paschi's previous capital hikes in 2014 and 2015. However JPMorgan, whose lending, trading and investing activities in Italy amounted to $6.8 billion in 2015, won government's support for its rescue plan in July, along with Mediobanca, after its chief executive Jamie Dimon met Renzi in Rome, sources said. As a result, the U.S. bank - which has Italy's former finance minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa - will be one of the top earners in Monte dei Paschi's overhaul if the plan goes ahead, sources said. It has offered to arrange a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to help Monte dei Paschi gain breathing space to engineer the securitization of its bad loans while seeking to raise cash. Banks which sign up to the loan will end up holding chunks of Monte dei Paschi's debt if they fail to find investors - a risk that JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon says he is willing to take.     "If we could pull something like that off, that would be great for Italy," he said in a CNBC interview.    REUTERS mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Yellen says Fed could raise interest rates 'relatively soon' With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership With tougher rules, China wants fewer, but better, electric car makers With S$4 billion port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore’s pie What are the differences between millennial and traditional leadership?

Stewart, 35, is charged with passing tips on five health-care mergers to his father, Bob Stewart, from 2011 to 2014. He testified Monday in his insider-trading trial that he lied when he told lawyers that he hadn’t given his father any information about Kendle International Inc. Instead, Stewart testified, he often talked about work with his father and other family members, never thinking the information would be used to make trades. “I did not want to get in trouble,” he said on cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Cucinella. “I did not want my father to get in trouble.” “You lied to the people that were sitting right across from you, right?” Cucinella asked. “I did,” Stewart said. He testified that he was questioned by the compliance staff after his father’s name showed up on a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority list of people who traded in Kendle stock around the time the acquisition by INC Research LLC was announced. At an August 2011 meeting at the Yale Club in Manhattan, Sean said, he confronted his father about the trades. Risky Move Stewart was questioned in Manhattan federal court for an hour and a half Monday, his second day on the witness stand. He testified in a risky move to convince jurors that he was unaware his father was using information gleaned from discussions about work, the family and other matters.  “My dad made some terrible mistakes,” Sean Stewart testified. “He used me.” Sean Stewart left JPMorgan Chase for Perella Weinberg Partners LP in October 2011, where he continued providing tips to his father, according to prosecutors. Sean testified that the elder Stewart had promised never again to trade on information his son acquired at work. Claudia Stewart, Sean’s mother and the wife of Bob Stewart for 39 years, told jurors that she, Sean’s brother Ryan and their wives were almost always present when Sean and Bob Stewart were together. She said she never noticed them speaking privately. “I would say, ‘What’s going on, what’s the issue?’” if she had seen them talking one-on-one, she said. “I’d probably think they were talking about me, because that’s how I am.” Before the trial began, Sean’s lawyers tried to force Bob Stewart to testify as a defense witness. At a hearing, Bob pleaded his Fifth Amendment right against incriminating himself. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain agreed with Bob’s lawyers that he couldn’t be forced to take the witness stand. Father’s Gain Prosecutors said that Sean Stewart benefited from his father’s insider trades when Bob Stewart used $10,055 to pay for the photographer at his son’s June 2011 wedding. Claudia Stewart testified that the couple also paid a $7,200 photographer’s bill for the wedding of Sean’s brother the following month. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

She and Sean both became tearful when his lawyer, Martin Cohen, showed jurors photos of what she called “happy family times,” including Sean with Bob in the pool, on the Little League team coached by Bob, and at a party for Ryan’s high school graduation. The relationship with his father is “damaged, perhaps permanently damaged,” Sean said at the conclusion of questioning by his attorney.  “He is my father, and he raised me,” Sean said. “And I love him, and I always will.” Both sides delivered closing arguments after Sean and Claudia Stewart’s testimony. "Five times, the defendant handed his father tomorrow’s news today, so he could make some fast cash on stolen information," Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Eddy McCallum told jurors. ‘Foolish Man’ McCallum told jurors that if Sean Stewart, a Yale University graduate and successful investment banker, told the truth about not knowing his father was trading on the details of the deals they discussed, he would have to be "a naïve, foolish man." McCallum called the idea "ridiculous," telling jurors Sean is instead "remarkably polished." Martin Cohen, a lawyer for Stewart, told jurors that his client was victimized by his father. "How could a father do what Robert Stewart did here to Sean Stewart?" he asked. "He never intended his father would take that information and trade on it." Cohen said the father merely picked up company names from conversations with Sean, knowing that his son specialized in healthcare mergers. Cohen said the government’s star witness, Bob’s friend and trading partner, Richard Cunniffe, lied when he implicated Sean Stewart in the insider-trading conspiracy. Swain said jurors will begin deliberating tomorrow after she instructs them on the law that applies to the case. The case is U.S. v. Stewart, 15-cr-00287, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Morgan Chase's stock extends gains despite downgrade at Citigroup By Tomi Kilgore Published: Aug 8, 2016 9:44 a.m. ET Share By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s stock JPM, +0.59% was downgraded Monday by Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz, who said he was no longer bullish at current levels as he believes investors and analysts are a bit too optimistic. He downgraded the stock to neutral, after being at buy since April 2014. Horowitz believes the banking giant is one of the most favored among buy side and sell side analysts, with more than three quarters of analysts rating it the equivalent of a buy. As a result, he said he believes 2017 and 2018 earnings estimates are about 2% too high. "In this environment, you want to rent not buy the banks," Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. "In a prolonged low rate-growth environment, we believe the banks are more trading range stocks and we believe the time to add to positions is when sentiment is negative." The stock was up 0.2% in morning trade. It has run up 7.4% over the past month to close Friday in positive territory for the year for the first time. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.23% has gained 6.6% year to date.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Researchers or lobbyists? Think tanks blur the line print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2605356 false Greg Kahn / The New York Times The Brookings Institution, which operates on a $100 million annual budget, twice what it was a decade ago, is located in Washington, D.C. Think tanks are seen as independent, but their scholars often push donors’ agendas, amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington. Click here to enlarge images 2605364 false T.J. Kirkpatrick / The New York Times Martin Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, speaks during a panel discussion at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. in December. Indyk said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar Corp. to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. Click here to enlarge images Researchers or lobbyists? Think tanks blur the line By Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams / New York Times News Service Published Aug 8, 2016 at 12:02AM WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corp., one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake and later offered to help Lennar “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status. Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; KKR, the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin Indyk, Brookings’ executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” But he acknowledged the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” Buying influence? At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’ agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study had been completed. When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Kempe said. 14697002 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 Monte dei Paschi woes add to huge investment fees LONDON: Italy’s troubled lenders are offering lucrative opportunities for investment banks, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena set to pay some of the highest fees in Europe this year to arrange its high stakes rescue plan. The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros (US$278.43mil) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank’s market value currently stands at 747 million euros. “The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial,” said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy’s largest lender, UniCredit, was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi’s poor showing in the tests – which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn – came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly US$304mil for its 5 billion euro capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid about 119 million euros (US$133.18mil) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank’s rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle to hoover up Monte dei Paschi’s bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan – which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility – is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi’s history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone’s third largest economy. “It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction,” said a London-based analyst who stressed the “country risk” adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca chief executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday “this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment.” The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world’s oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , italy Related Stories Will Italy leave the EU? ‘Aye’ for Italy’s third largest bank Renzi’s gamble gets real for investors Banca Ifis may buy US$2.2bil bad loans Mortgages show how difficult it is to rescue Italian banks You May Be Interested PPB Group’s Q3 earnings boosted by Wilmar’s contribution Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Lavishing patrons with ‘arty’ delights M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Setting the tone for markets, the U.S. non-farm payroll report released Friday showed the U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, beating expectations for 180,000. Good news on the jobs front may spur the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates sooner than the market had expected. Other factors may also spur volatility in markets. "Seasonal September quarter weakness along with risks around Italian banks, the Fed and global growth generally could still see more volatility in shares in the short term," said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital in a note to clients. Health-check for China There are several important data releases in China this week, including trade, inflation, industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investments. "In July, we expect that overall economic growth momentum remained largely stable," said economists Helen Qiao, Xiaojia Zhi and Sylia Sheng at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The economists said they expected the on-year growth of real industrial production and nominal fixed asset investment to have gone up last month, supported by the "resilience in infrastructure construction demand and favorable base effects." They expected industrial production growth to edge up to 6.3 percent on-year, up from 6.2 percent in June. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a separate note that the slowing fixed investment growth was "partly driven by weak private investment." "From the industry perspective, it appears investment in the traditional industries, such as mining and metals, have underperformed significantly, while investment in the new and services industries ... [have] outperformed notably," the JPMorgan analysts said. But both sets of market watchers agreed that the recent floods in southern China could throw a wrench in the works as they likely disrupted "real activities," which meant the data print could come in lower than expected. Central bank watch in the region After the Bank of Japan increased its purchase of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a new record low, markets will be looking at central banks in India, New Zealand and South Korea, all due to meet this week, to see if they also followed up with additional easing. The Reserve Bank of India's outgoing Governor Raghuram Rajan will present his final bi-monthly policy review on Tuesday before stepping down in September. Moody's Analytics said in a note Friday it expects the India central bank to keep the repo rate at 6.5 percent and that the RBI is unlikely to cut until the "monsoon season finishes in September." In New Zealand, the central bank will meet on Thursday and some market watchers expected interest rates could be slashed further. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said in its latest economic update released in July that prospects for growth in the global economy had diminished despite "very stimulatory monetary policy and low oil prices," and that financial volatility had increased following the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. Kate Hickie and Paul Dales from Capital Economics said they expected the RBNZ to cut interest rates from 2.25 percent to 2 percent and to "confirm that it is willing to reduce rates further." They said a "stubbornly high exchange rate, low inflation expectations and subdued wage growth" could likely see an additional rate cut below 2 percent. Earnings season Down Under After a handful of companies, including miner Rio Tinto, released quarterly earnings last week, several big names were set to release their results this week, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Telstra and News Corp. Economic conditions have somewhat improved since the beginning of the year, after oil and other resource prices stabilized and China's economy found its footing again. AMP Capital's Oliver said sectors likely to see good profits included discretionary retail, industrials, gaming and healthcare. "Expect disappointers to be punished severely with sharp share price falls," he warned.

He has said he will stand down if he loses the vote, a gamble that could revive market turbulencejust before the planned November cash call.

Quotes in the article Southwestern Energy Co SWN ▲ 11.41 +0.35 +3.16% Diamondback Energy Inc FANG ▲ 100.81 +1.61 +1.62% Callon Petroleum Co CPE ▲ 16.23 +0.39 +2.45% Pioneer Natural Resources Co PXD ▲ 184.43 +1.33 +0.73% As oil traded above $100 a barrel earlier this decade, JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and other U.S. banks doled out more than $110 billion of loans to finance a drilling boom -- all the while helping their clients borrow additional cash through bond sales. Now that prices have gone bust, the banks are reaping a bounty of fees underwriting stock sales for financially distressed energy producers, which in turn are using the proceeds to pay down their loans. And here's the kicker: Some of those oil companies are already taking out fresh loans -- often from the same banks -- to pay for new drilling projects. The episode highlights the role big banks have played as handmaidens in the oil and gas industry's latest boom-and-bust cycle, while demonstrating their ability to profit in downturns as well as upturns. For the energy markets, the recent flurry of fund-raising could delay a shakeout among crude producers, helping them to maintain output and raising the specter of prolonged prices below $45 a barrel. "Wall Street has an exceptional business model," said Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer and bank analyst who's now an adjunct finance professor at New York University. "It collects fees from its corporate clients in both fat and lean times." The benefit to banks' bottom lines showed up this month, when JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup all beat analysts' estimates for second-quarter results. The surprise, according to executives, came at least partly because the lenders didn't need to sock away as much money as expected to cover energy-loan losses. While oil prices have rallied from as low as $26 in February, a big driver was the producers' newfound ability to raise money in capital markets, following a drought in investor demand earlier in the year, Citigroup CFO John Gerspach told analysts on a July 15 conference call. In some cases, the companies used stock-sale proceeds to pay down loans. In other cases, the added capital simply made it easier for banks to reclassify distressed borrowers as healthy. Southwestern Energy , a natural-gas producer that's lost $6.4 billion in the last six quarters, raised $1.25 billion in June through a stock sale managed by Credit Suisse , Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo , among others. Most of the firms were members of lender consortiums that previously had provided Southwestern with as much as $2.75 billion of loans and credit lines. The banks also helped underwrite share offerings for Diamondback Energy , Callon Petroleum , Pioneer Natural Resources , Parsley Energy and QEP Resources , regulatory filings show. In all, Wall Street firms have sold more than $24 billion of stock on behalf of oil and gas companies this year, Hintz estimates. Based on a typical commission of at least 3% for a follow-on stock offering, that works out to more than $720 million of fees. The surge in offerings was made possible partly by the recent rally in stock markets, which in turn was fueled by speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks will delay raising interest rates -- or in some cases cut them -- to maintain economic growth. Many investors are also betting that the worst is over for oil-company stocks. "Things are freeing up a little bit," Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry told analysts on a July 15 conference call. "There's a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, of all forms," including junk-bond sales. U.S. stock offerings, which tumbled 41% in the second quarter versus a year earlier, were up an estimated 67% in July, Morgan Stanley estimated. Wall Street firms' role as both lenders and underwriters dates to the 1999 repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which barred commercial banks from selling stocks and corporate bonds. One of the chief goals of the original law was to keep banks from "issuing stock to the unsuspecting public to raise money so they could repay their loans," said Rajesh Narayanan, chair of the finance department at Louisiana State University.© TheStreet How Wall Street Made Millions From Big Oil's Boom -- And Its Bust While there's no evidence that such conflicts of interest are occurring now, it's indisputable that banks are benefitting from their ability to offer just about any financial service a company might need, Narayanan said. (Both the Democratic and Republican parties have called for reinstating Glass-Steagall, as a way of shrinking the power of big banks and curbing their risk-taking.) "We've set up financial institutions that are essentially one-stop shopping for corporations," said Samuel Hayes, a professor emeritus of investment banking at Harvard Business School. "If they're not in a position to take on more debt, the banks are ready to sell them equity." In an e-mail, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jessica Ong said that the choice of underwriter is "always at the discretion of the customer," noting that the San Francisco-based bank has been serving the energy industry for decades. She declined to discuss specific companies. The other banks declined to comment, while Southwestern executives didn't respond to requests for comment. For an example of how Wall Street's business model works in practice, take the case of Spring, Texas-based Southwestern. Started 87 years ago as a gas utility, the company in recent decades has morphed itself into the third-largest natural-gas producer in the continental U.S., largely through its use of a drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Much of that drilling was financed with borrowings. Southwestern's long-term debt load swelled 47-fold in the decade through 2015. Milestones included a $2 billion credit line in 2013, $5 billion of acquisition financing in 2014 and at least $3.8 billion of bond sales along the way. Then last year, as oil and gas prices swooned, the company posted a $4.67 billion net loss. In February, Moody's Investors Service slashed Southwestern's credit rating to junk-grade, citing the company's high debt load. Southwestern warned in an annual report in February that further downgrades could lead to a liquidity squeeze, and that a prolonged period of low natural-gas prices might force the company to refinance debt, issue new shares or dispose of assets. Or all of the above. "We cannot assure that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us," the company said. Enter the bankers. On June 27, Southwestern announced that it had reached a debt-refinancing accord with lenders led by Bank of America and JPMorgan, including $2.7 billion of loans that won't come due until 2020. Two days later, the company launched a stock offering that ultimately placed about 99 million shares -- a 26% increase to its base. The purpose was to raise money to repay a portion of the bank loans and buy back $750 million of bonds, according to Southwestern regulatory filings. Then on a July 22 conference call, executives announced they would use about $500 million from the stock offering to reactivate drilling rigs on key properties, a move that should provide a significant bump to 2017 production, relative to prior expectations. Even with the dilution from the stock offering, Southwestern's investors have cheered its strengthened financial position: The shares have climbed 77% this year.

By ERIC LIPTON and BROOKE WILLIAMSAUG. 7, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corporation, one of the nation’s largest home builders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar, a publicly traded company, “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. Video ‘This Is Thinly Disguised Lobbying’ Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, explains how some think tanks engage in “thinly disguised lobbying” to influence lawmakers. By A.J. CHAVAR and ERIC LIPTON on Publish Date August 7, 2016. . Watch in Times Video » embed “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Washington has seen a proliferation of think tanks, particularly small institutions with narrow interests tied to specific industries. At the same time, the brand names of the field have experienced explosive growth. Brookings’s annual budget has doubled in the last decade, to $100 million. The American Enterprise Institute is spending at least $80 million on a new headquarters in Washington, not far from where the Center for Strategic and International Studies built a $100 million office tower. The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media. “Wouldn’t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, ‘Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,’” Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin S. Indyk, Brookings’s executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. When think tank scholars testify before Congress or speak at other public events, the public is often not aware of the financial relationships between these scholars and for-profit companies. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting and The New York Times looked at some of these conflicts. Video by The Eye, from NECIR The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” A group of Democratic state attorneys general is investigating whether Exxon Mobil worked with certain think tanks in past decades to cover up its understanding of fossil fuels’ impact on climate change, in part by financing reports questioning the science, a suggestion the company rejects. OPEN Document Document: Brookings Institution and Its Corporate Donors Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country’s most difficult problems,” John J. Hamre, the chief executive at C.S.I.S., said in a written reply to questions. “We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement.” Yet researchers at think tanks are seeing corporate influence firsthand. Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, said she had been quizzed by potential donors as she tried to raise money for research on the military’s use of armed drones. “‘Are you going to say drones are bad?’” she recalled one potential financial backer asking. “‘We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.’” Donations and Rewards The confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer. The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings’s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions.

Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs — both critical parts of its business — and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries. In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with “a national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation.” From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings’s overall program spending that year. K.K.R., after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450,000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K.K.R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K.K.R.’s website, promoting one of the company’s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece. In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: “K.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.” The tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between “unrestricted” donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in.

Formerly a lobbyist at Patton Boggs, Mr. Gootman was appointed in 2010 as Brookings’s first director of strategic partnerships. Credit Erin Hull for The New York Times Lennar joined Brookings’s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program’s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than 700-acre mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most “transformative investments in the United States.” The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard. Lennar joined with Brookings as protests were escalating in 2010. One complaint, filed by area residents with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the San Francisco Health Department was “conspiring with Lennar Corporation to conceal the health threats of asbestos-laden dust.” The company was busy at the time looking for investors to help it complete the project, known as the San Francisco Shipyard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest — and said the alliance was not related to the protests. “There was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to ‘buy’ from Brookings,” Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project. “San Francisco’s Shipyard project is both physically and economically transformative for the Bay Area and globally significant,” Mr. Katz, the Brookings vice president, said in a news release issued by San Francisco’s mayor in 2011 as Lennar’s hunt for major investors intensified. “This project promises to set a new paradigm for successfully conceiving, financing and delivering transformative infrastructure projects in the United States.” Follow-up memos were more explicit: Brookings, as it sought an additional $50,000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to “use our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success” of Lennar’s project and to “provide public validation of San Francisco’s efforts through national and local media coverage.” The think tank soon delivered. Photo In a July 2014 document, Brookings sought more money from Lennar while offering to help with its San Francisco project. Mr. Katz made appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, the Lennar executive, to promote the project to government officials and business leaders in California. In 2014, around the time the think tank sought an additional round of money from Lennar, Brookings invited its new nonresident senior fellow, Mr. Bonner, who has a master’s degree in architecture and is a former government planner for several California cities, to appear at an event at its headquarters. “I am working in San Francisco in a fabulous property,” Mr. Bonner said at the event, referring to Lennar’s Shipyard project. In March, at a conference of real estate developers and investors in Cannes, France, Lennar sponsored a session in which Brookings researchers helped the company highlight the Shipyard. “Kofi is what I would describe as the quintessential city builder,” Julie Wagner, a Brookings nonresident senior fellow, said as she introduced Mr. Bonner at an event where projects with no connection to donors were also featured. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least some of the $400,000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings’s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry. Mr. Indyk said the collaboration simply reflected shared goals of revitalizing cities. Brookings scholars promoted other real estate projects, he said, involving local governments, universities or even developers that were not donors — including one in Detroit backed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, and one in Seattle backed by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had “created the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.” His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed. Photo Martin S. Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. “We do not compromise our integrity,” he said. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1.8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company’s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products. “Metro has held nine meetings and several conference calls in the past six months with executives from Hitachi’s water, transportation and data business lines and are collaborating more fully on defining what it means to be a ‘Smart City,’” a confidential Brookings memo said. Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company’s position. “Helping a corporation’s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,” Ms. Churches, the managing director, said. Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was “inelegant,” although not improper. When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, “It could be misconstrued.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that “today, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.” ‘Growing the Economy’ When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase.” The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would “not directly or indirectly communicate with any party” to help get JPMorgan business. Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda. “This was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,” said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. “We believe it’s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.” At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos — status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money — make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” said one Brookings document dated July 2011, as officials from the think tank met with top bank executives to discuss a planned donation that eventually totaled $15 million. The Global Cities Initiative, another document written by a Brookings senior fellow explained, “must mean a marriage between JPMC corporate interests” and “Brookings continued thought leadership.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the U.S. and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97% of them referencing GCI and 90% referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and 9 international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. Photo One of hundreds of documents detailing confidential discussions between Brookings and JPMorgan in 2011 as the parties were negotiating a $10 million gift for the Global Cities Initiative. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” It remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank’s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal. “If the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it’s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,” Mr. Scher said in a statement. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’s agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Ms. Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Close Partnerships Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. OPEN Document Document: Atlantic Council and Corporate Donors Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study was completed. FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to “emphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.” When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. An executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is very exciting,” Mr. Subramaniam said at the event, referring to the potential for more trade. “The upside opportunity is quite large.” Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. Photo A 2013 Atlantic Council brochure detailed the benefits of membership in the think tank’s corporate program. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Mr. Kempe said. ‘We Do Not Lobby’ General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition. “When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more,” Frank Pace, the president of the company’s aircraft systems group, told a Reuters reporter in late 2013 at an air show in Dubai. At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports. While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics’s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small — in the tens of thousands of dollars. C.S.I.S. set up confidential meetings at its headquarters with company representatives, inviting top officials from the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the State Department and the office of the defense secretary, according to emails and other documents obtained by The Times through open records requests. OPEN Document Document: C.S.I.S. and the Military Drone Maker “Our series will be unique in convening a much broader group of stakeholders than is typical,” Samuel J. Brannen, the think tank’s lead scholar, wrote in an email to Aaron W. Jost, one of the State Department officials in charge of regulating drone exports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’s Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying. “C.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. “We do not lobby.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story One thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics. Photo A Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. General Atomics helped fund a study that led the United States to ease restrictions on sales of drones to governments overseas. Credit Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times In February 2015, almost one year after the C.S.I.S. report was issued, the State Department announced a clarification of its rules, easing final approval that month for General Atomics’s long-planned sale of unarmed Predator drones to the United Arab Emirates, the first such sale to a non-NATO nation. The think tank report was just one of many voices pushing for the change. A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, “at the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.” Huntington Ingalls Industries had an equally clear objective: to create an elaborate public relations and lobbying campaign to convince Congress that the nation needed to confront an emerging threat from China by building more nuclear-powered aircraft carriers — at a cost of about $11 billion each. The clear beneficiary? Huntington, the lone builder of the ships. As part of a broader communications effort, Huntington helped finance a think tank report that enhanced the company’s argument for more funding. Bryan McGrath, a former naval officer who had commanded a guided-missile destroyer, approached Huntington Ingalls and offered to write a study on a fee-for-service basis as a private industry expert. The company turned down his offer. Later, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested. “A think tank has more prestige,” Mr. McGrath said. Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research. Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion. “The Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,” he said. “If a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In exchange for Huntington Ingalls’s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said. OPEN Document Document: The Aircraft Carrier Industry’s Lobbying and Think Tank Plan “We have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,” Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company’s suggestions. The report was released in October at the Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. McGrath received an introduction from one of the industry’s most important boosters, Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy. The report did not mention that Huntington Ingalls had helped pay for it. Asked about the failure to disclose the contribution, John P. Walters, Hudson’s chief operating officer, called it a mistake. The report was subsequently revised — months after it was released and the congressional event held — to disclose the donation. A second industry-funded report, prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, came out a month later with a similar urgent call for more money to build more ships and to base more ships abroad, although it did not mention that it had been funded by the Navy League of the United States, a nonprofit group whose large corporate donors include Huntington Ingalls. “This report is yet another important tool for Navy Leaguers to use in the field when educating local leaders and lawmakers,” Skip Witunski, the Navy League president, wrote to the group’s members late last year. The strategy — lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other — was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces. Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process. “I see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,” Mr. McGrath said, “and I got to scratch my head and say, ‘That guy must be on the payroll.’” Brooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

REUTERS/Tony GentileMore By Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's troubled lenders are offering lucrative opportunities for investment banks, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena set to pay some of the highest fees in Europe this year to arrange its high stakes rescue plan. The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros ($278.43 million) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank's market value currently stands at 747 million euros. "The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial," said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy's largest lender, UniCredit , was also among the banks which fared badly. Monte dei Paschi's poor showing in the tests - which predicted its capital would be wiped out if there was a severe economic downturn - came despite it tapping investors for cash twice since 2014. Last year the bank paid 130 million euros to a pool of banks for a 3 billion euro cash call. In 2014 it spent more than any other company in Europe on investment banking fees, paying advisers nearly $304 million for its 5 billion capital hike, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast Deutsche Bank paid about 119 million euros ($133.18 million) in 2014 to underwriters for its 8 billion euro capital hike, according to the prospectus for its rights issue. A spokeswoman for Monte dei Paschi declined to comment for this story. If successful, the bank's rescue plan will see even higher fees as it involves the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hoover up Monte dei Paschi's bad loans. That part of the plan could net banks up to 300 million euros, sources said, pointing to the need for a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to provide financing to the special purpose vehicle to begin buying up the debt. A bridge loan - which Monte dei Paschi said in its turnaround plan is a possibility - is seen by sources as inevitable since the timetable to split the Tuscan lender into a good and bad bank and simultaneously raise cash is too tight. Monte dei Paschi and its global coordinators JPMorgan and Mediobanca aim to carry out the cash call by the end of the year, most likely in November, the sources said. JPMorgan and Mediobanca declined to comment for this article. RISKY DEAL The large bill reflects the risk that the deal will not happen because investors are reluctant to sign up to the capital increase due to Monte dei Paschi's history of failed turnaround plans, uncertain market conditions and fear of increased exposure to the euro zone's third largest economy. "It is way more expensive than any other equity capital markets (ECM) deal in Europe because of the risk profile of the transaction," said a London-based analyst who stressed the "country risk" adds to the operational complexity of the transaction. The bank has said it would plug capital shortfalls and restore its health by splitting into a good and bad bank. The plan envisages the sale of 9.2 billion euros in bad loans and a 5 billion-euro capital increase. But none of the dozens of banks contacted by the troubled lender in recent weeks to form an underwriting consortium have made firm commitments to guarantee its proposed 5 billion euro cap hike, sources said. Mediobanca Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said on Friday "this is a pre-underwriting agreement which by definition is not a hard underwriting and is not a commitment." The lack of commitment means the plan can still fall apart. Any failure of the world's oldest bank would damage the entire Italian banking system and could spark contagion across Europe so Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government has pressured Italian and international investment banks to make the rescue work, sources said. A spokesman for the Italian government, however, told Reuters he was not aware of any pressure on banks. The government does not want to mount its own rescue because European rules say this would mean imposing losses on bondholders and depositors above 100,000 euros. The absence of financial support from the government also pushes up the size of the fees. Freeman consulting estimates the fees will be between 2.5 and 4 percent of the overall equity raised compared to 0.5 to 1 percent if the government were to intervene. Adding to the overall uncertainty in Italy is a referendum on constitutional reform that Renzi called for October. He has said he will stand down if he loses support - a gamble that could revive market turbulence in Italy just before the planned November cash call. FIGHTING FOR BUSINESS For large investment banks Monte dei Paschi is seen as a portal to other lucrative deals including the upcoming capital hike for UniCredit. "Industries that restructure and reconfigure create lots of fees and it's important to be there," said Hahn. Until June, UBS and Citigroup had acted as Monte dei Paschi's main advisors. For the past two years they have tried to find the bank a merger partner without success. The Swiss bank, under its charismatic investment bank president Andrea Orcel, also acted as global coordinator for Monte dei Paschi's previous capital hikes in 2014 and 2015. However JPMorgan, whose lending, trading and investing activities in Italy amounted to $6.8 billion in 2015, won government's support for its rescue plan in July, along with Mediobanca, after its chief executive Jamie Dimon met Renzi in Rome, sources said. As a result, the U.S. bank - which has Italy's former finance minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa - will be one of the top earners in Monte dei Paschi's overhaul if the plan goes ahead, sources said. It has offered to arrange a 6 billion euro syndicated bridge loan to help Monte dei Paschi gain breathing space to engineer the securitization of its bad loans while seeking to raise cash. Banks which sign up to the loan will end up holding chunks of Monte dei Paschi's debt if they fail to find investors - a risk that JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon says he is willing to take.     "If we could pull something like that off, that would be great for Italy," he said in a CNBC interview.    (Additional reporting by Silvia Aloisi and Giselda Vagnoni; Editing by Anna Willard) Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next JPMorgan has made an important hire from Goldman Sachs, and it hints at the future of trading Business Insider 'Russians, Americans and Turks' trying to destroy Europe: top MEP AFP Zidane praises Real's fighting spirit in Europe Reuters Germany amused by French candidate Fillon's Cold War map AFP Generali to exit weaker markets, cut costs Reuters ‘Are y’all ready to die?’ Chattanooga bus driver reportedly asked children before crash Yahoo News Who is Betsy DeVos?

Thursday, November 24, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Monte dei Paschi woes add up to large fees for investment banks August 9, 2016, Tuesday LONDON: Italy’s troubled lenders are offering lucrative opportunities for investment banks, with Monte dei Paschi di Siena set to pay some of the highest fees in Europe this year to arrange its high stakes rescue plan. The emergency deal, orchestrated by Mediobanca and JPMorgan, to save the 544-year-old bank, will incur about 250 million euros (US$278.43 million) in underwriting fees for a proposed 5 billion euro capital hike, according to three sources involved in the deal. That comes on top of nearly 400 million euros the bank has paid in the past two years for other capital hikes. There is no certainty the proposed rescue plan will proceed, but if it is carried out successfully, investment banks working with Monte dei Paschi will have generated a payday of close to 1 billion euros over the past three years, though the bank’s market value currently stands at 747 million euros. “The scale of fees that potentially are there in the Italian banking market – from restructurings and consolidation – are substantial,” said Peter Hahn, professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking & Finance. Monte dei Paschi emerged as the worst performer in European stress tests on July 29 and Italy’s largest lender, UniCredit , was also among the banks which fared badly.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Airbnb’s new raise makes it #2 Unicorn, delays IPO By Donna Fuscaldo | August 8, 2016 — 12:06 PM EDT Home sharing service Airbnb is on a fund raising-kick, disclosing in a filing late last week it raised $850 million, giving the company a valuation of around $30 billion, second only to Uber in the herd of unicorns, private companies that are valued at over $1 billion. According to a Bloomberg report, Airbnb made the filing in Delaware without disclosing who the investors are. The round of capital raising is reportedly designed to give Airbnb more time until it launches an initial public offering, which is now not expected to happen until 2018 at the earliest. It also comes on the heels of the home sharing company securing $1 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. In 2015, the company raised $1.6 billion, giving it a $25 billion valuation at the time. The additional $850 million pushes its valuation higher than Marriott International (MAR), which has a market capitalization of $18.7 billion. Airbnb’s decision to delay its IPO and instead raise more capital comes at a time when the IPO market in the U.S. has dried up. According to Dealogic, there were 54 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, raising $11.5 billion. That’s down from $22.9 billion raised via 118 deals in the same seven month period last year. Airbnb, which has been exploding in terms of growth, is gearing up to expand beyond its core market of facilitating home sharing between customers. The $1 billion it raised in June is expected to go toward developing new services and funding expansion into new markets. (Read more, here: Airbnb's $1B Debt Deal for Global Growth). Some of those add-on services include offering hotel-style amenities, art gallery tours, personal chefs and bicycle rentals. The idea is to become a full service travel company without the overheard of owning physical locations. By delaying the IPO and raising an additional $850 the company can continue to test new markets, without the pressure of shareholders and Wall Street analysts.

The New York-based bank has more than 20 global IPOs lined up and ready to go in September alone, Myers said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Monday. Myers expects the global IPO market to stabilize through the rest of the year, after the slowest start to global listings since the financial crisis. A steady uptick in the number of filings has been helped by central bank intervention in monetary policy, and growing investor appetite despite some market volatility, Myers said. “We’ve seen that trajectory toward normalization of the IPO market continue in July, so I’m optimistic that we’ll see that trajectory persist through the fall and into year-end,” Myers said. Companies planning to go public have been encouraged by recent deals. Some two-thirds of IPOs in 2016 have been priced at or above their marketed range, according to Myers. They’re also doing well once trading starts: The average share performance from the offer to date is more than 20 percent, she said. Watch Liz Myers talk about IPOs, technology deals on Bloomberg TV Technology, Robotics Technology companies specializing in software and disruptive internet are among those most likely to file for IPOs in coming months, and account for more than a dozen of the deals JPMorgan plans to launch before year-end, Myers said. However, the highest-value tech deals are likely to wait until 2017 and 2018, she said. Despite the focus on tech IPOs, JPMorgan has “a pretty broad swath of deals ready to launch” this year, Myers said, including filings by financial services, health-care, and consumer retail companies. “Investors are most focused on seeing quality deals, and deals that make sense in terms of its whole package,” she said. “The price range, the overall cash flow profile -- particularly for companies that are levered -- the growth rates, the opportunity for margin expansion, leadership in their sectors: Those perennial themes still persist,” Myers said. Myers also expects more private equity-backed companies to file for IPOs in coming months as venture capital and private equity firms weigh the benefits of taking companies public or selling them outright. “There’s a good dynamic going on among companies that are pursuing both,” Myers said. “The M&A market will be a good solution for certain types of companies, and the IPO market will still be there as well,” she said.

Login Search Stock Market News for August 08, 2016 August 08, 2016, 10:10:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Benchmarks finished in the green on Friday following an encouraging jobs report for July. Better than expected number of jobs raised rate hike prospects, which pushed financial stocks upward. Technology stocks also gained on the back of Motorola's better-than-expected earnings reports. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached their highest level ever. Also, gains in Merck boosted the Dow. Moreover, benchmarks registered weekly gains following strong jobs data and positive quarterly results from tech-giants. For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's  Ahead of Wall Street  article. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1%, or 191.48 points to close at 18,543.53. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% to close at 2,182.87. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,221.12, gaining 1.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 8.3% to settle at 11.39. A total of around 6.77 billion shares were traded on Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.58 billion shares. Advancers significantly outpaced declining stocks on the NYSE. For 70% stocks that advanced, 27% declined. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy created a total of 255,000 jobs in July, considerably higher than the consensus estimate of 180,000. The economy added higher-than-expected new jobs for the second straight month. Meanwhile, job number in June was revised upward to 292,000. Although, the unemployment rate in July of 4.9% was higher than the consensus estimate of 4.8%, it was in line with June's rate. This was mainly because Americans not counted in the workforce fell by 184,000 to 94.3 million which led the labor force participation rate to increase to 62.8%. Further, the average hourly earnings gained 0.3% or 8 cents in July from June to $25.69 per hour. It was also higher than the consensus estimate of 0.2% and June's 0.1% increase while year-ago gains advanced by 2.6%. Encouraging job reports in July increased Fed rate hike chances in September, which in turn boosted financial stocks. The Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) went up 2.4% and was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors. Dow components JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM ) and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( GS ) increased 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. Other key stocks including Citigroup Inc ( C ), Bank of America Corporation ( BAC ) and Wells Fargo & Company ( WFC ) rose 4.3%, 3.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Further, Motorola Solutions, Inc's ( MSI ) advanced more than 4.6% after reporting second quarter earnings per share and revenues of $1.03 and $1,430 million beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates of 90 cents and $1,395 million, respectively. Motorola was the best performer among the technology sector which led the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) to rise 1% and become one of the biggest advancer among the S&P 500. Key stocks from the sector including Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) and Facebook, Inc. ( FB ) increased 1.5%, 1% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, Merck & Co., Inc's ( MRK ) shares surged 10.4% after its rival company Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's ( BMY ) cancer drug Opdivo failed to meet targets in a late-stage study. Merck was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500, while Bristol-Myers Squibb, which slumped 16%, was the worst performer among the same. Gains in Merck boosted the Dow to end in the green. In other economic news, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System reported that consumer credit increased by $12.3 billion in July, following June's $18 billion increase. Consumer credit reported 4.1% rise in June, its slowest pace of increase since July 2012. For the week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow increased 0.4%, 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Better-than-expected U.S. private sector job data had a positive impact on financial sector. Also, upbeat quarterly results from tech-behemoths like Apple and Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) boosted tech sector. Both XLFS and XLK rose 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively becoming top performers among the S&P 500 last week. Additionally, oil prices gained for the week following a surprisingly large draw on gasoline stockpiles. However, some of its gains were curtailed on oversupply concerns, subdued demand and increased crude inventories. Both WTI and Brent crude rose 4.3% and 5.1%, respectively. Also, Bank of England (BOE) came up with a big stimulus package, but its effect on U.S. stocks remained more or less muted. In earnings news, Viacom, Inc. ( VIAB ), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ( TEVA ) and Kellogg Company ( K ) posted favorable quarterly earnings results. Economic data was mixed last week. The personal consumption expenditure, core personal consumption expenditure, consumer spending and disposable personal income increased in June. While, ISM Manufacturing and Services Index declined in July and factory orders declined for the second straight month in June. Also, construction spending was down for third consecutive month and initial claims increased to its highest level since end-June. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

'Commercial' Bank Is Misnomer. 'Real Estate' Bank Is More Apt By Alex J. Pollock August 8, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 2 Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Did Banks Learn Nothing from '06 CRE Boom? Energy Troubles Sapped Bank Earnings in 1Q: FDIC Battered Regionals Pledge to Keep Fighting Against Tough Conditions Warning for Wealth Managers: Investors are Wary of Your Advice 12 Housing Markets Mortgage Lenders Should Love Eight Mortgage Innovations We'd Like to See Comparing banking in the 1950s to today, we find giant changes that surely would have astonished the bankers of that earlier time. What's the biggest and most important one? You might nominate the shrinkage in the total number of U.S. banks from over 13,200 in 1955 to only about 5,300 now — a 60% reduction. Or you might say the rise of interstate banking, or digital technology going from zero to ubiquitous, or the growth of financial derivatives into hundreds of trillions of dollars, or even air conditioning making banking facilities a lot more pleasant. You might point out that the whole banking industry's total assets were only $209 billion in 1955, less than one-tenth the assets of today's JPMorgan Chase, compared with $15 trillion now. Or that total banking system equity was $15 billion, less than 1% of the $1.7 trillion it is now. Of course, there have been six decades of inflation and economic growth. The nominal GDP of the U.S. was $426 billion in 1955, compared with $17.9 trillion in 2015. So banking assets were 49% of GDP in 1955, compared with 83% of GDP now. But I propose that the biggest banking change during the last 60 years is none of these. It is instead the dramatic shift to real estate finance and thus real estate risk, as the dominant factor in the balance sheet of the entire banking system. It is the evolution of the banking system from being principally business banks to being principally real estate banks. In 1955, commercial and industrial loans were 40% of total banking loans and real estate loans only 25%. The great banking transition set in after 1984. The share of C&I loans kept falling, down to about 20% of total loans, while real estate loans rose to about 50%, with a bubble-induced peak of 60% in 2009. In this remarkable long-term shift, the share of real estate loans doubled, while the share of commercial and industrial loans dropped in half. The lines crossed in 1987, three decades ago, and never met again, despite the real estate lending busts of the early 1990s and of 2007-9. The long-term transition to concentration in real estate would have greatly surprised the authors of the original National Banking Act of 1864, which prohibited national banks from making any real estate loans at all. This was loosened slightly 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act and significantly in 1927 by the McFadden Act — in time for the ill-fated real estate boom of the late 1920s. The real estate concentration is even more pronounced for smaller banks. For the 4,700 banks with assets of less than $1 billion, real estate loans are 75% of all loans, about the same as their bubble-era peak of 76%. Moreover, in another dramatic change from the 1950s, the securities portfolio of the banking system has also become heavily concentrated in real estate risk. Real estate securities reached 74% of total banking system securities at the height of the housing bubble. They have since moderated, to 60%, but that is still high. In terms of both their lending and securities portfolios, we find that commercial banks have become basically real estate banks. Needless to say, this matters a lot for understanding the riskiness of the banking system. The assets underlying real estate loans and securities are by definition illiquid. The prices of these assets are volatile and subject to enthusiastic run-ups and panicked, unexpected drops. When highly leveraged on bank balance sheets, real estate over banking's long history has been the most reliable and recurring source of busts and panics. A good example is the frequency of commercial bank failures in 2007-12 relative to their increasing ratio of real estate loans to total loans at the outset of the crisis in December 2007. From the first quartile, in which real estate loans are less than 57% of loans, to the third quartile, in which they are over 72%, the frequency of failure triples, and failures are nine times as great for the highest ratio quartile as for the lowest. In the fourth quartile, real estate loans exceeded 83% of loans, and the failure rate is over 13%, which represents 60% of all the failures in the aftermath of the bubble. The 50% of banks with the highest real estate loan ratios accounted for 82% of the failures. Central to the riskiness of leveraged real estate is the risk of real estate prices falling rapidly from high levels — and right now those prices are again very high. The Comptroller of the Currency's current "Risk Perspective" cites rapid growth in commercial real estate loans, "accompanied by weaker underwriting standards" and "concentration risk." The predominance of real estate finance in banking's aggregate banking balance sheet makes that risk far more important to the stability of the banking system than the bankers of the 1950s could ever have imagined.
