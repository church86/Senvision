News Business Business News Money laundering, household spending, Laura Ashley: Business news in brief Friday 17 February Family spending still down on a decade ago; US banks push for relaxed rules; Homeware retailer issues profit warning Friday 17 February 2017 08:12 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Laura Ashley revealed a 29 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to £7.8m for the six months to 31 December Reuters Latest British 'family spending' data raises questions about true economic strength British household spending barely rose in the year to the end of March 2016 and was around 5 per cent below the level before the financial crisis, an official survey showed on Thursday, suggesting a much more muted picture than previous data. The figures, though from early last year, may revive the debate about living standards in Britain, nearly 10 years on from the start of the financial crisis. They come when inflation is beginning to pick up sharply following the June vote to leave the European Union. The average household spent £529 a week, excluding mortgage interest payments, a marginal rise in inflation-adjusted terms from £527 in 2014-15 and below a peak of £555 10 years earlier, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. By contrast, official data used to calculate British gross domestic product has shown household spending growing by 2.7 per cent in real terms in the same period – and then maintaining that pace through the rest of 2016. Consumer spending has driven Britain’s economy since the EU referendum, and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has expressed doubts about whether this will persist as inflation looks set to rise faster than wages. Thursday’s annual “family spending” survey from the ONS may raise questions about the true strength of Britain’s recovery from the global financial crisis. Reuters Big US banks to push for easing of money laundering rules America’s largest banks are to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity, arguing that rules imposed in the years after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and strengthened during the Obama administration are onerous and ineffective, sources said. The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest US banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Bank of America, has long raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current rules, but this will be the first time the group has publicly called for them to be revamped. The proposal, which could be published as soon as Thursday, will set the stage for an intensive lobbying effort targeting bank regulators and members of the Senate and House of Representatives finance committees. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street. To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the US financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators. “Now we tell banks to file [a report] on everything that might be criminal,” said Gary Shiffman, chief executive of compliance software maker Giant Oak. “But when everything is a priority, nothing ends up being a priority.” Reuters Laura Ashley issues warning after 29% fall in pre-tax profits Fashion and homewares retailer Laura Ashley has warned over full-year profits after being hit by falling sales and surging costs. The group revealed a 29 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to £7.8m for the six months to 31 December. Retail sales over its first half, which include key Christmas trading, fell 3.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis, putting it on a shortened list of losers over what proved to be a robust festive season elsewhere on the high street. Shares in the group tumbled 11 per cent as Laura Ashley alerted over profits amid tough trading, with like-for-like sales still in the red since the start of 2017 – down 0.6 per cent in the six weeks to 11 February. Chairman Tan Sri Dr Khoo Kay Peng said: “Trading conditions have been demanding during the first six months of the year. “The board have reviewed the first half results and forecasts for the remainder of the year to 30 June 2017 and, given the continued market challenges, feels that net pre-tax profit for the year will fall below market expectations.” The group said profits were also knocked by rising costs after the pound’s plunge in value since the EU referendum, as well as the new national living wage, which together contributed to a 6 per cent rise in operating costs to £52.3m. PA Air France plans long-haul push after full-year profit boost Air France-KLM Group reported a 35 per cent earnings increase for 2016 and said it will boost passenger capacity this year in an effort to win back the initiative in the lucrative long-haul market. Operating profit increased to €1.05bn (£890m) from €780m in 2015, helped by a lower fuel bill and productivity gains at Dutch arm KLM, Europe’s biggest airline said on Thursday. Analysts had predicted a figure of about €950m, based on eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac said in a statement that while political and economic uncertainties are continuing to weigh on fares amid industry overcapacity, the decline in unit revenue slowed to 0.7 per cent in January, indicating a “resilient start” to the year. The group will therefore lift capacity as much as 3.5 per cent in 2017 “in order to regain the offensive” in long-haul markets and boost performance on medium-distance routes. Bloomberg   JPMorgan and HSBC among those facing fines in South African rand-rigging probe South Africa’s antitrust investigators urged that a dozen banks be fined for colluding and manipulating trades in the rand, potentially becoming the latest in a string of penalties handed to lenders around the world for rigging currencies. The Competition Commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JPMorgan and Nomura as among those that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since at least 2007. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal, concluding an investigation that began in 2015. The outcome of the probe comes as President Jacob Zuma and his governing African National Congress step up pressure to break the dominance of the country’s four largest lenders and force them to lend more to black clients.  Bloomberg Lenovo comes up short on smartphones as PC business soldiers on Lenovo’s mobile-phone business continues to shrink, while its personal-computer division managed anaemic growth in the face of brutal holiday-season competition. The world’s largest PC maker’s profit plummeted more than two thirds in the December quarter, missing analysts’ projections after HP Inc threatened its position in North America. Smartphone sales declined almost a quarter globally as Lenovo bled market share to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co – both at home and abroad. Lenovo remains the leader in a PC market struggling through a prolonged downturn as people opt for smartphones to handle everyday tasks. But it barely maintained pole position over HP as its chief rival widened its share in North America, according to research firm IDC. In the mobile sector, Lenovo is pinning its hopes on premium phones, such as the one with augmented reality capabilities, to breathe life into the loss-making division. Yet it’s still ceding ground to rivals who are winning users over with aggressive sales tactics. Bloomberg GM will not ‘rationalise’ UK operations says minister British business minister Greg Clark said he had been reassured by General Motors that the firm did not intend to “rationalise” its Vauxhall operations in the UK, after a meeting held to discuss GM’s merger talks with France’s PSA. “There is some way to go in discussions between GM and PSA but I was reassured by GM’s intention, communicated to me, to build on the success of these operations rather than rationalise them,” Clark said in a statement. “We will continue to be in close contact with GM and PSA in the days and weeks ahead.”  Reuters Greece: No further austerity as part of bailout deal  The Greek government says the country’s economy has met its budget targets and there is therefore no reason for any further austerity measures to be imposed as part of a deal with international bailout creditors. Greece has been struggling for months to conclude negotiations with its creditors on spending cuts and reforms demanded as part of its third bailout program. It hopes to reach an agreement in time for a Monday meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said on Thursday that no further austerity should be imposed on the Greek people, and said the key to reaching an agreement was for the International Monetary Fund and Germany’s finance ministry to “return to reality”. Without a deal, Greece will be unable to receive the next instalment of rescue loans.  AP More about: Laura Ashley Goldman Sachs Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Business Home LBoard Guan Eng: Fed-Penang a reality if BN wins back state Predeep Nambiar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Big US banks to push for easing of money laundering rules Reuters | February 17, 2017 To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: America’s largest banks are to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity, arguing that rules imposed in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and strengthened during the Obama administration are onerous and ineffective, sources said. The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America and Citigroup, has long raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current rules, but this will be the first time the group has publicly called for them to be revamped. The proposal, which could be published as soon as Thursday, will set the stage for an intensive lobbying effort targeting bank regulators and members of the Senate and House of Representatives finance committees. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street. To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators. “Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal,” said Gary Shiffman, CEO of compliance software maker Giant Oak. “But when everything is a priority nothing ends up being a priority.” The number of suspicious activity reports rose from 669,000 in 2013 to almost a million in 2016, according to U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enforces anti-money laundering rules and collects data on suspicious transactions from banks around the country. Complying with anti-money laundering rules, including the manpower needed to file suspicious activity reports, costs U.S. companies as much as $8 billion a year, the Heritage Foundation estimated in a report last year. The Clearing House will propose a new system under which banks do not investigate and report every transaction that could possibly raise a red flag, according to people involved in the effort. Instead, banks would focus on investigating and reporting transactions based on specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Under this approach, banks could shift their focus, as law enforcement priorities change. Institutions in different parts of the country may also watch out for certain types of criminal transactions, based on information from authorities. For example, law enforcement could warn banks in the southwest of the United States to look out for drug traffickers moving funds to Mexico, according to people involved in drafting the proposal. The Clearing House will also call for the creation of an information-sharing platform that would allow banks to share data among themselves about possible criminal transactions. For international banks, the group will push for the U.S. Treasury’s FinCEN to be responsible for investigating compliance, rather than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a main bank regulator. Since FinCEN is already responsible for sharing threat data with law enforcement agencies, the agency will be better able to determine if banks are making a substantial contribution to law enforcement efforts, the bank group will argue. ‘New sets of eyes’ It remains to be seen what kind of reception such a proposal will get from U.S. law enforcement officials and regulators, who have spent years learning how to turn SARs into leads for fruitful investigations. A FinCEN spokesman pointed out dozens of criminal cases made with the help of SARs listed on the agency’s website. The spokesman said the agency is unable to collect comprehensive statistics on how often SARs lead to successful prosecutions. Even if controls were loosened at the federal level, state regulators such as the New York Department of Financial Services may not let banks alter course. Just last month, the New York regulator imposed a new anti-terrorism regulation requiring banks to beef up suspicious activity reporting. The New York regulator declined to comment for this story. Representatives of Bank of America and Citigroup also declined to comment. Critics say banks have only themselves to blame for greater scrutiny of the sector. In 2012, HSBC agreed to pay $1.9 billion in U.S. fines for failing to prevent money laundering violations by Mexican drug traffickers. In 2014, JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion over allegations it failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Bernie Madoff’s fund. The bank lobby waited for Trump to take office in the hope that a new administration will see the money laundering regulations through “a new set of eyes,” said one person involved in writing the proposal. Watchdog groups balk at the idea that the regulations could be loosened in any way. “I have concerns with the banks even doing what they are supposed to do now,” said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, an organization that pushes for stricter anti-money laundering enforcement.

THE MOST FROM THE COAST ! ..  Coastweek website Home  Coast Classified | Coast Art | Coast Books | Coast Cuisine | Coast Directory | Coast Eating Out | Coast Obituaries | Coast Poster | Shipping | Tides XINHUA NEWS SERVICE REPORTS FROM THE AFRICAN CONTINENT   Group of South Africa banks to be prosecuted in  for collusion JOHANNESBURG South Africa (Xinhua) -- The South African Competition Commission said Wednesday they have referred 17 banks to their tribunal for prosecution of collusion. Among the 17 banks, 3 of them are South Africa’s biggest banks who face prosecution of collusion for price fixing of the South African rand. The country’s consumer watchdog has been investigating the banks for the past two years and has resolved to refer the case to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. The Competition Commission said the banks manipulated the price for bids and offers through an agreement to abstain from trading and creating fake bids and offers at given times. The collusion happened through groups chats.  The South African Banks involved in collusion includes Standard Bank of South Africa, Absa and Investec. The foreign banks involved are JP Morgan Chase Bank, Barclays Capital, Barclays Bank, HSBC Bank and Bank of America Merril Lynch International, among others. Tembinkosi Bonakele, one of the Commissioners from the Competition Commission said “the referral of this matter to the tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves.” The Commission said the banks had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving U.S. dollar and rand currency pair.  According to the Commission, some banks used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. Some used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. The banks coordinated trading times and helped each other to reach desired prices. The Commission applied to the Tribunal to declare that the 17 banks as having contravened the Competition Act and are liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10 percent of their annual turnover. South African ruling party, African National Congress spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the actions by the banks are an attack on the constitutional mandate of the South African Reserve Bank to protect the value of the South African currency. “The African National Congress takes an extremely dim view of the activities of the listed banks, understanding the banking sector as being instrumental to our quest for economic growth and development,” he said.                 Remember: you read it first at coastweek.com !   TO ADVERTISE ON THIS WEB SITE:  www.coastweek.com Please contact MOMBASA - GULSHAN JIVRAJ, Mobile: 0722 775164 Tel: (+254) (41) 2230130 / Wireless: 020 3549187 e-mail: info@coastweek.com NAIROBI - ANJUM H.

While they may not yet have full indemnity, their disclosures to the Competition Commission could save them from being penalized if the information they provided is proven correct, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is still confidential. The two banks have been working with the commission from an early stage, they said. Citigroup and Barclays were named as part of the rand-rigging probe that started in 2015. The Competition Commission on Wednesday didn’t name Citigroup and didn’t add Barclays to the list of banks it recommended for fines. The commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Nomura Holdings as among those that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign-currency pairs involving the rand. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal. Traders in New York and Johannesburg used the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg chat-rooms to conspire to rig the rand’s rate, prosecutors will allege, according to one of the people. While the regulator will seek the maximum fines, banks that have cooperated are likely to be granted leniency, the person said. Fictitious bids “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the Pretoria, South Africa-based commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The prosecution should be shorter than most antitrust cases, due to the straightforward nature of the matter, one of the people said. Regulators aren’t seeking specific action against individual traders from the banks, but are likely to make demands to change incentives that encourage traders to push the boundaries, the same person said. Read also: Don't give 'untrustworthy' banks pension contract Other lenders named in the probe include Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group, Investec, which has units in South Africa and the UK, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie Group and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. South African President Jacob Zuma called for action against market abuse, while the National Treasury said reckless behaviour must be “punished and brought to an end.” ‘Unbridled greed’ “If proven to be true, it would confirm the pervasiveness of unbridled greed within the ranks of the forex trading sections of banks,” the Treasury said in an e-mailed statement. Barclays Africa, about 50 percent owned by Barclays, said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday it has cooperated with the commission and will continue to do so. Citigroup declined to comment in an e-mail on why it wasn’t on the list of banks facing a fine. London-based Barclays declined to comment. The commission recommended the banks be fined 10 percent of their turnover, the maximum allowed.

Price fixing: Punish guilty banks harshly, urges ANC Questions over timing of banks' collusion case How banks allegedly colluded on currency trades   Johannesburg - Citigroup and Barclays (which owns Absa) won’t be targeted for fines by the Competition Commission for colluding to manipulate the value of the rand because they co-operated with regulators, three people familiar with the matter said. While they may not yet have full indemnity, their disclosures to the Competition Commission could save them from being penalised if the information they provided is proven correct, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is still confidential. The two banks have been working with the commission from an early stage, they said. Citigroup and Barclays were named as part of the rand-rigging probe that started in 2015. The Competition Commission on Wednesday didn’t name Citigroup and didn’t add Barclays to the list of banks it recommended for fines. The commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Nomura as among those that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign-currency pairs involving the rand. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal. Traders in New York and Johannesburg used the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg chat-rooms to conspire to rig the rand’s rate, prosecutors will allege, according to one of the people. While the regulator will seek the maximum fines, banks that have cooperated are likely to be granted leniency, the person said. Fictitious bids “The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times,” the commission said on Wednesday. “They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives.” The prosecution should be shorter than most antitrust cases, due to the straightforward nature of the matter, one of the people said. Regulators aren’t seeking specific action against individual traders from the banks, but are likely to make demands to change incentives that encourage traders to push the boundaries, the same person said. Other lenders named in the probe include Standard Bank, Investec, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank, Macquarie and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. South African President Jacob Zuma called for action against market abuse, while the National Treasury said reckless behaviour must be “punished and brought to an end.” ‘Unbridled greed’ “If proven to be true, it would confirm the pervasiveness of unbridled greed within the ranks of the forex trading sections of banks,” the Treasury said in an e-mailed statement. Barclays Africa, about 50% owned by Barclays, said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday it has cooperated with the commission and will continue to do so. Citigroup declined to comment in an e-mail on why it wasn’t on the list of banks facing a fine. London-based Barclays declined to comment. The commission recommended the banks be fined 10% of their turnover, the maximum allowed.

Updated 3 hours ago WASHINGTON — America's largest banks are planning to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity, arguing that rules imposed in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and strengthened during the Obama administration are onerous and ineffective, sources said. The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America and Citigroup, has long raised concerns about the effectiveness of the rules, but this will be the first time the group has publicly called for them to be revamped. The proposal will set the stage for an intensive lobbying effort targeting bank regulators and members of the Senate and House of Representatives finance committees. President Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street. To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators. “Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal,” said Gary Shiffman, CEO of compliance software maker Giant Oak. “But when everything is a priority, nothing ends up being a priority.” The number of suspicious activity reports rose from 669,000 in 2013 to almost a million in 2016, according to U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which enforces anti-money laundering rules and collects data on suspicious transactions from banks around the country. Complying with anti-money laundering rules, including the manpower needed to file suspicious activity reports, costs U.S. companies as much as $8 billion a year, the Heritage Foundation estimated in a report last year. The Clearing House will propose a new system under which banks do not investigate and report every transaction that could possibly raise a red flag, according to people involved in the effort. Instead, banks would focus on investigating and reporting transactions based on specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Under this approach, banks could shift their focus, as law enforcement priorities change. Institutions in different parts of the country may also watch out for certain types of criminal transactions, based on information from authorities. For example, law enforcement could warn banks in the southwest of the United States to look out for drug traffickers moving funds to Mexico, according to people involved in drafting the proposal. The Clearing House also will call for the creation of an information-sharing platform that would allow banks to share data among themselves about possible criminal transactions. For international banks, the group will push for the Treasury's FinCEN to be responsible for investigating compliance, rather than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a main bank regulator. Since FinCEN is already responsible for sharing threat data with law enforcement agencies, the agency will be better able to determine if banks are making a substantial contribution to law enforcement efforts, the bank group will argue. It remains to be seen what kind of reception such a proposal will get from U.S. law enforcement officials and regulators, who have spent years learning how to turn SARs into leads for fruitful investigations. A FinCEN spokesman pointed out dozens of criminal cases made with the help of SARs listed on the agency's website. The spokesman said the agency is unable to collect comprehensive statistics on how often SARs lead to successful prosecutions. Even if controls were loosened at the federal level, state regulators such as the New York Department of Financial Services may not let banks alter course. Just last month, the New York regulator imposed a new anti-terrorism regulation requiring banks to beef up suspicious activity reporting. The New York regulator declined to comment for this story. Representatives of Bank of America and Citigroup also declined to comment. More Business Work advances on site of planned Sheetz in Harrison Thimble tossed!

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health Russia’s Growth Could Lag Behind World’s Average Until 2024 – OpEd Russian landscape By Paul Goble February 17, 2017 A group of Russian and international economic experts assembled by Moscow’s Higher School of Economics say that Russia’s growth over the next seven years will lag behind the worldwide average even if oil prices rise, that Vladimir Putin’s targets will not be met, and that Russia will thus be further behind in 2024 than it is now. That is the conclusion of a HSE report published yesterday compiled on the basis of input from Sberbank CIB, Alpha Bank, the Moscow Institute of Economics, the Boston Consulting Group, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley among other, Mikhail Sergeyev, the economics editor of Nezavisimaya gazeta, writes today (ng.ru/economics/2017-02-15/4_6930_russia.html). The world economy is currently growing at approximately three percent a year, the 25 specialists the HSE consulted say, while the Russian one is now stagnating and will not expand by more than two percent a year even at the end of that period and even assuming an increase in the price of oil. “The experts obviously do not expect an intensification of crisis phenomena in the Russian economy,” Sergey Smirnov of HSE says; but “the prospects for the restoration of stable and dynamic growth also seem to them extremely doubtful,” with only the most optimistic suggesting that Russia might approach international rates of growth. “In December of last year,” the Nezavisimaya gazeta journalist says, “economic activity fell compared to November in 39 regions; in 31, it remained at the same level; but it rose only in 12.” It is still in a depressed state; and only one in every seven regions of the Russian Federation is currently showing signs of coming out of the crisis.

President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street.   To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators.   "Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal," said Gary Shiffman, CEO of compliance software maker Giant Oak. "But when everything is a priority nothing ends up being a priority."   The number of suspicious activity reports rose from 669,000 in 2013 to almost a million in 2016, according to U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), which enforces anti-money laundering rules and collects data on suspicious transactions from banks around the country. Complying with anti-money laundering rules, including the manpower needed to file suspicious activity reports, costs U.S. companies as much as $8 billion a year, the Heritage Foundation estimated in a report last year.   The Clearing House will propose a new system under which banks do not investigate and report every transaction that could possibly raise a red flag, according to people involved in the effort. Instead, banks would focus on investigating and reporting transactions based on specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Under this approach, banks could shift their focus, as law enforcement priorities change.   Institutions in different parts of the country may also watch out for certain types of criminal transactions, based on information from authorities. For example, law enforcement could warn banks in the southwest of the United States to look out for drug traffickers moving funds to Mexico, according to people involved in drafting the proposal.   The Clearing House will also call for the creation of an information-sharing platform that would allow banks to share data among themselves about possible criminal transactions.

Following the announcement by the Competition Commission on Wednesday that it had asked the Competition Tribunal to prosecute 17 banks it alleges were colluding to manipulate the value of the rand, it has now merged that Absa will not be targeted for fines because it cooperated with regulators. Fin24 reported on Friday that three people familiar with the matter said the bank, owned by Citigroup and Barclays, could be saved from being penalised by its disclosures to the Competition Commission – that is if they are proven to be correct. Absa does not have full indemnity from being fined as yet. The sources, who asked not be identified because the matter is still confidential, said the two banks had been working with the commission from an early stage. Both Citigroup and Barclays were flagged by the commission as part of the rand-rigging probe that started in 2015, although the commission in its announcement on Wednesday did not name Citigroup and Barclays as its targets for fines. ALSO READ: No fear for the banks we love to hate  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Nomura were identified by the commission on its list as among the lenders that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign-currency pairs involving the rand. The case has been referred to an antitrust tribunal. Sources told Fin24 that prosecutors would argue that traders in New York and Johannesburg used the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg chatrooms to conspire to rig the rand’s rate. The commission will also ask for the maximum fines, while banks, such as Absa, that have cooperated are likely to be granted leniency The prosecution is expected to be shorter than most antitrust cases, “due to the straightforward nature of the matter”, one source said, adding that regulators were not asking for specific action against individual traders from the banks, but they will demand changes to incentives that encourage traders to contravene the country’s competition laws.

While well-intentioned, the other mandates that the President enacted have unfortunately distracted the general public. Still, last Friday’s executive order, “Core Principles For Regulating The United States Financial System,” should prove to be a positive step forward. Regional banks and other non-major bank stocks are paying particular attention to the latest developments. At issue is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law by the Obama administration in 2010. The direct result (and consequence) of Dodd-Frank was the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Originally designed to make the markets fairer for retail investors, the Act instead created yet another government bureaucracy. Even then, Dodd-Frank could be justified if it actually performed as intended. Instead, Dodd-Frank became the U.S. Postal Service, essentially useless and unprofitable. What made things worse was that all bank stocks regardless of size had to abide by the regulations. And institutions that meet a minimum threshold of asset value came under intense scrutiny. That means the same stress tests that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) endured had to be taken by regional banks. Regardless of your political affiliations, such wanton waste simply makes no sense. According to a study by the American Action Forum, Dodd-Frank incurred “$24 billion in final rule costs and 61 million paperwork burden hours.” The Wall Street Journal further added that the Act destroyed small and regional banks. During its first five years, the nation lost, on average, one small bank or credit union per day. Since regional banks are integral to small businesses and communities, this executive order is personal to Donald Trump. Many believe that his promise to make America great again entails bringing jobs back. That’s only half the story. The other half involves shoring up our infrastructure, and helping small businesses. Because it’s the little guys that do most of the hiring, the President can’t ignore their needs. In turn, that means boosting regional banks. Unlike other executive orders, the “Core Principles” should find much-needed bipartisan support. Here are three bank stocks that will soon find sustained relief.

On February 2, Trump took early steps which are a clear indication that – obsessed as he seems to be with dismantling as much as possible of his predecessor’s policies on practically everything – rules and protections created for the protection of consumers of investment advice he will probably be shooting out of the White House window. For starters he plans to reverse the policy – known as the fiduciary rule – that requires brokers to always act in clients’ best interests rather than with seeking profits for themselves. It is significant that Trump signed this new directive in a manner that portends where the bias of his future actions will be leaning towards. His was what is known as an executive order – signed after a White House meeting with Wall Street executives – that is both vague in wording but also having a potential reach over the US financial services sector that is indeed large and long. Already in parts of the literature what is happening in this sector is being described as “the Goldman Sachs agenda for US financial services”, and students of regulation will quickly be recalling all that they were taught about regulatory capture and drawing comparisons with many occasions when in fact Wall Street – and not defenseless citizens’ interests – ruled the White House. The vast bulk of retirees, both present and future, in the US are very worried. After the 2008 Lehman Brothers saga the Dodd-Frank Act had been structured by the Obama administration to, inter alia, ensure that banks and funds’ future liability positions be structured in a way that protect retirees’ interests. This came along with regulations that imposed on US pension advisors very serious fiduciary duties. Products for retirees which would fall into the general description of “excessively complex and generating high fees for limited values” were specifically targeted. There is a sharp difference where it comes to financial services regulation between Donald Trump and Barack Obama But now there is much to suggest that all effort is being directed at reversing the clock.  Craftily it is being alleged by some White House spokesmen that it will be only those parts of Dodd-Frank that hamper people with “good businesses” from being given loans by the banks. Trump is presently coming over as dead set on attacking the 2010 Volcker Rule which reined in certain mortgage practices and derivatives trading, and controlled the extent to which banks could trade with their own money; and this at a time when in fact US banks are increasing consumer lending via the usual popular credit cards and automobile loans. Most of the US media simply do not like Trump’s nestling up close to people like Stephen A. Schwarzman (CEO of private equity colossus Blackstone Group) and Jamie Dimon (boss of JPMorgan Chase).  Same goes for Stephen Bannon (ex-Goldman Sachs). They are all considered as definitely not being on the side of anything but the fat cat bankers of Wall Street, and all already engaged in plans to use the national budget process in some manner that kills off what defences for the working citizen lie in Dodd-Frank. And this at a time when the latest of what is historically an endless story of US bank and finance crises, the Wells Fargo Bank scandal, is still oozing blood out on the US financial scenario.  Of course, in the history of finance in the US we have been here before. Colleagues of mine in the teaching of banking regulation have written extensively about how even the US Securities and Exchange Commission was actually born out of Wall Street’s womb, and not out of real public interest or necessity. There is a sharp difference where it comes to financial services regulation between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Obama had clearly stated that “I did not run for office to be helping a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street”. Trump is now saying to Jamie Dimon, to Stephen Schwarzman, and to others, “Come along, you tell me about Dodd-Frank”(for which read “You tell me how you want it changed”) and never ever asking what the small savers, workers, and pensioners really need to have their savings and futures adequately protected. Sensing the bit between its teeth Wall Street is already strongly lobbying Trump to modify many rules and enforce them only very lightly.  Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee has expressed the view that “President Trump’s action will make it harder for American savers to keep more of what they earn”. With the US economy presently riding a good wave it is easy to see that Trump is wrongly thinking that this is the only time when he can get away with much of what he wants to do in so many areas (medicare, immigration, education, defense, etc).  But working people’s finances are a different kettle of fish. Hit the people, the savers, the workers, the pensioners hard there and one would be surprised at how quick and forceful the social and political backlash can be.

High-frequency trading firms have even built such analysis into their trading strategies. Then along came @real­donaldtrump. A month into Donald Trump’s presidency, the best algorithmic minds on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are still scrambling to come to grips with the phenomenon. “Trump’s tweeting habits seem to be as erratic as everything else about him,” Max Braun, an employee of the Google-affiliated research laboratory known as X, said in a recent interview. Braun has built an automated bot — Trump2Cash — that analyzes Trump’s tweets and then automatically places a trade on the companies the president names. But like others in his field, Braun has learned that Trump’s behavior on social media does not always play out the way the science would predict. After the president criticized Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s clothing line, the bot predicted that Trump’s negative comments about the retailer would cause its stock price to go down, but instead it rose 4.2 percent by the end of the trading day. As of Thursday, however, the bot’s overall returns are in the green, according to a benchmark Braun is keeping. The science of trading based on Twitter predates Trump. Yet the president “is a volatility machine,” said Joe Gits, the chief executive of Social Market Analytics, which produces automated analysis of social media for professional investors. “He generates more volatility than anything in the world right now, so these stocks are going to move one way or the other.” Gits noted that in the long run — or even within a few weeks — almost all the companies that have been hit by Trump’s jabs appeared to have recovered from the damage, suggesting that investors are discounting Trump’s resolve to act against the companies. Shares of Boeing, which was attacked by Trump in December over the cost of producing Air Force One, initially dropped in price, but they are now 12 percent higher than they were on the day of the tweet. But Gits said that any firm doing short-term trading had to take Trump’s statements into account. It has not been easy. In the seconds after Trump’s Nordstrom tweet, for instance, before people would have had enough time to respond, it was evident that automated trading algorithms had crunched the information and begun either selling or betting against the stock. The company’s share price fell 1 percent within a minute. But that decline quickly reversed, and by the end of the day the stock had made strong gains. That complicated response is, in part, a result of the fact that professional traders are not the only ones trying to play the Trump markets — tens of thousands of armchair investors are watching the president’s account and placing trades. Rachel Mayer is the co-founder of a New York startup, Trigger Finance, that creates automatic trading triggers for small-time investors, based on real-world events. The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-­moving signals — such as changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves — but the triggers that Mayer’s company has built around Trump’s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president’s attack. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Trump’s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president’s bark is worse than his bite. “The market doesn’t seem to think that he’s going to do anything else except complain,” she said. Trump2Cash, Braun’s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies because they amounted to more market noise than signal. But Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money — he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Trump’s politics. “I have a very particular set of skills, skills that allow me to have some fun with Trump’s emotional incontinence and maybe effect positive change along the way,” Braun wrote in a Medium post introducing the bot.

(BLK) Stock Is the Best Investment of the Century BLK stock is the perfect hedge in the age of Trump By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 16, 2017, 9:54 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: How Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Fooled the Suckers Again Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Is It Time to Start Worrying? Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Strictly for Yield Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Is Losing the War Against Fake News BlackRock, Inc. (BLK) Stock Is the Best Investment of the Century Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Beats Estimates, Hikes Dividend View All Posts Since going public in 1999, the asset management firm known as BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has been the best investment of the 21st century. Yes, it’s better than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a lot better. It’s up 2,670% in that time, and it has been paying dividends in a rising stream since 2003. Payouts started at 20 cents per share and now bring in $2.50 each quarter. An income investor who got in on the 1999 IPO, paying $14 per share, is now collecting $10 per share in dividends each year. Some of the capital gains are a trick of the light. BlackRock did not participate in the “dot-bomb,” the collapse of Internet stocks that began in early 2000 after Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX) gave AOL 60% of its equity in a merger. BlackRock doubled in value that year. If you start calculating after the dot-bomb wreckage cleared, BlackRock is up “only” 1,000%, against a nearly 5,400% gain for Amazon during that time. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also outpaced it since going public in 2004. The point is that with few exceptions, like the 2008 stock market collapse, the value of BLK stock has consistently increased. And, even during that crisis — where its market cap was cut in half and other companies collapsed completely — BlackRock did not cut that dividend. America’s Best Banker? CEO and co-founder Larry Fink is not often mentioned in the same breath as bankers like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) or Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS); he just does better for his investors. BlackRock was founded in 1988 with operating capital from Pete Peterson of the Blackstone Group, from which it separated in 1995 after a dispute with Stephen Schwarzmann, orchestrated with PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC), whose investment arm came into BlackRock in 1998. BLK went public a year later at $14 per share. Since then, Fink has gone from strength to strength. BlackRock was hired to clean up the mess of the 2008 meltdown. BlackRock Solutions unwound the toxic mortgage assets. Plus, the same year it was hired for that job (2009), BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors and its iShares franchise. BlackRock’s tech assets include Aladdin, an investment system from BlackRock Solutions, and iRetire, a retirement investment framework offered by other financial advisors. Hedge in the Age of Trump As BlackRock has grown, it has developed a knack for taking deals others wouldn’t even consider — and making them work. Right now, for instance, BlackRock is spending $500 million renovating the Willis (nee Sears) Tower in Chicago. In 2015, BLK bought the 108-story landmark, the world’s tallest building when completed in 1973, for $1.3 billion.

Image by: Gallo Images/Thinkstock Banks implicated in fixing the rand price are unlikely to be hit with heavy penalties, say analysts. Save & Share Tweet Email Print Related News Bank price fixers must be punished for their 'unbridled greed‚' says National Treasury Banks guilty of price fixing face fines in the tens of billions‚ but will probably pay far less‚ say experts Big banks accused of currency fiddles The Competition Commission on Wednesday recommended that the Competition Tribunal punish 15 local and foreign-owned banks operating in South Africa for price-fixing. If the tribunal agrees, the banks face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover. The commission's investigation started in April 2015 and goes back to 2007. Standard Bank could be fined tens of billions of rands if it were found that its traders colluded in fixing the prices at which they bought and sold rands. Big banks accused of currency fiddles The Times has calculated that, with about R515-billion in income from banking operations between 2007 and 2014, the bank would have to pay R51-billion in fines. But the implicated banks would have to pay much less if the fine were calculated on the turnover of their currency units, said Intellidex analyst Stuart Theobald. Banks accused of price-fixing the rand: What next? The commission investigated Standard, Investec and Absa but has exempted Absa from penalties because it co-operated in the investigation. In parliament yesterday, President Jacob Zuma said the banks had a case to answer at the tribunal. The government is stepping up its assault on the country's four biggest lenders. The ANC is determined to break their dominance of the sector and force them to lend more to blacks on less stringent terms. Banks guilty of price fixing face fines in the tens of billions‚ but will probably pay far less‚ say experts The banks incurred Zuma's ire when they closed the accounts of companies tied to the Gupta family, which is accused of using its close relationship with Zuma to influence government appointments and the awarding of state contracts. "The timing [of the price-fixing allegations] couldn't be worse for the banks," said Adrian Saville, chief strategist at Citadel Investment Services and Cannon Asset Managers. "It comes at a time when they're trying to demonstrate their impeccable behaviour. It makes a case for intervention." Legal and financial experts believe it is unlikely that the implicated banks - which include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Nomura Holdings - would have to pay huge fines if the Competition Tribunal found against them. Theobald said that, if there were a possibility of a massive fine, the banks' share prices would be plummeting. They dipped slightly on the announcement of the allegations but improved almost immediately. Bank price fixers must be punished for their 'unbridled greed‚' says National Treasury Prosecution of the banks would be difficult because many of the traders were offshore. Lawyers said that the Competition Act gave the authorities jurisdiction over activities that took place, or had an economic effect, in South Africa. Mitch Morrison, a director of Fullard Meyer Morrison, said this meant some banks might be able to "blow off" regulators because they are not physically present in South Africa. "South African banks might be able to use the fact that trades took place offshore as a defence," he said. Wits University associate professor of competition law Kasturi Moodaliyar said that, if the banks' conduct had an economic effect in South Africa, the competition authorities would have jurisdiction. But that would be hard to prove. Just One Lap trader Simon Brown said that, if traders had colluded to raise or lower the price at which the rand was sold, it would not have had a long-term effect on the rand's value. "It looks like it was only the gap between what banks buy and sell currency for that was manipulated. This is how banks make their money in forex. You buy for less than you sell for, and that spread is your profit. This doesn't affect what the actual exchange rate is." The local banks cited in the allegations might negotiate a fine to avoid a drawn out prosecution. Director for competition law at Clifford Dekker Hofmeyr, Lara Granville, said in recent cartel cases the accused usually settled with a fine. "There have been relatively few cartel cases actually litigated before the Competition Tribunal when the targets of these investigations have been found to have contravened the cartel provisions after fully contested litigation. "On the other hand, there are many instances of parties admitting to engaging in cartel activity in a settlement agreement."

Tags Stocks Investments Business Global stocks surge to record highs for first time since 2015 CNBC | Silvia Amaro | Friday, Feb 17, 2017 A trader at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Photo: Reuters Silvia Amaro CNBC Friday, Feb 17, 2017 Global stocks have pushed to new highs, outdoing previous records set in 2015, driven by strong economic data in the US and comments by the Federal Reserve on the future path of interest rates. The FTSE All-World index, which is priced in dollars and measures more than 7,000 companies in 47 countries, closed at 293.31 points on Wednesday afternoon and pushed even higher as stocks opened on Thursday. Reuters data showed this was the first record high reached since the end of May 2015. The benchmark is heavily geared towards America with US stocks having just over a 50 per cent weighting. "Further consideration of the implications of Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen's comments for the path of US interest rates, enhanced by another strong set of US economic data releases, ensured that financials stocks continued to play a central part in further gains for world equity benchmarks yesterday," Ian William, an economist and strategist at Peel Hunt, said in a note on Thursday morning. Yellen told US lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday that the US economy had dealt with the financial crisis better than European countries and that the economy had recovered from a very deep crisis. She also hinted that there could be an interest rate hike as early as next month. Meanwhile, data on Wednesday showed retail sales in the US increasing more than expected and expectations are that consumer spending will continue to be a key contributor to growth. Inflation has also come in higher than expected and manufacturing output has expanded. Such figures have boosted financial stocks across world markets, alongside Yellen's comments with lenders preferring an environment of higher interest rates. "In the UK, a late-session rally pushed the FTSE 100 above 7,300 to its highest close in a month, with banks leading the way once again, backed by pharmas and life insurance," Hunt added. John Bilton, global head of multi-asset strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management told CNBC that rising growth and the shift towards reflation reinforces the view on stocks against bonds. "The world economy is improving in concert for the first time in over five years based on economic surprise indices," he told CNBC via email. "In turn, this has driven the normalised global earnings revision ratios to its highest level over that period. This creates a favourable backdrop for stocks in general and lends support to regional equity markets despite the domestic US focus of the Trump administration." Sign up for our e-newsletter now!

While they may not yet have full indemnity, their disclosures to the Competition Commission could save them from being penalised if the information they provided is proven correct, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is still confidential. The two banks have been working with the commission from an early stage, they said. Citigroup and Barclays were named as part of the rand-rigging probe that started in 2015. The Competition Commission on Wednesday didn’t name Citigroup and didn’t add Barclays to the list of banks it recommended for fines. The commission identified lenders including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. as among those that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign-currency pairs involving the rand. It referred the case to an antitrust tribunal. Sixteen local and international banks face collusion fines Traders in New York and Johannesburg used the Reuters trading platform and Bloomberg chatrooms to conspire to rig the rand’s rate, prosecutors will allege, according to one of the people. While the regulator will seek the maximum fines, banks that have cooperated are likely to be granted leniency, the person said. Fictitious bids "The respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times," the Competition Commission said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. "They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives." The prosecution should be shorter than most antitrust cases, due to the straightforward nature of the matter, one of the people said. Regulators aren’t seeking specific action against individual traders from the banks, but are likely to make demands to change incentives that encourage traders to push the boundaries, the same person said. Other lenders named in the probe include Standard Bank Group, Investec, Standard Chartered, Commerzbank AG, Macquarie Group and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. Barclays Africa, about 50% owned by Barclays, said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday it has co-operated with the commission and will continue to do so. Citigroup declined to comment in an e-mail on why it wasn’t on the list of banks facing a fine. London-based Barclays declined to comment. The commission recommended the banks be fined 10% of their turnover, the maximum allowed. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.
