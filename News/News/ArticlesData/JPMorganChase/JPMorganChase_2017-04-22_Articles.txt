College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Bank Earnings Are Off to a Great Start Don’t let falling bank stocks fool you. It was a very good quarter for the nation’s largest lenders. Motley Fool Staff Apr 22, 2017 at 4:10PM Three of the nation's biggest banks kicked off earnings last week, and the results have been promising. With one exception thus far, large banks have seen their first-quarter net incomes rise by double-digit percentages compared to the year-ago period. As The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield discuss in the following segment of Industry Focus: Financials, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) led the way, with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) turning in the one disappointing performance among too-big-to-fail banks. Listen in below for more details about how each of these banks performed. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 17, 2017. Gaby Lapera: So far, JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells have all reported. Bottom lines for JPMorgan and Citi look good. John Maxfield: Yeah, both of them were up 17% on a year-over-year basis. When you're talking the biggest banks in the country, and among the biggest banks in the world, it's not often that you're going to see earnings grow by double-digit percentages on a year-over-year basis. Lapera: Yeah, that's pretty exciting. We were talking a little bit before the show, and it looks like it's mostly driven through their trading and investment banking. All these big banks, well, Wells kind of, but JPMorgan and Citi especially are universal banks. That means they have two separate arms. They have their retail arm, where they're doing what you traditionally think of as a bank's business, like giving out loans and collecting interest and doing whatever it is that big banks do. The other side of it is this investment-banking side. That's where they saw the big gains this quarter. Maxfield: Yeah. If you think about where we were at this point last year -- and I want to say, I'm going to be totally selfish here, but there's a part of me that wishes we were where we were at this point last year, because that's where, as an investor, we had gone through a huge correction in the market, and as an investor, that's the absolute best time to be in. Right now, everything looks so expensive, so I'm thinking back so fondly on those days. But if you think back to the first quarter of last year, which is what the banks were comping against in the first quarter of this year, there were two things in particular that really helped those comps shine. The first is that oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel. They got down to around $25 a barrel. And that is really, really low. The problem with that for banks -- even though it's great for consumers -- is that if you lend money to energy companies and the price of oil goes down that far, some of those companies that are operating with really tightened margins aren't going to be able to service their loans. So that made banks increase their loan-loss provisions in anticipation of future loan losses from the energy industry. Oil prices have since been on the mend. So they didn't have that concern this year, so they were able to scale down their provisions. Provisions act on income in the same way that expenses do. So it just freed up a whole bunch of revenue to fall to the bottom line. The second point, to the point that you're making, Gaby, is that there is also in that first quarter is when the United Kingdom announced that it was going to have a referendum on whether or not it would stay in the European Union. Now, that actual vote didn't happen until later in the year, but that announcement, in addition to concerns about slowing economic growth in China, caused an enormous amount of volatility in the various types of capital markets, and that translated into lower trading revenues for banks. What banks are is, they help institutional investors buy and sell securities, but when everything's going crazy in the market, those institutional investors step back, which reduces the commission that large, universal banks make from them. Lapera: Yeah, everyone was kind of in a tizzy at the end of the first quarter of last year. I remember that. I was looking at the show notes from last year around this time, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, I remember." We actually got a listener question about what was going on and we answered it and everything. Times were different then, a whole year ago. But the point that you're making, Maxfield, I think, is that the hurdle, the bar, is low for these banks to succeed year over year, in terms of 2016's first quarter versus 2017's first quarter, right? Maxfield: That's exactly right. Now, I don't want to be unfair, because JPMorgan Chase, even though, there was an easy comparison in terms of the comps this year compared to last year, it still had a really good quarter. Even in this really difficult and inhospitable environment for banks, it's earning a double-digit return on equity. So let's be fair; it had a good quarter. But it wasn't as amazing as it looks, based on those comps. Gaby Lapera owns shares of JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield owns shares of Wells Fargo.

U.S.: NYSE USD84.52 -1.03 -1.2039742840444185% /Date(1492808409257-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 18945233 AFTER HOURS USD84.52 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio 13.023112480739599 Market Cap 300710138622.914 Dividend Yield 2.36630383341221% Rev. per Employee 440546 More quote details and news » JPM in Your Value Your Change Short position analyst Eric Pan has dismissed the rollout of a new AUD600 million network covering 80% of the population as a “phantom menace”. He reckons the barebones network won’t be good enough to attract customers who pay a premium to access Telstra’s network, which provides much wider coverage. Plus, TPG’s network is two to three years away from having an impact on the industry. Pan has a target price of AUD5 a share. Deutsche Bank’s DBK.XE -0.3021148036253776% Deutsche Bank AG U.S.: NYSE USD16.5 -0.05 -0.3021148036253776% /Date(1492808523188-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 6049345 AFTER HOURS USD16.66 0.16 0.9696969696969697% Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio N/A Market Cap 32169322823.3725 Dividend Yield 1.2266515151515152% Rev. per Employee 422792 More quote details and news » DBK.XE in Your Value Your Change Short position Craig Wong-Pan is another bull, upgrading the stock to buy in the wake of last week’s selloff. While admitting TPG will impact Telstra’s mobile business, he also notes the new competitor is likely to target more budget conscious subscribers that are customers of Telstra’s rivals. He also notes TPG lacks stores to drive subscriber growth. He has a AUD4.51 price target, adding the stock’s price-earnings multiple trades at a 39% discount to the market. Telstra’s juicy yield has attracted income seeking bargain hunters. The stock is yielding over 7% based on dividends paid over the past 12 months. That yield is even higher for Australian investors once franking credits are taken into account. But should Telstra pay higher dividends or invest more into its network? Bernstein analyst Chris Lane said management may want to consider the wisdom of higher dividends, as committing to higher dividends and not having the cashflow to cover them would be “highly embarrassing”. He reckons this may push future capital management towards buybacks. However, he says the yield at this level is “highly attractive”. JPMorgan’s Pan reckons a dividend cut in unnecessary and reckons “any premature cut in dividend would be an admission of defeat even before it gets started”. Email: robert.guy@barrons.com Comments?

Wall Street banks aren’t buying the White House line that tax reform can be OK’d this year. Even as President Trump on Friday vowed to introduce new details about a tax code overhaul on April 26, major US banks don’t see Congress passing the White House plan before 2018, according to statements by executives and reports put out by the financial institutions. Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have all recently voiced doubt on such an aggressive tax overhaul timetable. Trump’s insistence on pushing for an Obamacare repeal and replacement is getting in the way, the banks said. “I’m not holding my breath,” Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told The Post on Friday about the passage of tax cuts. “If you want to do health care before tax, we don’t have a plan and you’ve already lost a few months. How are we going to do this this year?” Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that Washington is likely to be consumed with “sausage-making” for the next nine months. He had previously said he didn’t expect that Trump would sign any tax legislation before January. And Goldman — which has at least a half-dozen alums in the Trump administration — decried the “continued delays” that health care has imposed on the tax reform timeline, according to a note this week. The pessimism flies in the face of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, himself a former Goldman banker, who said on Thursday that he hopes passing a tax plan “won’t take til the end of the year” — even though in February he said he wanted to have it done by August. With a little more than a week before Trump crosses the 100-day mark, there are few details about the Trump tax cut plan — although Mnuchin has said it would be “sweeping.” More On: tax reforms Trump faces obstacles as he makes his 100-days push Trump looking to close out first 100 days with a bang Democrats' ridiculous tax attack More delays could kill the Trump tax cut One of the key holdups in the tax plan is whether to adopt a 20 percent tax on imports, a hallmark of the House Republican plan that has become increasingly unpopular. “That’s what the US is complaining that other countries do to us now,” Christopher said. “[Exporting countries] could retaliate against us in any number of ways.” Morgan Stanley, which also sees little hope for taxes this year, said that some budget hawks have softened their stances, and can live with “deficit expansion” — meaning they’d cut taxes without finding a way to pay for them. One of the most optimistic outlooks came from Deutsche Bank, which still cautioned investors not to get too excited. “We continue to see a better-than-even chance of tax reform (at least on the corporate side), though more limited in scope than originally advertised,” Joshua Feinman, chief global economist for the bank’s asset management arm, wrote in an April 17 note.

The only thing better than beating expectations is beating them and adding some positive forward guidance for the second quarter and/or the full year. We screened some recent reports from our Wall Street research database and some recent 24/7 Wall St. posts for companies that top analysts on Wall Street think are candidates to beat expectations. These stocks make good sense for growth portfolios that have some risk tolerance. Here are five top tech companies that may beat earnings expectations. Apple This technology giant has been on a huge run, continues printing all-time highs and is the top large cap pick at RBC. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, and it is among the leaders in the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. RBC thinks the iPhone 8 opportunities are solid, as the firm, like others, feels the product will have significant upgrades. Toss in the easier comparisons and the strong average selling prices, and the new phone is a distinct positive. While the firm does note higher commodity prices are a potential headwind from NAND and DRAM pricing, it sees service growth and acceleration as another distinct positive. Apple investors receive a 1.6% dividend. The RBC price target for the stock is $157, and the Wall Street consensus target is $147.61. The stock closed trading on Friday at $142.27, and Apple is scheduled to report earnings on May 2. Arris International This stock has been an RBC favorite for some time and is the top small cap pick. Arris International PLC (NASDAQ: ARRS) provides media entertainment and data communications solutions in the United States and internationally. It operates through two segments. The Customer Premises Equipment segment offers various product solutions, including set-top boxes, gateways, digital subscriber lines and cable modems, and embedded multimedia terminal adapters and voice/data modems that enable service providers to offer voice, video and high-speed data services to residential and business subscribers. The Network & Cloud segment provides cable modem termination system, converged cable access platform, multichannel video programming distributors, programmer equipment, ad insertion technologies and equipment in the ground or on transmission poles, as well as equipment used to initiate the distribution of content-carrying signals. The $33 RBC price target is in line with the consensus target of $33.13. Shares closed most recently at $25.51. The earnings report is due on May 3. Lumentum This top company looks to benefit big-time from the Facebook Voyager project. Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE) manufactures and sells optical and photonic products in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It operates in two segments, Optical Communications and Commercial Lasers. The analysts at JPMorgan are very bullish on the company as it is working on several handset original equipment manufacturers for 3D sensing, and the CEO recently said he could see $100 million or more a quarter growing up to a $1 billion opportunity annually (last 12 month revenues were about $1 billion), which many believe could drive upside to current estimates. JPMorgan has set its price target at $54, and the consensus target is $49.35. The stock closed most recently at $45.20. The company is expected to share its results on May 3. Viavi Solutions This smaller capitalization company has solid upside potential. Viavi Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV) is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community, including Viavi Velocity Solution Partners. The company delivers end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high-performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets. The JPMorgan analysts noted this in a recent report: We continue to see material upside to Viavi’s earnings from 3D sensing in the new iPhone as well as ongoing restructuring. We also believe accretive consolidation deals are a possibility. The $13 JPMorgan price target compares with the posted consensus target of $10.56. The stock closed Friday at $9.90 per share. The company is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results on May 3. Western Digital This long-time innovator in the storage industry is a leader in the total addressable hard disk drive (HDD) market, and it posted a very positive earnings pre-announcement earlier this week. Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC) is an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that help to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. Western Digital is responding to changing market needs by providing a full portfolio of compelling, high-quality storage products with effective technology deployment, high efficiency, flexibility and speed. Its products are marketed under the HGST and WD brands to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, cloud infrastructure providers and consumers. The most compelling news for 2017 and beyond is that the company made a stunning $19 billion purchase of SanDisk last year. This could be a strong addition to Western Digital’s current offerings, and the company could significantly benefit from SanDisk’s technology and portfolio leadership in the NAND flash semiconductor and enterprise flash systems market. Shareholders are paid a solid 2.4% dividend. RBC has a $96 price target, and the consensus price objective is $93.37. Shares closed Friday at $83.11. The company is scheduled to report on Thursday.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman This Big Bank Had the Best First-Quarter Earnings Report All four of the nation’s mega banks have now reported first-quarter earnings, which allows investors to compare their performances through the three months that ended March 31. It was a good quarter for banks, fueled by higher interest rates and income from their trading operations, but none could match Bank of America ‚s(NYSE: BAC) performance . Net income at the nation’s second largest bank by assets surged 40% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period. And for the third time in four quarters, its return on tangible common equity came in above 10%, an important threshold in the bank industry. Bank Year-Over-Year Change in Net Income (1Q17) Return on Tangible Common Equity (1Q17) Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) 40% 10.3% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) 17% 13% Citigroup (NYSE: C) 17% 8.2% Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) 0% 13.9% Data source: Quarterly earnings releases. The atypically large increase in Bank of America’s bottom line was a function of three things: First, the North Carolina-based bank was able to set aside less money this year in anticipation of future loan losses, reducing its provision expense by $162 million. Second, the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase the fed funds rate by 25 basis points last December equated to just under $600 million worth of additional net interest income, just as Bank of America had previously predicted . Third, lower uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets translated into a 23% gain in trading revenue at the universal bank . This isn’t to say that Bank of America doesn’t still have room to improve. Its return on tangible common equity proves that it does, as both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report meaningfully higher numbers. Wells Fargo leads the way with a 13.9% return on tangible common equity, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 13%. Image source: Getty Images. At the same time, as Bank of America’s CFO Paul Donofrio emphasized on the North Carolina-based bank’s conference call , it’s nevertheless on track to meet two of its three main performance targets on an annualized basis by the end of this year. „Many of you have been waiting patiently for us to approach our long-term targets,” said Donofrio. „I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter. We know we have more work to do to be consistently achieving all our targets, but we have more confidence than ever that responsible growth will get us there.” In sum, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also saw their earnings surge in the first quarter, no other big bank made as much forward progress as Bank of America did to start out 2017. 10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Editorial FG, get serious about Malabu bribery probe Published April 23, 2017April 23, 2017 Share Tweet Share Pin it +1 President Muhammadu Buhari1 Prospecting oil Licence 245, originally owned by Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, but sold to two oil companies operating in Nigeria, has spawned a web of corruption likely to haul the country into the abyss of infamy.  It is estimated to be worth about $500 billion. Reported to be the country’s richest oil asset, but sold for a little above $1 billion, the oil block has spiralled into an awfully dense drama since its allocation. A former Minister of Petroleum, Dan Etete, allocated it to a firm in which he had substantial interests in 1998, when the late maximum military ruler, Sani Abacha, was in office. The oil well was earlier entangled in an ownership dispute between Malabu and Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep, which initially came into the picture as a technical partner. A maze of litigation and agreements led to the mega oil block being returned to the Federal Government, and later sold to SNUP at about $1.3 billion. The government, in turn, settled Malabu to relinquish claim to its ownership. It was from the transaction money lodged in Nigeria’s escrow account at JP Morgan Chase, London that about $1.1 billion was paid to Etete and his allies. Nigeria then collected a paltry $210 million. A dodgy transaction of this magnitude can only happen in Nigeria. Prosecutors in Italy in the criminal trial of some oil executives over the case say a hefty bribe of $466 million was shared among Nigerian government officials at the time. A report by Global Witness on email exchanges between oil executives has also established this. Nigeria’s paltry financial gain from the transaction will remain an issue. Simon Taylor of Global Witness – an anti-corruption body − rightly observed that, with the development, “generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services, while oil men have grown rich at their expense.” The murky deal has triggered investigations in Italy, Holland, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. According to a court in Italy, those involved in the oil block deal were conscious of the fact that it was “fraught with fraud.” But all have denied any wrongdoing, just as Malabu and a host of indicted former Nigerian public officials have.  But the massive corruption scandal will not go away. A fortnight ago, operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission invaded the Kano residence of the immediate past Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke (SAN), to conduct a search. He had led the government team that brokered the deal, which resulted in the sale of the controversial oil well in 2011. In a twist that further exposes the underbelly of the scandal, Mohammed, Abacha’s son, has filed a suit at a Federal High Court Abuja, praying it to declare him and Pecos Energy Limited the supposed authentic owners of the oil block. The EFCC is also in court, with charges of fraud against nine persons associated with the bizarre deal.  But can the country be serious in bringing the bribe-takers to book? The toxic nexus between business and government explains why the country is failing. Before the Malabu oil bribery, there were the Siemens and Halliburton scams. Trials have long been concluded in the Halliburton bribery in the US, France and the UK, suspects convicted and jailed; and the US harvested over $1.5 billion in fines imposed on the firm involved. But despite the findings of a special panel headed by the then Inspector-General of Police, Mike Okiro, in 2010, which detailed the beneficiaries of the $132 million bribe, our government never acted. The then chairman of the EFCC and representatives of the State Security Service and National Intelligence Agency served on the committee. Such a prostrate disposition by government in corruption cases that involve the mighty explains why even a cautious optimism is difficult to express with the legal action the EFCC has taken so far on Malabu.  The anti-graft war in the country cannot make headway if the government always develops cold feet anytime questions of abuse of office by former rulers and our discredited ruling class feature in scandals.  Four previous heads of state were allegedly involved in the Halliburton mess; just as some have also been fingered in the Malabu saga. The EFCC should, therefore, end this circus by proving with this case that nobody is above the law, no matter how highly placed. This was what South Korea did when it impeached its first female president, Park Geun-hye, for corruption late last year. She is undergoing trial that could earn her life imprisonment.  This is how to fight corruption. Questions of probity and accountability have been dredged up with Etete and Abacha’s son’s claims to the ownership of OPL 245. Observers argue that Etete, as a minister, acted as a proxy for Abacha in getting the oil block. That is plain corruption and abuse of office if it is proved to be true. The law that gives the President or the Petroleum Resources Minister the discretion to dispense oil blocks or licences does not also direct him to illegally appropriate any. But this is what OPL 245 seems to be all about: conspiracy and official corruption at the highest level. It cannot stand any legal scrutiny. Nigerians must be ready to hold government to account. Brazil was engulfed in unrest for weeks over a huge kickback and bribery scandal at the state-owned oil giant, Petrobras. Apart from landing dozens of the country’s top business elite in jail, investigations into the epic graft scandal, nicknamed Operation Carwash, haveensnared at least five members of the cabinet, the heads of both houses of Congress and former Presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. The Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, has said that “Malabu is a mess.”  He should, therefore, step up government’s efforts to dredge this corruption swamp. No oil well is ever sold without the knowledge of its commercial value, which ultimately determines the signature bonus to be paid. And how much did Malabu pay in this regard? A token of $2 million. This is absolutely incredible! If truly the disputed OPL 245 holds reserves of about 9.23 billion barrels of oil, valued at about $500 billion, those who cornered it, sold it for the benefit of Malabu and a litany of corrupt Nigerian public officials really have questions to answer.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. said in their first-quarter earnings results that rising oil prices have helped them free a combined $370 million they previously set aside to cover bad loans. If the optimism turns into an increase in lending, it would be a boon to shale firms from Texas to North Dakota that rely on borrowed money to finance their drilling and fracking. That could further accelerate U.S. oil production, which is already expected to rise above 10 million barrels a day for the first time in late 2018, and put more pressure on OPEC’s efforts to restrain supply. “Cautious optimism is the theme,” said Kraig Grahmann, a partner at Dallas-based law firm Haynes & Boone. “Banks will still be a lot more prudent and conservative than they were when the price drop happened.” The spigots are starting to open. In the first quarter, U.S. energy companies raised $26.8 billion in so-called leveraged loans — loans that are extended to those already holding significant amounts of debt — up roughly 86 percent from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies are already looking to spend more. According to a Haynes & Boone April 4 survey that questioned 163 executives at oil companies, banks and private equity firms, 76 percent of respondents said they expect credit lines to stay steady or grow, and 89 percent predicted U.S. shale drillers will spend more in 2017. “With low cost of capital loans, there will be more programs for oil producers that will get them the desired rate of return,” Grahmann said. “Companies will be able to drill more oil and gas wells, which will increase production and thus increase U.S. supply.” Last year, U.S. lenders reduced credit to the U.S. energy sector after crude dropped near $26 a barrel, sparking fear that indebted shale producers would default. With prices double that level now, the worries about bad loans have eased. “If oil stays where it is for the next 12 months, there is not a big concern for credit quality,” Spencer Cutter, a U.S. Credit Bloomberg Intelligence Analyst. “[But] big banks will be more selective when choosing who to extend loans and will increase lending to better producers.”   Sarah Ponczek writes for Bloomberg View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: This Big Bank Had the Best First-Quarter Earnings Report Earnings surged at banks throughout the industry, yet one bank’s performance stood out from the rest. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Apr 22, 2017 at 10:47AM All four of the nation's mega banks have now reported first-quarter earnings, which allows investors to compare their performances through the three months that ended March 31. It was a good quarter for banks, fueled by higher interest rates and income from their trading operations, but none could match Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) performance. Net income at the nation's second largest bank by assets surged 40% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period. And for the third time in four quarters, its return on tangible common equity came in above 10%, an important threshold in the bank industry. Bank Year-Over-Year Change in Net Income (1Q17) Return on Tangible Common Equity (1Q17) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 40% 10.3% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) 17% 13% Citigroup (NYSE:C) 17% 8.2% Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 0% 13.9% Data source: Quarterly earnings releases. The atypically large increase in Bank of America's bottom line was a function of three things: First, the North Carolina-based bank was able to set aside less money this year in anticipation of future loan losses, reducing its provision expense by $162 million. Second, the Federal Reserve's decision to increase the fed funds rate by 25 basis points last December equated to just under $600 million worth of additional net interest income, just as Bank of America had previously predicted. Third, lower uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets translated into a 23% gain in trading revenue at the universal bank. This isn't to say that Bank of America doesn't still have room to improve. Its return on tangible common equity proves that it does, as both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report meaningfully higher numbers. Wells Fargo leads the way with a 13.9% return on tangible common equity, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 13%. Image source: Getty Images. At the same time, as Bank of America's CFO Paul Donofrio emphasized on the North Carolina-based bank's conference call, it's nevertheless on track to meet two of its three main performance targets on an annualized basis by the end of this year. "Many of you have been waiting patiently for us to approach our long-term targets," said Donofrio. "I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter. We know we have more work to do to be consistently achieving all our targets, but we have more confidence than ever that responsible growth will get us there." In sum, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also saw their earnings surge in the first quarter, no other big bank made as much forward progress as Bank of America did to start out 2017.

The pound has strengthened in response to the snap election Credit: Jason Alden /Bloomberg James Connington 22 April 2017 • 7:32am The Prime Minister’s surprise general election announcement this week was met with a six-month high for the pound against the dollar, and a 2.5pc fall for the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks. The strengthening of the pound indicates that markets are expecting the Conservative party to win a large majority, making it easier for Theresa May to push through a Brexit deal. Such a result would remove an element of uncertainty about the Brexit process – one of the main factors that has been depressing sterling’s value.  But what does a stronger pound mean for investors? Snap general election guide 01:30 What is happening to the pound? Before the EU referendum, the pound was highly volatile, reacting sharply to polling data indicating which way the vote was swinging. Following the vote it sank dramatically in value, falling from around $1.45 to lows of under $1.20. Pound / dollar exchange rate This slump was one of the main drivers of UK investor returns in 2016, with any company generating earnings from overseas getting a boost when it was converted into sterling. According to investment bank Stifel, if the Conservative party does achieve a stronger majority the pound should strengthen further. How does the pound affect returns? Global investments The returns of any UK-based fund, “tracker” or investment trust that invests overseas are exposed to exchange rate movements. For instance, if a fund invests in American-listed retailer Amazon any returns are delivered in dollars. For a UK investor those returns are then converted back into pounds. When the pound weakens compared to the company’s home currency the returns in sterling terms are boosted. Sign up to Telegraph Investor A significant proportion of the return from global funds to UK investors last year was due to the effects of the weakened pound. According to Alex Dryden of JP Morgan Asset Management, in 2016 a 50pc global shares and 50pc global bonds portfolio would have returned 5pc in US dollars, or 26pc in pounds. However, the reverse is also true, meaning that when the pound strengthens, overseas returns are dampened due to being converted into a stronger currency. Therefore, investors who enjoyed significant currency-induced gains from their global investments last year may see some of that profit wiped out. UK investments Just because a company is listed in the UK, does not mean that is where it earns its money. The companies within the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s largest companies derive 72pc of their earnings from overseas, meaning exchange rate movements have an immediate effect. When the pound falls, these earnings are boosted due to the more beneficial exchange rate. Over the short to medium term, this leads to a notable link between the performance of the pound and the index (see chart below). When the pound goes down, the FTSE 100 goes up Mr Dryden explained that since the start of 2016, for every 1pc fall in the pound there has been a 0.9pc rise in the index. Companies that earn more of their money in the UK avoid this exchange rate influence, but are then more exposed to the performance of the UK economy. However, even the more domestically focused FTSE 250 index derives 50pc of its earnings from overseas. Understand what you are invested in The vast majority of individual investors should not attempt to react to short-term currency movements, but it is prudent to be aware of exposure to movements in the pound. Global funds vary enormously in terms of the international exposure that they offer, and UK funds will offer differing exposure to movements in the pound based on the type of company they invest in.  The table below shows the percentage of a selection of large global investment trusts that are invested in the UK. At just a 4pc weighting to the UK, the £5bn Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust is the most internationally exposed global investment trust. Global investment trusts by UK weighting It is therefore more exposed to movements in the pound, although it has delivered substantial returns on top of the currency boost.  In pounds its one-year return is 35pc and in dollars it is 21pc, according to data service FE.  At the other end of the spectrum Law Debenture trust has 70pc invested in the UK and Lindsell Train investment trust has 74pc in the UK.  However, it is not as simple as saying that Scottish Mortgage is 70 percentage points more exposed to movements in the pound compared to Lindsell Train. The Lindsell Train fund invests in a number of large international businesses that are listed in the UK, such as Diageo, Relx and Unilever. All of these companies earn the majority of their revenues from overseas. That means that, as individual stocks, their earnings are swayed by the value of the pound, in turn affecting the share price and the fund’s performance.  The impact of the pound will be the same on these companies as some overseas-listed stocks that Scottish Mortgage owns. As a result, Lindsell Train Investment Trust has returned 36pc in pound-terms over the past year and 22pc in dollars – an identical difference to Scottish Mortgage despite the vastly different UK weighting.  How to deal with the influence of currency One way to mitigate the role of currency within a portfolio is to invest in hedged shares. These are share classes – only offered by some funds – where the fund invests in complicated currency contracts to attempt to cancel out the impact of exchange rates on returns. This means you receive returns as if you were investing in local currency, which is beneficial if the pound is strengthening, but means that you could miss out on gains if it weakens. However, while the funds attempt to cancel out all currency effects, they cannot always do this entirely. Five tips for managing your stocks and shares Isa 02:28 For most investors however, the answer to the problem of a shifting pound is to ensure they are diversified, incorporating domestically focused UK investments and investments that do not correlate with wider stock markets, alongside broad international exposure. UK smaller companies have proven a surprising haven since the referendum result, as the UK economy has performed markedly better than pre-vote predictions suggested. Despite not benefiting as heavily from the weakening of the pound, the average UK smaller companies fund has returned 22pc over the past year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Google Wallet is Making Strides, But it’s No Venmo Killer Last month, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced Gmail users would now be able to send and receive money on Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the „Send money” or „Request money” options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. Google Wallet’s uninspiring past While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn’t take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet’s own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail’s app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc’s Google blog . Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one’s Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. Google Wallet’s uneven present The constant meddling with Google Wallet’s capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc ‚s(NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation’s largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture’ s 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey , consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn’t standing still. In 2016’s fourth quarter, PayPal’s Venmo app, a hit with millennials , facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country’s largest financial institutions including Bank of America , BB&T , Capital One , JP Morgan Chase , PNC Financial , and Wells Fargo . As with Google Wallet’s new service, these banks’ account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person’s email address or phone number. Many of Zelle’s future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Google Wallet’s uncertain future Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with — once users are comfortable using a certain system, it’s tough to get them to switch. PayPal’s core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year.

The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the „Send money” or „Request money” options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. Google Wallet’s uninspiring past While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn’t take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet’s own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail’s app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc’s Google blog . Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one’s Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. Google Wallet’s uneven present The constant meddling with Google Wallet’s capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc ‚s(NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation’s largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture’ s 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey , consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn’t standing still. In 2016’s fourth quarter, PayPal’s Venmo app, a hit with millennials , facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country’s largest financial institutions including Bank of America , BB&T , Capital One , JP Morgan Chase , PNC Financial , and Wells Fargo . As with Google Wallet’s new service, these banks’ account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person’s email address or phone number. Many of Zelle’s future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Google Wallet’s uncertain future Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with — once users are comfortable using a certain system, it’s tough to get them to switch. PayPal’s core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it’s hard to see Google Wallet closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of accompanying attention from its parent company. With Alphabet’s track record with Google Wallet, that’s not something to count on. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We like this definition. New apartment community provides 61 new homes with services for formerly homeless and low-income residents. WILLOWBROOK, California (PRWEB) April 22, 2017 LINC Housing joined Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, community leaders, partners, neighbors and new residents to celebrate the completion of Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook, a new 61-unit affordable housing community for low-income families and formerly homeless households. Half of the apartments at the new complex are for formerly homeless residents who are being served by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. The other homes are for families earning up to 60 percent of the area median income for Los Angeles County, as established by HUD. "Homelessness and affordable housing are top concerns for the Willowbrook community," said Rebecca Clark, LINC's president and CEO. "We've worked side-by-side with county leaders, our partners and this community to bring solutions that will improve people's lives and transform the neighborhood. Now that construction is complete, we’ll shift our focus to providing expansive services including programs that will focus on housing stability, personal empowerment and community building." According to the latest homeless count from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, there are nearly 47,000 homeless in Los Angeles County. Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook is one of several new properties LINC Housing, a nonprofit focused on community development and affordable housing, is building to help address the affordable housing and homelessness issues facing the county. In addition to providing much-needed housing for low-income and formerly homeless residents, Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook also demonstrates LINC’s commitment to sustainable building and providing residents with healthy, energy efficient homes. The architecture and landscape at Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook has a ranch-style feeling that evokes the neighborhood's pride in being "country living in the city." It also incorporates many features for healthy living. Open stairs filled with natural light are conveniently located to encourage their use, while elevators are physically tucked away. The buildings are interconnected by open space to encourage walking and socialization. Community gardens are available for families to grow their own food, and the community room has space for educational classes for healthy living as well as a kitchen where residents can learn and share recipes on how to prepare the food they’ve grown. A tot lot and small field provide children a safe environment for physical activity. The large community space also includes multipurpose space to house a variety of resident programs as well as a computer lab, fitness room, manager’s office, and private meeting space for service providers and case managers. With the support of LINC's team of funders, architects, and contractors, Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook is on track to achieve a LEED for Homes Platinum rating. The property includes the following LEED, ENERGY STAR and sustainable features:     Utilizes water, energy, and material resources efficiently in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide cost-saving benefits to residents     Structures designed with durability and occupant comfort in mind     Energy-efficient light fixtures     ENERGY STAR refrigerators, dishwashers, and clothes washers     Low-flow toilets, showers, and faucets     Drought tolerant plants and high-efficiency irrigation     Environmentally friendly products, including green-certified flooring, locally produced cement, and low VOC paints, adhesives, and sealants     Within walking distance of bus stops that provide over 280 weekly transit rides     On-site fitness room, tot lot, and bicycle storage locations help promote exercise and a healthy lifestyle     Walkable community near to parks, restaurants, and schools. Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook has strong support from Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ office as well as the Los Angeles Community Development Commission.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Google Wallet is Making Strides, But it's No Venmo Killer Android users can now send money through Gmail on their favorite mobile device. Does it matter? Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Apr 22, 2017 at 8:48AM Last month, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced Gmail users would now be able to send and receive money on Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the "Send money" or "Request money" options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. Google Wallet's uninspiring past While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn't take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet's own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail's app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc's Google blog. Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one's Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. Google Wallet's uneven present The constant meddling with Google Wallet's capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation's largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture's 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey, consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn't standing still. In 2016's fourth quarter, PayPal's Venmo app, a hit with millennials, facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country's largest financial institutions including Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo. As with Google Wallet's new service, these banks' account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person's email address or phone number. Many of Zelle's future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Google Wallet's uncertain future Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with -- once users are comfortable using a certain system, it's tough to get them to switch. PayPal's core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it's hard to see Google Wallet closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of accompanying attention from its parent company. With Alphabet's track record with Google Wallet, that's not something to count on.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Bill To Replace Dodd-Frank Could Silence Shareholders By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 04/22/17 AT 6:00 AM Close Appalled by a Bloomberg Markets Magazine cover story that linked American steel company Nucor Corp. to pig iron suppliers in Brazil who used slave labor, an investment firm with a stake in Nucor called for corrective action. Their mechanism: a shareholder resolution. The proposal appeared on Nucor’s 2009 proxy statement prior to a yearly shareholder meeting — and 27 percent of the company’s shareholders voted in favor it. Nucor stalled at first, but within a year, the steelmaker told the stakeholding company, Domini Social Investments LLC (now Domini Impact Investments) that it had begun requiring its manufacturers to sign an agreement with a group of nongovernmental organizations, including a pledge to break ties altogether with the suppliers using forced labor. The shareholder resolution wouldn't have been legally binding but its success in drawing attention helped achieve real change.  “It’s kind of a little bit of a shame factor,” Adam Kanzer, then Domini's general counsel, now its managing director, said in a phone interview. “The CEO doesn’t want that.” The tool behind Domini’s ability to pressure Nucor will soon be out of reach to all but a hardly-existent portion of investors if a new bill becomes law. The CHOICE Act, sponsored by Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, would replace Dodd-Frank  — and sharply raise the ownership threshold for shareholders who can file proposals. Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) questioned SEC Chair Mary Jo White during a hearing in Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, 2016. Photo: Reuters Under current Securities and Exchange Commission rules, investors must own 1 percent or $2,000 worth of a publicly-traded company’s market capitalization for a continuous year. Hensarling’s bill would get rid of the $2,000 standard altogether, mandating that shareholders own 1 percent of the company for three years, according to a committee memo describing the bill. It would also raise the vote percentage needed for investors to resubmit their proposals the following year, and prohibit the filing of proposals on behalf of other investors. That 1 percent may seem miniscule, but Nucor’s current market cap, for example, is around $19 billion. In order to file a proposal under Hensarling’s CHOICE Act, an investor would have to hold $190 million in shares of the firm. The committee approved the bill in September and planned to hold a hearing on it Wednesday morning. Executives ‘Need To See A Financial Benefit To Change’ Shareholder proposals have pushed companies to do far more than address human rights abuses within their supply chains. Their effective elimination would have far-reaching consequences for climate change, board diversity and pay equity, pension funds’ power over their investments and companies’ disclosures of lobbying and campaign finance activities. Some firms — like the asset manager BlackRock, which issued guidance this year on its adherence to environmentally-conscious policies — have taken the lead on climate change issues on their own. But shareholders of other companies, especially those in the energy sector, have been increasingly nudging those firms in the direction of better sustainability, and have drawn substantial shareholder voting support. In the spring of 2016, nine resolutions from shareholders of energy companies related to the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal (limiting a rise in global temperatures to 2 degree Celsius) garnered an average vote of nearly 38 percent, the for-profit research and consulting firm Governance and Accountability Institute found.  Among the nine firms were Southern Co., ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., some of the top greenhouse gas polluters. Last year saw 978 shareholder proposal submissions, Deloitte found; of those, 71 focused on environmental issues, up from 40 in both 2012 and 2013, according to Heidi Welsh, executive director of the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute. This year, 66 such proposals were filed. (Shareholder resolutions for the year are generally filed by March.) With President Donald Trump’s budget proposal draining nearly a third of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, a primary force in the fight against climate change could soon be weakened.  With the loss of shareholder proposals, another climate regulation tool would be all but eliminated. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney (R) listened as President Donald Trump (L) met with members of the Republican Study Committee at the White House in Washington, D.C. March 17, 2017, the day after he released his "America First" budget plan. Photo: Reuters To Tim Smith, the director of Environmental, Social and Governance Shareowner Engagement at the Boston-based Walden Asset Management, it would mean his firm would no longer be able to push forward a vote on whether corporate boards ought to publish sustainability reports, as it successfully did with the energy companies Emerson Electric and C. R. Bard Inc. “We believe — and it’s not just us, but investors we work with — that this is more important than ever before,” Smith said. While many firms were “on a roll with sustainability,” some, like ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., were “good on certain things,” he said. “But in terms of moving toward a less-than-two-degree world, they have been behind on that.” Shareholders also often use proposals to push for pay equity and increased representation of women and minorities on corporate boards. Shareholder resolutions have led some companies to no longer allow a single person to play the role of both chairman and CEO. And, as Natasha Lamb, managing director of Boston-based Arjuna Capital, told American Banker in March, it could be a tool in the fight for corporate wage equality. “We don’t expect that businesses will change for the sake of doing the right thing — they need to see a financial benefit to change,” she said. “When we file shareholder proposals, that’s the position we’re coming from.” Shareholder resolutions can also be a means of shedding light on corporations’ lobbying and campaign finance activities at a time when, a February study found, only 12 percent of publicly-traded firms in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index disclosed their lobbying expenditures. The number of shareholder proposals on lobbying, the report noted, grew to 64 in 2016 from just five in 2010. Proposals related to elections remained relatively flat, but still made up a large portion of resolutions involving political activity, with between 40 and 63 filed per year between 2010 and 2016. A group of shareholders of the health insurance giant Anthem Inc. might be especially angered at the impending loss of a major corporate transparency tool. Earlier this year, Anthem shareholders submitted a resolution asking the company to disclose its “policy and procedures governing lobbying” and “payments by Anthem used for direct or indirect lobbying or grassroots lobbying communications.” But the SEC effectively blocked the resolution, giving Anthem executives free rein to keep lobbying information out of their proxy statement. Meanwhile, Anthem lawyers expressed hope that Trump’s administration might settle an antitrust suit by the Justice Department blocking the health insurance giant’s $48 billion acquisition of Cigna — a merger that would create the nation’s largest health insurance conglomerate. Last year, Anthem poured millions into campaign groups with ties to officials presiding over the agencies that would oversee and evaluate the merger, channeled $100,000 toward Trump’s inaugural committee and saw one of its key lobbyists take a top legal post at the White House. ‘All Hell Has Frozen Over’ Shareholder proposals are also useful to pension funds, which hold relatively large assets but still would fail to meet the 1 percent threshold. “Apparently all hell has frozen over, as the Republicans are now attacking investors,” said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the Office of Investment for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the largest federation of unions in the U.S. He added that even though the AFL-CIO’s fund holds about $7 billion in total assets, Hensarling’s proposal “would completely disenfranchise working people’s voices.” Public pension fund managers expressed similar frustration. “As a major long-term investor, the New York State Common Retirement Fund regularly files shareholder resolutions that call for action at the companies in its portfolio in order to protect the value of our investments,” New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office said in a statement, calling the proposed rule change “outrageous.” The office of his New York City counterpart said in a similar statement that the adjustment “would silence investors like our office — and hurt our City’s retired firefighters, police officers, and teachers.” So why would Hensarling want to essentially get rid of the shareholder proposal? A press representative from the Texas Republican’s office referred IBT to the House Financial Services Committee. In a statement, a Republican committee staffer, through a spokesperson, attributed the proposed change to “gadflies” who “hijack the process to push social and politically motivated agendas.” But it may help to look at a February letter from the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives chaired until recently by the CEO of one of Hensarling’s top campaign contributors, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon. Addressed to Trump’s National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, it asks for several Dodd-Frank and SEC rule rollbacks, among them the $2,000 threshold for shareholder proposals. JP Morgan Chase and Company CEO Jamie Dimon testified at a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., June 13, 2012. Photo: Reuters “In too many cases, activist investors with insignificant stakes in public companies make shareholder proposals that pursue social or political agendas unrelated to the interests of the shareholders as a whole,” the missive states. It cited Business Roundtable’s far more detailed and restrictive proposed limits on the shareholder proposal process, as enumerated in a post that characterizes the current rule as “outdated.” Nanette Heide, a partner at the law firm Duane Morris and a board member of the New York chapter of the Association for Corporate Growth, a global organization for merger and acquisition professionals, thinks policymakers ought to find a “happy medium.” “We want to be an attractive public trading market for both U.S. investors and non-U.S. investors as well,” she said, echoing the worry that some shareholders are “pushing their own agenda for no one but themselves.” Heide suggested post-recession laws might’ve been “too reactionary,” and could be reined in. While the three-year ownership period and 1 percent threshold struck her as far too rigorous, she pointed to data citing a relative dearth of calls for diversity and equal pay among the proposals. And although many described resolutions as a low-cost, efficient way to call attention to risks and other problems within a corporation, she cited concerns about the costs to the company itself. “The cost of bringing a proposal is greater than $2,000,” Heide said. “Maybe there's a more moderate place in between [$2,000 and 1 percent] so that people aren’t  making a small investment in the company and using it to their benefit.” To Kanzer, who was behind the push to break Nucor’s ties to slave labor, an investor’s financial stake is a non-factor. “It may not matter that the person who raised the idea owned $2,000 worth of stock or half a billion worth of stock,” he said, adding that owners of as much as 1 percent of a company can often simply pick up the phone and call its executives. “It’s the idea that matters.”National More Political Capital Lobbyists Funnel Cash To Democrats Amid Push To Pass Trump Bills By Andrew Perez (MapLight) and David Sirota Money flows into party’s coffers as companies seek bipartisan support for Trump-backed legislation.

Thursday, April 20, 2017 By Sarah Anderson, OtherWords | Op-Ed font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet Did you pay all of your taxes this April? Wall Street banks typically pay much less than the official 35 percent corporate tax rate. And yet after attacking Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street, President Donald Trump is pushing reforms that would make it even easier for big banks to rig the tax rules and skip out on paying their fair share. Nine of the largest and most profitable US banks paid an average federal tax rate of only 18.6 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to a new paper co-published by the Institute for Policy Studies and several tax and Wall Street reform groups. By using various loopholes, these banks avoided paying about $80 billion that could've gone towards urgent public needs, like fixing our crumbling infrastructure and expanding pre-K programs. Under Trump's plan, tax-dodging banks would pay even less. The official rate would drop to 15 percent, and they'd still benefit from loopholes that would let them pay even lower rates. One of the biggest loopholes allows US banks and other large corporations to use "creative accounting" to shift profits earned in the United States to foreign nations with low or no corporate taxes. Corporations still owe US taxes on these profits, but they can put off paying them indefinitely. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just send Uncle Sam an IOU every year? Financial firms are particularly good at this offshore tax-dodging game. The six largest US banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) have set up more than 2,300 subsidiaries in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. In 2016, they were holding nearly $150 billion in profits offshore. Trump's tax plan would slash the rate on those offshore profits to just 10 percent, saving the banks an estimated $25 billion. When these tax discounts on offshore profits have been tried in the past, they didn't help bring back US jobs. Instead of doling out new tax breaks to Wall Street, lawmakers should be working to make sure these profitable firms pay their fair share. After all, these are the guys who drove our economy off a cliff with their recklessness and greed in 2008. After the crash, taxpayers put them on a path back to profitability with massive bailouts. Where is all that money going today? While much of the country continues to struggle with widespread unemployment, losing their homes, and skinny budgets, Wall Street's high profits are once again driving sky-high pay for executives. At Citigroup, for example, a bank that wouldn't exist today if it hadn't been bailed out, CEO Michael Corbat made more than $42 million over the past three years. One practical way to generate much-needed revenue from Wall Street would be through a tax on short-term speculation. Working families pay sales taxes when they buy essentials like gas and shoes. But when Wall Street traders buy millions of dollars in stocks or derivatives and sell them a split second later, they don't pay any tax at all.  This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

New York saw a total of $1.4 billion in new issuance, $901 million of which was backed by office properties. There was $59 billion on the New York CMBS market in March, down 0.7 percent from $59.4 billion in February, and the delinquency rate fell 11 basis points to 0.51 percent, according to Trepp data prepared for The Real Deal. Nationally, the delinquency rate ticked up 6 basis points to 5.37 percent. New issuance in March totaled $556 million across four deals. Three loans totaling $197 million were securitized in the same $1 billion CMBS deal originated by Goldman Sachs. They include a $100 million loan backed by Vornado Realty Trust’s 350 Park Avenue, part of a $400 million financing package provided by Goldman Sachs, and a $70 million loan backed by Straus Group’s retail condominium at 935 Madison Avenue. Four New York loans, totaling $230 million, were included in another $1 billion CMBS deal, originated by by JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. They include a second chunk of the 350 Park Avenue loan and an $80 million piece of the $370 million refinancing of the Kushner Companies’ retail condo at 229 West 43rd Street. While the majority of the new issuance was backed by office and retail properties, a total of $28 million in loans on co-op properties in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, were securitized in a $624 million CMBS package. As for subtractions from the CMBS pool, the Chetrit Group’s $82 million loan on two office properties at 90 and 100 Trinity Place, which had been non-performing beyond maturity, was refinanced with a $101 million loan from South Korean fund manager KTB Asset Management and Midtown-based Rexmark. The market is expected to perk up more in the upcoming quarter, said Trepp analyst Sean Barrie, as concerns about the risk retention laws implemented in December wane.

Dakota Access Pipeline Mogul Cut $250,000 Check for Trump's Inauguration Thursday, April 20, 2017 By Sam Sacks, The District Sentinel | Report font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC, January 24, 2017. (Photo: Doug Mills / The New York Times) Financial disclosures filed on Tuesday reveal that corporate chiefs, including those with pending business before then-incoming President Trump, provided much of the financing for the festivities around his inauguration. Complying with federal law, the Trump Inaugural Committee disclosed its donors to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday, showing total contributions of more than $106 million -- a new record. Included in the roster of funders is pipeline builder Kelcy Warren, who contributed a quarter-million dollars to the event. Warren's company, Energy Transfer, is behind construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. In an interview with The Dallas News in January, Warren described 2016 as the "toughest year of my life," referring to protests that rocked the company over the construction of DAPL. He said that Trump's election gave him hope. Protests over DAPL forced the Obama administration to put the project on hold. Indigenous and environmental activists claim the pipeline threatens lands and water that are crucial to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. Trump, however, ignored those pleas and green-lighted construction of DAPL in February. Several other companies that later benefited from executive actions taken by President Trump also donated to the inauguration. Coal mining giant Murray Energy and petrol companies Chevron and Citgo gave over a million dollars combined. Last month, Trump took actions that put former President Obama's signature climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan, in jeopardy. Health insurance companies MetLife and Anthem also chucked over $100,000 apiece at the Trump inaugural committee, just as the incoming administration was plotting to repeal Affordable Care Act regulations. Other inaugural donors included top Wall Street firms like JP Morgan Chase and American Financial Group. Both companies each forked over $500,000 to Trump's celebratory organization. In his first few months in office, Trump has also taken aim at financial rules put in place by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law. Well-known GOP funder and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson was the top contributor to the inaugural committee, donating a whopping $5 million. Notable investor Charles Schwab and GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parson also were large donors, each one contributing a million dollars. That donation tier provided access to a "leadership luncheon" described as "an exclusive event with select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership," according to documents obtained by the Center for Public Integrity. The $106.7 million raised in total is a biggest haul of any inaugural committee. Former President Obama's 2013 Inaugural Committee collected $44.6 million, and also solicited corporate donors. Independent media is crucial for keeping a close watch on the Trump administration and Truthout takes that responsibility seriously.
