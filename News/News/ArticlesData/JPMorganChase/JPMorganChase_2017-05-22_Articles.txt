Additional Information about the Offers The tender offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 22, 2017 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and a related Letter of Transmittal the “Letter of Transmittal”), which set forth a more detailed description of the Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase (and any amendments or supplements thereto), the Third-Party Purchasers will only accept for purchase as many of the 2020-2021 Notes as the Third-Party Purchasers can purchase with cash up to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment and the Company will only accept for purchase as many of the 2023-2029 Notes as the Company can purchase with cash up to the Company Maximum Tender Payment and the applicable Tender Cap. If purchasing all of the validly tendered Notes of a series of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any Settlement Date would cause the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and any Tender Cap, as applicable, to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that Settlement Date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that Settlement Date, such that the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and the Tender Caps, as applicable, will not be exceeded. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated.

In addition, Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date. Any Third-Party Offer may be extended or amended without a corresponding extension or amendment of any other Third-Party Offer or the Company Offers, and vice versa. Subject to the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Date (the “Early Settlement Date”), the Third-Party Purchasers expect to purchase any 2020-2021 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date.

If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will not purchase any 2020-2021 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will purchase any remaining 2020-2021 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Expiration Date (the “Final Settlement Date” and each of the Early Settlement Date and Final Settlement Date, a “Settlement Date”), subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will not purchase any 2023-2029 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will purchase any remaining 2023-2029 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Tender Caps, the application of the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Final Settlement Date, subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

The amount of 2023-2029 Notes of each series that are purchased on any Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels set forth in the table immediately below (the “2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels” and, together with the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels, the “Acceptance Priority Levels”), with 1 being the highest 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Level and 3 being the lowest 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Level, in each case, subject to the Tender Caps and proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

Additional Information about the Offers The tender offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 22, 2017 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and a related Letter of Transmittal the “Letter of Transmittal”), which set forth a more detailed description of the Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase (and any amendments or supplements thereto), the Third-Party Purchasers will only accept for purchase as many of the 2020-2021 Notes as the Third-Party Purchasers can purchase with cash up to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment and the Company will only accept for purchase as many of the 2023-2029 Notes as the Company can purchase with cash up to the Company Maximum Tender Payment and the applicable Tender Cap. If purchasing all of the validly tendered Notes of a series of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any Settlement Date would cause the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and any Tender Cap, as applicable, to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that Settlement Date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that Settlement Date, such that the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and the Tender Caps, as applicable, will not be exceeded. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated. Holders must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2017 (such date and time, as may be extended, the “Early Tender Date”) to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as set forth in the applicable table above). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration for Notes of that series (which is equal to the Total Consideration minus the applicable Early Tender Premium) (as set forth in the applicable table above). In addition, Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date. Any Third-Party Offer may be extended or amended without a corresponding extension or amendment of any other Third-Party Offer or the Company Offers, and vice versa. Subject to the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Date (the “Early Settlement Date”), the Third-Party Purchasers expect to purchase any 2020-2021 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date.

Subject to the application of the Tender Caps, the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Early Settlement Date, the Company expects to purchase any 2023-2029 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date.

The Early Settlement Date will be determined at the option of the Purchasers and is currently expected to occur on June 7, 2017, subject to all conditions to the Offers having been satisfied or waived by the applicable Purchaser(s) with respect to such purchases. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will not purchase any 2020-2021 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will purchase any remaining 2020-2021 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Expiration Date (the “Final Settlement Date” and each of the Early Settlement Date and Final Settlement Date, a “Settlement Date”), subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will not purchase any 2023-2029 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will purchase any remaining 2023-2029 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Tender Caps, the application of the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Final Settlement Date, subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Final Settlement Date is expected to occur promptly following the Expiration Date, subject to all conditions to the respective Offers having been satisfied or waived by the applicable Purchaser(s).

Subject to applicable law, the Third-Party Purchasers may extend or otherwise amend the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date with respect to the Third-Party Offers, or the Third-Party Purchasers may increase or decrease the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, in each case, without extending the deadline for withdrawal or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of holders of Notes, and the Company may extend or otherwise amend the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date with respect to the Company Offers, or the Company may increase or decrease the Company Maximum Tender Payment. The Company may also increase, decrease or eliminate any of the Tender Caps, in each case, without extending the deadline for withdrawal or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of holders of Notes, subject to applicable law. Subject to applicable law, the applicable Purchaser(s) with respect to each Offer reserve(s) the right to terminate, withdraw, amend or extend such Offer without also terminating, withdrawing, amending or extending any other Offer. The Company Offers and the Third-Party Offers are being made independently, and any change to the Company Offers will not necessarily result in a change to the Third-Party Offers and any change to the Third-Party Offers will not necessarily result in a change to the Company Offers. The Purchasers’ obligations with regard to the Offers are conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

JPMorgan Chase has pledged to invest $150 million over five years to revitalize Detroit. The additional $2.5 million will go to support TechTown, Southwest Detroit Business Association, Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and Eastern Market. "The success of the city’s small businesses is driving neighborhood renaissance and creating vibrant urban corridors and local jobs," Bowdler said. "We look forward to continuing our partnership with the city’s many excellent nonprofits working hard to support Detroit’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.” About half of the money — $1.2 million — will go to TechTown's efforts to boost retail, Retail Boot Camp and SWOT City. The boot camp is an eight-week training program to prepare entrepreneurs to open retail establishments in Detroit. SWOT City is a support program to help brick-and-mortar enterprises. Related: JPMorgan Chase commits $5 million to Detroit neighborhoods Related: Chase to commit $50 million more to Detroit The Detroit Economic Growth Corporation will receive $725,000. The group supports development programs to boost foreign investment and from an African American business leadership council.

And the Southwest Detroit Business Association will receive $110,000 to train and mentor small business owners in Southwest Detroit by offering bilingual mentoring, food-safety training and certification and technical assistance. “For Detroit’s comeback to be successful," said Kathy Wendler, the president of the Southwest Detroit Business Association, "small business development and expansion needs to be a part of the equation.” In the past three years, Chase said it has helped 1,800 small businesses receive technical assistance and provided loans and grants to 100 small businesses, including 44 entrepreneurs of color who could not get access to traditional financing. There are about 32,000 minority-owned small businesses in Detroit, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The city is the fourth largest number of minority-owned businesses nationwide.

The last year has not inverted the tendency, but the credit crunch, affecting the behaviour of all financial players, has influenced the way in which custodians and pension funds do business with each other. Under the pressure of protracted losses in investments and declining funding ratios, pension funds looked for ways to better manage risk, generating business for custodians. Tim Caverly, executive vice president of State Street's investor services business in continental Europe, said the services needed by pension funds were not substantially different, but there was a higher requirement for real time information. He explained: "There is definitely a move to a daily processing environment from the typical monthly pricing reports we were asked to produce. "If pension funds receive questions from the senior management or the local regulator we have to respond quickly. There is definitely more urgency in answering the questions of our clients, given the times we are living in." Penny Biggs, head of institutional sales for EMEA, Northern Trust, commented that the market crisis emphasised how important open and transparent communication with clients is. She said: "When there is any uncertainty in the market, even if you don't have perfectly definitive answers, the most important thing is communicating pretty much every day with clients who are impacted and telling them as much as we can about issues and opportunities and challenges. Clients need information to manage their business prudently. Custody is only one part of the picture and we must not forget that, as an industry." To assist clients in managing and mitigating risk, Biggs said Northern Trust provides a daily risk monitoring service heavily used by investment managers of pension assets, as well as a risk tool that enables pension funds to get a measurable view of the performance information they deem of particular importance in terms of monitoring and controlling risk. Several custodians highlighted pension fund trustees had in recent months been extremely concerned about custodians' balance sheets, looking for stable and reliable platforms to do business with. In particular, Benjie Fraser, head of pensions and charities custody business, JPMorgan, pointed out pension schemes had been looking for independence from traditional counterparties, in a quest to minimise any risk they incurred in their investments. Fraser explained: "If you take the example of the valuation of derivatives, which has traditionally been done by brokers and fund managers, pension funds now want it to be done by custodians independently from other parties. "Pension funds need the independent valuation of information like inflation rate swaps, which is important to them to hedge their risks. As a result, the ability to provide that independent valuation has been greatly reinforced." Cross-country pension pooling Services related to cross-country pension pooling have also been high on the agenda of multinational corporations during the last few years. Custodians point out that market volatility has intensified this tendency. Kerry White, first vice president of multinational business development for Bank of New York Mellon, said consultants to pension funds had become very active in this area and were trying to close the knowledge gap quickly. What we have seen is that a number of the top tier consulting firms are undertaking studies on behalf of clients, looking for simpler and more efficient ways to manage their clients' pension assets in order to fund their future liabilities. White said: "I think the activity in this sector is now around 10% higher than it was approximately in the last 45 days, and I would say there is a direct correlation to these tumultuous market conditions. "Dutch multinationals, followed by the Germans, seem to be particularly interested in trying to work around situations that would trigger capital gains losses if they were to maintain the domicile in a specific foreign country." In July this year, JPMorgan secured a multinational asset pooling mandate for Royal Dutch Asset Management Company (SAMCo) involving assets in excess of $70bn. At the time, JPMorgan said it had launched a range of services for SAMCo and participating Shell pension funds, including fund accounting, fund administration and certain securities lending services all from segregated and/or pooled accounts. JPMorgan's Fraser claimed that deal had triggered further interest from the industry: "We are talking to European multinational headquarters to provide similar solutions to the ones provided for Shell. In the relevant jurisdiction of the pension fund, we pull all the assets and provide services that can give them a number of key benefits." Biggs also perceived increased interest in pension and investment manager pooling by Northern Trust's clients, although she pointed out not a large number of decisions were pending at the present time. She said: "Many of the plans we are working for are gathering agreement from all of their local plans to move forward into a cross-border pooling structure. Along the same lines, there is particular interest in the FGR (Fonds voor Gemene Rekening) structure [a Dutch investment fund for the joint account of participants], and this is gaining a lot of traction." On the other hand, Biggs said companies in Germany had not moved as fast as they perhaps could to benefit from the pooling solutions available to them. However, she added: "The interest is there, it is just a matter of finding the right structure that works for them." According to State Street's Caverly, the main change that took place last year was that the asset management community took the leader in developing pooling structures to be delivered to pension funds or institutional investors. He added: "Pooling products are normally set up in Luxembourg or Ireland - all tax transparent vehicles. The key aspect is creating economies of scale and tax savings. We see a new vigor in the market around asset pooling, but less so with large pension funds who are setting up these kinds of vehicles themselves." Sec lending concerns While custodians could arguably claim to have weathered the financial storm better than other financial institutions, securities lending related services raised several concerns. In late September, Northern Trust announced it was taking action to provide support for securities lending clients whose cash collateral investments were negatively impacted by market events. An almost total lack of liquidity in the credit markets had caused a decline in the market value of securities lending collateral pools. Northern Trust said it contributed approximately US$150m to make up a portion of the client losses. With respect to this market issue, Biggs commented the reactions of pension funds had been very different. She said: "We understand that there are certain pension schemes who are reassessing their lending arrangements in the light of current market events, while some schemes have temporarily withdrawn their participation over this period, but the majority of pension schemes are still being active participants in lending programmes. Pension funds are very sophisticated long term investors and understand the potential financial advantage of making an investment decision to participate in a lending programme." Caverly said none of the funds that support State Street's securities lending business had lost money for their customers, but highlighted the gravity of the moment: "In this environment custodians need to be very responsive with their reporting and engage in very transparent communication with their clients." Along the same lines, White highlighted the fact pension funds would continue to need instant access to investment data to go on coping with the current level of market volatility. Several custodians highlighted they had been continuously investing in new technology to better address clients' requests. Biggs agreed timely and accurate production of data would be the main theme for the coming months, while believing pension funds may look to redirect riskier asset allocations to safer and more straightforward investments, such as AAA government money market funds. What is certain, according to Laurens Vis, managing director, KAS Bank UK, is that pension funds and custodians will continue to work together, unless pension funds decide to go down the buyout track. He said: "They will need us and we will need them. This will not change."

Continue Reading Below The move is part of the firm’s more than $325 million global investment to equip young adults with the skills and experiences needed to help put them on a path to “greater economic mobility” later in life. “It’s a moral and economic crisis that too many young people graduate high school without clear pathways to good jobs,” Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. “We must make it a national priority to provide youth with the skills they need to succeed, and this starts by providing them with meaningful summer work. Our Summer Youth Employment Program does just that by exposing more students to jobs that teach them the skills they need to find careers in growing industries later on.” The company said $3 million of the $17 million investment will go to various organizations in 19 U.S. cities this summer to provide training and work experiences for young people. Some of those cities include Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Dallas, TX; Boston, MA; and Fort Lauderdale, FL. However, according to a 2016 survey conducted by JPMorgan, the demand for summer employment remains higher than the number of available job opportunities. The report also found that the summer employment rate for teens across the U.S. has fallen to 34 percent, a near record low and a 20 percentage point drop since 1995. Though despite the creation of more summer gigs, only approximately 38% of teens and young adults were able to find work. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT JPMorgan also predicts that by 2025, 65% of jobs in the U.S. will require some postsecondary education, training or credential—that number is up from 28% of jobs in the 1970’s.   What do you think?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 10 Reasons JPMorgan Chase Could Be the World's Most Perfect Stock Monetary tightening (and nine other positives) should have Wall Street and investors excited about JPMorgan's future. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 22, 2017 at 8:41AM Investors have well over 5,000 publicly traded stocks on reputable U.S. exchanges to choose from. Unfortunately, finding the proverbial needle in the haystack can often prove difficult. But if you're looking for the world's most perfect stock, your search might end with national banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Shareholders who've held throughout both the dot-com bubble and the Great Recession would have netted a nearly 790% return since the beginning of December 1983. Best of all, JPMorgan Chase's stock may not be anywhere near done. Here are 10 reasons JPMorgan Chase might just be the world's most perfect stock. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Monetary tightening is great news Arguably the greatest reason to be in big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase for the time being is the current monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve. After eight years of record-low rates, the Fed has raised its federal funds target by 25 basis points on three occasions since December 2015 as the U.S. economy has improved. Fed funds target increases have the effect of increasing the yields on interest-bearing assets, including variable loans, putting more money in JPMorgan's pocket without a need for the bank to do a thing. According to the bank's first-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates, as of the end of March 2017, would generate $2.3 billion in added net interest revenue for the company. A 200-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates, which is more or less in line with the Fed's long-term goal of a 3% fed funds rate, would add an estimated $3.8 billion in net interest revenue. While this isn't pure profit, the margin being generated from these interest rate hikes is very juicy for JPMorgan. 2. Its bread-and-butter businesses are on the upswing Sometimes boring really is better when it comes to banks. Deposit and loan growth is what you might call the bread-and-butter foundation for all banks. As of the first quarter, JPMorgan Chase was generating pretty steady growth in both respects. In the company's consumer and community banking operations, average deposits increased 11% to $622.9 billion year over year, while average loans rose 5% from the prior-year quarter. Similar strong improvements were seen in its asset- and wealth-management operations, where record average loan balances rose 7% year over year to $118.3 billion and average deposit balances increased 5% to $158.8 billion over the same time frame. If slow but steady wins the race, JPMorgan is likely at or near the front of the pack.  Image source: Getty Images. 3. Diversified organic growth from multiple operating segments Another factor that investors in JPMorgan Chase are bound to appreciate is the bank's focus on organic growth. This isn't to say that the company doesn't have the funds to purchase its way into new markets via acquisitions, but that's not how this bank grows historically. Look across its gamut of operating segments and you'll see pretty steady growth throughout. And in areas where income declined, other segments tend to step up and compensate for a single division's weakness. For instance, in Q1 we witnessed a decline in net income from its flagship consumer and community banking segment, likely a result of higher expenses and credit costs. However, corporate and investment banking income more than doubled to $3.2 billion, while commercial banking net income hit a record of $799 million, up 61% year over year. Long story short, this is a well-balanced organic growth machine. 4. Cost-cutting provides an avenue to improve margin Though a stronger U.S. economy has helped JPMorgan deliver solid organic growth as a whole, its management team isn't oblivious to the fact that prudent cost-cutting can also help improve margins. JPMorgan Chase has actively been looking at ways to reduce its physical imprint (i.e., close branches) to save money. As of the end of Q1 2017, the bank had 5,246 branches, down 139 from the year-ago period, or about 3%. This is a continuation of a plan announced in 2015 to close about 300 branches, or 5% of its physical banks, by the end of 2016. Doing so was expected to reduce expenses by $2 billion, which is on top of the $3.2 billion JPMorgan had already cut from expenses between 2012 and 2014. In short, more cost-cutting should yield even better financial flexibility. Image source: JPMorgan Chase & Co. 5. A strong mobile push Another reason JPMorgan Chase has been actively reducing its physical presence is the rising popularity of mobile banking among the younger generation. Data released from the company back in 2015 showed that depositing money with a teller costs more than 20 times as much as depositing money via a mobile app -- $0.65 versus $0.03. Focusing on mobile gives JPMorgan a way to improve consumer convenience, boost engagement with the next generation of workers, and cut its long-term costs. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had 27.26 million active mobile customers, which was up by more than 3.4 million, or 14%, on a year-over-year basis. As this figure rises, the bank's ability to market these consumers increases while costs decline. 6. It's well capitalized Considering the capital crunch many financial institutions faced during the Great Recession, investors often keep a very close eye on how well funded today's banks are. When it comes to JPMorgan, there are few worries. Once again referencing its Q1 report, the company ended the quarter with a Basel III leverage ratio of 12.4% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.1%. Both figures are up by 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Having been more prudent with its capital since the recession, and cleaning up its loan portfolio over the past decade, has had a big impact on strengthening its financial flexibility and ensuring it has the capital to survive a pretty steep recession, should one occur. Image source: Getty Images. 7. Relatively positive consumer loan trends As is often the case with rising interest rates, JPMorgan has witnessed a modest uptick in its 30-plus-day credit card delinquencies and net charge-offs over the past two quarters. This is to be expected as indebtedness consumers struggle to adjust to higher variable credit card rates. However, most aspects of JPMorgan's loan portfolio look great. Both home equity and residential short- and long-term delinquencies have been on a pretty steady decline over the past four years, while auto delinquencies and credit delinquencies are mostly stable since March 2013. Having a high-quality loan portfolio is important, because it means the bank doesn't have to set aside nearly as much in loan loss reserves. 8. Great Recession fines and settlements mostly in the rearview mirror One of the bigger hindrances for banks since the Great Recession have been a flurry of fines and settlements derived from their mortgage and lending practices. Though JPMorgan avoided having to pay north of $60 billion in aggregate fines like its peer Bank of America, it still wound up handing over a pretty penny to regulators, including around $20 billion worth of fines and penalties in 2013 alone. Here's the good news: JPMorgan's hefty fines are mostly in the rearview mirror. In January, the company agreed to pay $55 million to settle an investigation into whether it was charging certain borrowers higher interest rates than others, but $55 million is a far cry from the days where billion-dollar fines were seemingly the norm. What this means is investors are getting a cleaner look at the company's results, which is allowing for a more accurate valuation of the company. Image source: Getty Images. 9. Shareholder yield Despite looking to cut costs, JPMorgan Chase hasn't forgotten about its shareholders. The bank has done a good job rewarding investors through share buybacks and via dividend growth. For instance, in June of last year the company announced a $10.6 billion stock repurchase program that'll run through the end of June this year. Remember, buying back stock reduces the total number of shares outstanding, which in turn can lift earnings per share and lower a company's P/E ratio, making it look more attractive to Wall Street and investors. JPMorgan Chase has also lifted its quarterly dividend by a cumulative 32% ($0.38 to $0.50) over the past four years. This works out to a current yield of 2.3%, which is slightly above the average yield of the S&P 500. 10. An attractive valuation And of course, JPMorgan is also attractive on a valuation basis. The bank ended Q1 with a tangible book value (TBV) of $52.04, up nicely from the $48.96 in TBV reported in Q1 2016. Based on its recent closing price, it's valued at a little less than 1.7 times TBV. Typically, Wall Street doesn't worry about bank valuations (especially the valuations of superior performers) until they cross two times TBV. This leaves JPMorgan Chase's stock ample room to run higher and grow its TBV. On a more nominal basis, it's valued at just 11 times next year's EPS and could see in the neighborhood of 10% EPS growth each year during the current monetary tightening cycle. It's quite possible that JPMorgan Chase may be the world's most perfect stock.  Sean Williams owns shares of Bank of America. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Fintech Blockchain Zero-knowledge proofs added to JP Morgan's Quorum blockchain JP Morgan's Quorum is the first distributed ledger platform to feature the zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL). By Ian Allison May 22, 2017 14:00 BST Zero-knowledge proofs technology will protect the privacy of digital assets on JP Morgan's Quorum blockchain, as the developers of the Zcash cryptocurrency announce a partnership with the banking giant. Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs (specifically, zk-SNARKs) to prove the integrity of cryptocurrency transactions, without revealing any information about the sender, recipient or the assets that are being transferred. The Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (ZECC), which created Zcash, will extend Quorum's existing privacy protections, which already offer private smart contracts by changing the Ethereum codebase. The zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL) will make it possible to use shielded transactions to protect users' privacy. Quorum is the first distributed ledger platform that will feature ZSL, but it can also be integrated with any consensus mechanism; instead of proof of work, an enterprise ledger could use round-robin, proof of stake, or new consensus mechanisms like Tendermint. It could also be integrated into a MySQL database, where a schema plugin requires valid proofs for table inserts but the database administrator cannot see account balances. Jack Gavigan, COO, Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, said in an email: "What we're doing for Quorum is implementing ZSL within a smart contract (which we're referring to as a 'z-contract'). Issuers will be able to create z-contracts and issue z-tokens (representing tokenised securities, currency, etc.), which can be transacted with the same type of privacy and confidentiality that Zcash's shielded transactions benefit from." JP Morgan's Quorum has showcased a smart contract privacy solution that allows pairs or groups of participants to create and interact with private contracts, using an encrypted peer-to-peer layer called Constellation. The missing piece was the ability to make payments in a similarly private way, without either watering down the decentralised nature of the ledger or including some kind of trusted third party in the process. "That's where ZSL comes in," said Gavigan. "The trade's business logic is embodied within a private contract, while obligations that arise as a result of that business logic (e.g. "Alice owes Bob $1m") can be settled using shielded transactions on the main Quorum ledger. We use a simplified variant of payment disclosure to allow private contracts to react to shielded transactions (so when Alice pays Bob the $1m, the private contract's business logic can flag that obligation as having been satisfied). "The end result is that the business logic (i.e. the trade details or the derivative contract) is private, and the settlement is private (all third party observers will know is that a USD payment was made at a particular time; they can't identify the sender or the recipient, or see how much was being paid). It's turned out to be a very complementary approach," he said. Gavigan said the process of adding ZSL to Quorum has benefited from the experience of having already done it for Zcash. He also pointed out that the team had already done a fair amount of research and experimentation around adding zk-SNARKs to Ethereum-based ledgers (e.g. Baby ZoE). Enhanced privacy is a great thing, but how these solutions scale is often cited as a drawback. "ZSL faces the same efficiency and scalability limitations that Zcash does - generating the zero-knowledge proofs is still computationally intensive (although, given existing settlement cycles are measured in days, reducing that to a matter of minutes is already a huge win!)" said Gavigan. "There are scalability limitations in terms of the number of transactions a z-contract can support but we're talking about millions of transactions, and it's relatively straightforward to simply create a new z-contract when the old one is approaching its limit. "Our and JPM's approach to this is exploratory and experimental. Instead of rejecting ZSL because it doesn't scale infinitely, the idea is to try it out and see what those limitations mean in practise. It seems likely that it will be unsuitable for high-frequency trading use cases, but quite useful for something like syndicated loans or interest rate swaps. In the longer term, we have an ongoing research effort that's looking at different ways of making zk-SNARKs more efficient, and both Zcash and Quorum will benefit from the results of that research." There have been several approaches to preserving privacy using distributed ledgers such as homomorphic encryption, ring signatures, just not sharing data very much. Last year the Zcash team co-authored a report for R3, which compared and contrasted the different approaches. "Simply not sharing data much can mean that you avoid many of the benefits of a shared ledger - e.g. fungibility of digital assets, having a single 'golden' source of truth, full decentralisation, etc. The trick is to be able to retain those benefits in a way that also enables privacy and confidentiality," said Gavigan. "I think it's fair to say that any approach involves compromises, and the best approach is going to depend on your use case. But I think it's also important to look to the future in terms of what's theoretically possible and what limitations are imposed by different approaches. In our estimation, zero-knowledge proofs offer a lot of potential and flexibility." JP Morgan is a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), and ZECC has just announced that it has also joined EEA.

Two such funds debuted last week, one of which was the JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (NYSE: JPST). The JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF is a conservative fixed income strategy that looks to preserve principal and generate income while minimizing volatility. “The strategy takes a conservative approach and is designed to provide additional income beyond that of money market funds, while mitigating volatility and limiting duration exposure. It invests across sectors, but primarily focuses on corporate and investment grade credit,” said New York-based JPMorgan Asset Management in a statement. Many short-term bond ETFs emphasize lower duration U.S. government, a strategy that often leads to small yields, reducing income for investors in the process. Actively managed, JPST eschews that strategy to focus on securities with better income-generating potential, such as investment-grade corporate debt. Generally, JPST will try to maintain a duration of less than one year, but the ETF's management team can go beyond that threshold when market conditions indicate that could be a profitable strategy. “The ETF will normally focus investments in the banking industry or hold more than 25% of assets in securities issued by companies in the banking industry. The fund, though, may also invest less than 25% of assets in this industry as a temporary defensive measure,” according to ETF Trends. JPST charges 0.18 percent per year, or $18 on a $10,000 investment. JPMorgan Asset Management sponsors 13 ETFs with more than $1 billion in combined assets under management. JPST is the third bond fund in the firm's ETF stable.

JPMorgan, one of the largest wealth managers in the world with asset under management of over $1.7 trillion, alone has flagged these “religious and border disputes” regarding investments in India in at least eight regulatory filings made by its various funds so far. Besides, a number of other funds, including the India Fund managed by Aberdeen Asset Management, which has more than $380 billion of assets under management, have listed similar “risks” in their regulatory filings made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other such funds include Eaton Vance Greater India Fund, Mathews International Funds, Alps Funds (Financial Investors Trust), Franklin Templeton International Trust, Global X Funds and iShares Trust (managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors). Besides, Wasatch Funds Trust, Arthur J Gallagher & Co and Causeway Capital Management Trust have also flagged similar concerns. When contacted, senior officials at some of these funds and other experts said such risk factors follow a generic pattern in regulatory filings by various companies and investors and not much should be read into them, but they admitted that religious conflicts and Kashmir dispute remain an overhang. While cross-border tension continues in the Kashmir region, the government has been trying to send across a positive message to the world and some saw hosting of the GST Council meeting in Srinagar last week as a step in that direction. In a filing made by JPMorgan Trust II on May 18, the fund said, “Religious and border disputes persist in India. Moreover, India has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighbouring countries such as Pakistan.” IT major Cognizant, which has a substantial portion of its assets and operations in India, said in one of its SEC filings that the potential for hostilities between India and Pakistan “has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in India and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment, including events in and related to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria”.   What the companies think JP MORGAN Religious and border disputes persist in India.

Big banks are investing heavily to reinvent a boxy machine that has gracefully reached middle age even as the industry turns its attention to young, hip technologies such as APIs, blockchains and artificial intelligence. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America — which operate the industry’s largest fleets, each with more than 15,000 ATMs — recently began rolling out sleek machines with screens that look and operate like giant iPads. Several big banks in recent years have also launched a slew of features, such as the ability to withdraw large sums of cash, request multiple denominations, and conduct transactions using mobile phones instead of debit cards. Other options that integrate mobile banking are also in the works. That ATMs have such staying power in the rapidly changing world of retail banking is somewhat surprising, especially considering that cash withdrawals have stagnated in recent years. But the latest upgrades show how big banks are using the trusty teller machines — once standard-issue gray boxes — to distinguish their brands and acquire new customers as traffic at brick-and-mortar branches continues to wane. “It’s almost like a phoenix rising,” said Suzanne Galvin, a senior vice president at U.S. Bancorp in charge of ATM and debit services. To understand the appeal of a machine that predates Watergate, consider this: Convenience has always been the name of the game in retail banking. For decades, blanketing a neighborhood with branches and ATMs was a surefire way for banks to attract new customers. But times are changing. Young customers, in particular, view convenience as simply having access to digital banking, according to Andrew Hovet, a director of retail marketing and distribution at Novantas. Placing high-tech — and modern-looking — ATMs in high-traffic areas is one way for banks to market their digital prowess. Additionally, offering cutting-edge features — such as the ability to take out cash from an ATM by using a code from a smartphone app, instead of inserting a debit card — carries a lot of weight these days with prospective customers. “We use a phrase called ‘perceived convenience,’ ” Hovet said. “Big banks have done a great job of creating the perception that they have the best digital capabilities out there,” even if some smaller banks can match them “feature to feature.” Banks contacted for this story declined to offer details about the size of their recent investments. But it is worth noting that they are making large-scale upgrades at a time when cash withdrawals are flat. According to a 2016 study from the Federal Reserve, ATM withdrawals have held steady at 5.8 billion per year since 2012. Still, the machines are “surging in importance” when it comes to customer acquisition, as traffic in brick-and-mortar branches declines, according to a survey of more than 10,000 consumers conducted by Novantas. The 2016 survey showed that consumers ranked the availability of fee-free ATMs as the second-most convenient offering at retail banks, behind “leading online/mobile” capabilities. A year earlier, ATMs ranked third. “We do know that, over time — and it takes a while — as customers perceive what we do as making it easier to do their business with us, then that’s how you start to attract new clients,” said Charles Liu, head of branch transformation, ATM innovation and market strategy at Bank of America. More money The newest ATMs from Bank of America, shown above at the Founders Hall shopping center in Charlotte, N.C., allow customers to take out up to $600 in cash, a higher limit than offered by most ATMs. A driving factor behind the recent wave of ATM upgrades is that big banks are preparing to integrate their machines more closely with their mobile apps, according to industry experts. Some view the recent launch of cardless transactions over the past year — at B of A, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and others — as the first big step in that direction. At Bank of America, for instance, ATM screen displays are currently being redesigned so that they have the same look and feel as the company’s app, according to Liu. B of A soon plans to give its customers the ability to “pre-stage” a transaction on a mobile phone, so that they can quickly grab cash by tapping their phone to an ATM, without having to go through the somewhat cumbersome process of typing in a verification code. The function will be available to employees at the Charlotte, N.C.-based company in two weeks, and it will launch on a larger scale in late August. Further down the road, B of A’s chatbot, erica, will also likely be integrated into its machines. “You’re going to see the evolution of the financial center,” said Liu, describing the ATM as “one component of the ecosystem.” Notably, B of A has also recently begun testing automated branches, which include a combination of ATMs and videoconferencing rooms, where customers can have private meetings with bankers. JPMorgan is also looking into giving its customers “pre-staging” capabilities, according to Ryan Crowley, head of branch systems and innovation. Earlier this year, the company launched a large-scale software upgrade, giving its machines a more modern-looking interface. Its newest ATMs also have high-tech features on the back end, including the ability to recycle cash between deposit and withdrawal bins, to reduce the frequency with which machines are out of service. Next gen JPMorgan’s newest ATMs — pictured above, at the company’s World Trade Center branch in Manhattan — have large screens that resemble tablet computers. Other features are in the works, as well. “What I would say is we have a lab where we’re constantly introducing new and innovative technology,” Crowley said. By giving consumers more ATM features, such as the ability withdraw large sums of cash, banks are aiming to create “teller-transaction parity,” according to Erin Hill, JPMorgan's head of consumer branch banking. In other words, visiting a branch for simple transactions is quickly becoming a choice for consumers, rather than a necessity. JPMorgan, which operates the industry’s largest network, said its transactions increased 15% since 2014. Between 2014 and 2016, the company purchased 5,000 enhanced ATMs, which include the new features. It replaces about 2,000 of its machines every year. The push to upgrade ATMs is just the latest wave of innovation in the machine’s five-decade-long history. Industry veterans say the pace of ATM innovation has moved in fits and starts. The machine made its debut in banking at Barclays in London, in June of 1967. Over time, ATMs slowly began to feature color displays, touch screens and privacy filters. Some even dispensed nonbanking items like stamps and prepaid calling cards. ATM fleets have also expanded with the rise of computer networking, as well as with the introduction of surcharging in the 1990s. More recently, developments in imaging technology have allowed banks to improve the machines’ deposit-taking capabilities. “It comes in chunks,” said Ken Justice, a senior vice president in charge of ATMs at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ATMs currently in the market vary widely, from “cash-and-dash” terminals in convenience stores to more full-service teller machines at the flagship branches of many large banks. Regional banks are also getting in on the latest wave of ATM innovation, though on a much smaller scale. In its core markets, Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati operates 60 so-called smart ATMs, which offer features such as the ability to withdraw cash in more denominations than the standard $20 bill and also to cash checks, according to Jim Sutton, senior vice president of ATM networks and distribution. Phones are the new debit cards Banks such as Wells Fargo now allow customers to access ATMs with their smartphones. To do so, customers type in a passcode that appears in their mobile apps. Meanwhile, PNC, which recently expanded its ATM fleet by 20%, is experimenting with cash recycling to reduce the cost and frequency of having its machines out of order. Offering card-free withdrawals is also on the drawing board. “We’re sensitive to keeping it simple, making sure the transaction is pure,” Justice said. As ATMs continue to become more high-tech, regional banks will likely face a challenge in trying to keep up with their megabank peers, according to Hovet. Overhauling a fleet of ATMs with new hardware or software is expensive, and banks are less likely to get a boost from marketing new features unless they are among the first to do so. That means regional bank executives need to choose wisely, Hovet said. For instance, if research shows that consumers are not interested in card-free transactions, it may not be worth the investment. “Banks are looking for ways to create a marketing differentiation, even if it only has a short life,” Hovet said. “I think the problem for banks that are historically fast followers, the regionals, is that they get stuck in this arms race.” Article The mortgage search goes digital Search habits and online lenders are forcing loan officers to step up their digital game to compete.

As part of JPMorgan Chase’s $150 million commitment to the city’s economic recovery, the new investments will support TechTown, Southwest Detroit Business Association, Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and Eastern Market. These investments are informed by data, expertise and other resources provided by JPMorgan Chase to support the continued growth of small businesses in Detroit. Over the past three years, the firm’s investment in Detroit has helped 1,800 small businesses receive technical assistance and provided loan and grant capital directly to 100 small businesses, including 44 entrepreneurs of color who could not get access to traditional financing. 700 jobs were also created or maintained as a result of this commitment. Additionally, employees from around the globe have participated in the firm’s Detroit Service Corps, which put employees’ expertise to work strengthening the capacity of small business-focused organizations such as Eastern Market and TechTown. The JPMorgan Chase Institute also showed that 58 percent of consumer spending took place at small businesses within Detroit. Additionally, there are approximately 32,000 minority-owned small businesses in Detroit, according to the U.S. Census which ranks Detroit as the fourth largest U.S. city for the number of minority-owned businesses. “Detroit’s flourishing small business community is one of the most important drivers of an inclusive economy for the city,” said Janis Bowdler, Head of Small Business Initiatives, JPMorgan Chase. “We are especially proud to help the city’s entrepreneurs of color connect to the capital and resources they need to grow and thrive. The success of the city’s small businesses is driving neighborhood renaissance and creating vibrant urban corridors and local jobs. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the city’s many excellent nonprofits working hard to support Detroit’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.” JPMorgan Chase’s new small business investments include: TechTown ($1,200,000): This investment supports two of TechTown’s small business programs, specifically Retail Boot Camp (RBC), an intensive, eight-week training program that prepares entrepreneurs to open brick-and-mortar retail establishments in key Detroit commercial corridors, and SWOT City, a small business support program to help brick-and-mortar enterprises in six of the City of Detroit’s target neighborhoods for redevelopment launch, stabilize and grow over the course of 9-18 months. “TechTown has already served more than 500 businesses through our SWOT City and Retail Boot Camp program, thanks in part to the investment made by JPMorgan Chase,” said Ned Staebler, President and Chief Executive Officer, TechTown. “These programs remove roadblocks to urban innovation and business development in Detroit, helping businesses open and stay open. We are happy to have JPMorgan Chase as a partner in this critical effort.” Detroit Economic Growth Corporation ($725,000): The Detroit Economic Growth Association (DEGC) supports innovative economic development programs addressing three areas of need: foreign direct investment attraction, Motor City Match program support and the formation of an African American business leadership council. “Strong commitment to comprehensive and inclusive economic growth will continue to empower Detroit’s recovery,” said Michael Rafferty, Vice President of Small Business Development, Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. “JPMorgan Chase embodies this commitment with its ongoing support of small business growth, community development, and neighborhood revitalization.” Eastern Market Corporation ($500,000): The investment in Eastern Market Corporation (EMC) will focus on expanding food entrepreneurship programs, enhancing expansion opportunities for Detroit food businesses, supporting equitable community development of the Eastern Market District, and helping to provide EMC with sufficient organizational capacity to execute these programs. “JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to Detroit has already helped transform the city into a successful market for local food companies, including the vendors at Detroit’s historic Eastern Market,” said Dan Carmody, President, Eastern Market Corporation. “We are grateful for the firm’s backing as we help area entrepreneurs develop the skills and distribution pipelines to take their ideas from the kitchen to major stores, restaurants, and beyond.” Southwest Detroit Business Association ($110,000): This program aims to train and mentor small business owners to strengthen and establish their presence in Southwest Detroit. They offer bilingual 1-on-1 mentorship and food safety/business trainings/certifications, small business technical assistance, marketing support; and direct assistance with site plan reviews, permitting, and zoning and location challenges, among other things. “For Detroit’s comeback to be successful, small business development and expansion needs to be a part of the equation,” said Kathy Wendler, President, Southwest Detroit Business Association.  “With entrepreneurs being at the heart of the economic growth taking place in Detroit, we are glad to partner with JPMorgan Chase to work with small businesses and help them open, expand, and grow.” Also On The Michigan Chronicle: comments – Add Yours Your browser does not support iframes.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton By Olivia Oran | PURCHASE, N.Y. PURCHASE, N.Y. Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) executive compensation plan received the support of over 90 percent of its shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in its Purchase, New York wealth management headquarters on Monday. Morgan Stanley avoided protests that dominated other Wall Street firm's annual meetings this year. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon faced activists during the bank's annual meeting last week who demanded answers about his role on a White House business council [mL2N1II153]. Morgan Stanley awarded Chief Executive James Gorman $22.5 million in 2016, up 7 percent from the year ago period. The bank posted an 8 percent return on equity in 2016, moving closer to the 9 to 11 percent range which Gorman aims to achieve by the end of 2017. "We're confident about our targets for this year," Gorman said. "We're not going to start resetting targets at this point." Morgan Stanley shares soared 33 percent in 2016, the biggest gainer among the largest U.S. banks' stocks. Gains were particularly strong after the Nov. 8 U.S. election, as investors bet that President Donald Trump would usher in an era of less regulation and more economic growth. "What a difference a year makes," banking analyst Mike Mayo said during the meeting, noting that Morgan Stanley shares stood at $26 last year during this time, compared to over $41 today. Morgan Stanley shareholders also rejected an investor proposal from the AFL-CIO union that would prohibit stock awards from vesting for bank executives who resign for government service. The practice has received additional scrutiny in recent months from investors and lawmakers after it was disclosed that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) president Gary Cohn would receive at least $100 million upon taking a job with the Trump administration.

For years, Jamie Dimon has derided digital currencies. Now, his company has teamed up with the creators of one of the most prominent “altcoins” to build privacy features for the bank's blockchain platform. JPMorgan Chase’s partnership with Zerocoin Electronic Coin Co., announced Monday, is perhaps the most surprising alliance yet as traditional financial institutions co-opt a technology originally developed to route around them. ZECC’s founder, Zooko Wilcox, was part of the 1990s cypherpunk movement, which sought to defend individual privacy through strong cryptography. Last year his firm released Zcash, a cryptocurrency designed to be more anonymous than bitcoin. Just that phrase, “more anonymous than bitcoin,” might send shivers up the spines of some bank compliance officers, to say nothing of regulators. So, just to be clear: JPMorgan isn’t using Zcash. "This is solely a technology transfer agreement," Wilcox said. Instead, his team will use the same cryptographic techniques to add a “security layer” to Quorum, the system JPMorgan is developing to run smart contracts. In their most basic form, blockchains allow all participants in a network to see who has done what. But that transparency has been a turn-off for financial institutions, which don’t want to tip their hands to competitors, or reveal confidential client data. “Existing smart contract systems on replicated shared ledgers are unable to provide data privacy — transactions and smart contract state data are exposed in the clear on the replicated shared ledger,” JPMorgan said in a white paper for Quorum published in November. Quorum was designed so that a smart contract would be visible only to the parties, not the whole network. But that, by itself, precludes the contracts from involving assets that could later be transferred to other participants in the network. "You can't prove to Charlie that Bob is the legitimate owner of an asset while concealing that Alice was the previous legitimate owner," Wilcox said. ("Alice and Bob" are regular characters in the hypothetical examples given by cryptographers.) The Zcash developers plan to enable Quorum smart contracts to trade transferable, resellable tokens, through a cryptographic method called zero-knowledge proofs. These allow someone to prove that a statement is true without conveying any other information. In the Zcash currency, for example, zero-knowledge proofs provide assurance that users are only spending money that they have without revealing on the public ledger how much they have received from or sent to others. Participants can selectively decrypt such details about their own transactions, however, making it possible to comply with audits or court orders. Otherwise, the ledger is just a list of timestamped transactions, with the senders, recipients and amounts obscured. Applying that technology to Quorum would allow tokens (representing real-world financial assets, say, shares in Apple) to circulate throughout the network, rather than be confined to bilateral agreements between banks, without sacrificing privacy. “By adding the zero-knowledge security layer into Quorum, we are able to explore how state of the art cryptographic privacy technology will enhance the next generation of financial services applications,” Suresh Shetty, an executive director and lead architect for JPMorgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence, said in a press release Monday. Dimon has famously predicted that decentralized currencies like bitcoin — which let anyone with an internet connection send money anywhere in the world without the permission of an intermediary — are doomed. According to published reports, his bank has expressly forbidden banks it does business with to work with digital currency exchanges. “Virtual currency, where it's called a bitcoin vs. a U.S. dollar, that's going to be stopped," Dimon said in 2015. "No government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn't have the same controls. It's not going to happen." Together at last? A bitcoin vending machine next door to a Chase branch in Austin, Texas, March 14, 2015. JPMorgan is now working with the creators of Zcash, a modified version of bitcoin. Marc Hochstein Around that time, JPMorgan and other banks had begun to investigate the possibilities for their business of blockchain technology, which was originally developed to prevent double-spending of bitcoins. One advanced use case is smart contracts, which theoretically can cut costs in the financial system by automating much of the work done by lawyers, compliance officers, syndication desks, and others. "Smart contracts on a replicated, shared ledger hold the promise of improving efficiency and lowering costs compared with existing enterprise systems based on duplicated business logic and consensus by reconciliation," the bank's Quorum white paper said. JPMorgan participated in several of the industry alliances that are working to develop blockchain solutions for financial services, though it recently quit the R3 consortium. The bank decided to model Quorum on another open-source platform, the bitcoin rival Ethereum. While Zcash started as a “fork,” or modified version, of bitcoin, Wilcox’s company has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, of which JPMorgan is also a member. Wilcox said the Zcash currency has served as a showcase of sorts for the technology his company has been pitching to enterprises. "We can point to the thing running live in the wild as proof that it works and we can deliver," he said.

The Coca-Cola Company Announces Cash Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation May 22, 2017 08:02 AM Eastern Daylight Time ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Coca-Cola Company (the "Company") today announced that it has commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation (the “Offer and Solicitation”) for specified series of outstanding debt securities issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ("CCR"). The Offer and Solicitation consists of (i) an offer to purchase any and all of 11 series of outstanding notes of CCR (the “CCR notes”) and (ii) a solicitation of consents from the holders of the CCR notes to amend or eliminate certain covenants and events of default applicable to the CCR notes contained in their governing indenture to substantially conform to the covenants and events of default in the indenture governing the Company’s existing unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of the CCR notes are currently outstanding. The Offer and Solicitation is being made pursuant to an offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement (the “Statement”) dated today, which sets forth a more comprehensive description of the terms of the Offer and Solicitation. Subject to the conditions described in the Statement, the Company intends to provide full and unconditional guarantees of the CCR notes. The guarantees will be the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other unsubordinated debt. The Company is offering to purchase for cash and seeking consents from the holders of any and all of the CCR notes as listed in the table below: Series of CCR Notes     Aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding     Bloomberg Reference Page     UST Reference Security     Early Tender Premium     Fixed Spread (Basis Points)     Total Consideration     Consent Payment (as an amount) Zero Coupon Notes due June 20, 2020 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AV6/US191219AV64)     $170,926,000     PX1     1.500% due May 15, 2020     $30.00     20     (1)     $1.00 per $1,000 8.500% Debentures due February 1, 2022 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AP9/US191219AP96) $327,097,000 PX1 1.875% due Apr. 30, 2022 $30.00 20 (1) $1.25 per $1,000 8.000% Debentures due September 15, 2022 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AQ7/US191219AQ79) $133,208,000 PX1 1.875% due Apr. 30, 2022 $30.00 30 (1) $1.25 per $1,000 6.750% Debentures due September 15, 2023 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AU8/US191219AU81) $127,775,000 PX1 2.000% due Apr. 30, 2024 $30.00 30 (1) $1.50 per $1,000 7.000% Debentures due October 1, 2026 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AW4/US191219AW48) $110,187,000 PX1 2.375% due May 15, 2027 $30.00 50 (1) $2.00 per $1,000 6.950% Debentures due 2026 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AY0/US191219AY04) $205,522,000 PX1 2.375% due May 15, 2027 $30.00 50 (1) $2.00 per $1,000 6.750% Debentures due 2028 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219BE3/US191219BE31) $172,602,000 PX1 2.375% due May 15, 2027 $30.00 65 (1) $2.50 per $1,000 6.700% Debentures due 2036 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219AX2/US191219AX21) $152,212,000 PX1 3.000% due Feb. 15, 2047 $30.00 70 (1) $3.25 per $1,000 5.710% Medium-Term Notes (CUSIP/ISIN:19122EAP7/US19122EAP79) $4,390,000 PX1 3.000% due Feb. 15, 2047 $30.00 70 (1) $3.25 per $1,000 6.750% Debentures due 2038 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219BC7/US191219BC74) $113,137,000 PX1 3.000% due Feb. 15, 2047 $30.00 75 (1) $3.50 per $1,000 7.000% Debentures due 2098 (CUSIP/ISIN:191219BD5/US191219BD57) $195,041,000 PX1 3.000% due Feb. 15, 2047 $30.00 130 (1) $5.00 per $1,000   (1) The Total Consideration offer per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of each series of CCR Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and Solicitation will be determined in the manner described further in the Statement, including Annex B thereto, using the applicable fixed spread specified in this table over the applicable bid-side yield to maturity as calculated by the Dealer Managers based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security specified in this table, as quoted on the applicable Bloomberg reference page specified in this table at 11:00 a.m., New York City time on June 6, 2017.

See Annex B for the hypothetical Total Consideration for each series of CCR Notes as calculated on May 19, 2017. The Offer and Solicitation is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 20, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated. Holders of CCR notes must tender and not withdraw their CCR notes before the early tender and consent expiration date, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2017, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total consideration. Holders of CCR notes who tender their CCR notes after the early tender date will only be eligible to receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total consideration minus $30 per $1,000 principal amount of CCR notes tendered by such holder that are accepted for purchase. Holders not wishing to tender their CCR notes, but wishing to deliver consents with respect to their CCR notes must deliver, and not validly revoke, their consents pursuant to the consent solicitation on or before the early tender and consent expiration date in order to be eligible to receive the consent payment in an amount equal to the amount listed in the table above for each series of CCR notes. Holders of CCR notes may withdraw tendered CCR notes and revoke consents on or before the early tender and consent expiration date but not thereafter. The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of CCR notes tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer will be determined in the manner described in the Statement by reference to the bid-side yield to maturity of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security specified on the cover page of the Statement as measured by the dealer managers at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on June 6, 2017 plus the applicable fixed spread specified on the cover page of the Statement. In addition to the total consideration or the tender offer consideration, as applicable, accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the payment date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered CCR notes accepted in the tender offer. The payment date for Offer and Solicitation will follow promptly after the applicable expiration dates and currently is expected to be Thursday June 22, 2017. The Offer and Solicitation is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Statement. The Company has retained BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P.

He also signaled that the bank is unlikely to boost its market share in some businesses even further after recent gains, and repeated his call for finetuning bank regulation in the US. “The Trump administration wants to deregulate certain things, and most of us in business think that regulations have been holding back growth,” Dimon said. “I’m still optimistic that you’ll have some regulatory reform. Even my Democratic friends understand that it makes sense to look at what was done, what can be done better, what can simplify the burden on businesses.” Comments(0)Add Comments Dimon signals optimism on economy, US rule changes To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:Indiatimes Network or Fill in your details: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed Share this Comment:Post to Twitter Also Read Not an exaggeration to call India sole bright spot: JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon Low corporate tax rates help lower-paid people: Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says bank it will raise minimum pay Negotiations over Brexit will take years, says CEO of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon gets 35% raise READ MORE ONSaudi Arabiamarket shareJPMorganJamie DimonIMFDonald Trump Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App.DOWNLOAD NOW FROM AROUND THE WEB Find All The Accessories You'll Need To Own At Bal Harbou..

BGI and State Street Global Trust Company each picked up an international indexed equity mandate, benchmarked to the MSCI world index - developed countries. JPMorgan Investment Management, UBS Global Asset Management (Singapore) and Allianz Dresdner Asset Management secured international balanced mandates, using a 60% MSCI, 40% JPMorgan Government Capital Bond Index - Global benchmark. A second round of tenders for international mandates is expected to happen in the second half of the year, and be around US$500m in total. Also on the cards are investments in alternatives, said Chen: “We are in the stage of revising our internal regulations, to allow us to invest in venture capital and real estate.” Related articles Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Investigate 'arrogant and abusive' TPR and privatise PPF, says paper College of Law Pension and Assurance enters fourth buy-in PMI hires learning director to review qualifications and education strategy IA advisory board member takes aim at trade body's transparency plans Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Taiwan Latest stories Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Over half of pension professionals believe the 'gilts plus' valuation method is unhelpful in the current economic environment, according to Aon Hewitt research.

Aa Aa Now Reading: Time for a new surprise in dollar's Trump slump? 22/05/2017 Time for a new surprise in dollar's Trump slump? REUTERS 22/05/2017 By Ritvik Carvalho and Patrick Graham LONDON (Reuters) – After its worst week in a year, has a period of dollar strength dating back to 2014 been brought to a close by concerns over Donald Trump’s presidency and will the currency fall much further in the months ahead? That’s the question analysts and investors were debating on Monday as the latest round of political comments on exchange rates – this time from German Chancellor Angela Merkel – pushed the euro to a six-and-a-half-month high. The dollar’s fall last week after the sacking of FBI chief James Comey followed a period of turbulence around French presidential elections and North Korea’s missile tests. But as this graphic shows, the dollar’s steady fall this year – now almost 7 percent – correlates most closely with a rise in negative surprises from U.S. macroeconomic data. That hit its weakest in a year last week but then turned upwards – just as its euro equivalent did the opposite. Equity analysts from JPMorgan said in a note to clients on Monday that the dollar was already 5 percent undervalued against the euro <EUR=>, 1 percent against the yen <JPY=> and 2 percent against the Swiss franc <CHF=>. “Controversies such as the current one have some precedent in causing the dollar to weaken more than what would be justified by typical cyclical drivers like interest rate differentials,” they said. “We do think a more protracted period of political risk is worth positioning for, but given these existing risk premia, we do so narrowly – only via shorting the dollar vs the franc.” The fall in the past week has only taken the dollar index, measuring its strength against a basket of other currencies, back into the top of the range it held for most of 2015 and 2016 – until Trump’s election last November. “(That fall) should help to dampen the scope for the U.S. dollar to weaken further in the near-term which would also require building concerns over the health of the U.S. economy,” MUFG economist Lee Hardman said on Monday. “Technically, the dollar index has fallen back to within the consolidation range. A break below the bottom of that range would be a far more significant long-term bearish technical development (and) remains unlikely in the near-term.” (Writing by Patrick Graham; Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

 The carnage in retail is good news, but only if you know where to look Akin Oyedele May 22, 2017, 11:25 AM 2,338 facebook linkedin twitter email print Carl Court/Getty A handful of industries and companies are defying the downturn in retail as consumers move online to buy things. They don't include apparel retailers like Macy's and TJX, which disappointed on first-quarter earnings. But Walmart, America's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, proved resilient partly because it invested heavily in beefing up its online operation, including with its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The e-commerce threat is a common thread for many of the companies that are likely to close stores — more than 3,000 closings are expected this year — and in turn lay off workers. But the changes in behavior that have slammed some of the big players in traditional retail could boost other parts of the consumer discretionary sector. "Headwinds remain for some particular industries (autos, publishing, some retailers) within discretionary, but we are cautiously optimistic that the overall group should continue to move higher, possibly at a slower rate near-term," Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA, said in a recent note. "Stock pickers, however, will likely benefit the most." Some recent surveys, conducted by firms including TD Bank and JPMorgan Chase, found that millennials are spending more on experiences. For Sebastian Werner, a portfolio manager for US and global growth equities at Deutsche Asset Management, companies that offer experiences over items are likely to outperform in this environment. The beauty industry is doing fairly well, Werner said. He gave Ulta Beauty as an example that combines physical cosmetics sales with the experience of a makeover. Its shares have gained 42% over the past year. Werner and other investors have pointed to home improvement as another niche that's withstanding the broader weakness in retail. Floor & Decor, which went public in late April and has gained 13% since then, is "proof that this is a retail concept that might work in an environment that doesn't have the overhang from Amazon," Werner said. That's because of the "touch-and-feel" nature of tiles and other home-improvement supplies. Buyers also often prefer to get in-person advice from a professional at a store. Those trends also put gardening retailers in a good spot in this market environment. "If you're working on your garden now, you don't want to wait until the UPS car drives to your home in two days," Werner said. "You just drive to the store." Tractor Supply is one of Werner's preferred companies in this space, though its exposure to oil-producing markets has hurt its performance as the commodity's price fell and workers lost their jobs. Another area that stands to benefit from consumers spending more on experiences is travel, specifically cruise lines, Werner told Business Insider. "Most people that have gone on a cruise don't do it only once, but they become repetitive users," he said. "They get hooked on the experience, usually." He said cruise lines were smart about ways to upsell customers with upgrades like a room with a sea view. China's booming cruise industry also offers opportunities for investors, as well as the recent opening up of Cuba for tourists. Though Cuba still needs to upgrade its infrastructure, it offers opportunities for investors who are looking out to the long term, Werner said. To be involved in consumer discretionary, "you need some concepts that are somewhat differentiated and that are isolated by this e-commerce thing," Werner added.

But this month, a period of extraordinary investor returns appears to have dramatically come to an end as the entire Australian banking sector was heavily sold down – and analysts and fund managers are less than hopeful a recovery is in sight. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "Australian banks seem to have hitched a ride on the global banking rally which began in mid-2016 as bond yields started to inflect upwards. This is despite no direct benefit on Australian banks from a steeping yield curve," says UBS analyst David Cassidy. Photo: Paul Rovere Between November 8, the day of the US election, and May 1, NAB soared 29.8 per cent. CBA rose 21.4 per cent, ANZ added 21.9 per cent, while Westpac rose a more modest 16.7 per cent. None of the banks most directly affected by the US administration matched NAB's spectacular performance up to the start of May. JPMorgan gained 24.3 per cent over the period, Goldman Sachs rose 23.6 per cent, while Morgan Stanley added 28.3 per cent. Another similar bank, Wells Fargo, was hit with a lending scandal and so rose only 19.6 per cent over the period. This is despite the US banks being far more exposed to the reflation trade, as well as US President Donald Trump's unwinding of the Dodd-Frank regulations in February. The partial repeal pushed Goldman Sachs to a record high, but it has declined since. Local investors didn't expect the changes to significantly feed through to Australian banks. Advertisement Since the start of May, Australia's big four banks have lost ground, shedding a combined $50 billion in market capitalisation and between 7.2 per cent and 13.7 per cent off their share prices as they went ex-dividend, were hit by a banking levy in the budget, new macroprudential regulations and as ANZ's earnings disappointed. The rapid pace of the decline, JPMorgan's equities team wrote, is surprising, but even after it the banks are not necessarily at fair value. The big four don't tend to do well in May, losing on average since 2000 1.6 per cent over the month. But that hasn't stopped them surging the rest of the year before. Two and a half decades without a recession and a decline in local interest rates "created a fertile backdrop for Australian banks to outperform both global banks and the broader Australian market", wrote UBS equity strategist David Cassidy this month. Since 1997, the MSCI World Bank Index, from a base of 100, hovers just above 200 index points. Australia's banks are almost touching 1400 index points. Peak performance in the Australian banks, Mr Cassidy wrote, was actually around the April bank reporting season in 2015. But since then, the bank bull market has proved "surprisingly stubborn". "Australian banks seem to have hitched a ride on the global banking rally which began in mid-2016 as bond yields started to inflect upwards. This is despite no direct benefit on Australian banks from a steeping yield curve." But looking ahead, Mr Cassidy is one of many analysts who now expect bank performance to decline. "Banks appear a 'market performer' at best from here ... Headwinds and clouds seem to be accumulating". JP Morgan's equity sales team wrote that "caution around house prices and impending APRA capital requirement announcements could see the sector needing to look optically cheap to increase interest on the long side". Many fund managers are also cautious on the sector. The big four banks, which together comprise over a quarter of market capitalisation of the S&P/ASX200 index, are favourites with income-investors by virtue of their high dividends. But the bank levy, two of the banks said on Monday, would hit dividends – a view also expressed by many fund managers. In his monthly note, Contango Asset Management chief investment officer George Boubouras said investors could still rely on high payouts from the banks, which in absolute terms would continue to be attractive. But "investors should simply expect that initially the growth of dividends will slow at first before we eventually see a dividend cut in the years ahead", he wrote. The big four have recovered somewhat in recent days, but Katana Asset Management portfolio manager Romano Sala Tenna said the "opportunistic buying" was unlikely to signal a recovery. "I'd suggest the balance of probabilities is still weighted to the downside," he said. Originally published on The Sydney Morning Herald as After decades of outperformance, investors and analysts turn bearish on banks.

OLIVIA ORAN PURCHASE, N.Y. — Reuters Published Monday, May 22, 2017 7:33PM EDT Last updated Monday, May 22, 2017 7:33PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Morgan Stanley’s executive compensation plan received the support of more than 90 per cent of its shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting in its Purchase, N.Y., wealth-management headquarters on Monday. Morgan Stanley avoided protests that dominated other Wall Street firms’ annual meetings this year. During JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s annual meeting last week, chief executive Jamie Dimon faced activists who demanded answers about his role on a White House business council. Morgan Stanley awarded CEO James Gorman $22.5-million (U.S.) in 2016, up 7 per cent from the year-ago period. The bank posted an 8-per-cent return on equity in 2016, moving closer to the 9-per-cent to 11-per-cent range that Mr. Gorman aims to achieve by the end of 2017. “We’re confident about our targets for this year,” Mr. Gorman said. “We’re not going to start resetting targets at this point.” Morgan Stanley shares soared 33 per cent in 2016, the biggest gainer among the largest U.S. bank stocks. Gains were particularly strong after the Nov. 8 U.S. election, as investors bet President Donald Trump would usher in an era of less regulation and more economic growth. “What a difference a year makes,” banking analyst Mike Mayo said during the meeting, noting that Morgan Stanley shares stood at $26 last year during this time, compared with more than $41 today. Morgan Stanley shareholders also rejected an investor proposal from the AFL-CIO union that would prohibit stock awards from vesting for bank executives who resign for government service.

Scott Applewhite US 03:05 23.05.2017Get short URL 0 13531 Minister-Counselor of the Russian Embassy in the United States Denis Gonchar said in anterview with Sputnik on Monday that American companies working in Russia regularly confirm that they are not going to leave the country despite difficulties in the Moscow-Washington relations. WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — US companies currently doing business in Russia regularly affirm that they are planning to stay in the country, Minister-Counselor of the Russian Embassy in the United States Denis Gonchar told Sputnik. "Despite the difficulties, the bilateral trade between Russia and the United States is ongoing. The entrepreneurs have closed mutually beneficial contracts," Gonchar said. "American companies regularly confirm to us that they are not going to leave Russia. Their activities have never stopped, they are just often not widely covered." © Sputnik/ Aram Nersesyan Russian Arms Trade With US Must Uphold Country's Interests - RosoboronexportAt the end of April, Gonchar noted, Forbes said JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs became the top two and top three leading investment banks in Russia. And since the beginning of the year, he added, American banks have joined some major deals, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who took part in the initial offering of shares of Children's World (Detskiy Mir). "We launched about ten projects last year which involve American businesses. Many of them are in the medical sphere and concern the localization of the production of drugs in Russia," Gonchar said. "Thus, the company Veropharm, owned by Abbott Laboratories, opened two enterprises for the production of medicines in Belgorod (cytotoxic drugs and nasal drops) and in the village of Volginsky in the Vladimir region (antitumor drugs for chemotherapy)." © Sputnik/ Alexandr Demyanchuk US, Russian Companies Trade More Without Relying on IntermediariesThe Minister-Counselor added that US global pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer and Russian pharmaceutical company NovaMedica signed a strategic partnership agreement, including the construction of a manufacturing plant in the Vorsino industrial park for production of more than 30 vital medicinal products and the work of joint technical laboratories in Moscow. Moreover, Pfizer launched production of three medicines at St. Petersburg’s NTFF Polysan — for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, an anti-infective drug for hospital-acquired infections, and the reduction of cholesterol levels. "Medtronic together with Renova are beginning the production of stents within the framework of joint venture Stenteks at the innovation center SKOLKOVO," Gonchar said. Gonchar also pointed out that there are joint projects in the high-tech sector. "United Technologies' Hamilton Standard launched the construction of the second stage of the complex for the production of heat exchangers for the air-conditioning systems of Boeing 767, 777, and 787 in Kimry, Tver region," he explained. "Kemin Industries launched a plant in Lipetsk for the production of feed additives – to support the development of our livestock." © Photo: Pixabay Work of Russian Trade Representation in US Not Impacted by SanctionsRussian President Vladimir Putin said in March that US businesses continues to work in Russia and Moscow is always ready to "welcome," more companies from the United States to develop their business in the country. Russia's relations with the United States suffered a crisis after the beginning of a conflict in Ukraine in 2014. The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions against Russia over Moscow's alleged role in the Ukrainian conflict, a claim Russia has repeatedly denied. ...

(AMD) Stock Risks a Nasty Breakdown Dow Jones Finishes Strong as Trump Fears Recede View All Posts U.S. equities drifted higher in drama-free trading on Monday, a blissful calm after last week’s volatility. Political headlines slowed as President Trump continues his first foreign trip moving from Saudi Arabia to Israel today. Several appearances by Federal Reserve officials broke no news ahead of the release of the latest meeting minutes later this week. And traders looked ahead to the possible extension of OPEC’s supply freeze agreement at an upcoming policy meeting. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.5%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8% and the Russell 2000 added 0.7%. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was down against the euro, gold added 0.6% as silver surged and oil gained 0.9% to hit a one-month high. The gain in silver boosted the ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (NYSEARCA:AGQ) to a 3.6% gain for the day for Edge subscribers. Breadth was positive, with 2.2 advancers for every declining issue on light volume, with just 792 million shares on the NYSE totaling 88% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 1% gain while energy was the laggard, down 0.2% despite the gain in crude. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) gained 2.1% on the announcement CEO Mark Fields would retire amid frustration with the company’s stalled stock price and a loss of momentum in areas like electric vehicles and autonomous technology. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) gained 2.8% on an upgrade from JPMorgan on the closure of the NXPI acquisition. And Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) gained 10.2% on a positive Jefferies note following China Mobile’s selection of ZTE (representing about 10% of the company’s business) for buildout of its packet network. On the downside, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 3.3% — reversing a recent rebound rally — after Citigroup cast doubt on recent reports the company could get a licensing agreement from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for certain graphics processor technologies. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell 2.2% on cardiovascular risks for its Evenity treatment for osteoporosis. Turning back to OPEC, the oil sheiks will meet in Vienna on May 25. The consensus is for a nine-month extension to the supply cap that’s been in place in the first half of the year aimed at normalizing the global oversupply situation. There has also been chatter of a potentially deeper level of output cuts. The risk, of course, is that OPEC is merely sacrificing hard won market share gains earned during the post-2014 price war against U.S. shale producers; as wildcatters have eagerly increased U.S. drilling rig counts in response to the OPEC-driven energy price recovery that started in early 2016. Outside of OPEC, watch for the release of the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the timing and pacing of additional interest rate hikes through the end of the year. Wall Street is braced for another hike in June; but the rest of the year is murky with less than a 50% chance of a second hike before 2018.

Print   Email   Font Resize Butterfly Pavilion may move to Broomfield Project would be part of the new Science and Technology Park at Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway By Jennifer Rios Staff Writer Posted:   05/17/2017 01:36:54 PM MDT Students meditate during a class of Rainforest Yoga recently at the Butterfly Pavilion in Westminster. (The Butterfly Pavilion / Courtesy Photo) After 25 years at it's current Westminster location, the Butterfly Pavilion hopes to migrate to Broomfield. The pavilion and its affiliate, the Center for Invertebrate Research and Conservation (CIRC), want to relocate the facility to North Park, at Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway — a move council overwhelmingly supported at a Tuesday night study session. North Park also is where JP Morgan Chase intends to build a 150,000-square-foot, $220 million operations center. According to information submitted to Broomfield officials by the Butterfly Pavilion, CIRC intends to achieve "global change through innovative and integral programs that advance the knowledge and capacity of invertebrate research efforts while advancing invertebrate conservation work around the world." Broomfield agreed to pay $75,000 to help pay for schematic plans and story-boards for a potential joint-use project that would benefit Broomfield, the pavilion and the Adams 12 Five Star School District, which would be part of a new Science and Technology Park at North Park. The pavilion would match that $75,000. "In order to support the formation and long-term growth plans of CIRC, additional facility needs required Butterfly Pavilion to begin planning for expansion. This expansion is two-fold: 1) Lab and research space to support the critical work needing to be done by our science team; and 2) A state-of- the-art facility that allows us to present important scientific information to the general public, and engage them in behavior changes that support overall ecosystem health," according to the documents. Advertisement Mayor Pro Tem Greg Stokes said a way Broomfield can continue to be a "winner as a city" is to attract these type of projects. "As we continue to look for ways to get North Park started, this is one of the best ideas I've seen," Stokes said. "There's just so many good things about this for an optional city to make ourselves stand out among the cities around us. I'm 100 percent behind this." North Park is a Colo, 7 and Sheridan Parkway. (File Photo) The North Park Managed Growth and Development Agreement, which was approved in 2011, includes a provision that the developer and Broomfield will work together to develop a the Science and Technology Park. McWhinney a real estate developer based in Denver, owns the land and will contribute up to 20 acres for the Science and Technology Park. Broomfield officials are continuing to discuss a joint-use project with Adams 12 school district to develop the science park, which would include a District Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Center within North Park. Broomfield City and County uses could include library, recreation, educational, workforce and administrative services for the north end of Broomfield. The Butterfly Pavilion hosts more than 300,000 guests annually. The pavilion has also been approached with proposals to remain in its current community or relocate to a third community, according to Broomfield city documents. McWhinney is updating it's vision plan for North Park, which makes timing of CIRC ideal, Deputy City and County Manager Kevin Standbridge said. The hope is that all parties work together on design from the beginning to best serve the community. Council members Mike Shelton and Bette Erickson said they are excited about the project, but questioned what sort of future participation the center would ask of Broomfield. Rob O'Dea, chair of Butterfly Pavilion's board of directors, said CIRC would look to Broomfield for some assistance going forward. With a projected-half million people going through the facility in coming years, "with their pocketbooks out," he said, the relocation would benefit the center and surrounding Broomfield businesses. O'Dea said the original land in Westminster was a gift to the nonprofit pavilion. He did not have information on sales tax revenue generated for the city. Sharing and co-locating some facilities would help with construction costs, O'Dea said, and the pavilion is having the same conversations with Adams 12. One example of shared spaces would be an auditorium to host educational events where scientists from around the world would share their knowledge. O'Dea said the pavilion is working with a capital campaign committee and assured Broomfield officials that the pavilion is committed to the same vision as the city. The plan includes weaving a trail system through the area to tie the center into existing open space. Mayor Randy Ahrens said the center could provide an opportunity for businesses moving into Broomfield to establish themselves as part of the community by contributing to the project. He also is in favorof the idea of the K-20 STEM school where students would work on research projects at one of the top accredited zoos in the world. "What an experience for Broomfield youth to be able to have — this incredible zoo," he said. "How everything goes together is really great."

PURCHASE, N.Y. Morgan Stanley's executive compensation plan received the support of over 90 percent of its shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in its Purchase, New York wealth management headquarters on Monday. Morgan Stanley avoided protests that dominated other Wall Street firm's annual meetings this year. JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon faced activists during the bank's annual meeting last week who demanded answers about his role on a White House business council. Morgan Stanley awarded Chief Executive James Gorman $22.5 million in 2016, up 7 percent from the year ago period. The bank posted an 8 percent return on equity in 2016, moving closer to the 9 to 11 percent range which Gorman aims to achieve by the end of 2017. "We're confident about our targets for this year," Gorman said. "We're not going to start resetting targets at this point." Morgan Stanley shares soared 33 percent in 2016, the biggest gainer among the largest U.S. banks' stocks. Gains were particularly strong after the Nov. 8 U.S. election, as investors bet that President Donald Trump would usher in an era of less regulation and more economic growth. "What a difference a year makes," banking analyst Mike Mayo said during the meeting, noting that Morgan Stanley shares stood at $26 last year during this time, compared to over $41 today. Morgan Stanley shareholders also rejected an investor proposal from the AFL-CIO union that would prohibit stock awards from vesting for bank executives who resign for government serice. The practice has received additional scrutiny in recent months from investors and lawmakers after it was disclosed that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc president Gary Cohn would receive at least $100 million upon taking a job with the Trump administration.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 23, 2:49 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Growth Of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Foreshadows Blockchain Gold Rush By Leigh Cuen On 05/22/17 AT 4:20 PM Close The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance announced Monday more than 86 companies joined its network of blockchain innovators, including the National Bank of Canada, Samsung SDS and the San Francisco Stock Exchange. The EEA is the leading corporate gateway into the world of blockchain. Its founding members include Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Wipro, just to name a few. Although blockchain technology is still in its infancy, there is rampant adoption and integration across the tech industry, from startups to corporations. Among fintech veterans, the EEA already has a reputation for pragmatic collaborations where members wiggle around the red tape to get things done. “We still have a few hundred potential members waiting on the waiting list,” Matt Spoke, CEO of the blockchain startup Nuco, said at Consensus 2017 in New York on Monday. “You won’t get much as an observer. You’ll get more value as a participant. ... Everything is built around incentivizing members to actively participate.” Read: Why Startups Are Raising Cryptocurrency Along those lines, JPMorgan quickly moved from private talks to a public partnership with Zcash, a cryptocurrency with more privacy features than bitcoin. Forbes reported Monday that Zerocoin Electric Coin Co., the firm behind Zcash, plans to add Zcash’s privacy technology to JPMorgan’s blockchain system, Quorum. Critics of the Ethereum gold rush say blockchain is widely misunderstood, which is definitely true, and that privacy concerns create a major barrier for enterprise companies. JPMorgan’s new project may resolve many of those discrepancies between public and private ledger distribution. "Until now, blockchain technology's lack of privacy and confidentiality has been a major obstacle to adoption,” Zcash chief operating officer Jack Gavigan told Forbes. “By combining the zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL) with Quorum's private smart contracts, that obstacle is removed for many use cases, ranging from simple equity trades to complex derivatives." Amber Baldet, Blockchain Program Lead at JP Morgan, unveiled a live demo of the Quorum open-source platform at Consensus 2017 on Monday. She said internal departments are already using Quorum for payments. It won’t be long until JPMorgan offers blockchain contracts and scalable financial services for external clients too. “Corporate and investment banking, global scale financial applications,” Baldet explained during the demonstration. Even though the project is still in development, Quorum is an open source system and these experiments are having a wider impact on the Ethereum community. “What we’ve seen is an ecosystem emerging that really doesn’t have anything to do with what we’re doing at JPMorgan," Baldet said. "It's really cool."  For example, Spanish banking giant Banco Santander is already using Quorum. John Whelan, Banco’s director of innovation, described Baldet as “the genius” pushing banks forward into the future. “It’s great to see the privacy components coming together,” Whelan told International Business Times. “In financial services, the privacy of a financial transaction is not only important from a business point of view, it’s also mandated by regulators.” Read: How Women Are Building The Future And Promoting Diversity With Blockchain Blockchain technology is generally decentralized and values public, anonymous transactions over accredited options. Some major financial institutions are experimenting with private blockchain solutions. For example Nasdaq and Citi also announced Monday they are integrating blockchain technology into their internal systems. JPMorgan’s project is more along the lines of technology being developed by IBM, offering unique combinations of both public and private options. “Which is different from the bitcoin or Ethereum system,” Whelan said. In the back rooms of the New York conference, Wall Street veterans gossip about making millions over the next few weeks from cryptocurrency investments. Mashable reported the price of bitcoin passed $2,000 on Monday. Ethereum's ether tokens are now reportedly valued at around $180, a 1,400 percent rise compared to three months ago. Meanwhile, professional groups like the EEA are taking that growth from investors' private bank accounts to mainstream enterprise. “We’re not about top-down structure,” CME Group blockchain leader Sandra Ro said at the New York conference. “The working groups themselves are the real engine.”   Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Raquel Pichardo-Allison reports Nomura Asset Management has an image problem. Officials at Japanese asset manager Nomura have their sights set on becoming a truly global player with a wide spectrum of product offerings and clients spread around the world. But first, they need to change their image as only a Japanese equity manager. Related articles The pros and cons of direct lending PP Administration Survey 2017: The results How trustees should approach corporate takeovers What can the UK learn from Denmark to develop its own dashboard? Pension accounting changes - the what, when, who and how The firm wants to expand beyond its roots as a Japanese equity manager and plans to continue to build out its fixed income capabilities and expand its emerging markets offerings. "I think the meaning of a global manager is a manager that has products that can be promoted to any client in the world," said London-based chairman and director Tamon Watanabe. But one of Nomura's biggest challenges lies in its perception as a specialised equity manager, said Watanabe. "If you hear the name Nomura, you think regional equity manager," he said. "We'd like to develop our own capabilities in all key areas. We are an equity house, a fixed income house and we'd like to build out global credit. Global equity, emerging market equity, (etc...)," said Yoshihiro Namura, senior investment officer and managing director of fixed income at Nomura's Tokyo headquarters. "From a business point of view, do we have a big presence in the American retail space? We don't. Do we have a retail business here in Europe? No. Do we have a big institutional presence in America? No. Do we have operation in China? No," he said. Home assets The firm does have a substantial presence in its home region. Nomura had JPY19trn (US$200.5bn) in assets on March 31, according to the most recent details available on the firm's website. Of that, JPY6trn is run for institutions. The vast majority of its assets come from Japanese investors, officials there said. Nomura has saturated about 20% of the Japanese asset management market and has offices scattered throughout Asia, North America and Europe. Penny Green, chief executive at the £1.1bn Superannuation Arrangements of the University of London (SAUL) Trustee Co., and a Nomura client, said: "My first thought would be the mandate for which we appointed them - Asian equity, then Japanese equities, then global equities," she said. A year ago, SAUL hired Nomura to run a £50m Asia ex-Japan portfolio. Watanabe said the best way to combat that image, is to show clients the numbers. Excluding Japan, the global fixed income strategy returned 8.49% and 7.15% in the three and five year periods, besting the Citi World Government Bond Index by 119 basis points and 47 basis points, respectively. The firm's global fixed income strategy (including Japan) returned 7.08% annualised in the three years ended June 30, and 6.10% in the five-year period. The strategy beat the JPMorgan Global Bond Index - unhedged by nine basis points and 38 basis points in the three and five year periods, respectively. And in June 2008, Nomura lifted out the fixed income team from Proxima Alpha Investments in order to provide alpha-oriented global fixed income solutions. The New York-based team is called Nomura Global Alpha. Investors around the world have been slowly removing their assets from cash, which provided a safe haven during the credit crunch and market volatility of the financial downturn. But as they re-enter the markets, many are turning to fixed income, particularly the credit markets and Nomura wants to tap into this interest. "We are getting some inquiries about global credit. We were not major players in that area before, but we are seeing enquiries from large pension funds, mainly in Asia," said Namura. "We're seeing new demand in the credit space this year," he said. Credit has caught the attention of risk-averse investors ready to cautiously move out of cash and seek returns. Government bonds are delivering historically low yields, and very large new issuances are expected to fund government deficits, said State Street Global Advisors, global head of credit strategies and fixed income research William Cunningham. Meanwhile, structured product bonds, like asset-backed securities, rely on consumer debt and do not provide manageable downside risks. "This leaves only corporate bonds," said Cunningham. "Corporate bonds appear to offer the most compelling combination of significant return potential, stable fundamentals, manageable downside, liquidity, and principal protection of all the major asset classes that investors can look to as a first step out of cash to resurrect their portfolios." Multi-asset, multi-class In its quest to become a more global player, Nomura is part of a larger trend by asset managers to become multi-asset class solutions providers. "They're not the only firm out there thinking through how to become more global," said Casey Quirk & Associates partner, Jeb Doggett. "There's a perception among managers that investors themselves are becoming more global in their allocations... Investment managers recognise that to even compete in their home markets you need to have a more global perspective because they're up against global managers," said Doggett. The most recent and most high-profile example is BlackRock's US$13.5bn acquisition of Barclays Global Investors. The quickest way to become a global player is through acquisitions rather than organic growth, said Cerulli Associates, managing director of the international business Shiv Taneja. "The worry about them seeking global dominance is how will they do it, and how do they make it stick?" he asked. Acquisitions, he said, "is the speedier option, but it's the most difficult one." Because of their penetration in the Japanese market, Nomura has to look beyond its borders. "If they want to keep growing, they have to be outside of Japan," said Taneja. Indian expansion Nomura has a history of acquisitions and lift-outs. Aside from the Proxima lift-out in 2008, last month the firm scooped up 35% of LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India's largest life insurer. "It's a coup. It's a massive coup," said Taneja of the acquisition, adding that LIC practically had a monopoly on the Indian market about a decade ago, but other firms have since come into play. Watanabe said Nomura had been in discussions with LIC "for some time" and the acquisition is a sign of Nomura's belief that the Indian market is ripe for growth. Nomura also plans to make similar moves in China, though Watanabe declined to elaborate. "We are very interested in the market," he said. But Nomura isn't turning its back on its home market. "My own personal outlook is that this industry in Japan is still at the beginning of its growth because Japanese investors have been so conservative about investing in equities and so forth," said Namura. While potential growth in the institutional market in Japan is limited, the retail market is still in its early stages, said Watanabe. The Japanese retail market is the second largest in the world, but only 4% of individuals have their assets invested in mutual funds, said Watanabe. He estimated that amount could reach up to 10%. "This is the kind of picture we see emerging," he said. If Nomura succeeds in becoming a global player, it will become part of a very select group. "There aren't many asset managers that have a truly global business," said Doggett. "Maybe a dozen." "When an organisation is known for one competency, the easiest way (to expand) is to leverage on that core competency," said Doggett. "They're trying to develop new competencies and develop in new markets. That's twice as hard. He said it could take years for any manager to become global. The practice must be scaled to work across multiple time zones, multiple regulatory regimes and develop extensive risk management capabilities. Managers need to balance this transition, while ensuring existing clients are not neglected. "We would want to know that resources used for our account are not going to be re-diverted and that growth of the manager's business was being done on a controlled basis and that they were paying close attention to capacity constraints to ensure that existing client service and performance was not compromised," said UK-based West Midlands Pension Fund, head of quoted equities and corporate governance Tony Doyle. Nomura manages a £30m Japanese equity portfolio for the pension fund. But officials at Nomura see their move onto the global market as a gradual evolution, not an immediate transformation. "We have taken 20 to 30 years to develop our firm," said Namura. "We will not become a global player over night."   Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Insurance Nomura Latest stories Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Over half of pension professionals believe the 'gilts plus' valuation method is unhelpful in the current economic environment, according to Aon Hewitt research.

Viacom, the owner of Comedy Central, MTV, and VH1, is in advanced discussions with a streaming service to become part of an entertainment-only bundle that could cost less than $20 a month, CEO Bob Bakish said at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Telecom conference. AMC and Discovery are also in on the talks, according to a report from Bloomberg last month. The deal, which would cut out high-fee channels like ESPN and drop broadcast channels ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox, would dramatically reduce the end cost for consumers, and could be priced between $10 and $20 according to Bakish. Variety noted that Bakish also said Viacom was working on repairing its frayed relationship with said streaming service. This could mean Sony’s PlayStation Vue is behind this potential package; it dropped Viacom channels in a pay dispute last November. Whichever service does release the entertainment-only package, the hope is that a lower fee will entice a larger audience of users more than the current crop of packages from OTT services like Sling, DirecTV Now, and the aforementioned PlayStation Vue have attracted so far. The bigger question is how many people are interested in paying $20 a month for what amounts to fewer options than basic cable?

Outgoing CEO Mike Rothman founded the company in 2003 with six employees, according to a press release. Rhodes will replace him as CEO, but Rothman will remain as chairman. Rhodes left Rackspace about six months after guiding it through a $4.3 billion sale. “Mike’s genius was recognizing the opportunity to disrupt the huge, inefficient multisite property management industry by deploying a scalable, fully-managed technology-enabled solution,” Rhodes said Monday in a statement. “With this team’s passion for innovation and service, we will continue to revolutionize the industry.” SMS Assist has a team of more than 700 employees and 140,000 service locations, according to the press release. The company says its clients include Family Dollar, JPMorgan Chase and Colony Starwood Homes. It’s attempting to standardize and consolidate facilities maintenance services, which is a highly fragmented industry. “SMS Assist will standardize your approach to facilities maintenance and provide you and your employees with a simple, turnkey process to handle every issue, while also lowering your overall cost of management,” the company says on its web site. Rhodes said in a blog post earlier this month that the company he would be leading is “using cloud technologies to disrupt what has been a very low-tech industry.” He did not specify the company name at the time. “The company is going through growing pains and needs a CEO who has been through those challenges before,” he said at the time. Rhodes explained that he would be leaving San Antonio-based Rackspace because he felt he had taken the company as far as he could given his strengths and skills. He cited local author Kelley Freeman as saying “the last act of leading is leaving.” “What he means, in the context of a CEO, is that when you’ve taken your company as far as you can, given your particular strengths and skills, it’s time to let someone else with different strengths step up and take it farther,” Rhodes wrote. “That’s how I feel today.” The new job would play to his strengths, he said, adding that he thought “it will provide a reinvigorating change.” “This new job, at a smaller company, will also give me more control over my schedule and more time with my kids before the two oldest, who are now in high school, leave home for college,” he wrote in the post. Rhodes pocketed at least $22.7 million from the sale of his stock and options in the leveraged buyout of Rackspace by New York private equity firm Apollo Global Management, according to a Nov. 3 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. sehlinger@express-news.net Twitter: @samehlinger Text NEWS to 77453 for alerts Death toll climbs in bombing at Ariana Grande concert Manchester mayor issues statement after explosion Jury decides fate of salesman who killed Stone Oak homeowner Tuberculosis detected at S.A. middle school    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

By Ritvik Carvalho and Patrick GrahamLONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - After its worst week in a year,
has a period of dollar strength dating back to 2014 been brought
to a close by concerns over Donald Trump's presidency and will
the currency fall much further in the months ahead?
    That's the question analysts and investors were debating on
Monday as the latest round of political comments on exchange
rates - this time from German Chancellor Angela Merkel - pushed
the euro to a six-and-a-half-month high.
    The dollar's fall last week after the sacking of FBI chief
James Comey followed a period of turbulence around French
presidential elections and North Korea's missile tests.
    But as this graphic shows, the dollar's steady fall this
year - now almost 7 percent - correlates most closely with a
rise in negative surprises from U.S. macroeconomic data. That
hit its weakest in a year last week but then turned upwards -
just as its euro equivalent did the opposite.
    Equity analysts from JPMorgan said in a note to clients on
Monday that the dollar was already 5 percent undervalued against
the euro <EUR=>, 1 percent against the yen <JPY=> and 2 percent
against the Swiss franc <CHF=>.
    "Controversies such as the current one have some precedent
in causing the dollar to weaken more than what would be
justified by typical cyclical drivers like interest rate
differentials," they said.
    "We do think a more protracted period of political risk is
worth positioning for, but given these existing risk premia, we
do so narrowly - only via shorting the dollar vs the franc."
    The fall in the past week has only taken the dollar index,
measuring its strength against a basket of other currencies,
back into the top of the range it held for most of 2015 and 2016
- until Trump's election last November.
    "(That fall) should help to dampen the scope for the U.S.
dollar to weaken further in the near-term which would also
require building concerns over the health of the U.S. economy,"
MUFG economist Lee Hardman said on Monday.
    "Technically, the dollar index has fallen back to within the
consolidation range. A break below the bottom of that range
would be a far more significant long-term bearish technical
development (and) remains unlikely in the near-term."

The workshops are being held in all seven states across the Sunbelt where BBVA Compass has a physical presence — Florida, Alabama, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and California. They are part of the first of multiple campaigns the bank will initiate for its Year of Opportunity for Small Business, which kicked off during Small Business Week in early May and is designed to give small businesses the service, expertise and products they need to seize opportunities and fully realize their bright futures. Entrepreneurs and small-business leaders from the Upper Rio Grande Valley gathered on May 11 at Grindstone Coworking in Edinburg, Texas, for a BBVA Compass-sponsored workshop on entrepreneurship and the ins and outs of writing a business plan, using business credit, and understanding financial statements.

Entrepreneurs and small-business leaders from the Upper Rio Grande Valley gathered on May 11 at Grindstone Coworking in Edinburg, Texas, for a BBVA Compass-sponsored workshop on entrepreneurship and the ins and outs of writing a business plan, using business credit, and understanding financial statements. Small-business leaders gathered on May 17 at the Contra Costa Small Business Development Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif., for a BBVA Compass-sponsored workshop. „Small businesses are the engine of growth for our economy,” said Lonnie Hayes, BBVA Compass Small Business Segment Executive. „More than half of Americans either work for or own a small business, and those businesses create about two-thirds of the new jobs in this country every year. They’re creating a staggering amount of opportunity, and we want them to know that whatever they need — the capital to expand, the knowledge to thrive — we’re here to help provide it.” The curriculum for the workshops is available through the BBVA Compass Center for Financial Education, which offers online and in-person adult financial education courses. Developed in partnership with leading education technology firm EverFi, the small business curriculum includes five modules on topics such as how to use and obtain credit, develop a business plan and understand financial statements. It’s designed to give small-business owners the financial management tools they need to successfully grow and maintain a healthy enterprise. The bank’s $6.2 billion commitment The workshops are part of BBVA Compass’ comprehensive, coordinated effort to serve small businesses. The nation’s 22nd-largest bank by deposit market share, BBVA Compass is now the fifth most-active lender by total number of loans for the SBA’s flagship 7(a) loan program, approving 1,801 such loans in the fiscal year that ended in September 2016. Other banks in the top five included some of the largest in the country, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank claiming spots. Part of the bank’s success is due in part to its commitment in late 2014 to make $6.2 billion in small business loans over the next five years. By the end of 2016, BBVA Compass had made nearly $2.4 billion in loans to small businesses. „We’re putting Main Street on firmer capital footing, and some of our most innovative work is being done in the service of small businesses,” said Hayes, the bank’s Small Business Segment Executive. For instance, BBVA Compass mined data to help it identify branches that have high concentrations of small businesses within a 5-mile radius. It gave the managers of those branches advanced training so they can better meet the lending needs of microbusinesses which generate less than $1 million in annual sales.

The S&P 500 and the Dow added 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) settled a step ahead of its peers. The benchmark index dropped 44 points, or 1.8%, last Wednesday in response to a New York Times article that accused President Trump of asking former FBI Director James Comey to shut down the Bureau's investigation of former National Security adviser Michael Flynn. However, since the tumble, the S&P 500 has reclaimed all but seven points of the loss, as the buy-the-dip trade has prevailed once again. Ten of eleven sectors settled in positive territory on Monday with the technology (+1.0%) and utilities (+0.9%) spaces leading the charge. The technology group was underpinned by large-cap names like Microsoft (MSFT 68.45, +0.76), Alphabet (GOOGL 964.07, +9.42), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.28, +1.61) with QCOM showing relative strength (+2.8%) after the company's stock was upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan. QCOM's positive performance rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 1.1% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. The industrial sector also finished ahead of the broader market, thanks in part to defense names like Boeing (BA 183.67, +2.91) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 277.03, +4.24). The two names added 1.6% apiece following a weekend meeting between President Trump and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, which included the signing of a $110 billion arms deal. The consumer staples (+0.6%) and consumer discretionary (+0.6%) sectors also outperformed. Most of the remaining sectors finished with modest gains between 0.1% and 0.3%. However, the energy sector (-0.2%) settled in negative territory despite crude oil's positive performance. The energy component jumped 0.9% to $51.14/bbl as investors displayed confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts. In U.S. corporate news, Ford Motor (F 11.10, +0.23) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer on Monday morning. According to a Wall Street Journal report that was released earlier this month, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares lost around 36.0% of their value during Mr. Fields' time as CEO. U.S. Treasuries settled slightly lower across the board with the benchmark 10-yr yield climbing two basis points to 2.25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar lost 0.3% against the euro (1.1240) after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak. Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday, but, on Tuesday, market participants will receive April New Home Sales (Briefing.com consensus 605,000) at 10:00 ET.

The Dow (+0.4%) trades in line with the benchmark index while the Nasdaq (+0.7%) outperforms. Ten of eleven sectors trade in positive territory late this afternoon. The technology (+0.9%), utilities (+0.8%), and industrials (+0.7%) groups show relative strength while the telecom services (+0.1%) and energy spaces (-0.1%) exhibit relative weakness. The energy sector has lagged throughout today's session despite crude oil's positive performance. The commodity closed its trading day 0.9% higher at $51.14/bbl. On the earnings front, several notable companies will be reporting their quarterly results tomorrow morning, including AutoZone (AZO 662.59, -11.06), Toll Brothers (TOL 37.38, -0.01), Cracker Barrel (CBRL 161.52, +2.52), and DSW (DSW 17.49, +0.01).  2:30 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] Since posting its session high around 12:30 ET, the S&P 500 has drifted within a three-point range. The benchmark index currently sports a gain of 0.5%.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.8%) trades a step ahead of the benchmark index today amid broad strength from its components. Avis Budget (CAR 23.81, +1.46) is the DJTA's top-performer while airlines like JetBlue Airways (JBLU 21.57, +0.29), Southwest Airlines (LUV 58.95, +0.91), and United Continental (UAL 79.00, +1.02) also show relative strength.  Read More Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.4%) has struggled to keep pace with the broader market as names like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 10.92, -0.49), Chemours (CC 43.16, -0.68), Olin (OLN 30.95, -0.25), LogMeln (LOGM 111.15, -1.90), and Exelixis (EXEL 19.08, -0.61) weigh. The five companies show losses between 0.8% (OLN) and 4.1% (AMD). For the month, the DJTA and the Russell 2000 underperform, showing losses of 1.6% and 2.0%, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 has added 0.4% in the month of May. 2:05 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] Equity indices hover near their recent levels with the Dow holding a gain of 0.4%. Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.84, +0.63) is the top-performing Dow component this afternoon, up 2.0%. However, despite today's positive performance, the company still sits 5.9% below last Wednesday's closing level. CSCO shares plunged to a three-month low last Thursday in reaction to the company's latest earnings report. In the commodity market, metals finished Monday higher across the board. Silver ($17.19/ozt) jumped 2.3% while gold ($1,261.50/ozt) and copper ($2.60/lb) added 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. 1:25 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover at their best levels of the day with the S&P 500 up 0.5%. Given its current level, the benchmark index has retraced all but seven points of last Wednesday's dive, which represented the sharpest one-day decline since last September. Last Wednesday's swoon occurred just days after the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high of 2402.32, but the buy-the-dip response that followed has put the market within a striking distance of a fresh record yet again. Today has been largely uneventful for the bond market, where Treasuries hold slim losses with the 10-yr yield up one basis point at 2.25%. The benchmark yield has spent the entire session bouncing between 2.24% and 2.25%. 1:00 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The stock market is cruising towards its third consecutive win this afternoon with the major averages holding gains across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.7%) leads the S&P 500 (+0.5%) and the Dow (+0.4%) as tech stocks generally outperform. Ten of eleven sectors trade in positive territory this afternoon with the technology group (+0.8%) showing relative strength. The tech sector has been underpinned by large-cap names like Alphabet (GOOGL 962.71, +8.06), Microsoft (MSFT 68.24, +0.55), Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.76, +0.55), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.94, +1.26). Of these four companies, QCOM holds the widest advance, adding 2.2%, after the company's shares were upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan this morning. QCOM's positive performance has rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 0.7% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. Like technology, the industrial sector (+0.7%) also trades ahead of the broader market, thanks in part to defense names like Boeing (BA 183.45, +2.71) and Lockheed Martin (LMT 277.17, +4.38). The two names are up 1.5% apiece following a weekend meeting between President Trump and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, which included the signing of a $110 billion arms deal. The utilities sector also outperforms, trading higher by 0.7%. In U.S. corporate news, Ford Motor (F 11.04, +0.18) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer this morning. According to a Wall Street Journal report that was released earlier this month, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares have tumbled around 36.0% since Mr. Fields took over as CEO on July 1, 2014. Today, Ford trades higher by 1.7%, which makes it one of the consumer discretionary sector's (+0.5%) top-performing components. Amazon (AMZN 969.65, +9.85) has also helped the consumer discretionary space, adding 1.0%, as have retailers, evidenced by the 0.7% increase in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT 41.42, +0.28). Outside of energy, the remaining sectors trade in positive territory with modest gains between 0.1% (telecom services) and 0.6% (consumer staples). The energy sector is down 0.1% this afternoon, which is somewhat surprising given crude oil's positive performance. The energy component is up 0.8% at $51.05/bbl as investors display confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts. In the bond market, U.S. Treasuries trade slightly lower with the benchmark 10-yr yield climbing one basis point to 2.25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is down 0.2% against the euro (1.1233) after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak. Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. 12:35 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have ticked up in recent action with the S&P 500 (+0.5%) climbing to a fresh session high. Ten of eleven sectors trade in positive territory with the energy group (-0.1%) being the only exception. The technology (+0.8%) and industrials (+0.7%) sectors have maintained their spots at the top of today's leaderboard while the financial (+0.5%) space has moved in line with the benchmark index after showing weakness earlier in the session. However, some of the most influential financial components trade behind the broader market. Wells Fargo (WFC 52.90, -0.16) is down 0.3% while JPMorgan Chase (JPM 84.95, +0.17) and Bank of America (BAC 23.09, +0.04) hold modest gains of 0.2% apiece.  In Europe, the major bourses finished Monday mixed with the UK's FTSE adding 0.3%, France's CAC settling near its flat line, and Germany's DAX posting a loss of 0.2%. The euro (1.1235) has climbed 0.2% against the U.S. dollar to a fresh eight-month high after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the single currency is too weak. Eurozone monetary policy will be up for debate in a couple of weeks when the European Central Bank meets on June 8. 12:00 pm: [BRIEFING.COM] Range-bound action continues with the S&P 500 (+0.4%) staying true to a five-point range since today's opening bell. The top-weighted technology sector (+0.7%) has had a strong showing this morning, underpinned by large-cap names like Alphabet (GOOGL 962.32, +7.76), Cisco Systems (CSCO 31.62, +0.41), and Qualcomm (QCOM 59.16, +1.49). Of these three companies, QCOM holds the widest advance, adding 2.6%, after the company's shares were upgraded to 'Overweight' from 'Neutral' at JP Morgan earlier this morning. QCOM's positive performance has rubbed off on its semiconductor peers, evidenced by the 0.9% increase in the PHLX Semiconductor Index. Chipmakers are having a solid month with the PHLX Semiconductor Index currently holding a month-to-date gain of 6.3%. The positive performance has a lot to do with NVIDIA (NVDA 138.37, +2.39), which has spiked over 34.0% since releasing its latest earnings report on May 9. The company beat earnings and revenue estimates in addition to providing upbeat guidance. 11:25 am: [BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices have not changed since the last update with the S&P 500 clinging to a modest gain of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.3%) trades in line with the broader market. Energy stocks are under pressure today despite crude oil climbing to a fresh one-month high. The commodity is up 1.1% at $51.23/bbl as investors display confidence that top oil producers will extend the original OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement by six to nine months when they meet in Vienna on Thursday. In addition to pushing back the end date, reports indicate that producers may increase the magnitude of the supply cuts.  The energy sector trades at the bottom of the sector standings with a loss of 0.4%. The financials (unch), telecom services (-0.1%), materials (unch), and real estate (unch) groups also underperform. 11:00 am: [BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover modestly higher this morning with the Nasdaq (+0.5%) holding the largest gain. Earlier this morning, Ford Motor (F 11.06, +0.19) officially announced that Jim Hackett will replace Mark Fields as the company's Chief Executive Officer. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ford's Board of Directors has been looking to refine the company's strategy in response to a declining market share and a disappointing stock performance. Ford shares have tumbled 36.0% since Mr. Fields took over as CEO on July 1, 2014. Ford trades higher by 1.7%, making it one of the top-performing components in the consumer discretionary sector (+0.5%). The consumer discretionary group trades with the industrials (+0.5%) and technology (+0.5%) spaces at the top of the leaderboard while the energy (-0.3%) and financial (-0.1%) sectors lag. 10:45 am: [BRIEFING.COM] Oil prices are trading higher this morning on news of another possible variation of the OPEC/NOPEC deal; both side are meeting again this Thursday in Vienna, Austria On Thursday, May 25, OPEC and the non-OPEC members will meet again in Vienna, Austria, to discuss the idea of collectively cutting oil production to help balance out the world supply/demand imbalance On top of that now, in recent days, there are two more versions of what may happen at the May 25 meeting The first is a 9-month extension instead of a 6-month extension (an agreement to cut through the end of March 2018) And the most recent version is to cut production longer than originally expected and make the cuts deeper than the current 1.8 mln bpd This new version of extending even longer and cutting production even more than the current 1.8 mln bpd is largely why oil prices ran higher this morning June crude oil is now +$0.58 at $51.25/barrel In other energy, June natural gas is +$0.07 at $3.33/MMBtu Moving on to metals... June gold is currently +$5.50 at $1259.10/oz, while July silver is +$0.29 at $17.09/oz May copper is now +$0.01 at $2.59/lb 10:00 am: [BRIEFING.COM] Equity indices hover around their opening levels with the S&P 500 up 0.4%.

The consumer discretionary sector (+0.6%) trades with the industrial group (+0.6%) at the top of the day's leaderboard as Amazon (AMZN 969.62, +9.78) outperforms (+1.0%).

Investors should buy Qualcomm shares because the financial benefit from the NXP acquisition will add significantly to earnings next year, according to JPMorgan, which upgraded its rating on the company to overweight from neutral. Qualcomm licenses its wireless technology and manufactures mobile chipsets. It agreed to buy chipmaker NXP Semiconductors in October for about $38 billion. The company is under pressure this year due to a royalty dispute with Apple. Qualcomm shares are down 12 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 6 percent return. "We believe that there remains plenty of headline risk from the ongoing dispute with Apple. However, we believe the shares are discounting a significant amount of this risk now," analyst Rod Hall wrote in a note to clients Monday. "We believe there is material fundamental upside given the expected closure of the NXPI acquisition by the end of this year."

(Richard Drew / Associated Press) By Jenny Surane Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS For Kevin St. Pierre, the math on credit cards is pretty simple. “Generally, if the consumer has income, they pay their debts,” St. Pierre, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note to clients last week. “Consumer credit losses are driven predominantly by unemployment.” With investors skittish over the potential for higher defaults on auto and student loans, St. Pierre is one of many industry analysts and banking executives who’ve sought to allay similar concerns over rising credit-card write-offs. Card balances eclipsed $1 trillion in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, Federal Reserve data show. Card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp., Citigroup Inc., Synchrony Financial and Discover Financial Services all reported higher card write-offs in the first quarter. Still, executives and analysts see one data point as key to the health of the credit-card industry: jobs. U.S. unemployment is near an all-time low, and as long as it stays there, consumers should be able to handle their card debt. “We’re not losing any sleep that we can’t manage the credit situation we’re confronted with right now,” Discover Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf told analysts in April. “While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards.” Six of the biggest U.S. card lenders – JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, American Express, Capital One and Discover – reported that loans at least 30 days overdue, a harbinger of future write-offs, fell in April. Synchrony, signaling confidence in its own prospects, announced a dividend increase and new $1.6 billion stock repurchase program last week. Shares of the private-label card issuer have tumbled 26 percent this year, the worst performance in the S&P 500 Financials Index. Total U.S. credit-card loans have climbed every year since 2008, when the jobless rate approached 10 percent, forcing issuers to write off more than $100 billion in loans over the next two years. Recently, much of the growth has come from banks extending credit to borrowers with lower credit scores, causing write-offs to revert toward historical norms. “You’re now introducing a broader set of individuals to your portfolio that are likely more adverse,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst. “That’s just the nature of growth. These are still profitable customers. But that growth has come back and it’s creating a more normal-looking complexion in the portfolio.” For others, including Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Jason Harbes, looser underwriting standards is cause for worry. He downgraded the credit-card sector, noting in a May 19 report for clients that “credit quality has visibly worsened over the past two quarters.” The recent increase in defaults is reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when write-offs and loan balances rose despite a sustained decline in the unemployment rate, Harbes said. In addition to jobs numbers, analysts track the percentage of household income that consumers spend on debt. That figure dropped to 9.98 percent in 2016, the lowest since 2012, Fed data show. “We watch a lot of different things and are always worried that there will be some sort of inflection point,” said Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners. “But we don’t think we’ve seen an inflection point here in credit quality.” Updated: May 22, 2017, 6:12 p.m.  Tags: banking, credit, credit card, economy, loans Click here to comment on this story » Most read stories Dayton lost its asparagus business to the ‘War on Drugs’ but residents persevered … WSU grad student designs map of precinct-level election results … Three hospitalized after shooting in Manito Park early Saturday … Trump asked intelligence chiefs to push back against FBI collusion probe after Comey revealed its ex … Convicted child rapist Morgenstern gets multiple life sentences … ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

DESCRIPTION: NEW YORK, May 22, 2017 /3BL Media/ – JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced a $17 million, five-year commitment to U.S. cities working to increase the number of teens with access to quality summer work experiences that put them on a path to greater economic mobility. As part of the firm’s more than $325 million global investment in skills development, this nationwide effort will help equip young people with the skills and experiences they need to succeed and bridge the gap between the demand for summer jobs and the number of available positions. This summer, $3 million of the $17 million investment in Summer Youth Employment Programs (SYEPs) will go to organizations in 19 U.S. cities that provide training and work experiences for young people.  The cities include Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Dallas, TX; Plano, TX; Detroit, MI; Indianapolis, IN; Louisville, KY; Milwaukee, WI; St. Louis, MO; Boston, MA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Jersey City, NJ; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; Sacramento, CA; San Francisco, CA; and Seattle, WA. “It’s a moral and economic crisis that too many young people graduate high school without clear pathways to good jobs,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “We must make it a national priority to provide youth with the skills they need to succeed, and this starts by providing them with meaningful summer work. Our Summer Youth Employment Program does just that by exposing more students to jobs that teach them the skills they need to find careers in growing industries later on.” By 2025, 65 percent of jobs in the United States will require some postsecondary education, training or credential – up from 28% of jobs in the 1970s. These heightened expectations will require young people to gain work experience and develop skills today to enable them to compete in the global workforce in the future. Demand Exceeds Opportunity However, demand for summer employment remains higher than the number of available job opportunities, according to a 2016 survey of 15 U.S. cities. The report, which is based on a survey of SYEPs that are supported by JPMorgan Chase, also reveals that the summer employment rate for teens across the U.S. has fallen to 34 percent, a near record low and a 20 percentage point drop since 1995. Despite the creation of more summer roles, only approximately 38 percent of teens and young adults looking for summer jobs were able to find positions through 18 summer employment programs in the 15 cities surveyed over the last two years. Working Together Towards a Solution As cities creatively weave together resources to address the broader youth employment crisis, they are designing skills-based SYEPs, focusing on career pathways and integrating them into local workforce planning.  In addition to providing summer jobs for thousands of young people each year, this investment will support efforts to strengthen the summer youth employment field nationally by fostering learning, collaboration and innovation across U.S. cities. Below is a list of city programs receiving SYEP funding in 2016 or 2017.

Walsh. „Summer jobs are about giving young people opportunities that can change their lives. I applaud JPMorgan Chase for investing in equipping our young leaders with the skills they will use throughout their careers.”  Over the last two years, JPMorgan Chase has dedicated $5 million to enhance skill-based and career-specific job opportunities through SYEP. This commitment, combined with other local support, created almost 50,000 summer jobs for teens in over 14 cities. The public and private sectors are working together to increase the number of summer job opportunities available to young people by taking existing workforce and economic development strategies and discovering innovative ways to create jobs. As new and innovative programs evolve, JPMorgan Chase is providing funding to bring these programs to scale. Sample tactics being used to expand skill-based and career-specific employment and training opportunities include expanding public and private sector partnerships by strengthening operating and communications systems; linking summer jobs to technical skills building, training and education, and year-round employment; prioritizing programs for special youth populations, including at-risk youth; connecting SYEPs to local workforce systems through new partnerships and organizational structures; and creating financial capability programs to help create economic security for these young employees. “Massachusetts is a leader in innovation, healthcare, the life sciences and education because of impactful public private partnerships like this one,” said Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito. “Today’s commitment from JPMorgan Chase and the Private Industry Council compliments our administration’s efforts to develop a trained workforce ready to fill much needed jobs, particularly in STEM fields, as students prepare to enter the workforce.” About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.5 trillion and operations worldwide.

From Seattle to Santa Fe, cities are at the center of a movement to create publicly owned banks. By Jimmy Tobias Today 10:30 am Facebook Twitter Email Print Demonstrators protest against the Wall Street bailout outside Chase in Times Square. (AP Photo / Edouard H.R. Gluck) When Craig Brandt marched into the City Council chambers in Oakland, California, in the summer of 2015, he was furious about fraud. Ad Policy The long-time local attorney and father of two had been following the fallout from the Libor scandal, a brazen financial scam that saw some of the biggest banks on Wall Street illegally manipulate international interest rates in order to boost their profits. By some estimates, the scheme cost cities and states around the country well over $6 billion. In June of 2015, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Barclays, among other Libor-rigging giants, pleaded guilty to felony charges related to the conspiracy and agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines to US regulators. But, for Brandt, that wasn’t enough. He wanted the banks banished, blocked from doing business in his city. “I was totally pissed about it,” he says. “It was straight-up fraud.” So, in a small act of stick-it-to-the-man defiance, Brandt drafted a resolution that barred the municipality from working with any firm that had either committed a felony or had recently paid more than $150 million in fines. He presented the homespun and eminently reasonable legislation to city officials and urged them to adopt it. “The city councilors said they couldn’t do it,” Brandt says. “If they did, they wouldn’t have a bank left to work with. They said there wouldn’t be any bank big enough to take the city’s deposits.” Oakland, it seemed, was hopelessly dependent on ethically dubious and occasionally criminal financial titans. Brandt, however, was undeterred. After the City Council turned him down, he started looking for other ways to wean Oakland off Wall Street. That’s when he fell in with a group of locals who have been nursing an audacious idea. They want their city to take radical action to combat plutocracy, inequality, and financial dislocation. They want their city to do something that hasn’t been done in this country in nearly a century, not since the trust-busting days of the Progressive Era. They want their city to create a bank—and, strange as the idea may seem, it’s not some utopian scheme. It’s a cause that’s catching on. Across the country, community activists, mayors, city council members, and more are waking up to the power and the promise of public banks. Such banks are established and controlled by cities or states, rather than private interests. They collect deposits from government entities—from school districts, from city tax receipts, from state infrastructure funds—and use that money to issue loans and support public priorities. They are led by independent professionals but accountable to elected officials. Public banks are a way, supporters say, to build local wealth and resist the market’s predatory predilections. They are a way to end municipal reliance on Wall Street institutions, with their high fees, their scandal-ridden track records, and their vile investments in private prisons and pipelines. They are a way, at long last, to manage money in the public interest.

Since 2011, advocates from a national nonprofit called the Public Banking Institute have traveled across the country, preaching the practical benefits of public banking and recruiting or training activists and organizers to take up the cause. They have found willing and enthusiastic supporters from coast to coast. The movement has been embraced in Philadelphia, where the city council held hearings on the idea last year. It’s been championed in Seattle and San Francisco, where a number of city supervisors are calling for a task force to study public banking. It’s taken root in Santa Fe, with backing from the mayor, and in Oregon, Vermont, and even New Jersey, where a leading Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Phil Murphy, has proclaimed his desire to create a state bank right next door to the financial capital of the world. “I believe this is the wave of the future,” says Craig Brandt, who is now a leader of Friends of the Public Bank of Oakland, the group advocating for public banking in the city. “And I hope Oakland will be the first one out the door to do it.” The city is well on its way. Last November, the Oakland City Council passed a resolution announcing their intention to explore the creation of a public bank. In February, elected officials and community activists gathered at City Hall for a packed forum on the benefits of a public bank, including the possibility that it could hold deposits from the state’s multibillion-dollar cannabis industry and help promote affordable-housing development. This summer, meanwhile, the council will likely vote on whether to dedicate as much as $100,000 to fund a feasibility study that will explore the technical requirements of creating an independent publicly owned financial institution in Oakland. “The fundamental point is to have a bank whose purpose is to be responsive to community needs.” —Rebecca Kaplan “The fundamental point is to have a bank whose purpose is to be responsive to community needs,” says Oakland Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, a key backer of the local public-banking movement. “This would allow us to save money compared to traditional corporate bank rates, and it would allow us to fund vital projects based on community need rather than having those decisions driven by the profit motive.” She says the City is also interested in the possibility of creating a regional public bank by partnering with neighboring cities like Berkeley and Richmond, California.

Even today many public institutions, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the Small Business Administration to the Federal Housing administration, are essential components of America’s banking system. But there’s only one true public bank in this country and it’s not in Washington or New York or some coastal liberal enclave. It’s in North Dakota, where it has survived and thrived for nearly a century. First established in 1919 by populist state legislators eager to extend credit to cash-strapped farmers and ranchers, the state-owned Bank of North Dakota (BND) is now a modern and multifaceted financial juggernaut. The bank holds deposits from government agencies. It provides low-cost credit for school construction and municipal infrastructure projects. It refinances student debt at reduced interest rates. Rather than opening branches of its own, it generously partners with local community banks and credit unions tos issue small-business, home, and agricultural loans. Best of all, it funnels its profits back into state coffers whenever North Dakota has budget troubles. The bank is, in other words, essentially socialist. It’s also a steady source of profit. Last year, according to its annual report, the Bank of North Dakota saw its 13th consecutive year of record profits, taking in more than $136 million in income while growing its loan portfolio by $449 million dollars. And, unlike some of its counterparts, the bank accomplished all that without opening fraudulent accounts or manipulating interest rates or otherwise scamming consumers. The bank’s success—its long track-record of supporting and stabilizing local economies, sharing the wealth, and minting a profit to boot—has turned it into an intriguing model for cities around the country that are keen to find creative fixes for their ongoing financial woes. “Public banking is finding its time now because municipal executives have very poor choices,” says Walt McRee, the chair of the Public Banking Institute. “As things deteriorate and have to be fixed, as population grows but jobs decline, as tax receipts dry up, cities can either can cut services, raise taxes, fire people, or privatize things. But those trends are enormously destructive.” “The prospect of a public bank does something entirely different,” he continues. “It gives a community the ability to liquefy its own assets and lend itself money, to do things it needs to do with money it already has, to hold on to people’s capital instead of sending it to Wall Street.” Consider municipal bonds. Cities regularly go to the municipal-bond market to raise money for big projects, from school construction to bridge building to park development and more. These bonds, however, come with overhead costs in the form of fees that normally hover around 1 percent, but can climb as high as 10 percent, of the bond’s principal value. A recent report by the University of California Berkeley’s Haas Institute estimates that cities and other public entities pay upward of $4 billion a year in such fees, an enormous sum that serves only to fatten the purses of multinational banks, legal firms, and others involved in the bond-issuance business. A public bank could help reduce these costs and free up funds by enabling a city to deposit its money in a public entity instead of a profit-centric institution like Wells Fargo or JPMorgan Chase. The city would then be able to borrow money from its own bank rather than turning to the Wall Street bond market, with its overhead costs and market-set interest rates. It could, in short, introduce a radical alternative into the realm of municipal finance. One of the other places where this radical alternative has taken root, surpassing even Bay Area efforts, is Santa Fe, New Mexico. The movement in that city of 67,000 started gathering momentum in 2014, when a small but determined group called Banking on New Mexico held a symposium to promote the idea. More then three hundred people showed up, including the newly elected progressive mayor, Javier Gonzales. “A group of advocates met with me early in my term,” says Gonzales. “I was really intrigued and excited about an opportunity to explore a different way to have fiscal relationships.” In early 2015, Santa Fe commissioned a private consultant, in partnership with New Mexico State University, to conduct a feasibility study into public banking. A year later, in January 2016, the report came back and the news was positive: By funding the city’s capital needs and improving municipal cash management, among other functions, a public bank could generate more than $24 million in savings and earnings for Santa Fe over a seven-year period. And such a bank would be particularly effective, says Katie Updike, the consultant who authored the study, if it serviced the city as well as the surrounding county and school district. “In the case of Santa Fe, where I saw the biggest benefit is if the city, county, and school district worked together,” she says. “When you begin to step out of the jurisdiction of the city and look at the county and the school district too, which are separate entities, all their cash could be pooled and used to fund projects and then it began to get more interesting.” In late April of this year, based on the results of the feasibility study, Santa Fe’s city council announced that it was creating a nine-person task force to spend six months digging deeper into the legal and financial prerequisites of establishing a public bank. The task force will focus, above all, on developing a governance structure for the bank. “Governance is a concern for a lot of people,” says Elaine Sullivan, a leader of Banking on New Mexico and a passionate promoter of the cause. “People don’t want the bank run by political officials, and it wouldn’t be. There would be a clear distinction between the public bank, which would be managed by public bankers, and the city of Santa Fe.” Indeed, the prospect of political interference into a public bank is one of the most common critiques of the idea. If public banks are to succeed in cities around the country, say skeptics and supporters alike, they must to be firmly insulated from the whims of legislative bodies and elected officials. Across the country, activists, mayors, and city council members are waking up to the promise of public banks. Here, once again, the Bank of North Dakota offers a model. While overseen by a commission of elected officials, including the state’s governor and attorney general, BND is managed on a day-to-day basis by an independent and highly transparent executive committee of professional financial managers. Its operations are also subject to regular inspection by independent auditors. BND, moreover, maintains public goodwill by declining to compete with local banks. It has no retail locations or ATMs. Rather, it partners with community banks and credit unions to provide its services. By putting similar structure in place and starting small, Sullivan believes a public bank in Santa Fe could someday be a smash hit. It wouldn’t just provide ample economic benefits to the city but would serve a larger purpose too. “As the global banks and major corporations that don’t have a moral tether have become more and more powerful, communities have become weaker and weaker and more passive,” she says. “A public bank is about addressing plutocracy. It is about restoring hope.” A public bank, she asserts, would be a red-hot engine of local economic democracy. This essential fact, more than anything else, explains why the public-banking movement is blossoming in a post-recession, too-big-to-fail America where Donald Trump rules the White House and Wall Street rules Washington. “We are seeing a resurgence of community-oriented life and activism and vision in this imperial era,” says Councilmember Kaplan of Oakland. “And it has strengthened the movement.” 5 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Jimmy Tobias Jimmy Tobias is a contributor to The Nation, where he writes for the Cities Rising series and also covers conservation and environmental justice.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close Richard Drew In this May 9, 2012 file photo, a consumer makes a credit card purchase at a store.  (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Credit cards give investors jitters, but bankers sleep fine By Jenny Surane • Bloomberg 15 hrs ago (…) In this May 9, 2012 file photo, a consumer makes a credit card purchase at a store.  (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Richard Drew For Kevin St. Pierre, the math on credit cards is pretty simple. "Generally, if the consumer has income, they pay their debts," St. Pierre, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note to clients last week. "Consumer credit losses are driven predominantly by unemployment." With investors skittish over the potential for higher defaults on auto and student loans, St. Pierre is one of many industry analysts and banking executives who've sought to allay similar concerns over rising credit-card write-offs. Card balances eclipsed $1 trillion in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, Federal Reserve data show. Card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp., Citigroup Inc., Synchrony Financial and Discover Financial Services all reported higher card write-offs in the first quarter. Still, executives and analysts see one data point as key to the health of the credit-card industry: jobs. U.S. unemployment is near an all-time low, and as long as it stays there, consumers should be able to handle their card debt. "We're not losing any sleep that we can't manage the credit situation we're confronted with right now," Discover Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf told analysts in April. "While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards." Six of the biggest U.S. card lenders — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, American Express, Capital One and Discover — reported that loans at least 30 days overdue, a harbinger of future write-offs, fell in April. Synchrony, signaling confidence in its own prospects, announced a dividend increase and new $1.6 billion stock repurchase program last week. Shares of the private-label card issuer have tumbled 26 percent this year, the worst performance in the S&P 500 Financials Index. Total U.S. credit-card loans have climbed every year since 2008, when the jobless rate approached 10 percent, forcing issuers to write off more than $100 billion in loans over the next two years. Recently, much of the growth has come from banks extending credit to borrowers with lower credit scores, causing write-offs to revert toward historical norms.

"That's just the nature of growth. These are still profitable customers. But that growth has come back and it's creating a more normal-looking complexion in the portfolio." For others, including Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Jason Harbes, looser underwriting standards is cause for worry. He downgraded the credit-card sector, noting in a May 19 report for clients that "credit quality has visibly worsened over the past two quarters." The recent increase in defaults is reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when write-offs and loan balances rose despite a sustained decline in the unemployment rate, Harbes said. In addition to jobs numbers, analysts track the percentage of household income that consumers spend on debt. That figure dropped to 9.98 percent in 2016, the lowest since 2012, Fed data show. "We watch a lot of different things and are always worried that there will be some sort of inflection point," said Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. "But we don't think we've seen an inflection point here in credit quality." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Bernstein, said in a note to clients last week. “Consumer credit losses are driven predominantly by unemployment.” With investors skittish over the potential for higher defaults on auto and student loans, St. Pierre is one of many industry analysts and banking executives who’ve sought to allay similar concerns over rising credit-card write-offs. Card balances eclipsed $1 trillion in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, Federal Reserve data show. Card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp., Citigroup Inc., Synchrony Financial and Discover Financial Services all reported higher card write-offs in the first quarter. Still, executives and analysts see one data point as key to the health of the credit-card industry: jobs. U.S. unemployment is near an all-time low, and as long as it stays there, consumers should be able to handle their card debt. “We’re not losing any sleep that we can’t manage the credit situation we’re confronted with right now,” Discover Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf told analysts in April. “While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards.” Six of the biggest U.S. card lenders -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup, American Express Co., Capital One and Discover -- reported that loans at least 30 days overdue, a harbinger of future write-offs, fell in April. Synchrony, signaling confidence in its own prospects, announced a dividend increase and new $1.6 billion stock repurchase program last week. Shares of the private-label card issuer have tumbled 26 percent this year, the worst performance in the S&P 500 Financials Index. Total U.S. credit-card loans have climbed every year since 2008, when the jobless rate approached 10 percent, forcing issuers to write off more than $100 billion in loans over the next two years. Recently, much of the growth has come from banks extending credit to borrowers with lower credit scores, causing write-offs to revert toward historical norms. “You’re now introducing a broader set of individuals to your portfolio that are likely more adverse,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst. “That’s just the nature of growth. These are still profitable customers. But that growth has come back and it’s creating a more normal-looking complexion in the portfolio.” For others, including Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Jason Harbes, looser underwriting standards is cause for worry. He downgraded the credit-card sector, noting in a May 19 report for clients that “credit quality has visibly worsened over the past two quarters.” The recent increase in defaults is reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when write-offs and loan balances rose despite a sustained decline in the unemployment rate, Harbes said. In addition to jobs numbers, analysts track the percentage of household income that consumers spend on debt. That figure dropped to 9.98 percent in 2016, the lowest since 2012, Fed data show. “We watch a lot of different things and are always worried that there will be some sort of inflection point,” said Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners. “But we don’t think we’ve seen an inflection point here in credit quality.” (Updates share price in seventh paragraph.

Bernstein, said in a note to clients last week. “Consumer credit losses are driven predominantly by unemployment.” With investors skittish over the potential for higher defaults on auto and student loans, St. Pierre is one of many industry analysts and banking executives who’ve sought to allay similar concerns over rising credit-card write-offs. IMAGE: Getty Images Card balances eclipsed $1 trillion in February, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, Federal Reserve data show. Card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp., Citigroup Inc., Synchrony Financial and Discover Financial Services all reported higher card write-offs in the first quarter. Still, executives and analysts see one data point as key to the health of the credit-card industry: jobs. U.S. unemployment is near an all-time low, and as long as it stays there, consumers should be able to handle their card debt. “We’re not losing any sleep that we can’t manage the credit situation we’re confronted with right now,” Discover Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf told analysts in April. “While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards.” Six of the biggest U.S. card lenders — JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup, American Express Co., Capital One and Discover — reported that loans at least 30 days overdue, a harbinger of future write-offs, fell in April. Synchrony, signaling confidence in its own prospects, announced a dividend increase and new $1.6 billion stock repurchase program last week. Shares of the private-label card issuer tumbled 26 percent this year, the worst performance in the S&P 500 Financials Index. Total U.S. credit-card loans have climbed every year since 2008, when the jobless rate approached 10 percent, forcing issuers to write off more than $100 billion in loans over the next two years. Recently, much of the growth has come from banks extending credit to borrowers with lower credit scores, causing write-offs to revert toward historical norms. “You’re now introducing a broader set of individuals to your portfolio that are likely more adverse,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst. “That’s just the nature of growth. These are still profitable customers. But that growth has come back and it’s creating a more normal-looking complexion in the portfolio.” For others, including Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Jason Harbes, looser underwriting standards is cause for worry. He downgraded the credit-card sector, noting in a May 19 report for clients that “credit quality has visibly worsened over the past two quarters.” The recent increase in defaults is reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when write-offs and loan balances rose despite a sustained decline in the unemployment rate, Harbes said. In addition to jobs numbers, analysts track the percentage of household income that consumers spend on debt. That figure dropped to 9.98 percent in 2016, the lowest since 2012, Fed data show. “We watch a lot of different things and are always worried that there will be some sort of inflection point,” said Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners. “But we don’t think we’ve seen an inflection point here in credit quality.” Bloomberg News Comments Login or Subscribe Get us in your inbox Sign up for Payments Update CardLine Compliance Investment Merchant Technology Wallet Morning Briefing PayThink ISO & Agent Weekly Sign Up Subscribe Like what you see?

Elizabeth Balboa Benzinga May 21, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The decades-long story of Bernie Madoff begins in the dark corners of a Wall Street office and ends on Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX)’s HBO. Barry Levinson’s “The Wizard Of Lies,” based on a book by Diana Henriques, debuted Saturday and gave a glimpse into the non-financial impact of Madoff’s infamous scam. The Backstory In December 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Madoff for securities fraud committed through his 50-year-old investment securities firm. In the following months, he confessed to having run the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history, pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and was sentenced to 150 years in federal prison. By some estimates, Madoff robbed his clients of about $17 billion, but others calculate losses near $65 billion. And those were just financial damages. Madoff’s son committed suicide on the second anniversary of his arrest. His wife, "embarrased and ashamed," cut all contact with him. His younger brother, Peter, earned a 10-year sentence for crimes related to the scandal. And a number of other entities got mixed up in the case, from the hard-hit New York Mets to Madoff’s bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), which was investigated in 2013 for involvement in the fraud and paid $2.6 billion in 2014 to settle Madoff-related cases. “The Wizard of Lies” reflects on the diverse repercussions of the crime and the mentality of a person capable of orchestrating it. The Critical Voice The film earned a 65 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 67. Here are some highlights from the mixed but positive-leaning reviews. “While the movie spends comparatively little time on the thousands of people Madoff defrauded (acknowledging them in a couple of brief but intense montages), it conveys the severity of his crimes in the devastation of his immediate family, showing how he did lasting damage to the people he loved most, and none of them ever understood why.” — Josh Bell, Las Vegas Weekly “The Wizard of Lies is less convincingly about Bernie Madoff than it is about the struggle to understand Bernie Madoff: The search for why and how, by his family and his victims and the system, maybe even the man himself.” — Darren Franich, Entertainment Weekly “We may be wrong to look for scapegoats for the 2008 global financial crisis, but by normalizing Madoff's behavior, The Wizard of Lies thoughtlessly asks us to sympathize with a devil we don't want to know.” — Simon Abrams, The Guardian “The Wizard of Lies... doesn't try to either understand or humanize Madoff, but all the same it manages to be an intimate, unsettling portrait of a borderline sociopath.” — David Sims, The Atlantic Related Link: ‘Betting On Zero,’ Bill Ackman’s Anti-Herbalife Film, Rated 100% On Rotten Tomatoes Bernie Madoff Shows The Importance Of Understanding The Economic Moat Of An Investment Bernie Madoff Proves The Value Of Dividend Stocks See more from Benzinga David Einhorn's Letter To Greenlight Investors Reveals New Perrigo Position Windows Solitaire Makes Surprise Appearance In Video Game Hall Of Fame Finals © 2017 Benzinga.com.

By Amey Stone May 22, 2017 9:30 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The week ahead includes a lot of economic data as well as minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, an official analysis of costs of the Republican health care bill and the release of President Trump's budget. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, sums up the week's economic news: On the economic front, data on New and Existing Home Sales and the FHFA HPI index should show a generally healthy housing market, but one which may have reached a new steady-state, with little potential to boost economic growth from here. Durable Goods Orders should look weak for the month of April, reflecting lower aircraft bookings, while GDP revisions on Friday should continue to show weakness in the first quarter. Meanwhile, Unemployment Claims, due out on Thursday, could continue to show one of the tightest labor markets in decades. Finally, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from their last meeting which should confirm their general determination to raise rates given steady economic growth and a tightening labor market. Overall, the American economy is in a very good place but the potential for fast growth from here remains low. As far as public policy goes, the Federal budget release may overshadow The Trump administration's Russia-related woes. The Office of Management and Budget releases a more detailed budget on Tuesday that is expected to be technically balanced, but contain aggressive economic growth targets and reams of spending cuts that are unlikely to fly. Wednesday the same office releases cost estimates for the health care bill. Kelly sums up: In short, this will likely be a week of political heat on the President’s agenda, but at the end of it investors will probably be no closer to the cuts in corporate taxes and investment income taxes that could enhance the value of stocks.

Indices from the Investment Property Databank - the first Portuguese results produced by the IPD - reveal that bonds also performed well on +10%, up four points on 2001. Cash returns deteriorated slightly to reach 2.8 % and equities had another poor year with returns of -26%. But Portuguese property proved one of the most resilient markets in Europe in 2002. “However, this was below the 2001 return due to slower capital growth and lower income returns,” said IPD. “Rising vacancy rates affected most sectors of the market, resulting in income returns of 7.5% - the lowest in the last three years.” Retails were by far the strongest sector, followed by residential and other properties, while offices continued to lag behind. A recent study by JPMorgan Fleming showed that real estate continues to be the most popular asset class among investors, with a total of 70% of European institutions, including pension funds, currently making commitments. The survey polled some 341 institutional investors across the UK and Continental Europe, representing over e1trn in assets. The results were seen as broader drive towards alternative investments. Peter Schwicht, head of European institutional business, JPMorgan Fleming, said: “The lower correlation suggests that they [investors] will invest more into alternative assets, and that alternative assets are becoming a ‘standard’ instrument.” Asked if European pension funds were more receptive to alternative investments compared with their UK counterparts, Schwicht added: “It is fair to say that some of the more sophisticated institutions have been embracing this concept quite thoroughly.” Related articles Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Investigate 'arrogant and abusive' TPR and privatise PPF, says paper College of Law Pension and Assurance enters fourth buy-in PMI hires learning director to review qualifications and education strategy IA advisory board member takes aim at trade body's transparency plans Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Portugal Latest stories Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Over half of pension professionals believe the 'gilts plus' valuation method is unhelpful in the current economic environment, according to Aon Hewitt research.

"They like the direction, and now they are waiting for the results." The businessman in chief rode into office amid high hopes that he could reinvigorate the economy. Now, four months in, business leaders are giving President Trump and the Republican Congress high marks for heading in the right direction on policies that could help companies of all sizes prosper. The Washington Examiner checked in with representatives of the city's top business lobbies across eight economic sectors, from agriculture to retail. These leaders represent the engines of the American economy, and although their interests sometimes differ, they all seem upbeat about what they have seen so far. They like the pro-business tone. They appreciate the smackdown of Obama-era regulations. And though it is still early, they are waiting hopefully for bigger, broader successes in Congress that would keep up momentum. "Small-business owners are cautiously optimistic," said Jack Mozloom, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, in an assessment that is representative of the industries surveyed. "They like the direction, and now they are waiting for the results." That optimism is reflected among investors, who have sent stock indexes to record highs this month. There's plenty to like in the Trump economy, some of which is a holdover from the Obama years. Consumer and business confidence is high, jobs are being added at a steady clip and unemployment hit a 10-year low in April. But there are warning signs, too. Economic growth is sluggish, retail chains are filing for bankruptcy at a near-record pace and rising interest rates could slow business expansion and consumer spending. With no major legislation emerging from Congress, business leaders have cheered smaller steps that have undone some of the more aggressive executive interpretations of laws. Some of those came about through executive orders, but other rules were voided by Congress, then signed by Trump under the Congressional Review Act. Many sound minor or failed to crack through the constant news coverage of Russia, intelligence leaks and presidential tweets. One is the executive order revisiting an expanded definition of what constitutes bodies of water that can be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Yet several business leaders cited that re-examination of the "Waters of the U.S." rule as emblematic of the new approach. "The biggest change for us has been the sea change in the attitude of the regulatory machine," said Stephen Sandherr, CEO of Associated General Contractors of America, which represents 26,000 construction companies. "We are now playing offense rather than defense." Many are eyeing upcoming legislative battles, especially tax reform. But they are also watching what happens with healthcare and any revisions to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Here are the eight industries, summaries of how they are faring in the economy, and a look at the major federal policies they find important: AGRICULTURE Status: Farm income is expected to drop for the fourth straight year in 2017 as farmers struggle with low prices for crops. Review: Trade has been an early flashpoint for farmers. Withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trump's recent talk of quitting the North American Free Trade Agreement has some worrying about export markets for American crops. But life on the farm is made easier by rolling back onerous regulations and ensuring consistent and commonsense enforcement. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, with a background in veterinary medicine and agribusiness, is seen as a strong choice who understands the effects of regulations on farmers. Outlook: The farm lobby is hopeful that tax reform will include elimination of the estate tax, which helps farmers leave property to their heirs. It also wants Congress to continue allowing interest deductions, as farming is capital-intensive. Farmers are hoping for further regulatory reprieves and need ways to solve a worker shortage. They're also looking to build support for another farm bill. Quote: Working with the government is like farming. "We're getting the fields ready and the seeds in the ground. Now we're in the season where we hope Mother Nature cooperates and there aren't too many x factors popping up to spoil the crop." — Dale Moore, executive director, public policy, American Farm Bureau. BANKING Status: Rising interest rates are good news for banks, and bank stocks are up big since the election because of hopes for regulatory relief. Profits were up in the first quarter for most big banks, such as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, though many financial stocks have leveled off lately. Review: The banking industry welcomed a pair of executive orders: one delaying the so-called "fiduciary rule," an Obama labor department regulation that would hold investment advisers to high legal standards but could lead to more lawsuits and another directing a review of financial regulations that hinder economic growth while providing little benefit. Bankers also liked the appointment of Goldman Sachs alumni Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and Gary Cohn as Trump's chief economic adviser. Outlook: Banks are hoping for an overhaul of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, an effort that received a boost when Trump called the law "a disaster" in February and vowed to cut a lot of its regulations. They would like to see less-burdensome capital and liquidity standards and more transparent rules regarding "stress tests," among other changes. Quote: "President Trump's early executive actions are a welcome set of initial moves in the direction of reducing regulatory overreach, duplication and overgrowth. The hard work of getting into the details remains." — Wayne Abernathy and Shaun Kern, American Bankers Association, writing in ABA Banking Journal. CONSTRUCTION Status: Construction added 94,000 jobs (+1.4 percent) in 2017, and spending on residential and commercial construction is up, while spending on public projects such as roads is flat. Most firms are small, family-owned enterprises, but there are big players, too, such as Bechtel Corp. and Fluor Corp. Review: Contractors are heartened by some quick moves by Trump and Congress to roll back Obama-era regulations they found burdensome. Using the Congressional Review Act, Congress and Trump overturned the so-called "blacklisting rule" that required companies bidding on government jobs to report accusations of labor violations. They also repealed a rule giving the Occupational Safety and Health Administration more time to cite companies for recordkeeping infractions. Not having to fight multifront battles on expansive new regulations is a welcome change. Outlook: Contractors would like to see other regulations repealed as well, but focus should turn soon to pushing for increased infrastructure spending, a key Trump campaign promise that could have rare bipartisan appeal. They also favor pro-growth tax reform and support tax rates that create parity between large corporations and small businesses. Quote: "Generally, the attitude and outlook is one of relief for not having to deal with additional costly and burdensome regulations. That is a major attitudinal change for our members." — Stephen Sandherr, The Associated General Contractors of America. ENERGY Status: The success of the energy sector tends to fluctuate with the price of oil, which is down slightly in the first few months of the year but still 50 percent higher than a year ago. Exxon Mobil's profits doubled in the first quarter, and utility companies such as Duke Energy saw revenues rise. Review: Quick work by the new Trump administration to clear the way for the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline helped set the tone that the administration is friendly to energy. The industry counted five executive orders, six memorandums and four Congressional Review Act resolutions that supported U.S. energy development in the first 100 days. Outlook: In addition to the focus on beating back restrictive regulations, the energy industry is closely eyeing tax reform, especially provisions related to the treatment of overseas earnings and the continued support of investment incentives. Quote: "We are heartened by the president's emphasis on right-sizing America's energy policy to encourage responsible domestic energy development that creates well-paying American jobs and helps to lower costs for consumers." — Jack Gerard, CEO, American Petroleum Institute. MANUFACTURING Status: Factory output is high, and historic job losses have stabilized, with manufacturing employment up 41,000 jobs in 2017. Not all factory jobs will return, but high-tech plants with skilled workers have the best shot. Some big manufacturers such as General Motors Co. and Carrier Corp. have announced hundreds of new jobs, for which Trump has claimed credit. Manufacturers' optimism is at a 20-year high. Review: Manufacturers are heartened by Trump's promise of a "great revival" in U.S. manufacturing. Trump has met several times with manufacturing executives and signed a pair of executive orders in March aiming to end unfair trade practices. Outlook: Manufacturers are closely watching tax reform and infrastructure efforts in Congress, and they are pushing for worker training to address shortages of labor in skilled jobs as well as reductions of onerous regulations. They continue to be hopeful that the reality will match the rhetoric. Quote: "In his first 100 days, President Trump has kept his promise to manufacturers in the United States in historic ways. … He has paved the way to reduce the job-crushing regulatory burden in America unlike any previous president. And his bold actions to promote investment and create jobs are lifting more Americans up and restoring confidence to those who have felt left behind." — Jay Timmons, CEO of National Association of Manufacturers, in a news release. REAL ESTATE Status: Just a few months into 2017, most of the major housing indicators — sales of new and existing homes and housing starts — are near post-recession highs. It's not a housing bubble, but houses are being built and are selling, and prices are rising. Big builders such as Toll Brothers and KB Home report strong sales. Review: With many of the key executive-branch offices related to housing still unfilled, the real estate industry is focusing most of its attention on Capitol Hill. Outlook: High on the agenda is ensuring that the forthcoming tax reform bill retains incentives that encourage home ownership and, in turn, stronger communities. That means keeping the deduction for mortgage interest and ensuring that other changes don't dilute that advantage. The industry also wants to hang onto like-kind exchanges that allow real estate investors to defer capital gains taxes. Those could both be on the chopping block. Can Trump's real estate background help save them? Quote: "Realtors are optimistic about the possibility for reform on our key issues. It's clear from the first few months of this administration that they have an understanding of what's at stake and a strong desire to knock down some of the regulatory hurdles we've highlighted for years. That's a good thing, but of course change in Washington doesn't happen overnight." — William E. Brown, president, National Association of Realtors. RETAIL Status: Consumer confidence is at a 10-year high, and solid retail sales numbers to start 2017 are helpful for the retail sector. At least nine big chains such as The Limited and RadioShack have filed for bankruptcy protection, as some struggle with the surge toward online sales, benefiting online retailers such as Amazon.com. Review: Retailers are generally encouraged by what they have seen so far out of Washington. Retail companies often manage international supply chains, so they were disappointed with the early withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement. Since then, though, there has been steady momentum on some of the issues important to retailers, such as reducing expensive healthcare mandates and moving forward on pro-growth tax reform. Outlook: Retailers still have plenty of questions on issues important to them. They are carefully watching Dodd-Frank regulatory reform, because of proposals to repeal regulations on debit card swipe fees charged by banks, which could result in higher fees paid by merchants (and consumers). They are also waiting to see if the Trump administration and recently confirmed Labor Secretary Alex Acosta will roll back Obama labor regulations that require more retail employees to be eligible for overtime pay. Quote: "President Trump is intentionally disruptive. Some of that disruption causes unease. I encourage our members not to focus so much on the disruption but to keep their eyes on the long-term goal: If the Trump administration can achieve growth in the economy and a less burdensome regulatory agenda, our members will be very pleased." — David French, National Retail Federation. SMALL BUSINESS Status: Surveys show that small-business owners' optimism is riding high, with many saying they foresee higher sales and the need to expand. About two-thirds say there's never been a better time to own a small business, according to a February survey by USA Today and Allstate. Review: The cost of complying with federal regulations hits small businesses hard, so recent moves to repeal or pause burdensome Obama-era rules have come as welcome relief. Small businesses gave a thumbs-up to executive orders halting crackdowns on coal-generated electricity, which should keep energy costs low, and they cheered the order requiring two regulations be eliminated for every new regulation. Outlook: Small businesses are hopeful that the rollback of harmful regulations continues, including a 2016 Labor Department rule requiring companies to expand which workers are eligible for overtime pay. They also like what they see so far on efforts to rewrite the tax code to make it fairer for small-business owners. And they are optimistic that Congress can agree on a plan that lowers healthcare costs. Quote: "According to surveys of our members, our three biggest areas of concern have always been taxes, regulations and the cost of healthcare. On every one of those fronts, the administration has done something positive." — Jack Mozloom, media communications director, National Federation of Independent Business.

State Street did not reapply for its position on the panel. State Street has come under scrutiny since it was revealed last week the firm had been forced to reimburse a client for a transition management trade after an internal investigation found the client had been double charged on fees. (Global Pensions; 13 October, 2011) The PPF said a larger panel would offer flexibility as pension scheme assets are transferred over - and noted the new panel would allow it to make structural portfolio and manager changes when required. Last year, the PPF transitioned £1.5bn worth of assets from schemes it absorbed.

The Banco del Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social also plans this year to start issuing personal credit cards and begin offering tax-deferred retirement savings plans, Omar Serrano, the representative for workers on the BIESS's board of directors, said in an interview. The BIESS will cut holdings of government bonds 10% points to 45% of its portfolio, or $3.79bn, by the end of 2011, he said. The fund, which manages about $6.92bn for the nation's Social Security Institute and plans to have $8.39bn in assets by the beginning of next year, is seeking to make it easier for companies to borrow by offering lower rates with longer terms in a bid to spur growth in South America's seventh-biggest economy, Serrano said.

"We want a much more diversified portfolio." Government bonds yield about 1 percentage point less than comparable corporate debt and are less transparent, Serrano said. The return on government debt is between 6.5% and 7% while corporate bonds pay about 8%, he said. Ecuadorean government debt is the second-riskiest after Venezuela's among 15 emerging markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to the bank's EMBI+ indexes. The BIESS, which will increase loans to companies by about 7.4% to $627m this year, is also interested in partnering with foreign companies in local projects to increase investment guarantees and confidence in the country, Serrano said. The yield on Ecuador's 9.375% bonds maturing in 2015 was unchanged at 10.2% at 2:36 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The bond's price was unchanged at 97 cents on the dollar. The extra yield investors demand to hold Ecuadorean dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.89%, according to JPMorgan's EMBI+ index. Ecuador's spread has narrowed 1.25 percentage points this year, compared with a 0.22 percentage point increase for the index.

Dan Morris, global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the market's initial reaction - equities, commodities and euro rising, while government debt fell - was "quite positive. Key to this reaction has been the management of expectations by the eurozone's leaders. They were aware of the need to stick to the goals already set out while acknowledging that all the details would not be finalised for this summit. "Eyes will now turn to the next summit in early November, but as long as there is continued progress towards these objectives, investors should go on signalling their approval." Related articles Gilts plus 'unhelpful' in current climate, survey says Investigate 'arrogant and abusive' TPR and privatise PPF, says paper College of Law Pension and Assurance enters fourth buy-in PMI hires learning director to review qualifications and education strategy IA advisory board member takes aim at trade body's transparency plans Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officier for equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment said eyes would turn immediately to Rome. "The eye of the storm will now move to Rome and its fragile government. I don't think yields on Italian debt will fall on the back of this agreement for long." He said if the rescue fund was not on a sound equity base, saying it would be leveraged many-fold was just "a heroic piece of financial alchemy. "It's effectively an insurance company selling protection against its own default. You can understand why the insurance company would want to sell it, but it is yet to be seen whether the Chinese would want to underwrite it." "The path of equities will therefore require better news elsewhere. Earnings growth in the US continues to surprise on the upside and we may be approaching a policy shift in China. The catalyst for higher equity values lies outside Europe rather than within." He said the deal announced by leaders after 4am this morning was "not the game changer. Italy's 120% debt-to-GDP doesn't look any more sustainable today than yesterday. Europe is destined for a multi-year workout during where economic growth will be very restrained and equities will remain cheap." Recapitalising banks was "a step in the right direction," in Rossi's view, and the 50% write-down on Greek debt they will suffer was "an important step forward". Rossi added that giving banks to June to raise their cash buffer ratios to 9% "allows them to sell assets rather than just go directly to public markets, which would prove difficult. The sanctions on bank dividends and bonuses should ensure this gets done. "The €106bn in fresh capital will ensure a new minimum of 9% Tier 1 capital ratio for euro area banks. I believe that stronger banks will strive to be well above this level. The impact on growth in the short-term will be a negative as the deleveraging process continues, but a better capitalised banking system has got to be good in the long-term." Clear Currency's Peter O'Flanagan said: "There seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel for the indebted eurozone." But he added: "For now the euro has rallied, and risk-correlated assets are on the rise, but this may be short-lived as the reality of the size of the task in front of the eurozone sets in." Today markets will be gauging their own reaction to the package, but also eurozone confidence data due out this morning, then US GDP figures this afternoon.   This article originally ran in Investment Europe.

As part of the firm’s more than $325 million global investment in skills development, this nationwide effort will help equip young people with the skills and experiences they need to succeed and bridge the gap between the demand for summer jobs and the number of available positions. This summer, $3 million of the $17 million investment in Summer Youth Employment Programs (SYEPs) will go to organizations in 19 U.S. cities that provide training and work experiences for young people. The cities include Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Dallas, TX; Plano, TX; Detroit, MI; Indianapolis, IN; Louisville, KY; Milwaukee, WI; St. Louis, MO; Boston, MA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Jersey City, NJ; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; Sacramento, CA; San Francisco, CA; and Seattle, WA. “It’s a moral and economic crisis that too many young people graduate high school without clear pathways to good jobs,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “We must make it a national priority to provide youth with the skills they need to succeed, and this starts by providing them with meaningful summer work. Our Summer Youth Employment Program does just that by exposing more students to jobs that teach them the skills they need to find careers in growing industries later on.” By 2025, 65 percent of jobs in the United States will require some postsecondary education, training or credential – up from 28% of jobs in the 1970s. These heightened expectations will require young people to gain work experience and develop skills today to enable them to compete in the global workforce in the future. Demand Exceeds Opportunity However, demand for summer employment remains higher than the number of available job opportunities, according to a 2016 survey of 15 U.S. cities. The report, which is based on a survey of SYEPs that are supported by JPMorgan Chase, also reveals that the summer employment rate for teens across the U.S. has fallen to 34 percent, a near record low and a 20 percentage point drop since 1995. Despite the creation of more summer roles, only approximately 38 percent of teens and young adults looking for summer jobs were able to find positions through 18 summer employment programs in the 15 cities surveyed over the last two years. Working Together Towards a Solution As cities creatively weave together resources to address the broader youth employment crisis, they are designing skills-based SYEPs, focusing on career pathways and integrating them into local workforce planning. In addition to providing summer jobs for thousands of young people each year, this investment will support efforts to strengthen the summer youth employment field nationally by fostering learning, collaboration and innovation across U.S. cities. Below is a list of city programs receiving SYEP funding in 2016 or 2017. Chicago, IL (Chicago Public School Foundation; $300,000) Cleveland, OH (Youth Opportunities Unlimited; $150,000) Dallas, TX (Dallas Foundation A TX Nonprofit Corporation; $100,000/Education is Freedom Foundation; $75,000) Plano, TX (Plano Improvement Corporation; $50,000) Detroit, MI (City Connect Detroit; $500,000) Indianapolis, IN (Teenworks; $100,000) Louisville, KY (KentuckianaWorks Foundation, Inc.; $100,000) Milwaukee, WI (Greater Milwaukee Foundation, Inc.; $100,000) St. Louis, MO (St. Louis Community Foundation Incorporated; $150,000) Boston, MA (Boston Private Industry Council; $100,000) Fort Lauderdale, FL (Broward Education Foundation; $135,000) Jersey City, NJ (Jersey City Economic Development Corporation; $75,000) Miami, FL (Magnet Educational Choice Association; $125,000) New York, NY (Futures and Options, Inc.; $80,000/Fund for the City of NY; $100,000/PENCIL; $80,000) Newark, NJ (Newark Community Economic Development Corporation; $50,000) Philadelphia, PA (Philadelphia Youth Network, Inc.; $50,000) Sacramento, CA (Metro Chamber Foundation; $150,000) San Francisco, CA (United Way Bay Area; $300,000) Seattle, WA (Educurious Partners; $350,000) "Summer jobs for our teens represent so much more than just a paycheck," said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. "Summer jobs are about giving young people opportunities that can change their lives. I applaud JPMorgan Chase for investing in equipping our young leaders with the skills they will use throughout their careers." Over the last two years, JPMorgan Chase has dedicated $5 million to enhance skill-based and career-specific job opportunities through SYEP. This commitment, combined with other local support, created almost 50,000 summer jobs for teens in over 14 cities. The public and private sectors are working together to increase the number of summer job opportunities available to young people by taking existing workforce and economic development strategies and discovering innovative ways to create jobs. As new and innovative programs evolve, JPMorgan Chase is providing funding to bring these programs to scale. Sample tactics being used to expand skill-based and career-specific employment and training opportunities include expanding public and private sector partnerships by strengthening operating and communications systems; linking summer jobs to technical skills building, training and education, and year-round employment; prioritizing programs for special youth populations, including at-risk youth; connecting SYEPs to local workforce systems through new partnerships and organizational structures; and creating financial capability programs to help create economic security for these young employees.

The cities include Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Dallas, TX; Plano, TX; Detroit, MI; Indianapolis, IN; Louisville, KY; Milwaukee, WI; St. Louis, MO; Boston, MA; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Jersey City, NJ; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; Sacramento, CA; San Francisco, CA; and Seattle, WA. “It’s a moral and economic crisis that too many young people graduate high school without clear pathways to good jobs,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “We must make it a national priority to provide youth with the skills they need to succeed, and this starts by providing them with meaningful summer work. Our Summer Youth Employment Program does just that by exposing more students to jobs that teach them the skills they need to find careers in growing industries later on.” By 2025, 65 percent of jobs in the United States will require some postsecondary education, training or credential – up from 28% of jobs in the 1970s. These heightened expectations will require young people to gain work experience and develop skills today to enable them to compete in the global workforce in the future. Demand Exceeds Opportunity However, demand for summer employment remains higher than the number of available job opportunities, according to a 2016 survey of 15 U.S. cities. The report, which is based on a survey of SYEPs that are supported by JPMorgan Chase, also reveals that the summer employment rate for teens across the U.S. has fallen to 34 percent, a near record low and a 20 percentage point drop since 1995. Despite the creation of more summer roles, only approximately 38 percent of teens and young adults looking for summer jobs were able to find positions through 18 summer employment programs in the 15 cities surveyed over the last two years. Working Together Towards a Solution As cities creatively weave together resources to address the broader youth employment crisis, they are designing skills-based SYEPs, focusing on career pathways and integrating them into local workforce planning. In addition to providing summer jobs for thousands of young people each year, this investment will support efforts to strengthen the summer youth employment field nationally by fostering learning, collaboration and innovation across U.S. cities. Below is a list of city programs receiving SYEP funding in 2016 or 2017. Chicago, IL (Chicago Public School Foundation; $300,000) Cleveland, OH (Youth Opportunities Unlimited; $150,000) Dallas, TX (Dallas Foundation A TX Nonprofit Corporation; $100,000/Education is Freedom Foundation; $75,000) Plano, TX (Plano Improvement Corporation; $50,000) Detroit, MI (City Connect Detroit; $500,000) Indianapolis, IN (Teenworks; $100,000) Louisville, KY (KentuckianaWorks Foundation, Inc.; $100,000) Milwaukee, WI (Greater Milwaukee Foundation, Inc.; $100,000) St. Louis, MO (St. Louis Community Foundation Incorporated; $150,000) Boston, MA (Boston Private Industry Council; $100,000) Fort Lauderdale, FL (Broward Education Foundation; $135,000) Jersey City, NJ (Jersey City Economic Development Corporation; $75,000) Miami, FL (Magnet Educational Choice Association; $125,000) New York, NY (Futures and Options, Inc.; $80,000/Fund for the City of NY; $100,000/PENCIL; $80,000) Newark, NJ (Newark Community Economic Development Corporation; $50,000) Philadelphia, PA (Philadelphia Youth Network, Inc.; $50,000) Sacramento, CA (Metro Chamber Foundation; $150,000) San Francisco, CA (United Way Bay Area; $300,000) Seattle, WA (Educurious Partners; $350,000) „Summer jobs for our teens represent so much more than just a paycheck,” said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. „Summer jobs are about giving young people opportunities that can change their lives. I applaud JPMorgan Chase for investing in equipping our young leaders with the skills they will use throughout their careers.” Over the last two years, JPMorgan Chase has dedicated $5 million to enhance skill-based and career-specific job opportunities through SYEP. This commitment, combined with other local support, created almost 50,000 summer jobs for teens in over 14 cities. The public and private sectors are working together to increase the number of summer job opportunities available to young people by taking existing workforce and economic development strategies and discovering innovative ways to create jobs. As new and innovative programs evolve, JPMorgan Chase is providing funding to bring these programs to scale. Sample tactics being used to expand skill-based and career-specific employment and training opportunities include expanding public and private sector partnerships by strengthening operating and communications systems; linking summer jobs to technical skills building, training and education, and year-round employment; prioritizing programs for special youth populations, including at-risk youth; connecting SYEPs to local workforce systems through new partnerships and organizational structures; and creating financial capability programs to help create economic security for these young employees.

They join existing EEA members JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP LP, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV that are all trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the ethereum blockchain can cut costs by speeding up financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. The reason ethereum is creating such interest among industries from finance to health care is because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner than with bitcoin, which introduced the first blockchain to the world in 2009. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up The bitcoin blockchain is like a banking system that runs itself -- but its main use is just to allow people to move the digital currency from one place to another. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A and so on. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts -- which are just operating procedures -- you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. “The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable," Julio Faura, chairman of EEA and head of blockchain innovation at Banco Santander SA, said in a statement announcing the additions to the group. "Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware.” Toyota, for example, is experimenting with ethereum to help it develop self-driving cars and other uses.  "Toyota Research Institute supports the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its members in promoting common standards and tools to accelerate the adoption of this technology and the potential benefits for Toyota’s customers,” Chris Ballinger, chief financial officer of the car company’s unit Toyota Research Institute, said in the statement. John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. European aircraft maker Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Merck, which says it’s the world’s oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world dating back nearly 350 years, said its history isn’t stopping it from being innovative. "Curiosity fuels business development and enables companies like ours to remain competitive," Andreas Schindler, director ideation, innovation and technology foresight for the company, said in the statement. "We are curious to co-create with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance on distributed ledger architectures and solutions for future digital markets in health care and life sciences.” Adoption of blockchain technology such as ethereum has significant hurdles to overcome, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. There is also the fact that very few if any actual uses of blockchain have been released to date. Regulators also have to be convinced the system is safe. And the EEA is far from alone in seeking an edge in creating standards for blockchain systems. Competitors include R3, Chain, Digital Asset Holdings and the Hyperledger Project.

Bill Gates, the world’s richest person with $86.8 billion, lost $1 billion as shares of Microsoft Corp., his largest holding, tumbled 2.8 percent, the most in almost a year. Amazon.com Inc. co-founder Jeff Bezos, who came within $4 billion of taking the top spot from Gates earlier this week, dropped to No. 3 after losing $1.7 billion as shares of the online retailer slid 2.2 percent. Spanish retailing tycoon Amancio Ortega lost $355 million to end the day in the second position with $83.2 billion. $34/bbl OPEC may get its members to agree to continue to tamp down oil production, but it will likely produce the unintended effect of emboldening shale producers in the United States to pump more oil onto the global market. The crash in oil prices have helped US shale producers to become even more efficient with estimates pointing to enormous Permian and Eagle Ford shale fields in Texas where producers can break even at prices as low as $34 a barrel. Analysts now say shale production will increase 1.4 million barrels a day through December, up from a previous growth estimate of 0.9 million barrels a day. JPMorgan Chase & Co. doubled its forecast to an increase of 800,000 barrels a day for the same period. $1.3bn Alisher Usmanov, the Russian billionaire who owns a minority stake in Arsenal football club, has in recent weeks made a $1.3bn bid to buy out his rival shareholder, according to three people close to the situation. Mr Usmanov, a metals magnate who owns 30 per cent of the English Premier League club, conveyed the offer in a letter to Stan Kroenke, the US sports mogul, who controls a 67 per cent stake. The approach, made last month, valued the club at $2bn. Remember that our own Aliko Dangote has also expressed interest in controlling Arsenal. $10bn US private equity firm Bain Capital has made a $10bn bid for Toshiba’s prized Nand memory chip subsidiary that could result in management running the Japanese unit getting a stake in the business. The proposed arrangements are meant to enhance the political acceptability of a deal in which some of the capital behind the Bain bid comes from South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. Toshiba set a deadline of Friday for binding offers for the Japanese industrial conglomerate’s flagship technology asset. 119 South Africa which calls itself the most developed country in the continent was ranked 119 out of 195 countries in the Healthcare Access and Quality Index published by medical journal Lancet on Friday. This placed SA which received 52 points only one rank below Namibia causing upset among the people of the country. The country with the best score, Andorra, received 95 followed by 94 for Iceland and 92 for Switzerland. Central African Republic received the worst score of 29, with Afghanistan and Somalia rounding off the bottom three, with scores of 32 and 34 respectively.

The Harvard Crimson Commencement 2017: The New Corporation Man Morgan J. Spaulding The New Corporation Man By Brandon J. Dixon and Claire E. Parker, CRIMSON STAFF WRITERS May 23, 2017 David M. Rubenstein does not sleep much. He and his colleagues estimate an average of four or five hours a night—that’s all he says he needs. It’s also all he has time for. The 67-year-old co-founder of the Carlyle Group splits his time between managing one of the largest private equity firms in the world and advising dozens of nonprofit and educational institutions. Rubenstein, whose estimated net worth tops $2.6 billion, chairs the boards of trustees of the Kennedy Center and the Brookings Institution, serves as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, and sits on the boards of Duke University and the University of Chicago. He’s the vice-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a trustee of the National Gallery of Art, and he’s on the board at Johns Hopkins Medicine. That’s just a sampling. And this summer, he’ll become the newest member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s most powerful governing body. Everyone seems to know Rubenstein. At a panel on higher education in April at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.—which he also leads as its president—Rubenstein was in his element. Taking the podium in the Marriott Hotel ballroom he had filled with a crowd of ambassadors, lawyers, bankers, and higher education leaders, Rubenstein—whose thick-framed black glasses pop out against a shock of white hair—pointed to familiar faces to thank them by name. After a lunch of salmon and salad dressed in truffle vinaigrette, University President Drew G. Faust and the presidents of Stanford and Ohio State joined him on the stage for an hour-long discussion on the future of higher education. While the topic is far from light-hearted, Rubenstein managed to slip in a dose of his trademark humor. “Do members of Congress ever say, ‘here’s my son’s resume?’” Rubenstein asked Faust. Leah S. Yared “I don’t think any member of Congress has ever done that, but I have had people come up to me when I’m taking a walk and lobby on behalf of their grandkids,” Faust said with a laugh. In the coming months, Rubenstein will have plenty more opportunities to trade quips with Faust about all things Harvard. As one of the 13 members of the Corporation, Rubenstein—who did not attend Harvard at all, but has donated tens of millions to the University—will be a regular at Loeb House, where the body conducts its meetings. He’ll join a cadre of lawyers, academics, and corporate leaders each distinguished in their professional careers. But none of the other members will quite have Rubenstein’s star power. A recent Forbes magazine cover proclaimed him one of the “Kings of Capital,” a “60 Minutes” segment referred to him as “Clark Kent in a suit and tie,” and the New Yorker magazine described his role as a “civic patriarch.” He hosts the “David Rubenstein Show” on Bloomberg Television, conducting “peer to peer conversations” with Oprah Winfrey, General David Petraeus, and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan. Rubenstein is “a recognizable figure in most circles across the United States now,” his long-time business partner Daniel A. D’Aniello said in an interview. In short, Rubenstein is a far cry from the Boston brahmins of the Corporation’s past. Once a tight-lipped, seven-member body of New England alumni, the Corporation has slowly broadened its membership and relaxed tradition. And Rubenstein, who reportedly uses his private Gulfstream G550 jet 250 days out of the year, is emblematic of Harvard’s efforts to modernize the Western Hemisphere’s oldest corporation. 'The Wizard of Oz Behind the Curtain' The Harvard Corporation meets in Loeb House. Courtesy Wikimedia commons From the chandeliered rooms of Loeb House to the shores of Cape Cod, the site of the Corporation’s annual summer retreat, members chart the University’s course—as they have for over three and a half centuries. Removed from day to day campus life, the historically secretive body holds Harvard’s purse strings and has the final say on every major change at the University. Appointing deans, changing school seals, and passing sweeping policies governing undergraduate social life require the Corporation’s stamp of approval. And perhaps most importantly, the body wields the authority to appoint or remove the University president—a power it exercised when it ousted former University President Lawrence H. Summers in 2006. “We are responsible overall for the health and welfare of the University in the broadest fiduciary sense,” outgoing Corporation member and former Duke University president Nannerl O. Keohane said in an interview. The Corporation’s 1650 charter, enshrined in the Massachusetts Constitution, established a governing body with seven seats to be filled by five members, a treasurer, and the president. Members served life terms with the approval of the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s larger, less influential governing body composed entirely of alumni. While Harvard grew in size and prominence over the ensuing 350 years, the Corporation remained much the same. But after the turn of the millennium, its size had become stifling and its secrecy, oft-criticized. “It was very hard to feel that a seven-person board, even with the support and help of the Board of Overseers, could have financial and fiduciary responsibilities for such a large and complicated institution,” Keohane said. The Corporation’s opacity drew the ire of School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Frederick H. Abernathy and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. In 2009, on the heels of the financial crisis, the two penned an op-ed in the Boston Globe excoriating the body for its lack of accountability and transparency. With such a small group of people making high-stakes financial decisions, Lewis and Abernathy called the body “a dangerous anachronism.” “One of the issues at the time of the governance reforms was that the Corporation was a mystery,” Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 said in an April interview. “It was like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, except you didn’t know whether the Wizard was speaking or not.” To pull back that curtain, the Corporation spent its annual beach retreat in 2010 brainstorming how to revamp the aging body. The reforms the group eventually announced that December resulted in a dramatic restructuring of the Corporation. They nearly doubled its membership from seven to 13 members, instituted term limits, and created committees within the Corporation that focused on different aspects of University life. The more formal approach, according to Lee, allows members to better promote the Corporation’s four primary responsibilities: “intellectual capital,” “reputational capital,” “physical capital,” and “financial capital.” Now, members of the Corporation interact more regularly with Overseers on several joint committees. But they won’t be there for as long; in the past, Corporation members—mostly men of the Boston upper-crust—sat on the board for decades, until they reached some “vaguely determined age,” Keohane said. But the reforms capped members’ tenure at two six-year terms, so Keohane—who was elected to the Corporation in 2005—is on her way out. “Now that we have term limits there will more often be the need to think about a new member,” Keohane said. “It has simply given us a chance to think more carefully about the types of expertise that we bring on.” The Corporation’s expansion meant bringing in a new cast of characters. The body added new members in increments over the following years—inducting former Tufts University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University of California, Berkeley computer scientist Susan L. Graham ’64, and Boston businessman Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 in 2011. In 2012, Harvard added investment banker Paul J. Finnegan ’75, foreign policy expert Jessica T. Mathews ’67, and lawyer Theodore V. Wells, Jr., and rounded out the 13 with venture capitalist James W. Breyer in 2013. But even with 13 members, the Corporation is among the smallest university governing boards in the country—meaning each individual member holds significant sway. Even though Faust, who Lee likened to “the CEO,” sets the Corporation’s agenda, the 12 other members decide the fate of the University by majority vote. Advertisement When Keohane steps down in July, one of those votes will belong to Rubenstein. 'Access Capitalism' Rubenstein’s childhood friends didn’t expect the son of a Baltimore postal service worker to end up on the cover of Forbes magazine. After graduating from Duke and the University of Chicago Law School, Rubenstein spent two years working in corporate law before entering the world of politics. He became a policy aide to Jimmy Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign and—when Carter won—a deputy to domestic policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat in the White House. Leah S. Yared “I thought when we were in high school that his career was going to be focused mostly on government and politics,” childhood friend and former Baltimore mayor Kurt L. Schmoke said in an interview. “Those of us who knew him way back then...we all thought that we would be talking about cabinet secretary Rubenstein rather than CEO Rubenstein.” But when Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980, Rubenstein left government for the corporate world. He had a vision for a new type of enterprise. Carlyle Group chairman and co-founder D’Aniello remembers his auspicious first meeting with Rubenstein at the restaurant of a Washington, D.C. Marriott in 1986, when the partnership that would lead to Carlyle’s founding began to take root. D’Aniello recalls thinking Rubenstein was “very polite, very reserved, but well-spoken.” At the time, Rubenstein was working at a Washington law firm and D’Aniello was the vice president of corporate financial planning for Marriott. After convincing D’Aniello to join him and telecommunications executive William E. Conway, the trio began courting investors to seed what became the Carlyle Group, which was named after the storied hotel. “We started out with only 5 million dollars of capital and the rest is history, really,” D’Aniello said. The pitch was to leverage Rubenstein’s Washington connections and D’Aniello and Conway’s financial acumen to corral a new set of insider investors. Soon, Rubenstein had recruited a roster of ex-Washington power players, including former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci and former Secretary of State James Baker, to the firm. Michael Lewis, writing for the New Republic in 1993, spared no criticism of the firm’s tactics. To him, Carlyle privileged high-profile names on its staff list over substantive financial planning, in what he called “access capitalism.” “I've leaned over backward so far to avoid using government contacts,” Rubenstein told Lewis in 1993. “I didn't want anyone to be able to write an article saying we were trading on our connections.” While private equity has been widely criticized for its emphasis on stock value, Rubenstein said he “likes to analogize [private equity] to sex.” “You realize there were certain things you shouldn’t do, but the urge is there, and you can’t resist,” he told to a crowd gathered at the Business School in 2009. But Rubenstein’s instincts pay off, D’Aniello said, describing Rubenstein as a calculated risk-taker—a “type-A personality” with an “unrelenting will to succeed.” “David, first of all, is a visionary,” D’Aniello said. “He thinks about the world in the way it will look in five to ten years rather than where it is now. And to a large degree he has been sort of the guiding light of the strategic plan and execution of Carlyle's growth over the last thirty years.” Now, the Carlyle Group’s more than 1,550 employees span six continents, managing a total of $162 billion in assets. As the Carlyle Group spread around the world, Rubenstein’s wealth and reputation grew with it. Over the past three decades, Rubenstein has met investors, heads of state, corporate CEOs, and public officials across the globe, oftentimes publicly bantering in the same way he did with Faust. 'Patriotic Philanthropy' Through his philanthropy, Rubenstein has ensured that his name is, indeed, everywhere. When an earthquake damaged the Washington Monument, he quickly put up $7.5 million to fund its repair. He paid to renovate the slave quarters at Monticello and support the National Zoo’s pandas. When a copy of the Magna Carta went up for auction, Rubenstein quickly bid on it—and donated it to the National Archives, where it is on display in the “David M. Rubenstein Gallery.” And, after a $10 million gift, the main exhibition hall of the Smithsonian’s recently-opened National Museum of African American History and Culture bears Rubenstein’s moniker. “He’s more or less invented this notion of patriotic philanthropy,” former Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood said of Rubenstein. So when the president of the country’s oldest university, then Lawrence H. Summers, approached Rubenstein at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland about a decade ago, Rubenstein lent a ready ear. Summers wanted to know if he was interested in getting involved with Harvard and the Kennedy School in particular. Rubenstein was no stranger to Harvard: his wife, Alice Rogoff, graduated from the Business School in 1978, and two of their daughters would go on to attend the College. Though Rubenstein didn’t have a personal connection to the Kennedy School, it brought his interest in higher education and “patriotic philanthropy” together. “I think one of my interests in supporting things at Harvard is to help not only Harvard but also help other universities, because I think our higher education system is our great national treasure, and if our great national treasure can be enhanced by people giving their time and energy and ideas, then hopefully it’s a good thing for our country,” Rubenstein said in an interview. Summers continued to court Rubenstein after their initial meeting in Davos, and Rubenstein even hosted Summers for a party at his Nantucket home. Summers, a former Secretary of the Treasury, remembers playing “aggressive tennis” with the billionaire. “We played tennis, and David was as aggressive about his tennis as he was about everything else, though fortunately, his investing ability is bigger than his tennis ability,” Summers recalled. Rubenstein donated $10 million to the Kennedy School in 2004 and agreed to chair the school’s capital campaign, on one condition: the school’s buildings had to go. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers. Madeline R. Lear “I went to him and said we’d like you to lead our campaign. He agreed to do it, but he said ‘David, your buildings are a big problem. If we’re going to work on this, we need to do it,’” Ellwood recalled. The $10 million gift was the beginning of a philanthropic relationship with Harvard that has lasted for over a decade. Ellwood said he attributes a large amount of his success as the Dean of the Kennedy School to Rubenstein, and Summers regularly sought Rubenstein’s advice throughout his presidency. After Faust took over from Summers, Rubenstein’s involvement with Harvard deepened. He donated $5 million to the Business School in 2011, and took the stage at the 2o13 launch of the University’s record-setting capital campaign. He is one of the campaign’s co-chairs, and he and his wife have donated at least $25 million to the campaign to date. Rubenstein makes frequent trips to Cambridge: he estimates that he visits Harvard about once every six weeks. And well before he was elected to the Corporation, he was acquainted for one reason or another with the bulk of its members. He’d met Shirley M. Tilghman, the former president of Princeton, Keohane from his time on the board of Duke University, Matthews from working together in the Carter White House, and former Corporation member Robert E. Rubin ’60 from serving as vice chairman of the Council of Foreign Relations. Rubenstein was on the Corporation’s radar. The Making of a Corporation Member Whether or not the Corporation was on Rubenstein’s radar, though, is another matter. The Corporation regularly sends out feelers to get a sense of who might be next to join the board. “I actually think that if you try to become a Corporation member, that probably will ensure that you won’t become one,” Lee said. “As I’ve said publicly, it’s a group of folks that no matter what their accomplishments, everyone checks their ego at the door, and that’s a hard mix to maintain, but it’s critical to giving the best advice to the president as possible.” After the reforms, the Corporation created a new governance committee tasked with nominating prospective members to the Board. The committee casts a wide net when looking for candidates, drawing names from across the University. Nominees in mind, the Corporation’s governance board takes stock of what buckets of expertise it needs on its body. With a larger membership, Lee and Faust both said the Corporation tries to assemble different skill sets and professional backgrounds. Indeed, recently, the Corporation’s membership has seemingly conformed to a preset configuration. “If you look at the list of the people on the Corporation today, and you look at their backgrounds, you’ll see it,” Lee said. “We have four current and past college presidents, we have four major business executives. We have a couple of lawyers—Ted Wells and me, we’re not sure why we’re there. We have someone from the nonprofit world—Jessica Matthews—we have some other academics, so you’ll get a sense for how the puzzle fits together.” Profession Harvard Alumni When Took Office Higher Ed Board Experience? Brian P. Yu The death of James R. Rothenberg ’68 in July 2015 was an abrupt and tragic loss to many Corporation members. It also left a hole in the Corporation’s knowledge base that the body was not prepared to immediately fill. With Keohane’s term coming to a close, Lee said that the Corporation had been prepared to replace her with Tilghman, and maintain the number of prominent academics on the board. Tilghman—a renowned life scientist—chaired the University’s life sciences review in her first year on the Corporation. But with Rothenberg’s untimely death, the group was short on financial savvy. “Jim participated, he knew what was going on, and he could advise us,” Lee said, adding that Tilghman’s time at Princeton made her a compelling candidate. “When we filled that spot with Shirley, that left the huge hole that Jim left, and having folks who have business expertise, who participated at the highest level both as investors and business folks is important to us.” Rubenstein was a natural fit. His decades of experience in private equity, millions of dollars donated to the University, and laundry list of boards he sits on were more than enough qualification. “I probably served on as many nonprofit boards as one can serve on,” Rubenstein said. That Rubenstein never attended Harvard distinguished him from many of his would-be colleagues on the Corporation. Only Keohane and Faust did not attend any of Harvard’s schools before assuming a governing role. Keohane and Rubenstein say that’s an asset. “We think as long as we can now get 13 people, it may make sense to have a few of us without Harvard ties, so that we bring the perspective of some other educational experiences,” Keohane said. “I think if you’re as important to the country as Harvard is you probably need to take a look at whether you should only have Harvard graduates doing certain things,” Rubenstein said. University President Drew G. Faust Helen Y. Wu By the time Faust called Rubenstein to formally invite him to join the Corporation, he had already been thoroughly vetted by the sitting members and the Overseers. Rubenstein told Faust he’d have to think about it. “I went back and forth and decided to make sure that the time constraints would work because I think if you’re going to be a member of a nonprofit board—particularly a small one as this one is—you need to show up at the meetings,” Rubenstein said. “I had to make sure my schedule would work.” 'Einstein's Definition of Insanity' Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee'72 Tiana A Abdulmassih Soon after Lee became the senior fellow of the Corporation in 2013, he solicited advice from the chairs of other prominent nonprofit boards. He eventually found himself across the table from Rubenstein, whose deep knowledge of higher education institutions made him an appealing lunch partner. Laurene Sterling, who serves with Rubenstein on Duke’s board of trustees, said his leadership on the board “has just been transformational.” Lee and Rubenstein chatted amicably over lunch, but Lee said Rubenstein was candid in his assessment of what he should prioritize as senior fellow. “He was direct, he was honest, he gave me his views of what was strong at Harvard, what wasn’t strong at Harvard,” Lee said.“The only awkward moment is when I offered to pay the luncheon bill and he said, ‘You don’t have to because I own the restaurant.’” Rubenstein will bring more to the Corporation than a generosity for lunch bills and honest counsel. His time at Carlyle has not only served to enrich him personally—he’s also developed a robust fundraising network. Advertisement At Carlyle, Rubenstein finds investors to fund the firm’s ventures. As the private equity firm seeks to buy a dominant share in publicly-traded companies—with the intention of selling those shares after making the company more profitable—it needs to put up the equity for the controlling stake. It’s Rubenstein's job to raise the funds to make those purchases. He’s quite good at it. "David is the most prolific fundraiser maybe the planet has ever seen in any field, not just private equity—and Bill Conway is one of the greatest investors I have ever met," Jimmy Lee, the JPMorgan Chase banker, told Forbes magazine in 2012. Over the course of Rubenstein’s career, his web of contacts has only continued to grow. “He has a huge reach across not only the business community but also the government community as well as the philanthropic community,” D’Aniello said. “And all of that is a function of his growth and experience in fundraising and the financing of the firm over the course of the last thirty years.” As a Corporation member and chair of the capital campaign, Rubenstein plays an active role helping the University raise money. His status as a prominent donor gives him credibility as he asks others to make major gifts. “I mean I can go out and ask somebody to give $20 million—I did it as president,” Keohane, who served as president of Duke for 11 years and Wellesley for 12 years, said. “But now, as a sitting member of the Corporation, I couldn’t give anywhere near that, and therefore, according to the canons of fundraising, it is not going to be very persuasive for me to go ask somebody to give $20 million.” “They’ll say, ‘What did you give?’ It’s nowhere in that ballpark,” she added. Rubenstein has extensive experience convincing his wealthy peers to donate to universities and non-profits. “I chaired a number of capital campaigns for nonprofits, and I think at one point I was chairing or co-chairing six nonprofit capital campaigns simultaneously, which is surely Einstein’s definition of insanity to the nth degree,” he said. Corporation members hope that Rubenstein’s knack for investing transfers over to Harvard Management Company, which has seen “challenging” returns during the last decade. “Specifically, David Rubenstein has been brought on in part to help us deal with the need for strength in the area of investment and development,” Keohane said. And though 20 percent of the endowment’s investments are in private equity, Rubenstein and others said that he won’t be in a position to make direct investment decisions that might benefit Carlyle. While the Corporation appoints members to HMC’s Board of Directors, they do not directly set investment strategy at the firm. Rubenstein said he “wouldn’t presume” that he’ll be providing advice to HMC’s CEO during his tenure on the Corporation. “I’m obviously happy to give advice if asked, but I think they’re in pretty good shape, they don’t need my advice,” Rubenstein said. “There’s clearly been some challenges for all university endowments in the current situation but Harvard’s now dealing with it directly, and it’s obviously more challenging managing an endowment as large as Harvard’s and as visible as Harvard’s.” D’Aniello said he expects Rubenstein to recuse himself from any governance decisions involving private equity. D’Aniello previously served on the board of trustees for Syracuse and said he would leave the boardroom if his nonprofit responsibilities and his responsibilities to the Carlyle Group collided. “Every time they made a decision with respect to putting money with private equity, I would recuse myself,” D’Aniello said. “And as a matter of fact, I’m happy to say that they never did invest anything at Carlyle. But he’s not going to be involved in those decisions, he’ll be recused from those decisions.” Frequent Flyer Governance In recent years, Harvard has been trying to expand its global reach. More than 9,800 of its students and scholars are international, Faust just finished a global tour to promote the capital campaign, and Harvard recently opened a center in Tunisia. Keohane said the Corporation is trying to reflect that international focus. “When I joined the board, there was almost a sense that Harvard was Harvard, and you know we have a few peers, but most of our time is spent thinking specifically about Harvard itself,” she said. “And now, we’re more inclined to think about Harvard within a context of how higher education is developing around the world.” Rubenstein is used to thinking globally. He has traveled to the Middle East with Ellwood and spoken at Harvard events in London. “He’s constantly all across the planet,” Ellwood said. And Faust described Rubenstein as the “force behind the creation of the Global Advisory Council”—a network of prominent alumni who advise Faust about international engagements. “He has so many connections around the world that he’s been very helpful in bringing people together for that group,” Faust said. As Rubenstein eyes the first few months of his tenure on the Corporation, his focus will be on learning about Harvard. He’s well-versed in the process. “I think it’s good for new board members to kind of not assume that they’re going to have much influence for a while because I’ve got to learn a lot and listen, so I obviously spend a lot of time listening and learning for the first part of the time that I’m on the boards,” he said. But as he takes his seat on the governing body of a University better known for its buttoned-up members dedicated to a sober purpose than jetsetting billionaires with their own television shows, Rubenstein is ready to lighten up the mood. “Hopefully I can...bring some sense of humor to the whole thing so you can have a perspective that's not completely 100 percent so serious,” he said. —Staff writer Brandon J.

The bank provides full custodian services to both domestic and international clients for investments in global markets. MASATSU Custodian could spur fund interest Tue, 23 May 2017 Brian Ng The government is working on legislation that would create a framework for the establishment of a custodian bank in Cambodia, according to securities firms, which claim the absence of this institution could be deterring foreign investors from participating in share offerings on the local stock exchange. Seng Chan Thoeun, head of corporate finance at SBI Royal Securities, the underwriter for the initial public offering of Sihanoukville Autonomous Port (SAP), said the recent bookbuilding exercise for the seaport operator’s IPO exposed the impact of the missing institution. He noted that while the bookbuilding was successful in that it was 2.4 times oversubscribed, the turnout from foreign institutional investors was weaker than expected. “For this IPO we went to Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand for two rounds of road show, but the issue [that dampened response was] the custodian regulation,” he said. “Most of the foreign institutional investors require a custodian bank in Cambodia, but there is none in Cambodia at the moment.” A custodian bank does not operate like a traditional bank that handles loans and deposits. Instead, it is a specialised financial institution responsible for safeguarding an individual’s or firm’s assets, such as stocks or bonds, and administering actions related to the transfer or management of these assets. According to Thoeun the compliance rules of investment funds based in Singapore and Hong Kong require that they use a local custodian bank to transfer funds for subscription to securities in a foreign market. However, smaller investors from these countries may still be able to subscribe to shares using the custodian services of the underwriter’s partner brokerage firms. A representative from Yuanta Securities, which was the underwriter for two listings on the Cambodian Securities Exchange (CSX), affirmed that the absence of a custodian bank likely discouraged some large foreign investment funds from participating in the bookbuilding and subscriptions of these IPOs. Simon Sungbae Park, head of corporate finance at Yuanta, said the issue was a factor that may have limited subscriptions to the $5.2 million IPO of Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP) in late 2015. “Most of the large foreign institutional investors cannot invest unless there is a custodian bank,” he said. Lamun Soleil, director of market operations at the CSX, said the opening of a custodian bank in Cambodia would benefit foreign institutional investors by facilitating access to the Kingdom’s financial market. However, he said the small size of this market limited the interest of these large investors, and by extension the impetus for the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) to formulate regulations for the licensing of a custodian bank. An employee speaks on the phnone at the CSX offices in Phnom Penh. Hong Menea “Custodian banks are particularly useful for foreign institutional investors, but our stock market may not be big enough [yet] to receive them,” he said. “That may be the reason why the SECC has postponed [work on a] prakas. But the need may arise when Cambodia has bond market, especially a government one.” Thoeun conceded that while Cambodia’s nascent stock market, which has just four listed companies, may be too small to attract a large custodian bank such as JPMorgan Chase, some regional players have expressed interest. “We have met some banks in Thailand who want to be a custodian bank for Cambodian securities,” he said, adding that he could not reveal their identity. “They are really keen to apply for a licence with the SECC and they have submitted their applications and are communicating with the SECC already.” Vin Pheakday, director of the Securities Intermediaries Supervision Department at the SECC, confirmed that the market regulator has plans to establish a licensing mechanism for custodian banks, though a time line has not been set. “We have plans, but I am not sure when we will provide licenses,” he said. “We are discussing the issue with the relevant parties to get more information, and we are still studying the obstacles in the market.” Username * Password * Contact author: Brian Ng 0 Comments Please, login or register to post a comment Related articles Port IPO opens to subscribers Securities and Exchange Commission will regulates the stock exchange Sihanoukville port announces bookbuild and IPO date PPAP seeks to generate $6.4M in IPO Share price set for port’s $5.2M IPO Failing to sew up support PPWSA edges closer to IPO Momentum building for GTI Latest Video Phnom Penh eats: Ptas Nak Battambang As the name suggests, Ptsa Nak Battambang – which in English means Battambang's house – is the right place for those who want to try some of the province's typical dishes in Phnom Penh.

(AMD) Stock Risks a Nasty Breakdown Turning back to OPEC, the oil sheiks will meet in Vienna on May 25. The consensus is for a nine-month extension to the supply cap that’s been in place in the first half of the year aimed at normalizing the global oversupply situation. There has also been chatter of a potentially deeper level of output cuts. The risk, of course, is that OPEC is merely sacrificing hard won market share gains earned during the post-2014 price war against U.S. shale producers; as wildcatters have eagerly increased U.S. drilling rig counts in response to the OPEC-driven energy price recovery that started in early 2016. Outside of OPEC, watch for the release of the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the timing and pacing of additional interest rate hikes through the end of the year. Wall Street is braced for another hike in June; but the rest of the year is murky with less than a 50% chance of a second hike before 2018.

With the upward move on the day, the major averages further offset the sell-off that was seen last Wednesday. The major averages closed firmly in positive territory for the third straight session. The Dow rose 89.99 points or 0.4 percent to 20,894.83, the Nasdaq advanced 49.92 points or 0.8 percent to 6,133.62 and the S&P 500 climbed 12.29 points or 0.5 percent to 2,394.02. The markets continued to benefit from the upward momentum seen over the two previous sessions, which helped the major averages climb off their worst levels in nearly a month. Trading activity was somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. Later this week, trading may be impacted by reaction to reports on new and existing home sales and durable goods orders. The Federal Reserve is also due to the release the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting, which may shed some light on the outlook for interest rates. Among individual stocks, shares of Blackstone Group (BX) moved sharply higher after the private equity firm and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia announced they are launching $40 billion investment vehicle to finance infrastructure renovation in the U.S. Auto giant Ford (F) also posted a notable gain after announcing it has named Jim Hackett as its new president and CEO. Hackett succeeds Mark Fields, who has elected to retire from Ford. On the other hand, shares of Amgen (AMGN) came under pressure after the biotech company said it does not expect its experimental osteoporosis drug Evenity to win FDA approval this year amid concerns about heart safety. Sector News Gold stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index climbing by 1.5 percent. The strength among gold stocks came amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, as gold for June delivery rose $7.80 to $1,261.40 an ounce. Significant strength was also visible among networking stocks, as reflected by the 1.4 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Networking Index. Ciena (CIEN) led the sector higher after an upgrade by Stifel Nicolaus. Telecom stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, resulting in a 1.7 percent gain by the NYSE Arca Telecom Index. Qualcomm (QCOM) posted a standout gain after JPMorgan Chase upgraded its rating on the company's stock to Overweight from Neutral. Software, transportation, and electronic stocks also moved notably higher, while most of the other major sectors showed more modest moves. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.9 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index climbed by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index edged down by 0.2 percent and the French CAC 40 Index closes just below the unchanged line. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction before ending the session slightly lower. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, inched up by nearly a basis point to 2.254 percent. Looking Ahead A report on new home sales in the month of April is likely to attract attention on Tuesday. New home sales are expected to drop to 604,000 in April from 621,000 in March. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Thrills and Chills: The 10 Most Fun States In America Dubai For Lunch?

This has taken on a new meaning in the post credit crunch world, where every basis point of return counts. As a result, investing and trading in an efficient and effective manner has become paramount. The impact is more likely to be felt among the smaller and medium-sized pension funds, which have not been as technologically savvy as their larger, better resourced brethren. They are starting to move up the learning curve, mainly thanks to regulations such as the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) and the US' Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS). Each set of rules has its own nuances, but they both require systems and processes to deal with best execution, transparency, reporting, compliance and risk management. The other driving force, of course, is cost. Simply put, it is less expensive to use technology than human beings. Martin Campbell, director, Market Insights, Institutional Asset Management at SunGard, the software and IT giant, noted: 'Over the past 15 to 20 years, we have seen IT infrastructure and software development become much cheaper, while people are still expensive. Although pension funds have been later in the game, the volumes that are being generated and the increasingly complicated nature of the business has meant they are catching up with everyone else. Also, fund managers as well as service providers have become more sophisticated in the level of service and products they are delivering to pension fund clients.' In the past five years, pension funds have not only embraced more complex financial instruments, but they have also expanded their list of asset classes. Although still not large components, alternatives such as hedge funds, private equity, commodities and real estate now share space with bonds and equities. In addition, managers have cast their nets geographically further for opportunities in a portfolio, plus adopted different types of strategies such as liability driven investing. New products for a changed landscape LDI, in particular has gained a following in the UK, Netherlands and Scandinavia, on the back of regulation and changes in accounting standards. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) also opened the door for derivatives and over the last 18 months, 130/30 funds, which employ shorting strategies, have either made their debut or are in the pipeline. Technology vendors and securities service providers have wasted no time in picking up the gauntlet and offering new products and solutions for their pension fund clients. The biggest challenges have come in the murky world of over-the-counter products which are illiquid and hard to value. Hedge funds, private equity and real estate also require their own calculations, which helps explain why global custodians have been busy enhancing and upgrading their menu of products. The traditional custody offerings which focus on the back office functions such as safekeeping, settlement, income collection, tax reclamation, corporate actions and proxy voting, are still popular. However, in response to demand, value added, higher margin products are also a firm fixture in the stable. They range from performance and risk measurement to portfolio management, investment analytics, independent valuations of derivatives and collateral management. Regulatory record keeping, risk management tools and compliance monitoring, which ensure rules are being adhered to during the trading process, have also moved to the top of the agenda. Pension funds are currently worried about the turbulent market conditions, but a raft of regulation over the past seven years has also focused their minds. MiFID and Reg NMS have certainly dominated the news over the past two years, but the Myners report on unbundling and Sarbanes Oxley on corporate governance and anti-fraud requirements helped start the ball rolling. The latter was in response to the high profile collapses of US household names such as Tyco, Worldcom and Enron, whose pension funds went down with the corporate ship. Tom McEvilly, director of global solutions strategy at CheckFree, said: 'The regulatory environment impacts the back office and fund managers are looking for technology providers who can map specific functionality in their solutions to particular clauses in various compliance mandates such as MiFID and Sarbanes Oxley.' Campbell of SunGard, added: 'From our experience, clients want the pieces of control, transparency, compliance and risk management brought together under one umbrella. They are also asking for detailed monitoring and reporting, and they are using technology to achieve that. Take compliance, they want processes that show that they are compliant every second of every day. It is the same with operational risk. It is not just about measuring that risk, but eliminating anything that could cause risk in a consistent way.' Increased scrutiny The continuing and painful fallout from the credit crunch with the nationalisation of Northern Rock and the fire sale of Bear Stearns has only heightened the demand for these types of tools. 'Valuation risk is key, but so too is reputational risk,' said Philippe Carrel, executive vice-president, global head of business development at Reuters. 'If pension funds do not value their holdings, especially the more complex instruments, accurately and fairly, then their reputations can suffer and they could be the next major headline.' Pension funds are also using technology to scrutinise closely their fund managers as well as third party administrators such as custodians. Paul Westgate, Icon product manager at Linedata, a software and service provider, explained: 'Pension funds have been under increasing pressure to drive costs down and increase efficiency, but there also has been a greater focus on the performance of their fund managers and custodians. Trustees have become more demanding and are requiring greater transparency. They are no longer willing to just accept information, but want to have an independent check.' Benjie Fraser, head of UK pensions and charities for JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, added: 'Within the ongoing management of the pension fund assets, middle office functions such as performance measurement, as well as value at risk models, have become very important. Trustees not only want to drill down into individual portfolio performance, but they also want technology that will look at the potential VAR scenarios to see what could go wrong. Our aim is to provide clients with an in-depth snapshot of all of their assets.' Kerry White, first vice president, global product management, at BNY Mellon, also confirmed pension funds were wanting tools to dissect their portfolios into finer and more granular pieces. 'We are being asked to produce reports in a simple format which have more drilldown capabilities. Pension funds also want to combine different layers of information in order to get the big picture of the shares they hold.' Overall, governance is becoming an increasingly important theme in pension fund circles according to Peter Friz, head of global voting services at RiskMetrics, a provider of risk management and corporate governance services. 'In the past, there were a number of manual steps a pension fund had to undertake and the visibility into these processes was limited. For example, often managers did not receive any confirmation of their vote. Technology facilitates the process and adds transparency and although there is a cost involved, pension funds have realised that good governance can have a positive impact on their portfolios.' While technology for the back and middle office will keep evolving, the same is true for the front office, particularly in the electronic trading arena. Larger schemes or mid-sized plans via their fund managers are already keen users of direct market access and algorithmic tools and this is expected only to increase under the MiFID banner. The new rules abolish the concentration rules, paving the way for so-called multi-trading facilities. So far the only entrant has been Instinet's Chi_X Europe, which offers trading in Dutch, German, UK, Swiss and French blue chips with a service it claims to be ten times faster and up to ten times cheaper than the European stock exchanges. Launched last March, the platform has captured as much as 30% to 40% in some of the most liquid Dutch blue chips as well 9.7% of UK shares. Looking ahead, all eyes are now focused on Turquoise, an equities trading platform set up by a banking consortium of nine. Although it has taken longer to establish than expected, the platform has gained momentum in the past six months with the appointment of both Eli Lederman, a former managing director of Morgan Stanley, as chief executive and Cinnober Financial Technology to build the technology platform. The group built BOAT, the trade reporting system backed by many of the same investment banks that are members of Turquoise. The launch date is now set for September 2008. The proliferation of these different liquidity pools is also translating into an increasing demand for smart order routing. SOR tools seek out the best price on a variety of venues simultaneously and automatically direct the trade to the best venue. Fund managers had been slow to embrace this technology but that is changing now that they are obliged to achieve best execution for their clients.
