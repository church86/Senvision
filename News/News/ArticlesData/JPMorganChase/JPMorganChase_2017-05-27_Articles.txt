(Reuters Photo/Kim Kyung-Hoon) By : Sujata Rao and Saikat Chatterjee | on 11:00 PM May 26, 2017 Category : International, Asia-Pacific London/Hong Kong. Record-breaking dollar bond sales from Chinese companies are steadily increasing China's weight in global indexes, raising concerns about overexposure among investors who track them. Corporates' rapid move onto offshore bond markets, partly a response to the crackdown on runaway credit growth at home, highlights China's multi-faceted indebtedness, a growing worry for investors. Overall debt is approaching 300 percent of annual economic output, or gross domestic product, and Moody's said it was the reason for cutting China's credit rating for the first time in 30 years. Stripping out maturing debt and coupon payments, year-to-date bond sales from companies in emerging markets total $65 billion including $54 billion from China, JPMorgan estimates. In gross issuance terms, almost half this year's emerging market corporate bond sales are from Chinese firms, the bank said. Company debt issuance in other emerging markets has been subdued by commodity and growth slumps. Some indexes cap the weight they give to each country but most are committed to broadly representing the market. This means that the indexes have to increase the weighting they give to China and investors whose portfolios track or benchmark an index must adjust accordingly. "It poses a challenge for global portfolios. You don't want to have too much of a good thing," said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at AllianzGlobal Investments. China today comprises over 20 percent of the Markit iBOXX emerging market corporate index versus 0.5 percent in 2007. In JPMorgan's Cembi Broad index too, China is 21 percent, up from less than 4 percent in 2010, while in the iBoxx corporate dollar bond index which also includes developed countries, China has crept to 8 percent, from less than one percent five years ago. Chinese firms should this year easily surpass the $108 billion debt raised in 2016 and $116 billion in 2014. In 2010, just $14 billion was issued. "It's just a juggernaut of issuance," said Guy Stear, co-head of fixed income research at Societe Generale in Paris. "It's so large that it's a game changer in terms of EM corporates [...] it's not just commodity companies, its cement, materials, internet companies, there's a broad range." The Chinese deals are mostly welcomed by money managers who need to invest the money pouring into their funds. Also, Chinese state-run firms still carry investment grade ratings, unlike issuers from many big emerging economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. "Relative to rating Chinese debt pays relatively decent yield [...] against that people are conscious that if you are running an EM credit fund you have very very high exposure to one part of the world," Stear said. Allocation Conundrum One popular solution for the allocation dilemma is "unconstrained" debt funds that are less committed to representing the market. Morningstar data showed 10 such funds focused on Asian fixed income were launched already this year by asset managers. More than 40 launched in 2016. "We are already seeing clients and investors wanting a diversified approach rather than just seeking exposure to a broad emerging market bond index," said Bryan Collins, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International in Hong Kong. Such funds can opt for less China exposure. Or they can delve down the credit curve and away from state-run firms whose close correlation with sovereign yields offers less prospect of outperformance, Collins said. Other commonly used indexes cap China's weight – JPMorgan's Cembi Broad Diversified limits the weight each country can have, while Citigroup and Bloomberg have recently launched index variations capping China exposure. "We stay with the Broad Diversified and we are comfortable with China at 8 percent to 10 percent," said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments in London. Cook also noted that the $400 billion-plus market was still a fraction of the $5.7 trillion outstanding in US investment grade credit. Corporate dollar bonds also comprise a small proportion of the country's overall debt, estimated by some to be as high as $28 trillion. Cooling Down Chinese authorities were trying to cool the dollar bond boom even before the Moody's rating downgrade. Property firms for instance no longer receive new issuance quotas, Reuters has reported. Their efforts could accelerate after the Moody's downgrade and subsequent rating cuts for state-run firms should also raise borrowing costs. But bond sales are unlikely to grind to a complete halt. For one, raising cash overseas can allow companies to sidestep curbs that are in place to combat capital flight. Second, companies' total debt repayments in 2017 are estimated at 5.5 trillion yuan ($797 billion) by ratings agency China Chengxin estimates. For investment-grade Chinese firms, dollar borrowing works out some 90 basis points cheaper than on domestic markets where interest rates have risen. The spread between JP Morgan's China index and onshore AA-rated corporate debt is at its widest in two years. "If you are laden with debt, interest rates are rising and you need to roll over debt, you find the money wherever you can," said Stephen Jen, chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Bank Stocks Are Over the Trump Bump Shares of big banks have underperformed the broader market since the beginning of March. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) May 27, 2017 at 11:11AM Bank stocks shot up in the immediate wake of the presidential election on hopes that the unexpected victory of a pro-business candidate Donald Trump would spur profitability in the industry. But with the controversies swirling in Washington, D.C., combined with legislative paralysis, investors have begun to reconsider how much banks will actually benefit under the new administration. The optimism around bank stocks was spurred by two things, in particular. First, Trump vowed on the campaign trail to reduce the top corporate tax rate from 35% down to 15%. That would help banks more than any other industry, as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup all rank among the 10 biggest corporate taxpayers in America. Bank of America's office in New York City (center). Image source: Getty Images. For Bank of America, for instance, this would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share, holding all else equal. To be clear, there's a short-term downside to a tax cut from the perspective of certain big banks -- namely, Bank of America and Citigroup -- which have large deferred tax assets, which would have to be written down if taxes are cut. According to estimates, that would cost Bank of America somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.4 billion. But unlike the benefit, which would be recurring, this downside would hit the bank's balance sheet only once. In addition to tax cuts, moreover, Trump promised to ease the regulatory burden on banks, which had been ratcheted up ever since the financial crisis. This would lower compliance costs and give banks much more operational flexibility to grow revenue and return capital to shareholders, all of which would boost profitability. The net result is that bank stocks soared in the wake of Trump's unexpected victory. You can see this in the chart below, which compares the performance of the KBW Bank Index to that of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broader market, from the beginning of November 2016 through February of this year. KBWB data by YCharts. But now the tide has changed. With the Russia controversy consuming the White House, and all hopes for legislative victories on tax and healthcare reform reduced to a hope and a prayer, investors have become notably less optimistic about bank stocks. One could even go so far as to say that they're downright pessimistic. You can see this in the chart below, which picks up where the first one left off -- spanning from the beginning of March through today: KBWB data by YCharts. It remains to be seen, of course, how everything shakes out in the nation's capital. But if things don't get back on track soon, it isn't unreasonable to think that the more recent trend in bank stocks will continue to carry the day.

Federal Reserve Bank. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEAL ST. ANTHONY @StAnthonyStrib Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has not tread softly in his first 16 months on the job Kashkari, who was hired by the Minneapolis Fed board in January 2016, tweets, at times irreverently, about economic policy and irks big bankers with occasional criticism of management or his solution for preventing more federal bailouts. He challenges Wall Street, where he once labored, to put more skin in the game. And he’s not shy opining about the implications of certain monetary or fiscal policies, the bailiwick of Congress and the president. Kashkari has met with impoverished kids and struggling small business people as the Minneapolis Fed contemplates doing more to assist minorities achieve family-supporting jobs. He thinks the Fed can do more to revive gritty neighborhoods. “I care about public policy and I want to take on the most important economic challenges we face as a region and country,” Kashkari said last week. “That’s what I said to the board when I interviewed for the job. The Minneapolis Fed is an underutilized resource that could have a bigger impact. And this won’t be without controversy. As long as what we do is nonpartisan and grounded in good economic research, let the critics say what they may.” Kashkari is an engineer who once worked on rocket systems and an MBA who worked for Goldman Sachs. He played a pivotal role at the U.S. Treasury during the depths of the Great Recession. He also was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor of California in 2014. “I enjoyed running,” Kashkari said. “I met billionaires and homeless people and everyone in between. I learned that the vast majority of people are good people. And they care about their neighborhoods, communities and country. I was encouraged.” And he is not shy about ruffling feathers at financial institutions he oversees. The Federal Reserve influences interest rates and employment, does research designed to inform policymakers in Washington, D.C., and state capitals, and regulates bank holding companies, from huge JPMorgan Chase on Wall Street to U.S. Bancorp on the Nicollet Mall. In a rare move for a Fed president, Kashkari blasted the senior management of Wells Fargo & Co. over the consumer fake-account scandal before the board pushed out CEO John Stumpf last fall, five years after the problem surfaced internally. Kashkari also raised big-banker eyebrows when he announced last year the Minneapolis Fed’s preliminary recommendation that the best way to avoid another version of the 2008-10 bank bailout is to raise by 100 percent the capital big banks must hold to cushion against huge losses, to more than 20 percent. Kashkari has concluded it’s the right thing to do. After all, a bank made him put down 20 percent on his house for security. And he has unique insight. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, recruited Kashkari to Treasury and tasked him with a big piece of the bank bailout. The Treasury invested in hundreds of banks to keep them afloat and stimulate lending. The money was paid back with interest. However, as some small banks failed, the precedent was set: The government will bail out the biggest banks, those considered to be integral to the national and global economy through the huge electronic-payment systems that weave through the financial world. “We had to do it, and it was the right thing to do,” said Kashkari. “Let’s not have to do it again.” Big-bank lobbyists will fight capital-raising regulatory changes. Adding more capital means less lending and investing and restrains profits. Conversely, Kashkari would ease some rules for small banks. Kashkari was moved recently by a visit to the Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ), a nonprofit that assists low-income families on things ranging from getting kids ready for kindergarten to nutrition and health education and training referrals for out-of-work adults. The North Side boasts the highest concentration of poverty in the Twin Cities. Sondra Samuels, a former businesswoman who leads NAZ, will address a Fed conference that starts Monday on why blacks are unemployed at twice the rate of whites. Kashkari wants to study what works and spread the word. “These are enormously important and complex issues,” he said. “I think the Fed has a role.” Said Minneapolis Fed board member MayKao Hang, CEO of the Wilder Foundation: “Neel is a transformational leader who is willing to tackle important issues we face in our region and across the nation. “He knows, for example, that if we want to spur growth across the Ninth District, we have to address why we have some of the deepest economic and racial disparities in the country.” Neal St. Anthony has been a business columnist and reporter for the Star Tribune for 30 years.

Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Venezuela's people are hungry – but its lenders are kept happy Even Trump is having trouble selling his Ferrari A Wall Street Journal analysis shows that since the 1990s, sparsely populated counties have replaced large cities as America’s most troubled areas by key measures of socioeconomic well-being—a decline that’s accelerating. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 995.78 +2.40 +0.24% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 85.36 +0.01 +0.01% AdChoices At the corner where East North Street meets North Cherry Street in the small Ohio town of Kenton, the Immaculate Conception Church keeps a handwritten record of major ceremonies. Over the last decade, according to these sacramental registries, the church has held twice as many funerals as baptisms. In tiny communities like Kenton, an unprecedented shift is under way. Federal and other data show that in 2013, in the majority of sparsely populated U.S. counties, more people died than were born—the first time that’s happened since the dawn of universal birth registration in the 1930s. For more than a century, rural towns sustained themselves, and often thrived, through a mix of agriculture and light manufacturing. Until recently, programs funded by counties and townships, combined with the charitable efforts of churches and community groups, provided a viable social safety net in lean times. Starting in the 1980s, the nation’s basket cases were its urban areas—where a toxic stew of crime, drugs and suburban flight conspired to make large cities the slowest-growing and most troubled places. Today, however, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows that by many key measures of socioeconomic well-being, those charts have flipped. In terms of poverty, college attainment, teenage births, divorce, death rates from heart disease and cancer, reliance on federal disability insurance and male labor-force participation, rural counties now rank the worst among the four major U.S. population groupings (the others are big cities, suburbs and medium or small metro areas). In fact, the total rural population—accounting for births, deaths and migration—has declined for five straight years. “The gap is opening up and will continue to open up,” said Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the new urban-rural divide.

Those gains never materialized. As jobs in manufacturing and agriculture continue to vanish, America’s heartland faces a larger, more existential crisis. Some economists now believe that a modern nation is richer when economic activity is concentrated in cities. In Hardin County, where Kenton is the seat, factories that once made cabooses for trains and axles for commercial trucks have shut down. Since 1980, the share of county residents who live in poverty has risen by 45% and median household income adjusted for inflation has fallen by 7%. At the same time, census figures show, the percentage of adults who are divorced has nearly tripled, outpacing the U.S. average. Opioid abuse is also driving up crime. Father Dave Young, the 38-year-old Catholic priest at Immaculate Conception, was shocked when a thief stole ornamental candlesticks and a ciborium, spilling communion wafers along the way. Before coming to this county a decade ago, Father Young had grown up in nearby Columbus—where for many years he didn’t feel safe walking the streets. “I always had my guard up,” he said. Since 1980, however, the state capital’s population has risen 52%, buoyed by thousands of jobs from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., plus the growth of Ohio State University. Median household income in Columbus is up 6% over the same span, adjusted for inflation. “The economy has grown a lot there,” said Father Young. “The downtown, they’ve really worked on it.” Meanwhile, as Kenton—population 8,200—continues to unravel, he said he has begun always locking the church door. Again, he finds himself looking over his shoulder. “I just did not expect it here,” he said.© Ty Wright for the Wall Street Journal In the first half of the 20th century, America’s cities grew into booming hubs for heavy manufacturing, expanding at a prodigious clip. By the 1960s, however, cheap land in the suburbs and generous highway and mortgage subsidies provided city dwellers with a ready escape—just as racial tensions prompted many white residents to leave. Gutted neighborhoods and the loss of jobs and taxpayers contributed to a socioeconomic collapse. From the 1980s into the mid-1990s, the data show, America’s big cities had the highest concentration of divorced people and the highest rates of teenage births and deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “The whole narrative was ‘the urban crisis,’” said Henry Cisneros, who was Bill Clinton’s secretary of housing and urban development. To address these problems, the Clinton administration pursued aggressive new policies to target urban ills. Public-housing projects were demolished to break up pockets of concentrated poverty that had incubated crime and the crack cocaine epidemic. At that time, rural America seemed stable by comparison—if not prosperous. Well into the mid-1990s, the nation’s smallest counties were home to almost one-third of all net new business establishments, more than twice the share spawned in the largest counties, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public-policy organization. Employers offering private health insurance propped up medical centers that gave rural residents access to reliable care. By the late 1990s, the shift to a knowledge-based economy began transforming cities into magnets for desirable high-wage jobs. For a new generation of workers raised in suburbs, or arriving from other countries, cities offered diversity and density that bolstered opportunities for work and play. Urban residents who owned their homes saw rapid price appreciation, while many low-wage earners were driven to city fringes. As crime rates fell, urban developers sought to cater to a new upper-middle class. Hospital systems invested in sophisticated heart-attack and stroke-treatment protocols to make common medical problems less deadly. Campaigns to combat teenage pregnancy favored cities where they could reach more people. As large cities and suburbs and midsize metros saw an upswing in key measures of quality of life, rural areas struggled to find ways to harness the changing economy. Starting in the late 1990s, Amazon.com Inc. began opening fulfillment centers in sparsely populated states to help customers avoid sales taxes. One of those centers, established in 1999, brought hundreds of jobs to Coffeyville, Kan.—population 9,500. Yet as two-day shipping became a priority, Amazon shifted its warehousing strategy to be closer to cities where its customers were concentrated, and shut the Coffeyville center in 2015. An Amazon spokeswoman said that it didn’t make the decision lightly, and that last year it opened one of two planned fulfillment centers near Kansas City that will create more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Just as Amazon closed down, so did the century-old hospital in nearby Independence, population 8,700. The nearly one-million-square-foot Coffeyville warehouse Amazon rented has been empty since it went on the market for $35 million, and was recently repossessed at a value of $11.4 million after the building owner filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Coffeyville officials said the area’s problem isn’t a lack of jobs—it’s a shortage of qualified workers. After Amazon said it would close, economic-development leaders held an employment fair expecting to get up to 600 job seekers. Fewer than 100 showed up, said Trisha Purdon, executive director of the Montgomery County Action Council. In the late 1990s, convinced that technology would allow companies to shift back-office jobs to small towns, former Utah Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt pitched outposts in his state to potential employers. But companies were turned off by the idea of having to visit and maintain offices in such locations, he said. Eventually, many of the call centers he landed moved overseas where labor was even cheaper. Although federal and state antipoverty programs were not limited to urban areas, they often failed to address the realities of the rural poor. The 1996 welfare overhaul put more city dwellers back to work, for example, but didn’t take into account the lack of public transportation and child care that made it difficult for people in small towns to hold down jobs, said Lisa Pruitt, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. Rhonda Vannoster of Independence, Kan., who is 25, has four children with a fifth on the way. She is divorced and jobless and doesn’t own a car, which limits her work options. She said she wants to get trained as a nursing aide but struggles to make time for it. “There just aren’t a lot of good jobs,” she said. There has long been a wage gap between workers in urban and rural areas, but the recession of 2007-09 caused it to widen. In densely populated labor markets (with more than one million workers), Prof. Moretti found that the average wage is now one-third higher than in less-populated places that have 250,000 or fewer workers—a difference 50% larger than it was in the 1970s. As employers left small towns, many of the most ambitious young residents packed up and left, too. In 1980, the median age of people in small towns and big cities almost matched. Today, the median age in small towns is about 41 years—five years above the median in big cities. A third of adults in urban areas hold a college degree, almost twice the share in rural counties, census figures show. Consolidation has shut down many rural hospitals, which have struggled from a shortage of patients with employer-sponsored insurance. At least 79 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, according to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Rural residents say irregular care and long drives for treatment left them sicker, a shift made worse by high rates of rural obesity and smoking. “Once you have a cancer diagnosis…your probability of survival is much lower in rural areas,” said Gopal K. Singh, a senior federal health agency research analyst who has studied mortality differences. The opioid epidemic—and a lack of access to treatment—have compounded the damage. In Hardin County, prosecutor Brad Bailey said drug cases, which accounted for less than 20% of his criminal cases a decade ago, have surged to 80%. The epidemic is spawning more thefts, including a rash of snatched air-conditioners sold for scrap metal, said Dennis Musser, police chief in Kenton. Linda Martell, a 69-year-old who moved to Kenton from outside Cleveland a decade ago to be near her daughter, was surprised a chain saw and heavy tools were stolen from her garage. When she was a young adult, she recalled, “All the problems were in the big cities.” In November’s presidential election, rural districts voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, who pledged to revive forgotten towns by scaling back regulations, trade agreements and illegal immigration and encouraging manufacturing companies to hire more American workers. A promised $1 trillion infrastructure bill could give a boost to many rural communities. Lawmakers from both parties concede they overlooked escalating dmall-town problems for years. “When you have a state like Florida, you campaign in the urban areas,” said former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez. He recalls being surprised when he learned in the mid-2000s that rural areas, not cities, were the center of an emerging methamphetamine epidemic. During the Bush administration, lawmakers were preoccupied with two wars, securing the homeland after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Barack Obama’s administration tried to lift rural areas by pushing expanded broadband access, but found that service providers were reluctant to enter sparsely populated towns, said former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Since the collapse of the housing market, real-estate appreciation in nonmetropolitan areas has lagged behind cities, eroding the primary source of wealth and savings for many families. “We didn’t really have much of a transformation strategy for places where the world was changing,” Mr. Vilsack said. Meanwhile, major cities once considered socioeconomic laggards have turned themselves around. In St. Louis, which has more than 30 nearby four-year schools, the percentage of residents with college degrees tripled between 1980 and 2015—creating a talent pool that has lured health care, finance and bioscience employers, officials say. Instead of people moving where the jobs are, “jobs follow people,” said Greg Laposa, a local chamber of commerce vice president. In many cities, falling crime has attracted more middle- and upper-class families while an influx of millennials delaying marriage has helped keep divorce rates low. Maria Nelson, a 45-year-old media company manager who came to Washington, D.C., to work after college, had always assumed she would someday move to the suburbs, where she had grown up. A generation of heavy federal spending helped make the nation’s capital one of the country’s highest-earning urban centers. Its median household income rose to $71,000 a year in 2015, a 51% increase since 1980, adjusted for inflation. While Ms. Nelson was able to buy a brick row house in 2002, she said she worries about younger colleagues—let alone anyone moving in from a small town—who face soaring real-estate prices. “The whole area just seems to be out of range for most people now,” she said In Kenton, Father Young said that despite their mounting troubles, he is optimistic about his parishioners. Some of them tell him they worry about what will happen when they die because they still provide for their adult children. He likes to say there is always hope. “They can find a job,” he said. “Columbus is close enough.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

But for those who work for Wall Street brokerage firms or the mega Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup or German banking giant Deutsche Bank, just the mere mention of FinCEN can quickly produce beads of sweat dripping onto those expensive Canali suits. That’s because FinCEN is the Federal agency where suspicious financial activity that might turn out to be money laundering gets reported. All three banks, and numerous others, have had their share of scandalous run ins with money laundering. In recent weeks, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee have all shown an interest in what FinCEN might have in its database that would shed sunshine on involvement of the Trump business empire or Trump campaign and Russian money inflows. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, sent a letter on March 2 to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asking for documents and explaining his rationale as follows: “…Russia has been subjected to a number of international and US sanctions, as have many prominent Russian leaders and business people. Investors from Russia have, in the past, played a significant role in the Trump organization. example, President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. stated at a conference in 2008 that President Trump’s businesses involved substantial Russian investments. He reportedly said: ‘And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.’ “Such statements raise important questions about whether any Trump firms, including those now controlled by his children, retain ownership interests in Russian entities, or have business ties or projects elsewhere that include Russian investors. If so, what is the nature of those ownership or investment arrangements?  Might they provide opportunities for economic leverage over the President or any of his family members or associates?  Do they put the President or his family in danger of violating U.S. statutes, regulations, or simply prudent standards of conduct for the leader of our nation?” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on an unrelated matter on May 18. During the hearing, Senator Brown told Mnuchin that he had not received an appropriate response to his March 2 letter. He asked Mnuchin to provide “a complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties to ensure that any foreign entanglements are benign…” Mnuchin denied that he hadn’t been responsive to Brown’s letter.

The state Supreme Court this week denied a request to hear an appeal filed by the owners after prior courts ruled the pay method was illegal. “The kids won. McDonald’s lost,” said West Pittston-based attorney Mike Cefalo, who filed the class action lawsuit on behalf of the McDonald’s workers in June 2013. Declined comment Franchise owners Albert and Carol Mueller of Clarks Summit declined comment on the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear their argument, a spokeswoman said. The case will now return to Luzerne County Court, where Judge Thomas F. Burke Jr. will determine what damages will be awarded to the plaintiffs, according to Cefalo. In June 2015, Burke ruled that paying employees exclusively with a debit card did not fall in line with the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, which mandates “wages shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or check.” The state Superior Court last year upheld Burke’s decision. “The language is clear. A debit card is not ‘lawful money’ and it is not a ‘check’ ...” Superior Court Judge Anne Lazarus wrote in the court’s opinion. Attorneys for the Muellers had argued a debit card was the “functional equivalent” of a check or lawful money. The Superior Court panel called that argument “unavailing,” because the cards were mandatory and “forced users to incur fees” for all types of transactions. The J.P. Morgan Chase payroll cards issued to local McDonald’s employees carried fees for nearly every type of transaction, according to Cefalo’s lawsuit, including a $1.50 charge for ATM withdrawals, $5 for over-the-counter cash withdrawals, $1 to check the card’s balance, 75 cents per online bill payment and $10 per month if the card is left inactive for more than three months. After Cefalo filed the lawsuit, it quickly gained national attention, including a front-page story in The New York Times and an investigation by federal officials. Soon after, the Muellers announced they were abandoning the pay practice and would give employees the choice of being paid by check, direct deposit or by payroll card.

Blasting News > Politics > 2017 > 05 > Lloyds Bank will REMAIN in the UK, despite Brexit, says chairman Lloyds Bank will REMAIN in the UK, despite Brexit, says chairman The chairman of Lloyds Bank mocks Remainers' claims Britain will struggle post-Brexit Matt Snape Expert in Politics M. Snape Follow Following Published on: 27 May 2017 27 May 2017 Published on 27/05/2017 The chairman of Lloyds Bank mocks Brexit doom predictions Advertisements Lloyds Bank becomes the first financial institution to commit to the UK as its chairman expressed confidence in Britain's ability to thrive, post-#Brexit. London's domination as the globe's financial hub will not be threatened by Brexit, Lord Norman Blackwell has said. Lord Blackwell has mocked numerous doomsday predictions by different experts about Britain's prospects outside the #European Union. Lord Blackwell, who supported leaving the EU during last year's referendum, said London's financial foundations will ensure the Capital is resilient if the markets jitter once negotiations to leave the superbloc start. 'The Capital will survive' He said the Capital will survive, regardless of the threats made by numerous companies to vacate the UK since June 23rd 2016. Advertisements Advertisements Many organisations have panicked since Prime Minister Theresa May said she will quit her negotiations with the EU, should they fail to agree on a free trade agreement. This would mean Britain and the superbloc would have to trade on World Trade Organisation rules, which the markets fear would be worse than the deal the UK gets from the EU's Single Market. 'London is like a Jenga tower' The chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, warned London is like a Jenga tower. He added that if one brick falls down, who knows how many more will follow. However, Lord Blackwell mocked his HSBC counterpart's remarks, saying the Capital is considerably stronger than a Jenga tower due to its history of financial success. He compared the Capital to the Tower of London due to its solid foundations. The Chief Executive of Lloyds Bank, Antonio Horta Osorio, repeated his boss's claims. Advertisements But HSBC is not the only financial institution that fails to share Lloyds' confidence in Britain's post-Brexit prosperity. Insurers Legal & General and Aviva have threatened to move some operations to the Republic of Ireland because of Britain's EU exit. Dublin has offered British companies incentives to shift their activities to EIRE, particularly unfettered access to the EU's Single Market. Many British firms feel access to the Single Market will be jeopardised by leaving the EU, regardless of the Prime Minister's ability to agree a free trade deal with the superbloc. L&G assured staff they will not be made redundant as a consequence of this decision. L&G said this was part of their strategy to ensure that they continue to provide a service to their clients, regardless of Brexit. Reuters reported Aviva said on Friday it would transform its Irish life and general insurance branches into subsidiaries. Asset manager M&G, which is owned by Prudential, revealed plans to establish a fund management company in Luxembourg, while Legg Mason said it also intends to relocate to Dublin. Advertisements Another asset manager, Standard Life, said it may well choose to scarper to the Irish capital as well in order to preserve its EU activities. JPMorgan has already done so as it bought a building in Dublin to employ 1,000 staff. 'Ireland's financial strength' Ireland's Jobs Minister, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, welcomed the news numerous British companies wish to cross the border to EIRE, saying it demonstrated Ireland's financial strength. Martin Shanahan, the head of the IDA Ireland, which is responsible for attracting foreign investment on behalf of the Irish Government, said this was a signal of Ireland's ability to attract businesses without causing significant disruption to the market. Many EU countries have attempted to disrupt Brexit by providing British businesses with the opportunity to re-establish themselves in their financial cities. Spain's Basque region is a typical example of an area of Europe that has thrived from post-Brexit uncertainty. Many Basques work in Britain in the science, technology and engineering sections. Despite this, many of them have returned to Spain since Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23rd 2016. Ivan Jimanez, the head of Bizkaia Talent, an organisation that attempts to prevent highly-skilled Basques from relocating abroad, said many of them are returning home from the UK. #Politics Read more Chosen for you President Duterte visits Russia in a changing world environment MG Singh Jeremy Corbyn questions the effectiveness of UK's war on terror Anita Alig General election campaigning resumes following Manchester bombing Ben Sherlock President Duterte visits Russia in a changing world environment MG Singh Top Videos of the Day Showbiz & Tv 2017 GLAAD Awards New York: the winners [VIDEO] Study shows talk show hosts made 1,060 jokes about Trump in his first 100 days [VIDEO] 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' Review: Fun, exciting and surprisingly emotional [VIDEO] Michael Moore endorses Dwayne Johnson for President in 2020 [VIDEO] Celebrities who have died so far in 2017 [VIDEO] ‘Avatar’s four sequels finally get release dates [VIDEO] Video:Alec Baldwin reveals how he gets into character as Donald Trump for ‘SNL’ Chance The Rapper will donate $1 million to public schools in Chicago Margot Robbie cast as Maid Marian in new Robin Hood movie Katy Perry fans are certainly in for a treat Advertisements ﻿ Advertisements Chosen for you Salman Abedi: here’s what we know about him Ben Sherlock Manchester Arena attack: another possible accomplice has been arrested Ben Sherlock Theresa May and the Aged Pressure Cooker (Part Two) Bob Robertson Indian army tackles stone pelters in Kashmir valley in a novel way MG Singh Blasting SA, IDI CHE-247.845.224, Palazzo Mercurio, Piazza Colonnello Bernasconi 5 - 6830 Chiasso (Switzerland) - © 2013-2022 The Blasting News Data Security and Privacy | Editorial policy | How to contact us What do you think?
