However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

(NYSE:JPM) said he is optimistic about the global economy and the prospects for regulatory reform in the US under President Donald Trump. “Japan is growing more than it has grown in 15 years, Europe is doing well all things considered, America is chugging along,” Mr. Dimon said in an exclusive interview last Saturday in Riyadh, where he attended a Saudi-US CEO Forum held to coincide with President Trump’s visit to the Kingdom. “Even the IMF, which is always warning about stuff, is saying the world will grow faster than expected.” Mr. Dimon said he’s comfortable about JPMorgan’s future given its positioning in emerging markets like Saudi Arabia, which is moving to privatize assets and gaining increased attention from international investment banks seeking advisory mandates. He also signaled that the bank is unlikely to boost its market share in some businesses even further after recent gains, and repeated his call for fine-tuning bank regulation in the US “The Trump administration wants to deregulate certain things, and most of us in business think that regulations have been holding back growth,” Dimon said. “I’m still optimistic that you will have some regulatory reform. Even my Democratic friends understand that it makes sense to look at what was done, what can be done better, what can simplify the burden on businesses.” To read about the bank’s most recent earnings, click here. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that breaking up the biggest banks would be a “huge mistake,” just weeks after President Trump said his administration was reviewing whether a split made sense. Some Trump Administration officials suggested they are in favor of Congress passing an updated version of the Depression era Glass-Steagall law that split commercial and investment banking. It was repealed in Y 1999. “When they’re talking about Glass-Steagall, they’re saying, would you regulate smaller banks differently than the bigger banks, and that’s perfectly understandable,” Mr. Dimon said. “I don’t think it’s going to stop our ability to compete.” In April, the bank beat analysts’ Q-1 profit estimates on better-than-expected trading results and lending margins. Trading revenue rose for a Q-4, the longest streak in at least 10 years, with a 17% advance in fixed income and a surprise increase for equities. “It will be hard to gain” further share in fixed income, Mr. Dimon said. Mr. Dimon also said the bank may consider making acquisitions in financial technology or payment processing in the future, though he’s not considering any deals at the moment. “There is no area we can’t grow organically,” he said.

British shares fell slightly on Tuesday as losses among miners more than offset stronger banks, while solid earnings results among mid-cap companies drove the FTSE 250 to a fresh all-time high. The FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies ended down 0.15 percent, reversing earlier gains but still near last Tuesday's record level of 7,533.70 points, while the FTSE 250 added 0.04 percent to reach 19,920.12 points. "I think there are reasons why the market can go higher from here. It doesn't look expensive versus earnings growth, and it doesn't look expensive in historical terms," said Callum Abbot, UK equity fund manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. "The market is trading at 15 times forward earnings, which doesn't seem unreasonable given you are looking at earnings growth in the mid-teens." He pointed also to the index's yield being relatively higher than other developed equity markets. Blue-chip gains were underpinned by banks RBS and Barclays, and defence contractor Babcock. Babcock rose 2.9 percent, the biggest gainer on the FTSE, after a positive note from Deutsche Bank saying the stock could rebound if the firm reports solid results on Wednesday. Among top gainers, EasyJet rose 2.5 percent after a top-rated RBC analyst upgraded the stock, saying the airline had reached its profit nadir, and pointing to an expanding gap of strong customer rankings versus competitors. The airline's shares recovered all the lost ground since a badly-received earnings update last week sent the stock tumbling. Miners dragged on the index after shares in conglomerate Noble Group sold off sharply in Singapore, with the firm forced to halt trading after a 32 percent plunge as ratings agency S&P downgraded it on weak cash flows and profitability. Glencore, BHP, Rio Tinto and Randgold Resources all fell between 0.6 and 1.6 percent. Merlin, which runs London attractions including Madame Tussauds waxworks and the aquarium and is exposed to tourism, was among the biggest fallers, down 1.5 percent after Monday's deadly attack in Manchester. The European travel and leisure sector < .SXTP> was down 0.3 percent. More domestically focused mid-cap stocks outperformed large-caps again, hitting a fresh record high of 19,984.66 points during the session as company results impressed. Home emergency insurance provider Homeserve surged more than 10 percent to a record high after its full-year results beat expectations. "Homeserve has increased investment in its front line staff and network," said Liberum analysts, adding that the firm's acquisition of online trader listings website Checkatrade in February could boost its access to an as yet untapped clientele. Britain's biggest sandwich maker Greencore jumped 7.3 percent after its results came in ahead of expectations, alleviating investors' concerns about inflation denting consumer appetite, with what Jefferies analysts called 'reassuring commentary' around inflation recovery. Small-cap tile retailer Topps Tiles was less upbeat about the economy, pointing to a challenging trading environment and saying full-year profit would come in at the low end of analysts' expectations. Its shares fell 6.6 percent, the top small-cap losers. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Despite rising U.S. supplies in recent months, the coming driving season is expected to help ease the glut, and with energy underperforming this year, the energy master limited partnerships (MLPs) look like a very good place to be. In a new research report, JPMorgan remains positive on the larger diversified MLPs and the report noted this: We maintain our positive view on the group given upside leverage to increasing domestic crude oil and natgas production, improved financial health, and strong diversification across the midstream value chain. Moreover, the group currently Offers an attractive 7%+ yield, notably more income than the 3.4%/4.0% yields Of Utilities and REITs. Four diversified MLPs are rated Outperform at JPMorgan, and all look like good values for growth and income investors at current levels. Enterprise Products Partners This is one of the largest publicly traded partnerships and a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) once again, despite the energy slump, recently raised its distribution 1%. The company maintains a very good long-term position in the market. It provides many of its services on the basis of long-term, fixed-fee contracts, insulating against some of the wilder swings of the commodities that it trades in. One reason why many analysts may like the stock might be its distribution coverage ratio. The company’s distribution coverage ratio is well above one times, making it a relatively less risky MLP. Its distributions have grown for several quarters, and last quarter Enterprise Products announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared an increase in the quarterly cash distribution paid to partners to $0.415 per common unit, or $1.66 per unit on an annualized basis. JPMorgan noted this in the report: The company should benefit from the numerous projects placed into service recently and the upcoming ‘big five’ (Midland-Echo, PDH, Frac 9, Shin Oak, iBDH) projects. Moreover, the integrated value chain with high barriers to entry continues to spawn attractive downstream projects servicing growing petroleum/chemical needs and also stands to capitalize on Permian processing and oil/gas takeaway needs. Investors receive a 6.07% distribution. The JPMorgan price target for the units is $33, and the Wall Street consensus target is $32.96. The stock closed Monday at $27.33. Energy Transfer Partners This stock was acquired by Sunoco Logistics Partners last year. Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (NYSE: ETP) engages in the natural gas midstream and intrastate transportation and storage businesses in the United States. The company’s Intrastate Transportation and Storage segment transports natural gas from various natural gas producing areas, and through ET fuel system and HPL system. It owns and operates 7,500 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines and three natural gas storage facilities in Texas. Its Interstate Transportation and Storage segment provides natural gas transportation and storage services; owns and operates approximately 12,300 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline; and has interests in various natural gas pipelines. The Midstream segment gathers, compresses, treats, blends, processes and markets natural gas. It owns and operates 35,000 miles of in service natural gas, 31 natural gas processing plants, 21 natural gas treating facilities and four natural gas conditioning facilities. The report noted: With the dust settling post the merger with Sunoco Logistics (helps B/S & coverage post cut) and mega project execution derisking in the rear view mirror (Rover, DAPL), the company has passed crucial hurdles, which we believe the market fails to credit. We expect large size, diversification, vertical integration and contributions from high quality projects will benefit ETP. Execution remains the focus from here. Unitholders receive a 9.14% distribution. JPMorgan has a $30 price target, close to the consensus target of $30.86. The stock closed Monday at $23.42.

Additional Information about the Offers The tender offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 22, 2017 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and a related Letter of Transmittal the “Letter of Transmittal”), which set forth a more detailed description of the Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase (and any amendments or supplements thereto), the Third-Party Purchasers will only accept for purchase as many of the 2020-2021 Notes as the Third-Party Purchasers can purchase with cash up to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment and the Company will only accept for purchase as many of the 2023-2029 Notes as the Company can purchase with cash up to the Company Maximum Tender Payment and the applicable Tender Cap. If purchasing all of the validly tendered Notes of a series of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any Settlement Date would cause the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and any Tender Cap, as applicable, to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that Settlement Date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that Settlement Date, such that the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and the Tender Caps, as applicable, will not be exceeded. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration for Notes of that series (which is equal to the Total Consideration minus the applicable Early Tender Premium) (as set forth in the applicable table above). In addition, Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date. Any Third-Party Offer may be extended or amended without a corresponding extension or amendment of any other Third-Party Offer or the Company Offers, and vice versa. Subject to the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Date (the “Early Settlement Date”), the Third-Party Purchasers expect to purchase any 2020-2021 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date.

Subject to the application of the Tender Caps, the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Early Settlement Date, the Company expects to purchase any 2023-2029 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date. The maximum aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) of 2023-2029 Notes that will be purchased on the Early Settlement Date will not exceed the applicable Tender Cap and is subject to the Company Maximum Tender Payment. The Early Settlement Date will be determined at the option of the Purchasers and is currently expected to occur on June 7, 2017, subject to all conditions to the Offers having been satisfied or waived by the applicable Purchaser(s) with respect to such purchases. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will not purchase any 2020-2021 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will purchase any remaining 2020-2021 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Expiration Date (the “Final Settlement Date” and each of the Early Settlement Date and Final Settlement Date, a “Settlement Date”), subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will not purchase any 2023-2029 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will purchase any remaining 2023-2029 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Tender Caps, the application of the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Final Settlement Date, subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

The Company may also increase, decrease or eliminate any of the Tender Caps, in each case, without extending the deadline for withdrawal or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of holders of Notes, subject to applicable law.

Additional Information about the Offers The tender offers are being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 22, 2017 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and a related Letter of Transmittal the “Letter of Transmittal”), which set forth a more detailed description of the Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase (and any amendments or supplements thereto), the Third-Party Purchasers will only accept for purchase as many of the 2020-2021 Notes as the Third-Party Purchasers can purchase with cash up to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment and the Company will only accept for purchase as many of the 2023-2029 Notes as the Company can purchase with cash up to the Company Maximum Tender Payment and the applicable Tender Cap. If purchasing all of the validly tendered Notes of a series of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level on any Settlement Date would cause the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and any Tender Cap, as applicable, to be exceeded, the amount of that series of Notes purchased on that Settlement Date will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of that series of Notes tendered in respect of that Settlement Date, such that the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment or Company Maximum Tender Payment and the Tender Caps, as applicable, will not be exceeded. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 19, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated.

In addition, Holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date. Any Third-Party Offer may be extended or amended without a corresponding extension or amendment of any other Third-Party Offer or the Company Offers, and vice versa. Subject to the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Date (the “Early Settlement Date”), the Third-Party Purchasers expect to purchase any 2020-2021 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase at or prior to the Early Tender Date.

If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will not purchase any 2020-2021 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2020-2021 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the Third-Party Purchasers will purchase any remaining 2020-2021 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Third-Party Maximum Tender Payment, the application of the 2020-2021 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Third-Party Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Third-Party Purchasers with respect to such purchases, on a date following the Expiration Date (the “Final Settlement Date” and each of the Early Settlement Date and Final Settlement Date, a “Settlement Date”), subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes purchased on the Early Settlement Date equals the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will not purchase any 2023-2029 Notes on the Final Settlement Date. If the aggregate purchase price of 2023-2029 Notes tendered on the Early Tender Date is less than the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Company will purchase any remaining 2023-2029 Notes that have been validly tendered by the Expiration Date, subject to the Company Maximum Tender Payment, the Tender Caps, the application of the 2023-2029 Acceptance Priority Levels and all conditions to the Company Offers having been satisfied or waived by the Company with respect to such purchases, on the Final Settlement Date, subject to proration as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

The Company may also increase, decrease or eliminate any of the Tender Caps, in each case, without extending the deadline for withdrawal or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of holders of Notes, subject to applicable law.

(Photo: PAT CROWE II, AP) 189 CONNECTTWEET 22 LINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORE Victims of Bernard Madoff's huge Ponzi scheme have so far received no repayments from the company the Department of Justice tapped to distribute $4 billion recovered from the notorious fraud. Nearly 8½ years after Madoff's arrest, RCB Fund Services LLC is still working to finalize reviews and recommendations for 63,580 claims covering $67.8 billion in reported losses. In a January update posted on the fund's website, special master Richard Breeden, whose company was hired to distribute the funds, wrote: "We were unable to initiate our first payout in 2016 as we had hoped because of the volume and complexity of claims." "However, we now expect that the initial distribution will take place sometime in 2017 and will be larger than we had anticipated," wrote Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He added that the fund was expected to make "two or more cash distributions for approved claims." Although fraud victims have received nothing from the fund, Breeden's company has been paid $38.8 million for its work, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing records released by the government in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. RCB Fund Services did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. As of January, the company similarly had not yet distributed hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for investors hurt by misrepresentations from BP after the explosion of its Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and an unrelated case in which JPMorgan Chase settled allegations that it misstated some financial results. The delays highlight the challenges in verifying compensation claims filed by people and companies who say they lost money in complex cases of alleged wrongdoing. File photo taken in 2009 shows Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff leaving a Manhattan federal court hearing in New York City.  (Photo: Mario Tama, Getty Images) Madoff surrendered in December 2008. The surrender came as his investment fund teetered toward collapse when clients tried to get their  money back amid the financial crisis. The former Nasdaq chairman was sentenced to 150 years in prison in 2009 after he pleaded guilty to fraud charges and admitted he had used funds from some investors to pay others — all while living a life of luxury. Madoff gets 150-year sentence as victims applaud - USATODAY.com The roughly $17.5 billion fraud devastated thousands of ordinary investors, charities, celebrities and pension funds that had entrusted their money to Madoff. The Department of Justice appointed Breeden as special master for identifying and repaying Madoff scam victims fund in 2012. The fund largely consists of $2.2 billion seized in 2010 from the estate of deceased investor Jeffry Picower, one of Madoff's favored clients, and $1.7 billion JPMorgan paid for failing to alert authorities to warning signs of fraud in his account at the bank. In contrast with the repayment delay, a separate effort launched by the investment industry-financed Securities Investor Protection Corporation has amassed nearly $11.6 billion in Madoff-related recoveries and agreements and has distributed just over $9 billion to burned investors so far. That effort is led by court-appointed trustee Irving Picard, whose law firm has received millions of dollars from the fund for the recovery work. A 2014 court order created the $525 million BP Fair Fund and appointed Breeden's firm to serve as the distributor of the money, which came from a settlement the energy giant reached with the SEC. A January 2017 case status update posted on the fund's website said more than 70,000 investor claims had been received. "As with all such distributions, we must know the final amount of all claims before we can determine the actual payout percentage on eligible losses," the posting stated. "Once that is determined, cash distributions can commence." The JPMorgan Fair Fund was created in 2013 as the bank agreed to a $200 million SEC settlement of allegations that it misstated financial results and lacked effective internal controls to detect and prevent traders from overvaluing investments. A January 2017 update posted on the fund's website announced the completion of nearly 125,000 compensation claim reviews and said determination notices would be sent to each claimant. "Upon receipt and review of any responses to the Determination Notices, we will be closer to determining the final amount of all claims, which is required before we can determine the actual payout percentage on eligible losses," the posting stated.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Growing Banking Access Movement Stakeholders Gather in Washington, DC NEW YORK, May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund) today hosted the 2017 Bank On National Conference in Washington, DC. The banking access movement’s conference brought together key stakeholders from multiple sectors across the country: local Bank On coalition program leads and their community partners, city administrators, financial institutions large and small, federal banking regulators, national nonprofit organizations, philanthropic partners, consumer advocates, and more. Keynote addresses were delivered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Senior Deputy Comptroller for Compliance and Community Affairs Grovetta Gardineer. During the day-long conference at Washington, D.C.’s Newseum, CFE Fund leaders revealed the growing list of financial institutions across the country offering safe and affordable transaction accounts certified as meeting Bank On National Account Standards. The CFE Fund unveiled a national Bank On data portal into which financial institutions with certified accounts could report basic information underscoring the vitality of the accounts. Other discussion topics included innovations in safe and affordable financial products; strategies for banking access connectivity; and reflections on coalition banking access success strategies, including through summer youth employment programs. In addition, the CFE Fund presented a number of resources to help local Bank On coalitions better connect residents to safe, affordable mainstream banking products, including a coalition Playbook, coalition capacity grants, and a new national Fellowship opportunity. Local Bank On coalitions across the country, largely led by local government, work to expand access to appropriate financial products and services to the over 65 million people outside of the mainstream financial system who rely on alternative, costly financial services.  „Thanks to the hard work of our many partners, today’s national Bank On Conference is filled with exciting progress and a truly committed, multi-sector banking access community,” said Jonathan Mintz, President and CEO, Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund. „More and more financial institutions are now offering accounts certified as meeting Bank On National Account Standards, we’re making enormous strides on constructive approaches to both data reporting and banking connectivity strategies, and local leaders are redoubling their successful approaches to vibrant coalitions.” „Bank On National Account Standards have been a game changer, thanks to the CFE Fund’s leadership,” said Naomi Camper, Head of Nonprofit Engagement at JPMorgan Chase, Bank On’s seed funder. „JPMorgan Chase is proud to partner with CFE Fund to build the capacity of local governments and nonprofits to work with banks to promote asset building and financial empowerment.” „We’re committed to supporting the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund and its ongoing efforts to provide access to responsible financial products and solutions for families across the U.S.,” said Angie Lathrop, Community Affairs executive, Bank of America and Bank On programmatic supporter. „Connecting people and communities to financial resources is an important part of building financial security to plan for a more stable future.”  „At Wells Fargo, we share the CFE Fund’s commitment to strengthening the economic viability of our communities, and to offering accounts and services that meet the financial needs of the underserved,” said Mike Rizer, director of Community Relations at Wells Fargo and Bank On programmatic supporter. „Today’s conference was a powerful display of that shared commitment, and we’re proud to be a sponsor of this important event. We’re also proud of our recent investment in the Bank On program, which will provide seed funding for the new Bank On Fellows program. Together, we will help provide safe, affordable financial services to underserved families across the country.” The goal of Bank On is to ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable financial products and services. The Bank On National Account Standards identify critical product features for appropriate bank or credit union accounts, making it easier for local coalitions across the country to connect consumers to accounts that meet their needs. Core account features include low costs, no overdraft fees, robust transaction capabilities such as a debit or prepaid card, and online bill pay.  Earlier this year, the CFE Fund announced a streamlined process through which financial institutions can submit online for certification, at no charge, accounts that they believe meet the Bank On National Account Standards. At the Conference, the CFE Fund announced that 9 financial institutions now have accounts that meet Bank On National Account Standards; these accounts are now available at 24,137 branches in 49 states and Washington, DC. Newly certified accounts include: Dart Bank’s Bank On Checking Account, First Commonwealth Bank’s SmartPay Card, First National Bank’s Access Debit Account, and KeyBank’s Hassle-Free Account. These newly-certified accounts join Bank of America’s Safe Balance Banking account, Chase Liquid, Citi’s Access Account, U.S. Bank’s Safe Debit Account, and Wells Fargo’s EasyPay Card. Local Bank On coalitions will be able to use certification program to identify other local and regional financial institutions, including both banks and credit unions, that offer accounts that meet the Standards. „Dart Bank is proud of our partnership with Bank On,” said Sally Rae, Executive Vice President, Dart Bank. „As a community bank we feel a responsibility to help individuals re-establish themselves financially, and this program helps us to do this.” „Now more than ever, people look to cities to ensure everyone has a safe, affordable place to keep their money and build wealth,” said José Cisneros, Treasurer, City and County of San Francisco. „Since the pioneering launch of Bank On San Francisco ten years ago, we have helped over 75,000 people open their first account and move into the financial mainstream. Now is the time to double down on this progress. San Francisco is proud to lead a strong coalition of nonprofit and financial institution partners committed to supporting all our residents achieve greater financial security and prosperity under Bank On.” The CFE Fund also announced the release of new Bank On resources, including an updated Bank On website and new chapters in the Bank On Coalition Playbook. The resources in the Playbook cover a range of topics, including constructively partnering with financial institutions. The Playbook, available online, now includes a new chapter on the Bank On Listserv; previous chapters include Bank On National Account Standards (2017-2018), Bank On Guiding Principles, and a partnership template Bank On Coalition Financial Institution Partnerships: Statement of Principles. Additionally, the CFE Fund highlighted the recent announcement of a competitively-awarded Bank On Fellowship opportunity, supported by Wells Fargo, which will provide match funding to up to five Bank On coalitions to support a full-time staff position for two years, a „Fellow,” to lead coalition activities. The Bank On Fellowship Program focuses on building a multi-city cohort of successful Bank On program coordinators, equipping them with the training, tools, and resources to make significant advancements in local banking access efforts and at the same time generating best practices for other coalitions around the country. The Bank On Fellowship application is open now; coalitions are encouraged to apply here. The CFE Fund leads the national Bank On movement, supporting city coalitions working to connect individuals and families to the financial mainstream through partnerships between local governments, financial institutions, and community organizations. To learn more about Bank On and the National Account Standards click here, or follow the conversation on Twitter @CFEfund #BankOn.

JPMorgan, one of the largest wealth managers in the world with asset under management of over $1.7 trillion, alone has flagged these “religious and border disputes” regarding investments in India in at least eight regulatory filings made by its various funds so far. Besides, a number of other funds, including the India Fund managed by Aberdeen Asset Management, which has more than $380 billion of assets under management, have listed similar “risks” in their regulatory filings made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other such funds include Eaton Vance Greater India Fund, Mathews International Funds, Alps Funds (Financial Investors Trust), Franklin Templeton International Trust, Global X Funds and iShares Trust (managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors). Besides, Wasatch Funds Trust, Arthur J Gallagher & Co and Causeway Capital Management Trust have also flagged similar concerns. When contacted, senior officials at some of these funds and other experts said such risk factors follow a generic pattern in regulatory filings by various companies and investors and not much should be read into them, but they admitted that religious conflicts and Kashmir dispute remain an overhang. While cross-border tension continues in the Kashmir region, the government has been trying to send across a positive message to the world and some saw hosting of the GST Council meeting in Srinagar last week as a step in that direction. In a filing made by JPMorgan Trust II on May 18, the fund said, “Religious and border disputes persist in India. Moreover, India has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighbouring countries such as Pakistan.” IT major Cognizant, which has a substantial portion of its assets and operations in India, said in one of its SEC filings that the potential for hostilities between India and Pakistan “has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in India and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment, including events in and related to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria”.   What the companies think JP MORGAN Religious and border disputes persist in India.

Activists aim to "make hate unprofitable." By Mattea Kramer / TomDispatch May 23, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: a katz / Shutterstock.com In normal times, Dee from New York would have ordered her copy of The Handmaid’s Tale from Amazon, but these are not normal times. Amazon is on the Grab Your Wallet list, a campaign to boycott retailers that sell Trump family products, which began as a response to the video revealing our now-president’s penchant for grabbing women "by the pussy." Dee bought her book from a smaller retailer instead. Since Donald Trump’s election in November, and especially since his January inauguration, hundreds of small and not-so-small organizations have sprung up to oppose the president.  They joined the ranks of established left-leaning and liberal groups already revving up their engines to fight the administration. Among all the ways you can now voice your dissent, though, there’s one tactic that this president will surely understand: economic resistance aimed at his own businesses and those of his children. He may not be swayed by protesters filling the streets, but he does speak the language of money. Through a host of tactics -- including boycotting stores that carry Trump products, punishing corporations and advertisers that underwrite the administration’s agenda, and disrupting business-as-usual at Trump companies -- protesters are using the power of the purse to demonstrate their opposition and have planned a day of resistance against his brand on June 14th. Such economic dissent may prove to be an especially apt path of resistance, especially for the millions of Americans who reside in blue states and have struggled with a sense of powerlessness following the election. After all, it’s not immediately obvious how to take effective political action in the usual American way when your legislators already agree with you. But what blue-state dwellers lack in political sway they make up for in economic clout, since blue states have, on average, greater household incomes and more purchasing power than their red-state compatriots. The impact of coordinated blue-state boycotts could be enormous. That’s why Grab Your Wallet, along with Color of Change, a racial-justice group, and numerous other organizations are encouraging individuals to see their purchasing power as political muscle. “It was close at the polls, but it’s not close at the cash register,” Shannon Coulter, a founder of Grab Your Wallet, told me recently. And yet, even as throngs of organizations and hundreds of thousands of individuals throw their energy into economic tactics intended to weaken the president, it’s still an open question whether this type of resistance -- or, more specifically, its current implementation -- can precipitate anything in the way of meaningful change. “A Sprawling Landscape of Resistance” At first glance, Grab Your Wallet is a modest website: a Google spreadsheet that lists about 50 companies to boycott.  Included are the department stores Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Lord & Taylor, as well as online retailers like Overstock.com, Zappos, and Amazon, all of which sell some type of Trump swag. (The precise number of companies listed continues to decline, as retailers dump the Trump brand.) The site gets an impressive two million unique visitors every month, and when I spoke with Coulter, she told me that 22 retailers had dropped Trump products since the start of the boycott. She believes that this is just the beginning. “I don’t think we’ll see the full impact of the boycott until summer, because of how the retail cycle works,” she explained. The department store Nordstrom, for instance, the biggest company to date to drop the Ivanka Trump brand, sold through its existing inventory before indicating that it would not reorder. That announcement even attracted attention from the president, who tweeted: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Color of Change has long deployed strategies of economic resistance, specifically by going after advertisers who underwrite hate. Now that Trump is in the White House, Rashad Robinson, the group’s executive director, told me that they’re focusing on the role of corporate enablers “who’ve made this administration possible.” He described a strategy in which his organization carefully selects a corporate target and then rallies its million-plus members to participate in a campaign designed to tarnish the company’s brand -- unless its executives make more ethical advertising choices. Color of Change played a role in the recent ouster of Bill O’Reilly from Fox News by helping to influence some of the more than 50 major advertisers who pulled their financial support from his top-rated program. After advertisers fled, Fox gave O’Reilly the boot. Progressive groups are proving increasingly savvy when it comes to designing such consumer-driven tactics. The Center for Popular Democracy and the immigrant-rights group Make the Road New York recently co-launched a campaign called Corporate Backers of Hate, which targets Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, The Walt Disney Company, and a handful of other corporations that have provided various forms of support for Trump and his agenda. Wells Fargo, for instance, has lent millions of dollars to the president’s companies, is an investor in immigrant detention centers run by private, for-profit contractors, and has loaned money to developers for the Dakota Access Pipeline, the 1,172-mile oil pipe that would cross Standing Rock Sioux Tribe lands in North Dakota. (Trump signed a memo authorizing that pipeline within days of taking office.) The Corporate Backers of Hate website allows protesters to bypass customer service staff at these corporations and send messages directly to top executives and board members to express their disapproval. This strategy of going after the funding underlying Trump’s network has won some early victories. Several groups have been trying to cut off the flow of advertising dollars to Breitbart, the xenophobic pseudo-news site formerly run by White House strategist Steve Bannon. Leading the charge in this work is a Twitter-based group, Sleeping Giants, with a relatively simple proposition: it asks followers to take screenshots of ads on Breitbart -- preferably next to an offensive headline -- and then tweet that screenshot to the company in the ad along with a polite message asking it to stop underwriting hate. This approach has been wildly successful; according to Sleeping Giants, thousands of advertisers have pulled out of Breitbart. Nicholas Reville is a seasoned online organizer who has become a leading figure in the campaign to, as he says, make “hate unprofitable.” He believes that the Sleeping Giants model of digital resistance represents a new and important type of political action. “It’s very, very rare that you have an activism campaign where people are doing something other than signing a petition, showing up to a rally, [or] donating money,” he told me. Instead, he pointed out, an individual can now take a discrete action on his or her personal device and actually help win a victory when an advertiser pulls out of Breitbart. Some activists are going beyond screenshots and tweets. Journalist Naomi Klein recently released a video highlighting the fact that Trump’s brand is one of his most important sources of revenue and suggesting that “jamming” the brand -- by turning it from a money-maker into a money-loser -- would be a powerful form of resistance. She mentions tactics like clogging phone lines at Trump companies or making, and then canceling, reservations at his hotels. One activist who has been working on jamming those Trump phone lines, and who spoke with me on condition of anonymity, said that resisters like her had discovered that it was surprisingly easy to disrupt the president’s businesses. “The phone lines do not have the capacity to handle even medium-volume call traffic,” she said, and assured me that there was more phone jamming planned for the future. When I asked what she hoped to achieve through this tactic, she responded that the goal was to weaken President Trump financially, politically, and in every way imaginable. “These strategies are complements to other kinds of organizing,” she went on. “None of these tactics alone are going to bring down the Trump administration... that’s not how it works. This is part of a sprawling landscape of resistance.” Easy to Resist, Hard to Win The multitude of groups, campaigns, and individuals going after Donald Trump, Trump businesses, and companies supporting him or his political agenda do indeed form a sprawling, often chaotic landscape of resistance. I receive a dozen different, mostly uncoordinated action-alert messages in my inbox daily. In the weeks immediately following the inauguration, I found all that frenetic energy strangely appealing. After a couple of months of diffuse efforts, however, I began to wonder whether such efforts would be better spent on fewer, more coordinated campaigns. While Trump oppositionists undoubtedly feel a thrill of satisfaction when Nordstrom drops Ivanka’s product line and legions of advertisers pull out of Breitbart, it’s unclear whether these are steps on the path to a revised political landscape, or whether they are just feel-good wins leading nowhere in particular. This dilemma is perhaps best exemplified by the Boycott Trump app, which has been downloaded 350,000 times. The concept behind it is similar to the one that animates Grab Your Wallet. The app is essentially a list of companies to boycott, though it includes more than 250 of them, rather than the dozens on Grab Your Wallet, many because they sponsored Trump’s NBC show The Apprentice back in 2011. I asked Nathan Lerner, who heads an organization called the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which is responsible for the app, what qualifies a company to be listed, and he said that any company connected to the president was worth listing. I then asked if his group was collaborating with other boycott efforts. “We’ve been a little frustrated with partnering,” Lerner told me. “Right now we’re seeing a ton of enthusiasm around boycotting Trump, but it’s fragmented. Folks are popping up doing great work, but they’re doing it on their own.” That seemed like a remarkably on-target summary of the situation, and Lerner’s group seemed to be an example of those working “on their own.” In search of answers, I called up Marshall Ganz, who would surely be in the hall of fame of community organizing if there were one. He worked with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s to organize California farmworkers and was an architect of Barack Obama’s organizing strategy for his presidential run in 2007. A professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School (and, full disclosure, once my professor), Ganz defines “strategy” as “how we turn what we have into what we need to get what we want.” That applies nicely to the Trump boycott concept, in which activists are trying to turn their discrete consumer power into collective influence great enough to change where our country is headed. When I mentioned to Ganz that so many different boycotts and related campaigns are happening without much coordination, he described the problem this way: “The mechanisms for starting my thing, my thing, my thing, they’re so easy in virtual space.” Bringing those initiatives together is the problem. As he pointed out, back in 2007 the San Francisco Bay Area alone had about 54 different pro-Obama groups registered online; the hard part was getting them to work together in a way that channeled their energy toward a shared goal. When it comes to fighting Donald Trump, Ganz suggested that it would be far more strategic for the many different boycott and pressure groups to pool their efforts. Were this to happen, he suggested, the anti-Trump movement could become more proactive, rather than reactive. Not all experts agree with his assessment. L.A. Kaufman is the author of the recent book, Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism. “I think that the decentralized character of the resistance gives it resilience,” she told me in a phone interview. In her view, the fact that all this activity is totally grassroots and happening outside the Democratic Party is a sign of political renewal in this country. She has a point. Yet it’s hard to see how economic resistance, surely a suitable weapon against a businessman-in-chief, can be effective without a critical mass coalescing around an agreed-upon set of actions and goals. I asked Shannon Coulter whether she’s coordinating with other campaigns, and she pointed out that Grab Your Wallet is now aligned with the organizers of the Women’s March, the vast post-inauguration protest that swept the country. Those same organizers were also the driving force behind the formation of roughly 5,500 groups of local activists who convened after the march to consider the next steps for the emerging anti-Trump movement. This alliance seemed like a promising sign. Recalling what Ganz had said about uniting groups that supported Obama in 2007, I asked Coulter whether she would ever consider merging Grab Your Wallet into a larger organization. To this, she responded in the negative. “I say that,” she explained, “because Grab Your Wallet is one of the only women-led ones in the movement.” Coulter isn’t the only one to offer such reasoning. Since the anti-Trump movement is a heterogeneous collection of groups representing women, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and lots of straight white people, there’s concern that combining efforts could result in a resistance dominated by white men who might compromise the priorities of specific groups and their constituents. In order to be effective, says Rashad Robinson of Color of Change, campaigns must carry the “moral authority of an impacted constituency.” He described situations in which white-led groups had tried to mimic campaigns led by Color of Change -- without realizing that they lacked the moral authority to do so effectively. In 2014, Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina who studies social movements, gave a TED talk titled “Online social change: easy to organize, hard to win,” in which she described the March on Washington in 1963. That historic event, where Martin Luther King delivered his famed “I Have a Dream” speech, drew 250,000 people. Tufekci underscored the significance of attracting such a crowd in 1963, when organizers used landline phones, flyers, and word of mouth, in a landscape lacking today’s easy digital tools. Fifty years ago it was nothing short of awe-inspiring to draw a quarter million people to the National Mall. “If you’re in power,” said Tufekci, “you realize that you have to take the capacity signaled by that march, not just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.” The anti-Trump movement has yet to accomplish anything so awe-inspiring. Nearly half a million people gathered in Washington for the Women’s March -- a number that climbed to more than a million when all the protests around the country were added in -- but it’s not at all clear that such numbers carry the same weight today as smaller crowds did in previous eras. Though protesters filled the streets in Washington one day after the inauguration, anti-Trump activity remains fragmented several months into his term. And when it comes to waging economic resistance against this billionaire president, the pressing question is whether innumerable people across the country, like Dee from New York, who are changing their spending habits, tweeting at advertisers, contacting chief executives, and jamming phones at Trump businesses, will do so in a way that converts their discrete actions into real influence and power. It’s still too early to tell.  Mattea Kramer is a research analyst at the National Priorities Project.

US Treasury bond yields extended their rise in late trading after a solid 2-year debt auction while euro zone shares closed higher on strong growth data. Oil prices rose slightly in volatile trading as expectations of an extension to Opec-led supply cuts and another drop in US crude inventories offset the proposal in Trump’s budget plan to roll out sales of petroleum reserves over 10 years. US crude rose 0.84 per cent to US$51.56 (RM221.37) per barrel and Brent was last at US$54.26, up 0.72 per cent on the day. Trump’s first full budget plan calls for an increase in military and infrastructure spending but also a raft of cuts, including healthcare and food assistance. “People will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending,” said Nadia Lovell, US equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 per cent, to end at 20,937.91, the S&P 500 gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.09 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,138.71. “There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,” said Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West in Denver, Colorado. Trump’s tax and spending plan in its current form is unlikely to be approved by Congress, which will craft its own. Across the euro zone, businesses showed their strongest run since 2011, according to IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for May. It matched the previous month’s 56.8, its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.25 per cent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.09 per cent. Sterling was subdued after reports showing sluggishness in the UK economy and a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester Monday night that killed 22 people and wounded dozens. “Increasingly the markets are just more and more numb to these. As bad as they are and as horrific as they are, the market immediately looks through these things and uses these as buying opportunities more than anything else,” said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. The pound was last 0.25 per cent lower at US$1.2968. Treasury debt yields rose, with some investors paring bond positions to make room for this week’s federal and corporate supply while others reduced safe-haven bond holdings in favor of stocks. There was solid demand at a US$26 billion auction of a new two-year note issue, the first part of the US$88 billion in coupon-bearing government debt supply this week. Some traders also turned cautious ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes of its May 2-3 meeting today. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note yield was 2.287 per cent, up three basis points from late on Monday, while the 30-year bond yield was more than three basis points higher at 2.949 per cent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies as its worst week of losses in a year drove some profit taking, and as investors turned their attention to today’s Fed minutes. The index rose 0.41 per cent after falling to a more than six-month low on Monday. “We haven’t heard from any Fed members clarifying or warning the market that they are on the wrong side. That’s a positive sign that June is still a go (for an interest rate hike),” said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton, sources say Chinese automaker Geely takes 49.9pc stake in Proton Proton-Geely partnership to ensure future growth of national carmaker Malaysia’s GDP growth is beyond expectations of many, says Wahid Highlights of Trump’s budget proposal Malaysia eyes sale of Proton as Dr M’s auto power dream dies IRB hits Magnum, subsidiary with RM476m penalty PM: Malaysia and Indonesia will retaliate against countries which boycott palm oil Bank Negara’s MyClear merges with MEPS to form PayNet Singapore Airlines loses as flyers swap champagne for cheap seats Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Calls for unity at Manchester vigil Reuters Video: Nicole Kidman tears up on Cannes red carpet Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Highlights of Trump’s budget proposal Wall Street edges up at open ahead Trump’s budget plan Trump’s budget proposes converting some military grants to loans Trump budget to give first look at infrastructure plan Wall Street rebounds from Trump-induced sell-off; dollar rises Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

"There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,” Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West, told Reuters. In 3.27pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 percent gain. In 3.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent. The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, up 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Home Depot and those of Walt Disney, recently down 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively for the biggest percentage drops in the Dow. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales sank 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units in April, compared with an upwardly revised 642,000 units in March. While that was a bigger slide than economists had expected, the outlook for the housing market remains solid. "Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn't changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. Indeed, fed fund futures showed that traders are cementing bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, according to Bloomberg. Minutes from the Fed’s May 2-3 meeting, slated for release on Wednesday, will be scoured for fresh clues on the timing and pace of rate hikes. Meanwhile, shares of Bunge soared, up 15.8 percent as of 3.28pm in New York, after Glencore said it “made an informal approach to Bunge Limited regarding a possible consensual business combination.” “Discussions may or may not materialise and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur,” Glencore said in the statement. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2 percent gain from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index climbed 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2 percent. Germany, the euro-zone’s largest economy, offered fresh reasons to be optimistic about the region’s outlook. Separate reports showed that the nation’s economic growth increased to 0.6 percent in the first quarter, while business confidence as measured by the Ifo institute climbed to 114.6 in May, the highest level in more than 25 years. Oil prices rose amid fresh indications that OPEC and its partners are likely to extend production cuts for another nine months when they meet on Thursday in Vienna. "Six and nine months are both proposals on the table ... we will support the majority, probably the nine months," Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

The investors are still waiting for their first checks, though. The Justice Department disclosed its payments to Richard Breeden, the Madoff Victim Fund administrator, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from Bloomberg News. Breeden's fees, which are being paid from cash in the fund, cover his work through 2016. The delay highlights how, 8½ years after Madoff's arrest, investors are still scrambling to recover money from a U.S. fund that was announced with great fanfare. Victims have recovered billions of dollars from another fund, but they have yet to be made whole. 'Very frustrating' "It's very frustrating that people are making money off us like this, using money that was recovered for victims," said Daphne Brogdon, a Food Network personality, whose family lost about $5 million in the Madoff scam. "They're eating away at whatever percentage we could possibly get." Messages left with a representative of Breeden's firm, RCB Fund Services, weren't returned. Justice Department spokeswoman Dawn Dearden declined to comment on the fees or claims process but pointed to information on the fund's website.

The compensation fund was created in December 2012 to repay thousands of Madoff's victims after the U.S. seized $2.4 billion from the estate of one of his biggest investors, the late Jeffry Picower. The fund grew by $1.7 billion following a 2014 forfeiture deal with Madoff's bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., which was accused of turning a blind eye to the scam. Breeden's hiring came months after he handed out more than $728 million to about 8,500 Adelphia Communications victims, which he described as "the largest single distribution of forfeited assets to victims in Department of Justice history." Breeden, 67, estimated in February 2016 that as many as 40,000 victims would get initial payments by the end of that year. They didn't. An update on the website in January cited the time-consuming claims process and issues with inadequate paperwork from some victims. The Justice Department is "notoriously slow" making decisions on forfeited assets, said Jon Barooshian, a white-collar defense lawyer in Boston who has dealt with forfeiture issues. "I'm surprised it's taking so long, but I don't know if the fault will fall at Richard Breeden's feet. It might be more of an internal DOJ issue," said Barooshian, who isn't involved in the Madoff case. Another's success By comparison, Irving Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation of Madoff's firm, has paid out more than $9 billion since 2009. Picard, a lawyer at Baker & Hostetler, brought numerous lawsuits to recover assets, and his fund is administered separately from Breeden's under different U.S. laws. Picard has racked up considerable fees himself, telling ABC News in 2015 that his firm might collect as much as $1 billion when all is done. He called it a "very good return on an investment." His fees are paid by the industry-financed Securities Investor Protection Corp. rather than from money recovered for victims. Breeden will eventually make recommendations to the Justice Department's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section on which claims to pay and which to deny. His firm has already been paid the $38.8 million in fees, the Justice Department said. Feeder funds Picard accepted claims only from Madoff's direct account holders. That meant customers of so-called feeder funds, which directed cash to Madoff's firm for years, weren't eligible. Feeder funds could, however, file claims with Picard and repay their investors if they received payments from the trustee. Breeden accepted claims from all Madoff investors, including feeder funds. That increased the amount of work, particularly because Madoff's records don't have any information about feeder-fund customers that could be used to verify claims. Madoff, 79, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. His victims lost a combined $17.5 billion in principal, though their final account statements totaled about $64 billion including profit from bogus trades. Two TV movies His downfall has been the subject of two TV films. In February 2016, an ABC docudrama starred Richard Dreyfuss as Madoff and Blythe Danner as his wife Ruth. This month HBO is presenting "Madoff: The Wizard of Lies." Robert De Niro is Madoff and Michelle Pfeiffer is Ruth.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Markets US equities mark 4-session gains streak as concerns over Trump ease Tuesday's gains come less than a week after US stocks posted their worst daily decline in months. By Nicole Rojas May 24, 2017 01:24 BST Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, on 18 May 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US equities closed higher Tuesday (23 May) as investors' optimism about the Trump administration rose following the White House's release of its 2018 budget proposal. The stock-index benchmarks marked their fourth straight session in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 43.08 points, or 0.2%, to close at 20,937.91. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JP Morgan Chase & Co, which suffered losses earlier in the session, added 32 points to the blue-chips gauge, MarketWatch reported. Meanwhile, a 1.3% rise in Caterpillar Inc added another nine points to the Dow. The S&P 500 index rose 4.40 points, or 0.2%, to end at 2,398.42. Gains were led by the financial and healthcare sectors, with 10 of the S&P's 11 sectors closing higher, MarketWatch reported. The Nasdaq Composite Index, meanwhile, inched up 5.09 points, or less than 0.1%, to settle at 6,138.71. The tech-heavy index marked its longest winning streak since 10 May, despite Apple shares dropping. Tuesday's gains come less than a week after equities dropped more than 1% on fears that US President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda was at risk, CNBC noted. News that Trump allegedly attempted to interfere in a federal investigation into his former national security adviser sent shockwaves throughout Wall Street. "As we get temporary spikes in volatility, ... these will continue to be buying opportunities because the fundamentals have been so strong," Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, told CNBC. Frederick noted that economic data has been solid and the latest earnings season surpassed expectations. Investors are keeping an eye on Trump's first overseas trip since becoming president. After stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel and Palestine, the president will be in Europe for the remainder of his trip. Trump's "trip overseas is definitely helping. Not so much because of what he'd done, but because he is tied up and doesn't have time to cause problems," Frederick added. The president's 2018 budget is also being eyed by investors. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told MarketWatch that Trump's budget is a "non-issue" as it is unlikely to pass Congress in its current form. "The market doesn't know what to make of it," Pavlik said. "If you're trading stocks on this budget proposal, then you're an idiot." In economic news, US flash PMI reading for services and manufacturing for May were mixed, MarketWatch reported. Manufacturing PMI dropped to an 8-month low, but services PMI jumped to a 4-month high. Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell to about 2.28% as investors prepare for the probability that tax reform may not come as soon as expected. Gold prices dropped 0.5% to settle at $1,255.50 an ounce, while the dollar traded 0.4% higher.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman While you were sleeping: Trump budget relief Wednesday, 24 May 2017, 10:59 am Article: BusinessDesk Wednesday 24 May 2017 07:55 AM While you were sleeping: Trump budget relief By Margreet Dietz May 24 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street moved higher amid initial relief about US Donald Trump’s budget plan. „There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,” Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West, told Reuters. In 3.27pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 percent gain. In 3.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent. The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, up 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Home Depot and those of Walt Disney, recently down 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively for the biggest percentage drops in the Dow. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales sank 11.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units in April, compared with an upwardly revised 642,000 units in March. While that was a bigger slide than economists had expected, the outlook for the housing market remains solid. „Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn’t changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains,” Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. Indeed, fed fund futures showed that traders are cementing bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, according to Bloomberg. Minutes from the Fed’s May 2-3 meeting, slated for release on Wednesday, will be scoured for fresh clues on the timing and pace of rate hikes. Meanwhile, shares of Bunge soared, up 15.8 percent as of 3.28pm in New York, after Glencore said it “made an informal approach to Bunge Limited regarding a possible consensual business combination.” “Discussions may or may not materialise and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur,” Glencore said in the statement. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2 percent gain from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index climbed 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2 percent. Germany, the euro-zone’s largest economy, offered fresh reasons to be optimistic about the region’s outlook. Separate reports showed that the nation’s economic growth increased to 0.6 percent in the first quarter, while business confidence as measured by the Ifo institute climbed to 114.6 in May, the highest level in more than 25 years. Oil prices rose amid fresh indications that OPEC and its partners are likely to extend production cuts for another nine months when they meet on Thursday in Vienna. „Six and nine months are both proposals on the table … we will support the majority, probably the nine months,” Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Residential construction work done in Q1 fell at its fastest pace in 16 years Moody's cuts China's credit rating, raising alarm over the country's worsening debt outlook The Aussie lives up to its reputation as a proxy for Chinese economic expectations Sigma shares plunge after the company warns profit may shrink 5% on legal wrangle European stocks rise on strong economic data, while Wall St shrugs off Trump's budget Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:47pm That's all for today - thanks everyone for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. 4:29pm Shares have salvaged some gains for the day, thanks to a small leap at the close, as investors looked past a surprise downgrade to China's credit rating by Moody's. The ASX rose 0.15 per cent to 5769.0, led by a 1.2 per cent gain in industrials.  The ratings downgrade sparked some wobbles both on Chinese bourses as well as the local market, but shares quickly recovered. But the Australian dollar, a currency market proxy for China's economy, fell about 0.5 per cent. Gains in industrials were led by testing services provider ALS, which rose 12.8 per cent, reaching its highest in 2-1/2 years during the session, after it reported an after tax profit in fiscal 2017, a turnaround from a loss a year ago. Pallets and container group Brambles also underpinned gains in industrial stocks, rising 1.9 per cent. Winners outnumbered losers two-to-one but many of the bourse's heavyweights ended the day in the red, keeping a cap on overall gains. The big miners dropped after iron ore futures pointed to another fall in the bulk commodity's spot price. BHP slipped 0.6 per cent, Rio lost 1.3 per cent and iron-ore pure-play Fortescue shed 4.75 per cent. The big banks closed mostly lower, with CBA managing to eke out a miniscule gain. The banking sector has more downside risks than upside due to stretched valuations, rising cost of funds, low credit growth and the bank tax that is likely to increase over time, Blue Ocean Equities said in a note. Also among the losers were gold stocks, with Newcrest dropping 3.6 per cent. But Sigma Healthcare faced the biggest wipe-out among top 200 stocks, plunging 31 per cent after saying that it planned legal action against the My Chemist/ Chemist Warehouse Group over an alleged breach of a supply agreement. The company warned profit could fall 5 per cent if the agreement wasn't honoured. 4:09pm It's not all bad news out of China. Here's one for the bulls: Sales of excavators in China at 5 year highs. Price of rebar steel at 5 year highs.Is there still a tail wind to the 'old economy' in China? pic.twitter.com/iGeQjZyD5B— Robert Rennie (@R0bertRennie) May 23, 2017 3:55pm Forget the levy, the banks are now a better buy than before the budget, Michael Pascoe says: When it comes to mounting a scare campaign, the big four banks' CEOs and chairmen are more Casper the Friendly Ghost than Freddy Kruger, more Pooh Bear than Chucky. Oh, they tried - brace yourself - they even wrote letters to shareholders! Yet the peasants show little sign of manning and womanning the barricades for two key reasons: nobody really believes the Big New Bank Tax won't be substantially passed on; and banks are now a better buy than they were before the budget. Westpac has identified itself as the bank that will pay the most for the levy, $370 million gross in the first year. But because the levy is a deduction, it will only cost the bank $260 million after tax. In his letter to shareholders, chairman Lindsay Maxsted suggested the $260 million, if not passed on, would knock 8 cents off last year's $1.88 annual dividend. On the Monday before the budget, Westpac shares closed at $34.08. The $1.88 dividend represents a yield of 5.5 per cent, before adding franking credits. Westpac shares finished at $30.77 on Tuesday as the market over-reacted. If the dividend is cut to $1.80, that would be a yield of 5.8 per cent. Add on the franking credits, and it's the pre-tax equivalent of a fat 8.2 per cent with the potential upside of the dividend being better than $1.80 when at least some of the levy is passed on to borrowers. And then there's ratings agency Standard & Poors adding cream to the pudding by cutting the credit ratings of the smaller banks and credit unions, thus improving the big banks' competitive position when borrowing. Here's the full article The dividend yield is even more attractive now after the market over-reacted. Photo: Paul Rovere 3:27pm The Australian dollar is feeling the China pinch, following a downgrade in the country's sovereign ratings by Moody's. The Aussie slipped nearly 0.5 per cent to as low as US74.43¢ and is currently trading just above that levek, away from a three-week peak of $US75.17¢ set yesterday. "The Aussie reaction is not necessarily a direct economic response, it's more a sentiment response," said Annette Beacher, chief macro strategist, FX and rates at TD Securities, adding that anything bad for China is seen as bad for Australia. The currency has a reputation for being the forex world's favourite proxy for China's economic fortunes. Also undermining the Aussie is a 0.7 per cent fall in domestic construction work done in the first quarter versus forecasts of a 0.2 percent decrease. The slippage follows a surprisingly hefty 13.4 percent drop in building approvals in March. Back to top 3:06pm Beijing is not amused. China's finance ministry said that the credit downgrade by Moody's was based on inappropriate methodology, saying it was exaggerating difficulties facing the economy and underestimating reform efforts. Moody's downgraded China's credit ratings by one notch earlier today, saying it expects the financial strength of the world's second-biggest economy will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. In what will be viewed as a rebuke of the so called China model, Moody's downgraded the country's foreign and local currency ratings to A1, but said the outlook was stable. It is the first time the agency has downgraded China since 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre when the economy slipped into recession amid Beijing's international isolation. The ministry said China's government debt will rise at a reasonable pace and rising debt levels from local government financing vehicles and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will not add to existing government debt. Government-linked economists were also quick to hit back. Xu Hongcai, the deputy chief economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, said the rating downgrade did not "reflect the truth". "Moody's does not understand the situation," he told the AFR. "China's economy is growing much faster than most other countries." The chief economist at China's Industrial Bank, Lu Zhengwei, said the downgrade was caused by a rising number of loan defaults in recent months. "It looks bad at the moment but it is beneficial for the long-term development of the economy," he said. "The defaults are due to the government's hard line on not providing bail-outs." Not so bullish. Moody's has renewed doubts about China's financial system. Photo: Qilai Shen 2:44pm Sell in May has been a useful adage, but it does depend a bit on what you dump. It's clearly not been a month for the blue chips, with the big banks leading the sell-off in the market's heavyweights. Overall the ASX 20 index is down nearly 5 per cent since the start of the month, nearly double the benchmark ASX 200's more moderate 2.7 per cent loss. Last 7yrs the #ASX200 has been down May/June 100% of the time avg -5.3% 2017 we are down -2.58% with everyone expecting #selloff #knownknown— Matt Felsman (@mattfelsman) May 23, 2017 But the relative outperformance is even more obvious among smaller stocks, with the Small Caps indexs down just a bit over 1 per cent. Is the tide once again turning for small caps after their sell-off since last August? Maybe, but it's also still early days. The switch from small caps into blue chips went on for about eight months, but in the past three weeks it has started to reverse, says Bell Potter's Richard Coppleson, who provided the attached chart. "We know why – the banks have had huge rallies – I went aggressively to buying banks in August last year and two weeks ago pushed hard a "trading sell"(only a 'trading sell' as I think they will bounce back – but not until later in the year," he says. Coppo says that instos have been taking money out of the big banks and resource stocks and putting it into the likes of Suncorp, IAG, QBE or Bank of Queensland. "But they ignore the Small Ords stocks where the bargains are aplenty." Coppo predicts that once the tax loss selling in late May, early June is done many small caps will enjoy "huge rallies". 1:59pm In further reaction to the cut to China's credit rating, the country's stocks dropped more than 1 per cent before recouping some of the losses. The downgrade by Moody's aggravated a market already worried by tighter regulation, rising borrowing costs and signs of an economic slowdown. Moody's downgraded China's long-term local and foreign currency issuer ratings before financial markets started trading, citing expectations that the country's financial strength would erode in coming years. The downgrade has had "a negative psychological impact on the market," said Tian Weidong, strategist at Kaiyuan Securities, adding Beijing's campaign to clean up the financial system was already driving up market rates and causing retail investors to panic. China's benchmark stock indexes fell more than 1 per cent shortly after the market opened, before recovering some losses. By the lunch break, the CSI300 index was down 0.3 per cent to 3,412.76 points while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4 per cent to 3,050.94 points. The market has already been hobbled in recent weeks with signs that Beijing's regulatory campaign targeting shadow banking and risky investment in the financial system is pushing up short-term borrowing costs and threatening to slow the economy. In a rare sign of tightening liquidity in the interbank market, the one-year Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) is at 4.3137 per cent, exceeding the one-year Loan Prime Rate at 4.3 per cent. Morgan Stanley said in a report today that China's interbank interest rates can rise by another 40-50 basis points from current levels in the coming months, to keep pace with the Fed's tightening moves. Mainland Chinese shares fell across the board, but reaction to the Moody's downgrade was more muted in Hong Kong, where the benchmark index was little changed.  Another blow for China investors. Photo: AP 1:38pm Ride-sharing service Uber is a ponzi scheme that will go belly-up within the next 10 years, according to Magellan Financial Group's chief executive Hamish Douglass. In a candid interview at the Stockbrokers and Financial Advisers Conference in Sydney, Douglass lamented the dramatic losses awaiting Uber investors as automated driving technology permeates the market. "I see Uber as one of the stupidest businesses in history," said Douglass. "The probability of this business not going bankrupt in a decade is like 1 per cent." Pointing to the high-cost owner-driver model of Uber's supply side and the almost "valueless" user base, Douglass described the San Francicso-based business's capital-raising style as a "ponzi scheme". "They've got no advantage over anyone else when it comes to autonomous driving technology. They tried to steal it from Google, they've ended up in court. That whole side of the business is falling apart. It's constantly losing money and it's capital-raising strategy is a ponzi scheme. "All they do is keep increasing their private market valuation and someone always says, I'll put some money up, because next time they raise, it'll be at a higher price." Here's more 'One of the stupidest businesses in history.' Photo: Eric Risberg 1:29pm Iron ore remains on a rollercoaster ride. Chinese futures have dropped more than 5 per cent, the steepest single-day drop in more than two weeks, on supply concerns as stocks of the steelmaking raw material at the country's ports have risen to the highest in at least 13 years. The decline also tracked losses in Chinese steel prices after they climbed to nine-week highs on Monday. Iron ore "supply is bearish" with the expected pickup in imports, said Hui Heng Tan, analyst at Marex Spectron. "The continued destocking of imported ore by mills is expected to provide headwinds for prices." The most-traded iron ore contract for September delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was down 5.1 per cent at 464.50 yuan ($US67) a tonne. The decline in Chinese iron ore futures should drag down spot prices further. Iron ore for delivery to China's Qingdao port fell 1.9 per cent to $US62 a tonne overnight. The slide in Chinese steel futures for a second straight day also pressured iron ore prices. The most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was last down 2.1 percent at 3,251 yuan a tonne. But Morgan Stanley said the sustained fall in Chinese steel stockpiles pointed to strong downstream demand. Steel product inventories held by Chinese traders in the week to May 19 dropped 5.6 per cent from the previous week, Morgan Stanley said. Back to top 1:08pm Developers put the brakes on new residential projects in the first three months of the year, causing housing construction to fall at its fastest pace in more than 16 years. The 4.7 per cent decline in residential building cut the quarterly total to a seasonally-adjusted $17.2 billion from $18.1 billion in December and was the greatest quarter-on-quarter decline since December 2000, when it slumped 8.2 per cent, official figures show. ABS Q1 CWD: seems to show the residential construction cycle retracing somewhat sooner than had been expected, concerning for jobs #ausbiz pic.twitter.com/tshbjsiyZC— Alex Joiner (@IFM_Economist) May 24, 2017 The decline in residential building work, which has buoyed the construction sector as mining-related investment work has fallen, was enough to offset quarterly gains in non-residential and even engineering construction, to pull the total work done for the three-month period down 0.7 per cent to $46.4 billion, and followed a revised 0.7 per cent increase in December. Economists had expected a 0.5 per cent total quarterly decline, following on from an originally reported 0.2 per cent fall in December.  The latest numbers add to the sense that housing construction, which peaked at a total $18.1 billion in the June 2016 quarter, is now retreating. Separate figures from consultancy Macromonitor suggest housing construction in Sydney and Melbourne is headed for a major slump due to apartment oversupply and credit tightening, and that total dwelling starts will fall 23 per cent from last year's peak to the cyclical trough in 2019. Macromonitor Residential Forecast 2017  12:53pm The Trump rally may have faltered in recent months but the reflation trade isn't dead yet, asset management giant BlackRock says. Despite the setbacks that have seen bonds and yield-sensitive stocks rise, latest data suggested both economic growth and inflation are picking up in major industrialised countries, BlackRock head of investment strategy David Griffith said.  "Reflation is not just a US story anymore and is benefiting company earnings globally," he said at a briefing. "This recovery has a good few years in it yet." Indeed, corporate earnings expectations have been revised higher in most major economies, and nowhere as steeply as in Japan, one of BlackRock's favourite sharemarkets. The recovery is also flowing through to emerging markets, and among these in particular the Asian ones, another preferred region of the group's asset allocators. BlackRock's growth optimism matches predictions by Credit Suisse, which in a recent note pointed out that while some of the enthusiasm over Trump's policies may have waned (as measured in sentiment indicators or "soft data"), real, hard data was set to accelerate. "We still believe that the five structural headwinds to global growth over the past four years are diminishing — fiscal tightening, the euro crisis, bank deleveraging, the decline in BRIC growth and the collapse in commodity prices — while we see US growth re-accelerating and euro area GDP growth accelerating to more than 2 per cent," the analysts wrote. "The conditions appear in place for a passing of the baton from a commodity-driven inflation impulse, which has now largely passed, towards a less dramatic, but perhaps more sustained, wage-driven inflation impulse." Here's more Deflation fears have mostly disappeared. Photo: BlackRock 12:29pm The corporate regulator has banned Nathan Tinkler and two of his associates from managing companies for between three years and four years, citing "multiple serious failures" in their duty as directors of companies that include his thoroughbred racing empire and A-League football club, the Newcastle Jets.  The ASIC statement said Tinkler - who is now bankrupt - and fellow directors Donna Dennis and Troy Palmer were banned as a result of information contained in reports provided by the liquidators of the failed companies associated with the former billionaire. "The disqualifications imposed on these directors should highlight the consequences that can follow when companies are poorly managed," said ASIC commissioner John Price. "ASIC will seek to hold company directors accountable if they systemically fail to discharge their obligations when managing companies." According to the corporate watchdog, the trio failed to "prevent the companies from trading while insolvent", didn't ensure the companies paid their taxes and "allowed one of the companies to deliberately operate at a loss".  Here's more The corporate watchdog said the bankrupt former billionaire failed in his duties as a company director. Photo: Daniel Munoz 12:08pm Households are facing price a 'price spike' running into hundreds of dollars a year, one consumer group has warned, in the wake of a federal court ruling which has blocked government efforts to curtail power price rises. In the ruling, the Australian Energy Regulator lost on most counts when it sought to restrain spending by power companies with the argument that NSW electricity companies - the poles and wires companies such as Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy - were inefficient. The decision has national ramifications since the approach being taken by the regulator with the NSW power companies is to take effect with the power industry in all other states over the next few years. Today's court decision covers planned spending by the power companies over the period 2014-2019, with households to be exposed to a large portion of the rise in prices the power distributors wanted. The cost of transporting electricity from power stations to households makes up around 40 per cent of the electricity bill, and it is this portion which has been at the centre of a prolonged legal battle as power companies sought to maximise their revenues, by spending up big on new equipment. The decision is worth billions of dollars for the buyers of the 51 per cent stakes in former NSW state-owned Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy, which opted to invest despite the uncertainty over future revenues posed by the court case. The AER has lost a bid to lower prices charged by power distributors. Photo: Carla Gottgens 12:03pm  Economic growth of 3.0 per cent is still likely in 2017 but prospects for 2018 are "discouraging", Westpac says. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into the future, fell in April. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the index had been at or above trend for nine consecutive months, indicating economic growth in 2017 will be close to the Reserve Bank's forecast of 3.0 per cent - but a contraction in housing construction, slowing export growth and weak wage growth could bite in 2018. Back to top 11:47am A few reactions to the cut to China's rating by Moody's: - "It is a psychological blow that China will not take kindly to and absolutely speaks to the rising financial pressures in China," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen. That said, "It doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things because so much of Chinese debt is held by state or quasi-state actors and minimal amounts are international investors."  - "It is not going to come as any great news to the world that China has problems with a huge credit boom that, in the end, is probably going to require government intervention to bear some of the costs," said Richard Jerram, chief economist at Bank of Singapore. "In general I think that people are worried about the rapid pace of debt expansion, but re-assured that most is in local currency, so it is more a question of internal transfers, rather than a more abrupt sort of event driven by the capital account." - "I don't think it's going to be earth-shattering or shift investors' sentiment toward China," Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB private banking told CNBC. "Everyone on the planet has flagged the risk of Chinese debt and the risk that is associated with the current policymakers' strategy and attempt to deleverage." - "The downgrade jolted markets and the Australian dollar again showed itself to be the preferred FX proxy for China's economy," said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac. "The currency's fall is probably driven by fear Moody's could be right that China's heavy indebtedness threatens its medium-term growth prospects and thus demand for commodities." - "From a macro perspective, a downgrade by rating agencies could potentially erode the financial soundness of China, creating the risk of a negative feedback loop," said ANZ economist Khoon Goh. "The downgrade will likely lift the cost of financing of Chinese issuers, especially in the offshore market. "As the loan exposure of the domestic monetary system to local borrowers heightens, the central bank will be cautious in policy tightening in the future, extending the lingering debt concerns further." The ratings cut is a 'psychological blow that China will not take kindly to.' Photo: Nicolas Asfouri 11:38am Dreamworld owner Ardent Leisure is looking at unlocking value from parts of what it calls the Gold Coast theme park's "prime real estate". Ardent, which this month flagged a full-year loss from its theme parks after visitor numbers and revenue fell after last year's fatal accident at the park, said it has appointed a town planner to examine the feasibility of rezoning parts of the site for alternative uses. The troubled leisure company will look to develop the site adjacent to its Dreamworld Gold Coast theme park and is undertaking a strategic review of its US-based Main Event business. It was also planning to appoint at least one US-based director, Ardent said.  Ardent disclosed the moves - which it said would have otherwise remained confidential until complete - after being requested by new investors Gary Weiss and Kevin Seymour earlier this month for seats on the Ardent board. Weiss' and Seymour's investment companies Ariadne and Kayaal have a combined stake in Ardent of about 7.9 per cent. Ardent shares are up 1.2 per cent at $2.075.  Reviewing its direction: Ardent is considering developing its Dreamworld precinct in Gold Coast and is also considering a strategic overhaul of its US-based Main Event business. Photo: Tammy Law 11:10am Shares in pharmaceuticals group Sigma Healthcare have plunged almost 25 per cent after the company revealed it has launched legal action against industry behemoth My Chemist, which owns the Chemist Warehouse brand.  Sigma said that it had launched the action after My Chemist, which is backed by Rich Listers Jack Gance and Mario Verrocchiand operates more than 300 stores around Australia, said it would start purchasing medicines from a different wholesaler "Sigma maintains that under the existing agreement MC/CW is not entitled to acquire products from another CSO Wholesaler," the company said in a statement to the ASX. "Remedies to be sought by Sigma include declarations and injunctions for specific performance of the agreement." Sigma shares have nearly one-quarter to 89¢ and have almost halved since touching $1.53 on December 2016.  Sigma said that if My Chemist does start purchasing "certain products" from another wholesaler then its earnings before interest and tax would fall by $5 million to $10 million per annum, with earnings hit as soon a this financial year.  "While Sigma remains confident of its position, this action, combined with a continuation of the subdued start to the financial year, may mean that current year underlying EBIT could be up to 5 per cent below FY2016/17 (subject to the outcome of the proposed proceedings)."  Sigma reported underling EBIT of $100.2 million for the year to January 31, 2017. Analysts had expected EBIT would rise to $107.5 million  Sigma has flagged a hit to its profit should Chemist Warehouse start stacking competitor products. Photo: Carla Gottgens 10:54am As the reason for the rating cut to China's debt, Moody's said that the outlook for the country's financial strength will worsen, with debt rising and economic growth slowing. The downgrade one notch to an A1 rating from AA3 comes at a time when the Chinese government is grappling with the challenges of slowing economic growth and soaring debt. Moodys cut Chinas debt rating from Aa3 to A1 unlikely to have much impact.Chinas debt issues well known & its worlds largest creditor nation— Shane Oliver (@ShaneOliverAMP) May 24, 2017 "The downgrade reflects Moody's expectation that China's financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows," Moody's said. "While ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government," the ratings company said. @DaveVK2 Moody's had China on negative watch since March 2016 so I guess the decision is in line with that but obviously timing was very open— Sean Callow (@seandcallow) May 24, 2017 Moody's also changed the outlook for China to stable from negative, saying the now stable outlook reflected the assessment that risks were balanced. "Moody's expects that economy-wide leverage will increase further over the coming years," it said, adding that China's reform program was likely to slow, but not prevent, the rise in leverage. The Australian dollar and the offshore Chinese yuan both dipped following the downgrade. The Aussie fell as much as 0.3 per cent to US74.55¢ while the yuan slipped to 6.8901 per US dollar, 0.1 per cent below late US levels. Beijing is seeking to rein in credit risks in the financial system, while ensuring there's enough lending to keep the economy humming above their target for economic growth of at least 6.5 per cent this year. Total outstanding credit climbed to about 260 per cent of GDP by the end of 2016, up from 160 per cent in 2008, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Moody's is worried about rising debt levels in China. Photo: SeongJoon Cho 10:42am Shares are trading higher in early trade, after wavering slightly at the open following a surprise cut to China's credit rating by Moody's. The ASX is up 0.2 per cent at 5773.8, after briefly slipping into the red on the downgrade headlines. The Aussie dollar also dipped about a third of a cent to the day's low of US74.55¢ following the move by Moody's. Moody's downgrades China's rating to A1 from Aa3 and outlook changed to stable from negative.

Saudi Arabia plans to expand its sovereign wealth fund into the world’s largest. The kingdom took a huge step toward that goal on Saturday when it signed billions of dollars of deals with Blackstone Group LP and SoftBank Group Corp. The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify revenue away from oil under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The fund could eventually control more than $2 trillion, according to Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The sale of a less than 5 percent stake in oil giant Aramco to the public will provide funds for investment. “We want to be an investment powerhouse,” PIF managing director Yasir Alrumayyan said in a rare public appearance Saturday during an event that gathered top Saudi officials and American corporate titans, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Citigroup Inc. CEO Mike Corbat, in Riyadh. “Most of the investments we announced and will announce soon are international, but they will be in parallel with our investments in Saudi.” The PIF’s dealmaking has quickened this year as it seeks to increase the proportion of foreign holdings to 50 percent from 5 percent, excluding Aramco. Here’s some of the fund’s biggest investments so far: Blackstone Infrastructure Fund The PIF agreed to commit $20 billion to an infrastructure investment fund with Blackstone, the world’s biggest private-equity manager. Blackstone plans to raise the same amount from other investors and with leverage, the New York-based asset manager expects to have more than $100 billion in purchasing power for infrastructure projects, primarily in the U.S. The agreement is non-binding and terms are still being negotiated. The potential investment reflects the PIF’s “positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the United States as announced by President Trump,” and will allow the PIF to “achieve long-term returns given historical investment shortfalls,” Alrumayyan said. SoftBank Vision Fund Saudi Arabia and SoftBank formally announced the first close of fundraising for the largest-ever technology investment fund on Saturday. More than $93 billion has been secured from backers led by the PIF and the Japanese company, and the fund could grow to $100 billion. The PIF didn’t disclose the size of its investment, but bin Salman agreed to potentially invest up to $45 billion in the fund over five years after a meeting with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son. Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. also put in capital. “We are building a portfolio that is diversified across sectors, asset classes and geographies, and expect the Vision Fund to act as a platform to access a range of exciting, emerging opportunities in the technology sector,” Alrumayyan said in a statement announcing the deal. Uber Technologies Inc. The PIF invested $3.5 billion in U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. last June, marking its arrival as a major global investor. The deal valued Uber at $62.5 billion and gave Alrumayyan a board seat at the San Francisco-based company. To learn more about the Public Investment Fund, click here. Saudi Arabian Military Industries The PIF earlier this month set up a defense company -- Saudi Arabian Military Industries, or SAMI -- to help reduce the kingdom’s reliance on foreign purchases of military equipment and create a domestic manufacturing industry. The wealth fund said SAMI will directly contribute around 14 billion riyals ($3.7 billion) to the Saudi economy by 2030, invest more than 6 billion riyals in research and development and create over 40,000 jobs in the engineering and technical fields. “SAMI is a big thing,” Alrumayyan said. “We are the third-largest spender on military in the world so by 2030 we want to bring in 50 percent of our procurement into Saudi Arabia.” Mohamed Alabbar The PIF was among investors contributing to start Middle East e-commerce venture Noon last November. Led by Dubai-based business tycoon Mohamed Alabbar, the fund pledged to invest $500 million -- half of Noon’s capital -- and will be an active participant in its board. The Saudi fund deepened ties with Alabbar, who is also chairman of Dubai’s largest real estate developer Emaar Properties PJSC, later that month when it took a 50 percent stake in his investment vehicle Adeptio AD Investments SPC Ltd. Adeptio bought Kuwait Food Co., which operates KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the Middle East and North Africa. Posco The PIF’s investment in Korea’s Posco Engineering & Construction Co. was one of the fund’s first overseas deals. The fund paid $1.1 billion for a 38 percent stake and got the right to appoint two board members. At Home Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Domestically, the PIF has assets worth about $106 billion, including stakes in companies such as Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the world’s second-biggest chemicals manufacturer, and National Commercial Bank, the kingdom’s largest lender. The government also plans to transfer ownership of many state assets to the fund while they are being privatized, including the Saudi stock exchange and flour mills. The PIF is the main investor in a planned 334 square-kilometer sports and entertainment city that will be built south of Riyadh, the government said in April. The plans will include a safari area and a Six Flags Entertainment Corp. theme park. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stock Slipped Today Shares of the travel review site fell after its CFO issued a warning. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 23, 2017 at 5:42PM What happened Shares of TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) got clipped today after the travel review site's chief financial officer made downbeat comments about the current quarter's growth. The stock closed down 4.9%. So what At the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference, CFO Ernst Teunissen reiterated the company's outlook for the current quarter, but said that there could be a deceleration in click-based and transaction revenue, adding that revenue growth in that category could be in the mid- to high-single digits after increasing 12% in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images. That statement spooked investors, causing the stock to tumble in afternoon trading. Management had called for a similar increase in the current quarter, but Teunissen's statement seemed to cast doubt on that even as he maintained the company's guidance. Now what  TripAdvisor shares have been battered over the past year as the company's attempted transition to an online travel agent from just a travel recommendation site is taking longer than expected.  In the first quarter, overall revenue increased just 6%, and adjusted earnings per share fell 27% to $0.24.  Management is hoping that launching a national TV ad campaign this quarter will spur growth, but the stock seems risky as long as it's in free fall. Shares have stumbled by nearly two-thirds since their peak in 2014, and it appears the problems may continue after Teunissen's latest statement. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Trump administration on Tuesday will ask Republicans who control the US Congress – and the federal purse strings – for the politically sensitive cuts in its first full budget. The proposal in its current form is unlikely to be approved by lawmakers as they craft their own tax and spending plans but the document sets out Trump›s budget priorities and lays down a marker with Congress. Trump seeks to balance the budget by the end of the decade, according to a preview given to reporters on Monday. There is some new spending in his plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October. The Pentagon would get a boost, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, which was a central promise of Trump›s presidential campaign. Trump›s proposal foresees selling half of the US emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down US crude prices. The biggest savings would come from cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor made as part of a Republican healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Trump, who is traveling overseas this week, wants lawmakers to cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps. US stocks were slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of the budget›s full unveiling later in the day. «In the US all eyes are on Trump›s budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending,» said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. Republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the Trump administration›s pro-business economic agenda, which would cut the business tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, and reduce the number of personal tax brackets. But their policy agenda has stalled as the White House grapples with the political fallout from Trump›s firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey had been leading a probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. In his budget, Trump upheld his promise – for the most part – that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security, two social insurance programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. Those so-called entitlement programs may not come out of Capitol Hill unscathed, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. «We have to look at the entitlements if we believe that we want them to be there for future generations,» he told CNBC. The healthcare bill passed by the House aims to gut the Obama administration›s signature 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, that expanded insurance coverage and the government-run Medicaid program. But it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is writing its own law. The White House proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, to work. The plan would slash supports for farmers and impose user fees for meat inspection. Another politically fraught item is a proposal for cuts to the US Postal Service, a goal that has long eluded lawmakers and administrations from both political parties. The first look at the plan came in a «skinny budget» released in March which received a tepid response from Congress. Most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The budget includes $25 billion for a plan to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, and $200 billion to encourage state and local governments to boost spending on roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure programs. The plan drew immediate fire from lobby groups, including from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which said it relied on «rosy assumptions,» gimmicks and unrealistic cuts. «While we appreciate the administration›s focus on reducing the debt, when using more realistic assumptions, the president’s budget does not add up,» Maya MacGuineas, the group›s president, said in a statement. Trump›s plan relies on forecasts for economic growth of 3 percent a year by the end of his first term – well beyond Congressional Budget Office assumptions of 1.9 percent growth. «That assumes a pessimism about America, about the economy, about its people, about its culture, that we’re simply refusing to accept,» White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said of the CBO assumptions. — Reuters SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleITCF seals $35m accord to support Suriname’s sectors Next articleChandy praises Indian schools standard Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Professionally perfect 7 agreements signed for urgent Holy Sites projects Authorities finalize Ramadan preparations NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply May 2017 S M T W T F S « Apr       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31   STAY CONNECTED 1,636,326FansLike 44,036FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Professionally perfect May 24, 2017 7 agreements signed for urgent Holy Sites projects May 24, 2017 Authorities finalize Ramadan preparations May 24, 2017 Kingdom condemns Manchester terror attack May 24, 2017 Main attacker of security man on Corniche gets 18 years in prison May 24, 2017 Archives May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Stocks claw back more lost ground with 4th straight gain Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose for the fourth day in a row Tuesday as they continued to recover the ground they lost last week. Major indexes approached record highs again. Most of the gains went to banks, which surged as bond yields jumped. That will allow them to charge higher rates on loans. Banks took steep losses last Wednesday, when stocks had their worst day since September. Scientific instrument companies and drugmakers also rose. However auto parts companies were hammered after poor third-quarter results from AutoZone and home builders fell after sales of new homes sank in April. The four-day rally has restored most of the market's losses and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is almost back to record highs. "The market was simply reminded that there's political risk out there and it reacted to that reminder," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial. Peterson said he doesn't think long-term investors have made big changes to their portfolios in response to last week's drop, which followed allegations President Donald Trump asked the FBI to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Peterson says high stock prices and the calm market makes stocks more vulnerable to surprises from the political arena. The S&P 500 added 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 3.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,380.98. Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.28 percent from 2.25 percent. That helped bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase, which gained $1.06, or 1.3 percent, to $85.76 and BB&T, which rose 63 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $43.03. Scientific instrument maker Agilent Technologies raised its annual profit forecast after its second-quarter profit and sales beat Wall Street estimates. Its shares gained $2.58, or 4.6 percent, to $58.66. Industrial and medical device maker Danaher picked up $1.04, or 1.3 percent, to $83.95. Auto parts retailer AutoZone took its worst one-day loss in eight and a half years as high costs and lower sales at older locations hurt its results. Its stock fell $78.09, or 11.8 percent, to $581.40. O'Reilly Automotive sank $8.28, or 3.3 percent, to $240.18 and Advance Auto Parts gave up $6.71, or 4.6 percent, to $140.66. All have tumbled this year as investors worried about slowing car sales. Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after its fourth-quarter profit and sales surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's games include the "Grand Theft Auto" ''NBA2K" and "Sid Meier's Civilization" franchises. Take-Two stock jumped $3.79, or 5.5 percent, to $72.83, and it has doubled over the last year.

Authors Rachel Barker Policy Analyst and Engagement Strategist Twitter rachelabarker Joseph Parilla Fellow - Metropolitan Policy Program Twitter joeparilla But Hatinger and his partners are not alone in having a stake in the success of their edible bug enterprise. As Detroit bounces back from municipal bankruptcy, regional leaders are also betting that small businesses can help fuel a recovery that extends to neighborhoods and entrepreneurs historically disconnected from regional growth. Some promising early signals point to success. The Kresge Foundation’s annual Detroit Reinvestment Index, which foundation President Rip Rapson presented at Brookings last week, finds significant confidence in the city among both national investors and local entrepreneurs. Following the presentation, Hatinger and a panel of philanthropic and non-profit leaders considered the role of small businesses in Detroit’s resurgence and the promise of small business development to support inclusive economic outcomes in more places. Here are five highlights from the conversation: 1) Small businesses provide unique benefits to neighborhood economies and residents Small businesses can create jobs in neighborhoods accessible to residents without a car, and help revitalize disinvested corridors. Janis Bowdler, head of small business and community development for global philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase, summarizes recent research pointing to a wide range of benefits that small businesses deliver. 2) Small businesses offer expanded pathways to opportunity and wealth-building Small business development offers an opportunity for cities to support innovative ideas from a broad cross-section of citizens, with the potential to help individuals quickly achieve greater economic success. Anthony Hatinger, co-founder and chief executive officer of DetroitEnto, explains the power of this approach. 3) Cities need to intentionally build an ecosystem to support small businesses Launching a business isn’t easy, and many start-ups fail. So cities need to be deliberate about structuring programs and outreach to both encourage start-ups and support existing small businesses. This ranges from cutting red tape to connecting entrepreneurs to office or production space and expertise from clusters. Cathy Belk, president of the Northeast Ohio-based entrepreneurship non-profit JumpStart, describes some of the barriers and how her organization is addressing them. 4) Small business development needs to occur in tandem with investments in growth industries—and requires a smarter approach to economic development As cities invest in small, locally-serving businesses, they also need to maintain innovative growth industries, particularly in traded sectors with significant multiplier effects. Pam Lewis of Detroit’s New Economy Initiative described following “not an ‘or’ strategy, … (but) an ‘and’ strategy.” In this clip, Bowdler expands on the need for cities to take a strategic approach examining both, which may be a shift for economic developers “focused on landing the next big fish.” 5) Philanthropy can play a role in building an entrepreneurial ecosystem—and delivering inclusive outcomes Philanthropy has been a significant driver of Detroit’s economic recovery and investor in local economic development. Lewis describes the role of her organization, which pools philanthropic capital, as a “process manager for an entrepreneurial ecosystem” and the unique nature and implications of that model. City-level small business development strategies like Detroit’s are occurring against the backdrop of a broader national decline in the business startup rate. Structural changes in the U.S. economy seem to be favoring large incumbents over new firm entrants, which has worrying implications for core economic fundamentals like job creation and productivity growth. Viewed in this light, local and regional efforts to enhance entrepreneurship not only advance important goals around neighborhood revitalization and wealth-building, but also can help counteract the nation’s declining business dynamism. For any city seeking to boost inclusive growth, Detroit’s big bet on small business bears watching. The Kresge Foundation and JPMorgan Chase are members of the Metropolitan Leadership Council, a network of business, civic and philanthropic leaders that acts as a financial and intellectual partner of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program. The New Economy Initiative is a past supporter of the Metro Program.

US Treasury bond yields extended their rise in late trading after a solid 2-year debt auction while euro zone shares closed higher on strong growth data. Oil prices rose slightly in volatile trading as expectations of an extension to OPEC-led supply cuts and another drop in US crude inventories offset the proposal in Trump's budget plan to roll out sales of petroleum reserves over 10 years. US crude rose 0.84 percent to $51.56 per barrel and Brent was last at $54.26, up 0.72 percent on the day. Trump's first full budget plan calls for an increase in military and infrastructure spending but also a raft of cuts, including healthcare and food assistance. "People will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, US equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to end at 20,937.91, the S&P 500 gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,138.71. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," said Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West in Denver, Colorado. Trump's tax and spending plan in its current form is unlikely to be approved by Congress, which will craft its own. Across the euro zone, businesses showed their strongest run since 2011, according to IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for May. It matched the previous month's 56.8, its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.25 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.09 percent. Sterling was subdued after reports showing sluggishness in the UK economy and a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester Monday night that killed 22 people and wounded dozens. "Increasingly the markets are just more and more numb to these. As bad as they are and as horrific as they are, the market immediately looks through these things and uses these as buying opportunities more than anything else," said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. The pound was last 0.25 percent lower at $1.2968. Treasury debt yields rose, with some investors paring bond positions to make room for this week's federal and corporate supply while others reduced safe-haven bond holdings in favor of stocks. There was solid demand at a $26 billion auction of a new two-year note issue, the first part of the $88 billion in coupon-bearing government debt supply this week. Some traders also turned cautious ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes of its May 2-3 meeting on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note yield was 2.287 percent, up three basis points from late on Monday, while the 30-year bond yield was more than three basis points higher at 2.949 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies as its worst week of losses in a year drove some profit taking, and as investors turned their attention to Wednesday's Fed minutes. The index rose 0.41 percent after falling to a more than six-month low on Monday. "We haven't heard from any Fed members clarifying or warning the market that they are on the wrong side. That's a positive sign that June is still a go (for an interest rate hike)," said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street moved higher amid initial relief about US Donald Trump's budget plan. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West, told Reuters. In 3.27pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 per cent gain. In 3.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 0.2 per cent. The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, up 2.1 per cent and 1.5 pe rcent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Home Depot and those of Walt Disney, recently down 0.7 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively for the biggest percentage drops in the Dow. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales sank 11.4 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units in April, compared with an upwardly revised 642,000 units in March. While that was a bigger slide than economists had expected, the outlook for the housing market remains solid. "Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn't changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. Indeed, fed fund futures showed that traders are cementing bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, according to Bloomberg. Minutes from the Fed's May 2-3 meeting, slated for release on Wednesday, will be scoured for fresh clues on the timing and pace of rate hikes. Continued below.

"Discussions may or may not materialise and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur," Glencore said in the statement. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2 per cent gain from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index rose 0.3 per cent, while France's CAC40 Index climbed 0.5 per cent. The UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2 per cent. Germany, the euro-zone's largest economy, offered fresh reasons to be optimistic about the region's outlook. Separate reports showed that the nation's economic growth increased to 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, while business confidence as measured by the Ifo institute climbed to 114.6 in May, the highest level in more than 25 years. Oil prices rose amid fresh indications that OPEC and its partners are likely to extend production cuts for another nine months when they meet on Thursday in Vienna. "Six and nine months are both proposals on the table ... we will support the majority, probably the nine months," Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday, according to Reuters. - BusinessDesk By Margreet Dietz Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Site Archive Dow closes up 43 points Tuesday May 23, 2017 at 11:24 AM May 23, 2017 at 4:56 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rose for the fourth day in a row Tuesday as they continued to recover the ground they lost last week. Major indexes approached record highs again. Most of the gains went to banks, which surged as bond yields jumped. That will allow them to charge higher rates on loans. Banks took steep losses last Wednesday, when stocks had their worst day since September. Scientific instrument companies and drugmakers also rose. However auto parts companies were hammered after poor third-quarter results from AutoZone and home builders fell after sales of new homes sank in April. The four-day rally has restored most of the market's losses and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is almost back to record highs. "The market was simply reminded that there's political risk out there and it reacted to that reminder," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial. Peterson said he doesn't think long-term investors have made big changes to their portfolios in response to last week's drop, which followed allegations President Donald Trump asked the FBI to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Peterson says high stock prices and the calm market makes stocks more vulnerable to surprises from the political arena. The S&P 500 added 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 3.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,380.98. Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.28 percent from 2.25 percent. That helped bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase, which gained $1.06, or 1.3 percent, to $85.76 and BB&T, which rose 63 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $43.03. Scientific instrument maker Agilent Technologies raised its annual profit forecast after its second-quarter profit and sales beat Wall Street estimates. Its shares gained $2.58, or 4.6 percent, to $58.66. Industrial and medical device maker Danaher picked up $1.04, or 1.3 percent, to $83.95. Auto parts retailer AutoZone took its worst one-day loss in eight and a half years as high costs and lower sales at older locations hurt its results. Its stock fell $78.09, or 11.8 percent, to $581.40. O'Reilly Automotive sank $8.28, or 3.3 percent, to $240.18 and Advance Auto Parts gave up $6.71, or 4.6 percent, to $140.66. All have tumbled this year as investors worried about slowing car sales. Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after its fourth-quarter profit and sales surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's games include the "Grand Theft Auto" ''NBA2K" and "Sid Meier's Civilization" franchises. Take-Two stock jumped $3.79, or 5.5 percent, to $72.83, and it has doubled over the last year. Rival Activision Blizzard added 68 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $57.80 and Electronic Arts rose 62 cents to $109.01. Sales of new homes fell 11 percent in April from the month before, the biggest drop in more than two years. Sales had reached a nine-year high in March, and experts said the decline was most likely a blip. Homebuilder NVR fell $61.27, or 2.6 percent, to $2,296 and D.R.

Large US banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, advanced more than 1 per cent. The latest gains mean the major US stock indices are back to near their levels prior to a tumble on May 17 sparked by worries over President Donald Trump's agenda following a series of missteps and controversies. With Trump out of the country and amid solid economic data, those fears have receded. "The market looks inclined to keep squeezing higher in the wake of the 1.8 per cent decline it suffered last Wednesday," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.2 per cent to end the session at 20,937.91. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to finish at 2,398.42, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 per cent to 6,138.71. Agribusiness firm Bunge surged 16.6 per cent after Swiss commodities giant Glencore confirmed that it approached the US company about a possible combination. Alexion Pharmaceuticals plunged 9.3 per cent after announcing several executive departures, including chief financial officer David Anderson after less than six months. AutoZone, which sells replacement auto parts, slumped 11.8 per cent after reporting third-quarter same stores sales declined 0.8 per cent and earnings and revenues missed analyst expectations.

But that claim raises eyebrows because Amazon Web Services, the public cloud market leader, also sells cloud services in China. As does IBM. Capossela's statement at a JP Morgan Chase (jpm) tech conference in Boston echoes similar comments by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella over the past year. Pressed on the issue, Capossela said that Microsoft (msft) has a joint venture with a partner that the Chinese government recognizes. "We are the only multinational company that does that," he said. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter about the business of technology. However, Amazon also partners with a local Internet provider, Beijing Sinnet, on its Chinese facilities. In an online post about that relationship, AWS said under this arrangement, Beijing Sinnet bills and manages customers on behalf of AWS. It is unclear why AWS or IBM (ibm), which works with 21Vianet, the same partner used by Microsoft in China, would be less legitimate or legal in that country. An IBM spokeswoman said that company has been operating cloud services legally in China for two and a half years and is expanding those services via a new partnership with Wanda, a large Chinese conglomerate. Amazon has not responded to a request for comment but Gartner (it) distinguished analyst Lydia Leong, said any claim that AWS is not operating legally in China is "completely untrue." Just as Azure China is operated by 21Vianet, Amazon's Beijing region is operated by Sinnet, Leong said via email. "Both meet the regulatory requirements for foreign cloud IaaS providers with services in China," she noted. IaaS is a tech term for Infrastructure as a Service which is itself another name for public cloud, a model in which one company runs a vast network of data centers, packed with computing, storage, and networking gear. Business customers that don't want to run their own data centers—or build more of them—can rent use of that gear. Related: Welcome to the Era of Data Center Consolidation China, despite its tricky regulations and the government's desire to keep data under its control, is an important market for U.S. companies. Forrester Research (forr) projected that the public cloud market in China will grow from $2.2 billion in revenue in 2016 to $3.8 billion in 2020. Related: Alibaba Ponies up $1 Billion to Build its Cloud Business In China, AWS, IBM (ibm), and Microsoft challenge local public clouds like Aliyun, the public cloud backed by Chinese retail giant Alibaba (baba). Internet provider Tencent also fields a cloud as does Internet search giant Baidu. Related: China's Huawei take on Alibaba and Amazon in Cloud Services Google, generally considered the third largest public cloud provider, has not been a factor in China since shutting down its search engine operations there seven years ago. Google's nearest cloud facilities are in Taiwan and Tokyo, neither of which would pass muster for use by Chinese companies worried about legal restrictions. Microsoft, Capossela said, sees a big opportunity in China for multinational corporations from the U.S. and elsewhere that want to sell into that market. China, is not the only government with strict requirements about how data is stored and handled. Germany, for example, mandates that citizens' data be maintained inside the country. Regulations such as these are feeding the land-grab among cloud providers to put data centers in all relevant countries. That competitive fervor is also fueling claims and counter claims.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Stocks rise as Trump budget brings relief Margreet Dietz Wednesday May 24, 2017 Share Jennifer Lee, BMO Capital Markets senior economist, says demand for housing remains strong Play NBR radio on Wall Street moved higher amid initial relief about US President Donald Trump's budget plan. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West, told Reuters. At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.08 points, or 0.2%, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.2% to 6138.71 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 0.2% to 2398.42, its fourth successive day of gains. The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JP Morgan Chase, up 1.7% and 1.5% respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Home Depot and those of Walt Disney, down 0.7% and 0.5% respectively for the biggest percentage drops in the Dow. Government bonds fell, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rising to 2.285% from 2.254% on Monday. New home sales down A Commerce Department report showed new home sales sank 11.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,00 units in April, compared with an upwardly revised 642,000 units in March. While that was a bigger slide than economists had expected, the outlook for the housing market remains solid. "Demand for housing remains strong and the usual list of support factors hasn't changed, with the key items being job growth and wage gains," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. Indeed, Fed fund futures showed traders are cementing bets the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, according to Bloomberg. Minutes from the May 2-3 meeting, slated for release on Wednesday, will be scoured for fresh clues on the timing and pace of rate hikes. Meanwhile, shares of grain trader Bunge soared 16.6% after mining and commodity trader Glencore said it "made an informal approach to Bunge regarding a possible consensual business combination." "Discussions may or may not materialise and there is no certainty that any transaction will occur," Glencore said in the statement. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.2% gain from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index rose 0.3%, while France's CAC40 Index climbed 0.5%. The UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2%. German economy booms Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, offered fresh reasons to be optimistic about the region's outlook. Separate reports showed that the nation's economic growth increased to 0.6% in the first quarter, while business confidence as measured by the Ifo institute climbed to 114.6 in May, the highest level in more than 25 years. Oil prices rose amid fresh indications that OPEC and its partners are likely to extend production cuts for another nine months when they meet on Thursday in Vienna. "Six and nine months are both proposals on the table ... we will support the majority, probably the nine months," Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday, according to Reuters. US crude oil for July delivery rose 0.7% to $US51.47 a barrel, posting its fifth consecutive session of gains.  (BusinessDesk) Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

More China stocks fall after rating cut, other Asian markets gain by: JOE McDONALD, AP Business Writer Updated: May 24, 2017 - 12:00 AM BEIJING (AP) - Chinese stocks sank Wednesday after Moody's cut the country's debt rating and other Asian markets rose following Wall Street's advance. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,047.80 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was unchanged at 25,410.81. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.5 percent to 19,707.87 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,774.40. Seoul's Kospi added 0.2 percent to 2,317.26 and benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Singapore gained. Jakarta declined. CHINESE DEBT: Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's long-term local currency and foreign currency debt ratings, citing the country's rising debt. Moody's cut the rating to a still relatively robust A1 from Aa3 and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The change reflects an expectation "China's financial strength will erode somewhat" and economy-wide debt will rise, Moody's said. It said that while planned reforms will transform the economy and financial system, those will not prevent an increase in debt and potential government liabilities. ANALYST'S TAKE: The China downgrade could "deal a blow to confidence in regional markets," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "While the downgrade itself had not been regarded as a plunging drop in rating, the attention on China's worsening outlook could create jitters." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose for a fourth day, with most gains going to banks. Scientific instrument companies and drug makers also rose. Auto parts companies were hammered after poor third-quarter results from AutoZone and home builders fell after sales of new homes sank in April. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.2 percent to 2,398.42. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2 percent to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.1 percent to 6,138.71. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 13 cents to $51.60 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 34 cents on Tuesday to $51.47. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 16 cents to $54.31 in London. It added 28 cents the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 111.90 yen from Tuesday's 111.77 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1181 from $1.1183. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Trump is set to propose a raft of politically sensitive cuts, including to healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. Congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. "In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump's budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.62 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,928.45, the S&P 500 was up 2.72 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,396.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.75 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,140.37. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the health index's and technology sector's 0.23 percent rise leading the advancers. U.S. futures slipped slightly on Monday evening, before recovering, on news of the suicide attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at a pop concert in the English city of Manchester. Among stocks, shares of Toll Brothers rose 2.7 percent to $39.01 after the luxury homebuilder reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly profit. Autozone fell 8.2 percent to $608.57 after the company's quarterly results came in below expectations. Shares of other auto part retailers were also hit. Advance Auto Parts, O'Reilly Automotive and Genuine Parts were down between 3 percent and 4.5 percent. Shares of Take-Two reversed course from premarket to rise as much as 11 percent to a record high of $76.70 as the videogame maker's full-year forecast was not as bad as feared.

Morgan's stocks add 32 points to Dow industrials gain By Mark DeCambre Published: May 23, 2017 4:40 p.m. ET Share By MarkDeCambre A climb in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday was supported predominantly by a rally in banks shares, Goldman Sachs Group and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Combined, shares of the pair of bank giants contributed about 32 points to the the price-weighted Dow industrials DJIA, +0.21% The blue-chip gauge ended 43 points higher, with Goldman GS, +1.68% and J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.25% producing more than 74% of the heavy lifting. The broader stock market booked its fourth straight advance, coming after a tough stretch for stocks last week, highlighted by the worst decline in months on Wednesday. That drop was spurred by mounting doubts that President Donald Trump will be able to produce promises of tax cuts, a boost to infrastructure spending, and deregulation--factors which have vaulted equity benchmarks higher over the past several months. However, those proposals have come into question as Trump faces an FBI probe into his administration's ties to Russia. Still, the broad uptrend appears to be intact, with the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% closing up 0.2% at 2,398, briefly reclaiming 2,400 intraday-- a level it was at prior to last Wednesday's rout, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.08% closed less than 0.1% higher at 6,138.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe My mother writes checks when she receives bills in the mail, while I make automatic payments electronically each month. My daughter, however, is open to taking care of money matters via whatever mobile app comes along. “For millennials, if you’re not mobile, you don’t matter,” said Andy Brown, CEO and cofounder of Sand Hill East, an advisory and consulting firm serving early-stage companies, during his keynote at the annual NetSuite SuiteWorld event held recently in Las Vegas. One of the challenges for banks and other financial institutions is that they need to serve digital natives, digital dinosaurs, and all people in between seamlessly—as well as prepare for a rising tide of customers like my daughter. But since the financial meltdown 10 years ago, financial services companies have had to redeploy much of the money they used to spend on innovation just to keep up with regulations, Brown said. Simultaneously, the introduction of the iPhone (also in 2007) created a massive shift in consumer expectations about customer service. A rush of fintech startups took advantage of these parallel opportunities. Instead of competing with banks with a multitude of services, these startups “look at areas that are unserved, where customers want to do something that banks won’t help them do,” he said. Today, fintechs are occupying—and in many case disrupting—every single banking sector, from loans to investments to insurance. Follow the money: Investors pumped more than $24 billion into fintechs in 2016, after investing $46.7 billion money the year before, according to KPMG’s Q4 ’16 Pulse of Fintech Report. A survey by PwC released last year found that 83% of respondents from traditional financial services firms and 95% from banks think that part of their business could be lost to niche fintech firms. Established financial service companies are now debating whether to build their own competing services, buy one or more of the fintechs, or “borrow” those services through partnerships, said Eileen Tobias, NetSuite vice president of business strategy. “Building it can be costly, and there could be delays getting to market,” Tobias said at SuiteWorld. “Buying a startup is a big risk. So what we’re seeing in this industry is a lot of partnerships.” In 2016, for example, JPMorgan Chase teamed with OnDeck Capital to provide loans to small businesses faster. In March, HSBC announced that it’s partnering with Tradeshift, which manages supply chain invoicing for companies online, enabling it to offer trade financing to more businesses. And in early May, Barclays announced its seventh innovation center, where its internal banking and technology teams work alongside startup partners to create new products and platforms. Agile Tech for the Win-Win Among the fintech startups using technology to blaze new paths is Avant, founded in 2013 to provide “near-prime” unsecured consumer loans on its online lending platform. To date, the company has provided about $4 billion in loans to 500,000 customers and has raised more than $600 million in equity. “Taking out a loan from a bank involves a lot of back and forth,” said Dan Seikel, Avant director of finance, at SuiteWorld. “There’s not much clarity on status, it takes forever. We’ve been able to use technology to streamline that process. We can underwrite customers very quickly, and get cash to them as soon as the next business day.” Avant’s machine learning technology looks at consumers’ FICO scores and hundreds of other variables to assess the credit worthiness of a loan applicant. “Banks might look at four or five variables, and they’ll use FICO as their main source of underwriting,” he said. Within a year of its launch, Avant started a UK subsidiary and found that running the business on QuickBooks and consolidating multiple currencies on Excel wasn’t going to scale. Avant switched to the NetSuite OneWorld software suite, which it uses to consolidate financials, calculate other comprehensive income (OCI), do segment reporting on its now multiple subsidiaries, and compile financial statements quickly. “There’s so much built into NetSuite. We know we’ve just scratched the surface, and we’re excited to use more of the functionality as we continue to grow,” Seikel said. And grow it has. Avant no longer focuses just on direct loans; it now allows institutional investors to purchase its loans. Among its partnerships, the company signed a deal with Regions Bank, which will use Avant's online platform to offer unsecured loans to consumers through the Regions website. If the customer doesn’t fit Regions’ guidelines, Avant may provide the loan itself. Regions are able to serve more customers faster, and Avant’s business grows as well. It’s the kind of flexible approach banks will need to serve millennials, the demographic of consumers roughly between the ages of 18 and 35. According to The Millennial Disruption Index, a three-year study that included a survey of 10,000 millennials, one in three people in this age group is open to switching banks in the next 90 days, while 53% don’t think their bank offers anything different from other banks—and one-third think they won’t need a bank at all at some point in the future. All the more reason that digitally native fintechs and established banks alike need to stay on their toes. Margaret Harrist is director of content strategy and implementation at Oracle.

(NASDAQ: NCSM) saw its shares pullback in Tuesday’s session after the company’s quiet period came to an end. NCS originally came public in its late-April initial public offering (IPO). Most analysts were fairly positive on the stock, although there was a little trepidation from one firm. 24/7 Wall St. has included some recent highlights from NCS, as well as what analysts are saying after the quiet period. The stock entered the market on April 28 around $20 per share, despite pricing at $17 per share. Overall, there were 9.5 million shares in the offering, which raised gross proceeds over $160 million. The underwriters for the offering were Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Simmons, Raymond James, RBC Capital Markets and Tudor Pickering Holt. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Credit Suisse started NCS as Outperform with a $27 target, calling it a differentiated play: In a highly commoditized industry, NCSM represents a potentially disruptive technology with the best return and FCF metrics in the industry. NCSM has 26% of the entire Canadian horizontal completions market and less than 1% of U.S. market share, both of which are accelerating (first quarter revenues increased about 70% quarter over quarter, and the brokerage firm models 2017 revenues up roughly 160% year over year.) The business model is compelling, with capex being the lowest in our sector, relative to revenues or EBITDA, and returns on tangible assets over the past four years the highest in the industry. Wells Fargo and RBS both started NCS with an Outperform rating, with a $35 target price from the former and a $29 price target from the latter. Piper Jaffray started it as Overweight, with a $28 price target. JPMorgan was the only firm that took a sideline view of the stock, with a Neutral rating and a $24 price target. For some background: NCS is a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. It provides products and services primarily to exploration and production companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Shares of NCS were trading down 3.7% at $23.11 on Tuesday, with a post-IPO trading range of $19.25 to $24.45.

Since that time, the stock has surged over 30% to the current price level. The underwriters for offering were Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Stifel, JMP Securities and Raymond James. This company empowers organizations to become data‑driven enterprises in the newly hyperconnected world. Cloudera has developed the leading modern platform for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics. Cloudera’s pioneering hybrid open source software (HOSS) model incorporates the best of open source with its robust proprietary software to form an enterprise‑grade platform. This platform delivers an integrated suite of capabilities for data management, machine learning and advanced analytics, affording customers an agile, scalable and cost-effective solution for transforming their businesses. This company also has financial backing by Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC). It’s worth noting that Intel bought a 17% stake three years ago, and a recent purchase still makes Intel’s investment underwater, according to a May 1 article in the Wall Street Journal. It had about $261 million in sales last year, up about 57% from the prior year, but the company still lost $187 million last year, versus $203 million in the prior year. Here’s what analysts were saying about Cloudera after the quiet period: JPMorgan initiated coverage with an Overweight rating and a $24 price target. Deutsche Bank started it as a Buy with a $25 price target. Stifel started it at Buy with a $24 price target. Citigroup initiated it with a Buy rating and a $23 price target. JMP Securities was the one firm with a Market Perform rating. Shares of Cloudera were trading up over 2% at $21.43 on Tuesday, with a post-IPO trading range of $17.73 to $23.80.

Advertisement An effort to transform how businesses work by using blockchain technology added new members from multiple industries as Toyota Motor Corp., Merck KGaA, State Street Corp. and other companies joined industry group the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. They join existing EEA members JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP LP, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV that are all trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the ethereum blockchain can cut costs by speeding up financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. The reason ethereum is creating such interest among industries from finance to health care is because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner than with bitcoin, which introduced the first blockchain to the world in 2009. The bitcoin blockchain is like a banking system that runs itself -- but its main use is just to allow people to move the digital currency from one place to another. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A and so on. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts -- which are just operating procedures -- you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. Toyota, for example, is experimenting with ethereum to help it develop self-driving cars and other uses. "Toyota Research Institute supports the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its members in promoting common standards and tools to accelerate the adoption of this technology and the potential benefits for Toyota’s customers,” Chris Ballinger, chief financial officer of the car company’s unit Toyota Research Institute, said in the statement. Popular Now Nobody Likes a Bully Apple and the Battle for American Manufacturing Monitoring Asset Management Strategy Execution with KPIs “The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable," Julio Faura, chairman of EEA and head of blockchain innovation at Banco Santander SA, said when announcing the additions to the group. "Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware.” European aircraft maker Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Merck, which says it’s the world’s oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world dating back nearly 350 years, said its history isn’t stopping it from being innovative. "Curiosity fuels business development and enables companies like ours to remain competitive," Andreas Schindler, director ideation, innovation and technology foresight for the company, said in the statement. "We are curious to co-create with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance on distributed ledger architectures and solutions for future digital markets in health care and life sciences.” Adoption of blockchain technology such as ethereum has significant hurdles to overcome, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. There is also the fact that very few if any actual uses of blockchain have been released to date. Regulators also have to be convinced the system is safe. And the EEA is far from alone in seeking an edge in creating standards for blockchain systems. Competitors include R3, Chain, Digital Asset Holdings and the Hyperledger Project.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stock-index benchmarks closed higher Tuesday, marking a fourth straight session in the green following the White House’s release of its 2018 budget proposal. The moves come amid mixed economic data and an updraft in shares of financial firms. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% which earlier broke above the 2,400 mark for the first time in a week, rose 4.40 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 2,398.42. Financial and health-care shares led the gains, with 10 of the benchmark’s 11 sectors closing higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21% rose 43.08 points, or 0.2%, to wrap up at 20,937.91, with shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.68%  and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.25%  swinging from earlier losses in the session to leading the average higher. Those bank shares contributed 32 points to the blue-chip gauge, while a 1.3% gain in Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.31%  shares added about 9 points. The winning streak for the two benchmarks is the longest since late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.08% which saw slight advances and losses during the session, closed up 5.09 points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,138.71, for its longest winning streak since May 10. Tuesday's trade comes less than a week after equity indexes on Wednesday suffered their worst daily loss in months. Meanwhile, markets in Europe SXXP, +0.22%  finished slightly higher on Tuesday after a cautious start following the suspected suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that left at least 22 people dead. Asian stocks closed mixed. “Geopolitical trauma is disheartening and scary, but the reality is that companies continue to do business. [Purchasing managers index] data from the eurozone at six-month high suggests that their economy is gaining steam, all of which bodes well for global equities,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial. Also in focus was Presidential Donald Trump’s 2018 budget. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, said the release likely was a nonissue, seeing that it is highly unlikely to survive in its present form in Congress. Read: Trump budget forecasts an era of growth not consistently seen since the dot-com era “The market doesn’t know what to make of it,” Pavlik said. “If you’re trading stocks on this budget proposal, then you’re an idiot.” Rather, the uplift in stocks has a lot to do with Trump traveling abroad and appearing presidential, and how that’s stealing some thunder away from the firing of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and the Russia probes, Pavlik said. When Trump returns stateside, however, the probe will likely gain traction again and weigh on stocks, especially with Comey testifying before lawmakers after Memorial Day.

According to Zacks, “Amdocs reported relatively healthy second-quarter fiscal 2017 results with modest year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. Amdocs further aims to improve its revenues with an innovative product portfolio. With a diligent execution of operational plans, Amdocs has outperformed the industry in the last three months. For fiscal 2017, the company further increased its revenue guidance on favorable growth dynamics and strength in the business model. However, foreign currency risks and slow-paced growth in European and emerging markets undermine its growth potential to some extent. Amdocs is also susceptible to high concentration risks as approximately 73% of total revenues in fiscal 2016 came from the top 10 clients and loss of any of these customers will likely result in significant top-line erosion. Significant consolidation in the U.S. telecom industry remains another headwind.” A number of other brokerages have also recently issued reports on DOX. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reissued a “neutral” rating and issued a $68.00 price objective on shares of Amdocs Limited in a research note on Tuesday, May 9th. Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. reissued an “outperform” rating and issued a $70.00 price objective (up from $65.00) on shares of Amdocs Limited in a research note on Tuesday, March 7th. Finally, Robert W. Baird increased their price objective on shares of Amdocs Limited from $62.00 to $66.00 and gave the stock a “neutral” rating in a research note on Wednesday, May 10th. Four research analysts have rated the stock with a hold rating and three have issued a buy rating to the company. Amdocs Limited presently has an average rating of “Hold” and a consensus price target of $66.14. Amdocs Limited (NASDAQ:DOX) traded up 0.33% on Tuesday, reaching $64.19. 274,790 shares of the company traded hands. The stock’s 50-day moving average is $61.77 and its 200-day moving average is $60.22. Amdocs Limited has a 1-year low of $54.12 and a 1-year high of $64.48. The stock has a market capitalization of $9.41 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.28 and a beta of 0.64.

The FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies ended down 0.15 percent, reversing earlier gains but still near last Tuesday's record level of 7,533.70 points, while the FTSE 250 added 0.04 percent to reach 19,920.12 points. "I think there are reasons why the market can go higher from here. It doesn't look expensive versus earnings growth, and it doesn't look expensive in historical terms," said Callum Abbot, UK equity fund manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. "The market is trading at 15 times forward earnings, which doesn't seem unreasonable given you are looking at earnings growth in the mid-teens." He pointed also to the index's yield being relatively higher than other developed equity markets. Blue-chip gains were underpinned by banks RBS and Barclays, and defence contractor Babcock. Babcock rose 2.9 percent, the biggest gainer on the FTSE, after a positive note from Deutsche Bank saying the stock could rebound if the firm reports solid results on Wednesday. Among top gainers, EasyJet rose 2.5 percent after a top-rated RBC analyst upgraded the stock, saying the airline had reached its profit nadir, and pointing to an expanding gap of strong customer rankings versus competitors. The airline's shares recovered all the lost ground since a badly-received earnings update last week sent the stock tumbling. Miners dragged on the index after shares in conglomerate Noble Group sold off sharply in Singapore, with the firm forced to halt trading after a 32 percent plunge as ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded it on weak cash flows and profitability. Glencore, BHP, Rio Tinto and Randgold Resources all fell between 0.6 and 1.6 percent. Merlin, which runs London attractions including Madame Tussauds waxworks and the aquarium and is exposed to tourism, was among the biggest fallers, down 1.5 percent after Monday's deadly attack in Manchester. The European travel and leisure sector &lt; .SXTP> was down 0.3 percent. More domestically focused mid-cap stocks outperformed large-caps again, hitting a fresh record high of 19,984.66 points during the session as company results impressed. Home emergency insurance provider Homeserve surged more than 10 percent to a record high after its full-year results beat expectations. "Homeserve has increased investment in its front line staff and network," said Liberum analysts, adding that the firm's acquisition of online trader listings website Checkatrade in February could boost its access to an as yet untapped clientele. Britain's biggest sandwich maker Greencore jumped 7.3 percent after its results came in ahead of expectations, alleviating investors' concerns about inflation denting consumer appetite, with what Jefferies analysts called 'reassuring commentary' around inflation recovery. Small-cap tile retailer Topps Tiles was less upbeat about the economy, pointing to a challenging trading environment and saying full-year profit would come in at the low end of analysts' expectations. Its shares fell 6.6 percent, the top small-cap losers.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. President Donald Trump wants lawmakers to slash healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor as they cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over 10 years, according to the White House's budget proposal for next year. The Trump administration on Tuesday will ask Republicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - for the politically sensitive cuts in its first full budget. The proposal in its current form is unlikely to be approved by lawmakers as they craft their own tax and spending plans but the document sets out Trump's budget priorities and lays down a marker with Congress. Trump seeks to balance the budget by the end of the decade, according to a preview given to reporters on Monday. There is some new spending in his plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October. The Pentagon would get a boost, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, which was a central promise of Trump's presidential campaign. Trump's proposal foresees selling half of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down U.S. crude prices. The biggest savings would come from cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor made as part of a Republican healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Trump, who is traveling overseas this week, wants lawmakers to cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps. U.S. stocks were slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of the budget's full unveiling later in the day. "In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump's budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. Republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the Trump administration's pro-business economic agenda, which would cut the business tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, and reduce the number of personal tax brackets. But their policy agenda has stalled as the White House grapples with the political fallout from Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey had been leading a probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY In his budget, Trump upheld his promise - for the most part - that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security, two social insurance programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. Those so-called entitlement programs may not come out of Capitol Hill unscathed, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. "We have to look at the entitlements if we believe that we want them to be there for future generations," he told CNBC. The healthcare bill passed by the House aims to gut the Obama administration's signature 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, that expanded insurance coverage and the government-run Medicaid program. But it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is writing its own law. The White House proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, to work. The plan would slash supports for farmers and impose user fees for meat inspection. Another politically fraught item is a proposal for cuts to the U.S. Postal Service, a goal that has long eluded lawmakers and administrations from both political parties. The first look at the plan came in a "skinny budget" released in March which received a tepid response from Congress. Most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The budget includes $25 billion for a plan to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, and $200 billion to encourage state and local governments to boost spending on roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure programs. The plan drew immediate fire from lobby groups, including from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which said it relied on "rosy assumptions," gimmicks and unrealistic cuts. "While we appreciate the administration's focus on reducing the debt, when using more realistic assumptions, the president’s budget does not add up," Maya MacGuineas, the group's president, said in a statement. Trump's plan relies on forecasts for economic growth of 3 percent a year by the end of his first term - well beyond Congressional Budget Office assumptions of 1.9 percent growth. "That assumes a pessimism about America, about the economy, about its people, about its culture, that we’re simply refusing to accept," White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said of the CBO assumptions. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 85.76 +1.06 +1.25% The Justice Department disclosed its payments to Richard Breeden, the Madoff Victim Fund administrator, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Bloomberg News. Breeden’s fees, which are being paid from cash in the fund, cover his work through 2016. The delay highlights how 8 1/2 years after Madoff’s arrest investors are still scrambling to recover money from a U.S. fund that was announced with great fanfare. Victims have recovered billions of dollars from another fund, but they have yet to be made whole. "It’s very frustrating that people are making money off us like this, using money that was recovered for victims," said Daphne Brogdon, a Food Network personality, whose family lost about $5 million in the Madoff scam. "They’re eating away at whatever percentage we could possibly get."

Justice Department spokeswoman Dawn Dearden declined to comment on the fees or claims process but pointed to information on the fund’s website. "We now expect that the initial distribution will take place sometime in 2017 and will be larger than we originally had anticipated," Breeden, a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote on the website. Picower’s Billions Load Error The compensation fund was created in December 2012 to repay thousands of Madoff’s victims after the U.S. seized $2.4 billion from the estate of one of his biggest investors, the late Jeffry Picower. The fund grew by $1.7 billion following a 2014 forfeiture deal with Madoff’s bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., which was accused of turning a blind eye to the scam. Breeden estimated in February 2016 that as many as 40,000 victims would get initial payments by the end of that year. They didn’t. An update on the website in January cited the time-consuming claims process and issues with inadequate paperwork from some victims. The Justice Department is “notoriously slow” making decisions on forfeited assets, said Jon Barooshian, a white-collar defense lawyer at Bowditch & Dewey in Boston who has dealt with forfeiture issues. "I’m surprised it’s taking so long, but I don’t know if the fault will fall at Richard Breeden’s feet. It might be more of an internal DOJ issue," said Barooshian, who isn’t involved in the Madoff case. Picard Payouts By comparison, Irving Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation of Madoff’s firm, has paid out more than $9 billion since 2009. Picard, a lawyer at Baker & Hostetler LLP, brought numerous lawsuits to recover assets, and his fund is administered separately from Breeden’s under different U.S. laws. Picard has racked up considerable fees himself, telling ABC News in 2015 that his firm might collect as much as $1 billion when all is done. He called it a “very good return on an investment.” His fees are paid by the industry-financed Securities Investor Protection Corp. rather than from money recovered for victims. Heather Wlodek, a spokeswoman for Baker & Hostetler, declined to comment. Breeden will eventually make recommendations to the Justice Department’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section on which claims to pay and which to deny. His firm has already been paid the $38.8 million in fees, the Justice Department said. Madoff, 79, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. His victims lost a combined $17.5 billion in principal, though their final account statements totaled about $64 billion including profit from bogus trades. Direct Accounts Picard accepted claims only from Madoff’s direct account holders. That meant customers of so-called feeder funds, which directed cash to Madoff’s firm for years, weren’t eligible. Feeder funds could, however, file claims with Picard and repay their investors if they received payments from the trustee. Breeden accepted claims from all Madoff investors, including feeder funds. That increased the amount of work, particularly because Madoff’s records don’t have any information about feeder-fund customers that could be used to verify claims. In 2013, the fund’s website said the process "is moving forward toward necessary decisions in the relatively near term.” A year ago, Breeden said he was preparing to recommend approval of more than 25,000 claims covering almost $4 billion in losses, but he didn’t say when checks might go out. He also said he fund would recommend denial of more than 7,500 claims covering more than $25 billion of claimed losses that didn’t satisfy requirements of the plan. Breeden was hired months after distributing more than $728 million to about 8,500 Adelphia Communications Inc. victims, which he described as "the largest single distribution of forfeited assets to victims in Department of Justice history." He served in similar roles after the collapses of Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Rodrigo Amaral reports Chilean pension schemes have been increasing their investments in other countries as they try to maximise returns and diversify their portfolio to spread the risks. Changes implemented gradually since 2007 have raised the maximum level of investments Chilean pension funds can have outside the country.  The limit was raised to 60% of total assets in mid-2009, from 30% in 2007. The new rules have created a real opportunity that pension funds have been only too happy to exploit. By the end of 2009, they had 43.7% of their assets invested outside Chile, compared to 24.1% in February of the same year. And there is scope to keep sending more money abroad, as investments remain well below the legal limit. Meanwhile, the national pension supervisor, Superintendencia de Pensiones, has moved to make hedging currency exposure easier than it had been.  Related articles The pros and cons of direct lending PP Administration Survey 2017: The results How trustees should approach corporate takeovers What can the UK learn from Denmark to develop its own dashboard? Pension accounting changes - the what, when, who and how Chile has one of the most advanced private pension systems in the world and scheme managers are actively looking for ways to make their assets work harder. With 97% of the country’s employees making contributions, and a good chunk of self-employed professionals too, pension funds have plenty of money invest.  Chilean schemes are not allowed to invest directly in hedge funds and other alternative assets Pension funds represent a very important part of the Chilean economy, managing assets of US$114bn by the end of February. That’s equivalent to about 70% of the country’s GDP. The sheer volume of their assets means that pension funds account for a large part of Chile’s investment needs.   Opportunity for gains “Financial vehicles negotiated outside our country offer not only opportunities to make gains, but they also have an important effect on diversification,” said Eduardo Steffens Vidal, the chief investment officer of AFP Cuprum, one of Chile’s major pension schemes.  By sending more money than ever abroad, Chilean pension funds have already invested $51.8bn in financial products provided by international groups, according to Superintendencia de Pensiones. This eagerness to embrace global markets is especially strong when it comes to investing in the so-called “Fondos A”, the riskier of the five kinds of funds pension funds can invest in, which are subject to less stringent investment restrictions. They can have up to 80% of their assets invested in equities, and 70% of all the money invested in Fondos A has already gone abroad.    Increasing interest This trend has fuelled the interest of asset managers from around the world who have been focusing their attention on this South American country as they look to expand their footprints. While large amounts of money are currently being invested overseas, there is still some way to go before Chilean pension funds reach the legal limits. There was a further $19.15bn that could have been invested in international vehicles last December, according to Superitentencia de Pensiones’ data.  Volumes have been picking up quickly. Amid the gloom of 2008, only $2.5bn was transferred abroad for investment purposes; the amount reached $15.2bn last year, strong evidence of the increasing appetite of managers to try their luck in new pastures. “There are many groups already providing a wide range of products to Chilean funds, as they have considerable amounts of money to invest,” said Rodrigo Acuña, a partner at Primamerica, a Santiago-based consultancy.  The largest beneficiary so far has been BlackRock, which accounted for 11.33% of the assets Chilean pension funds invested overseas by the end of 2009. Other winners included Fidelity (8.81%), Schroders (7.3%), Vanguard (6.57%) and JP Morgan Chase (6.02%). Superintendencia de Pensiones estimated that about 50 companies currently provide international investment services for Chilean pension funds, but only eight of them account for more than half the market. The data compiled by the supervisor disclosed that schemes are mostly attracted by equity funds, with 59.5% of all the assets invested abroad pouring into these investments. Fixed income funds, mainly exposed to corporate high yield bonds and emerging market sovereigns, come next with about 24%. ETFs come third with 12.3%.  In terms of geographical distribution, Chilean funds have displayed an increasing appetite for emerging markets vehicles. The United States remains the most popular destination of investments with 23.2% of the total, but its share has been gradually shrinking, while those of Brazil (14.6%) and China (7.8%) are on the rise. Investment has been spread around too, as pensions funds have investments in more than 60 different countries.  The asset classes that are still missing are alternative investments like hedge funds and private equity. “Chilean schemes are not allowed to invest directly in hedge funds and other alternative assets,” said Acuña.  Only instruments specifically mentioned in the Chilean law or approved by the Central Bank and the industry supervisor can be picked up by pension funds. Even if alternative investments were an option, however, Steffens said pension funds would not be particularly drawn to such products. “We believe pension funds already are widely diversified portfolios, and that the marginal gain delivered by those instruments is low, whilst to have access to them implies a very high cost,” he said.   2008 losses Funds managed by the Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (or AFP, as Chile’s pension fund managers are known) suffered heavy losses in 2008, following the trend observed in other parts of the world. But Steffens noted that investments policies drafted before the crisis hit had a long term horizon and their basic principles had remained intact.  But the CIO of AFP Cuprum acknowledges that some important lessons have been learned.  “It showed how important it is to have more liquidity available in portfolios during times of high volatility,” Steffens pointed out. “The crisis not only generated large flows of money in and out of the funds, but also big price changes that made it necessary to perform transactions with the goal of keeping the performance of the funds within the range established by our investment policy.” Steffens said that for all the turmoil that has taken place since 2007, Chilean pension funds have already recovered to the levels they had before the financial crisis. Last year’s rally was a major factor to offset the losses of 2008. Superintendencia de Pensiones estimated that the riskier funds that AFPs can manage, Fondos A gained 65% on average last year in dollar terms. The strong performance followed a 51.8% drop in 2008 and a 28.7% growth the year before.  The least risky funds, Fondos E, which focus on fixed income and have a mere 3.6% of their assets invested out of Chile, gained only 9.8% last year in dollar terms, and actually lost 9% of their value in pesos. Fondos E have been, however, the best performers in the past three years, with returns of 27.77%, against 5.09%% of their riskier peers.  AFP Cuprum’s five funds posted returns of up to 45.59%, in the local currency, the peso, in the past five years. The worst performing fund, which cannot bet in equities, saw assets increase by 5.52% in the period. As managers of huge amounts of money in a market where the financial system has a limited scope, AFPs are set to carry on looking outside Chile to meet their actuarial targets; not least because the supervisor has taken further measures to make it easier and less risky to invest abroad.  In January, Superintendencia de Pensiones changed the law to allow pension funds to have more capabilities to hedge currency risk. The measure was seen as a necessity especially considering AFP’s growing interest in emerging markets vehicles, in whose currencies about 22% of their assets are denominated, said the supervisor. Superintendencia gave pension funds more flexibility to hedge their risks by authorising them to use a wider range of currencies to do it. For example, before the change, if investors had assets in the Brazilian real, they could only have derivative contracts in real to hedge currency risk. Now they can use other currencies too, which is expected to expand their options to sign currency hedging contracts. The new resolution also expanded the deadline to settle deficits in derivative contracts, from five or 10 days (depending on the type of contract) to 90 days.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Stocks to Give to Your Children and Grandchildren in May A good portfolio is the gift that keeps on giving. But the criteria can be a bit different when you're picking buy-and-hold stocks for seriously long-term investors. Neha Chamaria, Steve Symington, and Jordan Wathen (Nehams) May 23, 2017 at 10:07AM There's no better gift for your children than helping to secure their financial future. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better way to do that than by socking away some money for them in rock-solid stocks that have the potential to grow for decades. Not every stock fits the very long-term bill though, so we asked our three of our contributors to pick great buy-and-forget stocks that they believe could reap your grandchildren rich returns. Here's why they chose JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), and 2U Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU). Owning the future of education Steve Symington (2U Inc.): To succeed, today's youth require a good education, so why not buy them a piece of a promising business that's shaping the future of learning: online higher-education specialist 2U.  Image source: Getty Images Though 2U already has 38 announced programs at 17 top-200 universities, over the long term, the company expects to grow the number of programs it offers to around 193. As a result, 2U is also targeting at least 30% year-over-year revenue growth "for the foreseeable future."  Last quarter was no exception. Revenue climbed 36.7% year over year to $64.8 million, which produced adjusted net income of $500,000, or $0.01 per share. Both the top and bottom lines arrived above the high ends of 2U's financial guidance ranges, which allowed the company to increase its full 2017 guidance.  What's more, earlier this month, 2U agreed to spend $103 million (plus $20 million in potential earn-out payments) to acquire GetSmarter, a premium online short-course specialist that caters to working professionals. The acquisition will accelerate both 2U's international expansion and its entry into non-degree alternatives. So if you're willing to buy 2U stock in these early stages, I think watching its growth story play out in the coming years could be a great learning experience for a young investor. Your grandchildren will thank you for choosing this stock Neha Chamaria (Sherwin-Williams): If you're investing for your grandchildren, you're thinking really long term: You need stocks that will not only be around decades down the line, but will also have grown considerably over time. One way to pick such companies is to choose a proven leader -- or better yet, a household name -- in an important industry, one that has been an outperformer and grown exponentially over the years, and offers reliable dividends too add extra income to your portfolio. For those criteria, I can think of no better candidate than Sherwin-Williams. Let's step back two decades to show how far the stock has come: SHW data by YCharts While no one can guarantee that Sherwin-Williams will be a multibagger in the years to come, there's little reason to believe it won't grow. The stock's tremendous run up isn't a fluke: This is a 150-year-old paint company that has made its mark in the housing, construction, and industrial markets with its namesake and Dutch Boy brands, among others. Going by the consistent growth in its same-store sales -- it improved 5% last year -- there's no denying Sherwin-Williams enjoys brand loyalty. An expansive own-store setup, credible management, a focus on growth, and financial fortitude have helped it grow its net income and free cash flows by many times over the years. And there's no greater proof of Sherwin-Williams' credibility than its dividends, which it has raised every year since 1979. For long-term investors, those payouts can make a huge difference, as the "total return" change in the above chart reveals. With the paints and coatings company on course to become the largest in its industry when it acquires Valspar, there's a strong chance your children will thank you later for buying them some shares of Sherwin-Williams today. A bank for the long haul Jordan Wathen (JPMorgan Chase): In the banking industry, where a 1% return on assets is the hurdle for "good" banks, there isn't much room for error. Good banks do well by avoiding the bad. JPMorgan shines because of its management, and I think that goes deeper than CEO Jamie Dimon. It has the right incentive structure in place to do well even if Dimon steps down in the next few years. A recently filed proxy statement shows that 95% of Dimon's 2016 pay of $28 million was classified as "at-risk" pay. He earned $1.5 million in base compensation last year, with the remainder made up of $5 million in cash and $21.5 million taking the form of performance share units. Thus, a large share of the CEO's compensation rests in JPMorgan's ability to generate good returns on tangible common equity, which keeps management's interests aligned with those of the shareholders. This is how compensation plans should work, and it's what gives me confidence that JPMorgan will generate attractive returns over full banking cycles. So long as this incentive structure is in place, investors can be confident that the bank will be run with long-term shareholders in mind. And for that reason, even at a recent price of roughly 1.8x tangible book value, I think JPMorgan stock is a good pick for the long run.  Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Trump administration on Tuesday will ask Republicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - for the politically sensitive cuts in its first full budget. The proposal in its current form is unlikely to be approved by lawmakers as they craft their own tax and spending plans but the document sets out Trump’s budget priorities and lays down a marker with Congress. Trump seeks to balance the budget by the end of the decade, according to a preview given to reporters on Monday. There is some new spending in his plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October. The Pentagon would get a boost, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, which was a central promise of Trump’s presidential campaign. Trump’s proposal foresees selling half of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down U.S. crude prices. The biggest savings would come from cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor made as part of a Republican healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Trump, who is traveling overseas this week, wants lawmakers to cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps. U.S. stocks were slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of the budget’s full unveiling later in the day. “In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump’s budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending,” said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. Republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s pro-business economic agenda, which would cut the business tax rate to 15% from 35%, and reduce the number of personal tax brackets. But their policy agenda has stalled as the White House grapples with the political fallout from Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Comey had been leading a probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY In his budget, Trump upheld his promise - for the most part - that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security, two social insurance programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. Those so-called entitlement programs may not come out of Capitol Hill unscathed, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. “We have to look at the entitlements if we believe that we want them to be there for future generations,” he told CNBC. The healthcare bill passed by the House aims to gut the Obama administration’s signature 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, that expanded insurance coverage and the government-run Medicaid program. But it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is writing its own law. The White House proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, to work. The plan would slash supports for farmers and impose user fees for meat inspection. Another politically fraught item is a proposal for cuts to the U.S. Postal Service, a goal that has long eluded lawmakers and administrations from both political parties. The first look at the plan came in a “skinny budget” released in March which received a tepid response from Congress. Most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The budget includes $25 billion for a plan to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, and $200 billion to encourage state and local governments to boost spending on roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure programs. The plan drew immediate fire from lobby groups, including from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which said it relied on “rosy assumptions,” gimmicks and unrealistic cuts. “While we appreciate the administration’s focus on reducing the debt, when using more realistic assumptions, the president’s budget does not add up,” Maya MacGuineas, the group’s president, said in a statement. Trump’s plan relies on forecasts for economic growth of 3% a year by the end of his first term - well beyond Congressional Budget Office assumptions of 1.9% growth. “That assumes a pessimism about America, about the economy, about its people, about its culture, that we’re simply refusing to accept,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said of the CBO assumptions.

"You are the community who will drive the future of this technology. I challenge you to start collaborating together -- and I don’t just mean with people that think like you -- we need to be having hard conversations,” Johnson said in prepared remarks Tuesday at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Johnson told the gathering of the blockchain industry that her firm isn’t giving up on digital currencies despite hurdles. She pointed to several barriers to blockchain adoption, including limits of the technology, policy issues, control of the systems and customer usability. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up While blockchain technology has drawn attention from the financial industry because of its potential to free up billions of dollars in capital, it also faces significant hurdles, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. Regulators must also be convinced that linked networks of computers can be trusted to manage aspects of some of the world’s most important financial markets. JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV are among companies trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the blockchain can cut costs by speeding financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. Venture Deals Fidelity has invested in blockchain through venture deals with TradeBlock, Axoni and Boost VC and forged academic partnerships to explore the area, Johnson said. The firm’s innovation group, Fidelity Labs, has also been conducting research and experiments in the area. "Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities -- it will fundamentally change market structures -- and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself," she said. The virtual currency bitcoin introduced the world to the first blockchain in 2009. Since then, a more expansive type of software has gained attention. Called ethereum, its blockchain does far more than allowing bitcoin users to send value from one person to another as easily as sending an email. Urging Dialogue Ethereum is gaining interest among industries from finance to health care because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once participants create contracts they can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. Still, such technology isn’t able to offer scalability, privacy and peer-to-peer settlement all at once, she said. Fidelity is focused on investing in privacy since that’s important to customers, Johnson said. Johnson also encouraged the industry to have an open dialogue with regulators because the technology’s rapid growth is making it difficult for them to keep up. "Talk with people on the opposite side of the argument. Talk with people who are using these products. Talk with big businesses and the regulators. And come talk to us -- we need to hear your voice," she told the conference. Johnson, who has been CEO since 2014, took full control of Fidelity from her father, Edward "Ned" Johnson, in November 2016. She’s the third generation to run the company and, like her family members, keeps a low profile. The firm had $6.1 trillion in assets under administration, including managed assets of $2.2 trillion, as of April 30. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

While Tuesday's economic data was weak, investors were relieved Trump's first full budget plan was largely as expected, even if it is not expected to be approved in Congress. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," said Wade Balliet, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of the West. Trump's budget called for a hike in infrastructure and military spending, along with a raft of politically sensitive cuts, in areas such as healthcare and food assistance programs, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. The S&P 500 ended below its session high. It topped 2,400 points a few times during the session for the first time since the markets' plunge last Wednesday on concerns about the future of Trump's presidency. While the President is on an overseas trip, stocks were helped by a lack of major news updates related to the government probe on possible ties between his election campaign and Russia. "With the President being away, with the news cycle slowing a little bit, investors have nibbled their way back in," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "This market has had tremendous strength on the idea that the new administration is going to be able to push through a pro-business platform. To the extent it loses political credibility the market has had trouble holding these gains." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 20,937.91, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 5.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,138.71. In the morning, U.S. economic data showed new single-family home sales in April tumbled from near a nine-and-a-half-year high, while manufacturing activity for May fell to the lowest level since September. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended higher. Financials .SPSY rose 0.8 percent, helped by a 1.2 percent gain in the bank subsector .SPXBK. Consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was the biggest laggard with a 0.4 percent drop. The biggest drag on the consumer sector was Autozone Inc (AZO.N), down 11.8 percent to $581.4. The auto part retailer's quarterly results missed expectations. Advance Auto Parts (AAP.N) fell 4.6 percent while O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY.O) fell 3.3 percent and Genuine Parts (GPC.N) shares fell almost 2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 59 new lows. About 5.95 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Global shares were mixed in trading, Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2015, with only some markets cheered by an overnight rally as investor sentiment grew cautious on lower oil prices. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Updated at 11:39 a.m.  NEW YORK • U.S. stocks are rising Tuesday as banks climb following an increase in bond yields, which will allow banks to charge higher rates on loans. Health care companies like makers of scientific instruments and drugs are higher as well. Stocks are on track for their fourth gain in a row and have mostly undone a big loss from last Wednesday, when they took their biggest loss of 2017. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 7 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,400 as of 12:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,943. The Nasdaq composite erased an early loss and rose 9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,142. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks also turned higher and gained 6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,382. Two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are rising and the S&P 500 is closing in on the record high it set last week. NETWORKING: Nokia climbed after the company said it settled its legal disputes with Apple. The two companies said they will work together and that Nokia will get a cash payment from Apple, but it didn't disclose specifics. The Finnish company was once the biggest cellphone maker in the world, but it sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014 and is now a network infrastructure provider. Its U.S. shares rose 31 cents, or 5 percent, to $6.52 Tuesday. Apple dipped 6 cents to $153.93. SCOPE THIS OUT: Scientific instrument maker Agilent Technologies rose after its second-quarter profit and sales beat Wall Street estimates. The company also raised its annual profit forecast. Its shares gained $2.69, or 4.8 percent, to $58.77. Elsewhere, industrial and medical device maker Danaher picked up $1.26, or 1.5 percent, to $84.17. BONDS: Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.27 percent from 2.25 percent. That helped bank stocks. High-dividend companies like utilities also traded higher. BLOWING A GASKET: Auto parts retailer AutoZone stumbled after its results were weaker than expected. The company said costs were higher and sales at older locations fell. Its stock fell $55.87, or 8.5 percent, to $603.62. Competitor O'Reilly Automotive sank $7.35, or 3 percent, to $241.11 and Advance Auto Parts gave up $5.17, or 3.5 percent, to $142.20. All three stocks have dropped this year as investors worried about slowing car sales. DRINK UP: Coca-Cola gained 33 cents to $44.51 and Monster Beverage climbed 94 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.28 as beverage companies and other household goods companies gained ground. PepsiCo rose 38 cents to $115.28. POWER UP: Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after its profit and sales in the fourth quarter surpassed analyst expectations. The company's games include the "Grand Theft Auto" ''NBA2K" and "Sid Meier's Civilization" franchises. The strong results canceled out a delay for another key game, "Red Dead Redemption 2," which will be published next spring instead of later this year. Take-Two stock jumped $3.54, or 5.1 percent, to $72.58. It has doubled over the last year. Rival Activision Blizzard added 27 cents $57.39 and Electronic Arts rose 58 cents to $108.97. HOME SALES SLOW: Sales of new homes fell 11 percent in April from the previous month. That was the biggest drop in more than two years. Economists expected a smaller decline since sales had reached a nine-year high in March, and experts said the decline was most likely a blip. Homebuilder NVR fell $28.79, or 1.2 percent, to $2,328.48 and D.R. Horton lost 29 cents to $33.62. Lennar sank 33 cents to $52.12. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's also slipped.

The company said clearance sales hurt its earnings, and its shares gave up $1.56, or 8.8 percent, to $16.09. The stock is down 29 percent this year. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 17 cents to $51.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 15 cents to $54.02 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: European stocks traded slightly higher after key surveys of business activity and optimism hit their highest levels in years. That left investors hopeful that unemployment will start to decline and European economies will continue to gain strength. Germany's DAX added 0.3 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain declined 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.1 percent. The South Korean Kospi gained 0.7 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.68 yen from 111.20 yen. The euro declined to $1.1202 from $1.1234. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | MYT 10:11 PM Wall St edges up at open ahead Trump’s budget plan At 9:37am ET (Tuesday) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.62 points, or 0.16%, at 20,928.45. The Reuters photo shows a trader working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: US stocks were slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of US President Donald Trump’s first full budget plan that is aimed at slashing government spending and trimming the deficit. Trump is set to propose a raft of politically sensitive cuts, including to healthcare and food assistance programmes for the poor, with the aim of chopping government spending by US$3.6 trillion (RM15.5 trillion) and balancing the budget over the next decade. Congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. “In the US all eyes are on Trump’s budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending,” said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 9:37am ET (1337 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.62 points, or 0.16%, at 20,928.45, the S&P 500 was up 2.72 points, or 0.11%, at 2,396.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.75 points, or 0.11%, at 6,140.37. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the health index’s and technology sector’s 0.23% rise leading the advancers. US futures slipped slightly on Monday evening, before recovering, on news of the suicide attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at a pop concert in the English city of Manchester. Among stocks, shares of Toll Brothers rose 2.7% to US$39.01 after the luxury homebuilder reported a 40% rise in quarterly profit. Autozone fell 8.2% to US$608.57 after the company’s quarterly results came in below expectations. Shares of other auto part retailers were also hit.  Advance Auto Parts, O’Reilly Automotive and Genuine Parts were down between 3% and 4.5%. Shares of Take-Two reversed course from premarket to rise as much as 11% to a record high of US$76.70 as the videogame maker’s full-year forecast was not as bad as feared. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,701 to 819. On the Nasdaq, 1,150 issues rose and 1,066 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 18 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Related Stories Wall Street ends up; defense, tech stocks a boost(Update 1) Wall St gains as defense, tech stocks rise Wall St gains as Trump rout eases Wall St edges up as investors buy beaten down stocks Wall Street skids amid Trump turmoil You May Be Interested UMW downgraded from Hold to Reduce at CIMB Research Malaysian palm oil/Vegoils: Market factors to watch Wednesday May 24 Ringgit easier against US$ Wednesday Trump budget proposes deep cut to US oil stockpile CIMB Research raises AirAsia X core net profit for FY17 Diary Malaysia Wednesday May 24 Others Also Read Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro device to reverse sales drop Turning the dial up at fitness fest Chris Cornell's death ruled as a suicide Property Related advertisement Latest News Govt to reimburse Proton RM1.1b as grant for R&D Noble Group says still talking with potential strategic parties Chinese demand for palm oil set to drop as buyers snap up alternative cargoes Moody's downgrades China, warns of fading financial strength as debt mounts DRB-Hicom to sell 49.9% in Proton to Geely Holding Most Viewed in Business DRB-Hicom to sell 49.9% in Proton to Geely Holding Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Proton CIMB posts record quarterly earnings of RM1.18b Ringgit at 6-month high Pound to head lower as "all roads" point to hard Brexit Moody's downgrades China, warns of fading financial strength as debt mounts KLCI higher at noon, ringgit lower versus US$ Chinese demand for palm oil set to drop as buyers snap up alternative cargoes New chief wants to add zest to TM Is RM3bil for small and mid caps justified? advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(NYSE: CWH) has registered an amended S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its secondary offering. The company plans to offer 10 million shares, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.5 million shares. Out of the 10 million shares, 3.5 million are being offered by the company and the remainder are being offered by the selling stockholders. At Monday’s closing price of $29.02, the entire offering is valued up to $333.73 million. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Baird, BMO Capital Markets, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Stephens and Wells Fargo. The company believes that it is the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for recreational vehicle (RV) enthusiasts. Roughly 9 million households in the United States own an RV, and of that installed base, it has approximately 3.3 million active customers. Camping World generates recurring revenue by providing RV owners and enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that it believes are essential to operate, maintain and protect their RV and to enjoy the RV lifestyle. The firm provides these offerings through its two iconic brands: Good Sam and Camping World. In terms of its finances, the company had this to say in the filing: Our Active Customer database had approximately 3.3 million customers on December 31, 2016, representing a 6.4% five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Our total revenue was $3.5 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 17.4% five-year CAGR. Our net income was $203.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 48.0% five-year CAGR. Our Adjusted EBITDA was $291.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 22.5% five-year CAGR. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase common units directly from CWGS, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of the Gander Mountain acquisition, including the related reopening and initial working capital needs of 70 or more retail locations. Camping World will not receive proceeds for the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. Shares of Camping World last closed at $29.02, with a consensus analyst price target of $37.25 and a 52-week trading range of $20.45 to $36.60. The stock was down 2.7% at $28.25 in early trading indications Tuesday.

Trump is set to propose a raft of politically sensitive cuts, including to healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. Congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. "In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump's budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state, but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.62 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,928.45, the S&amp;P 500 was up 2.72 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,396.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.75 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,140.37. Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher, with the health index's and technology sector's 0.23 percent rise leading the advancers. U.S. futures slipped slightly on Monday evening, before recovering, on news of the suicide attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at a pop concert in the English city of Manchester. Among stocks, shares of Toll Brothers rose 2.7 percent to $39.01 after the luxury homebuilder reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly profit. Autozone fell 8.2 percent to $608.57 after the company's quarterly results came in below expectations. Shares of other auto part retailers were also hit. Advance Auto Parts , O'Reilly Automotive and Genuine Parts were down between 3 percent and 4.5 percent. Shares of Take-Two reversed course from premarket to rise as much as 11 percent to a record high of $76.70 as the videogame maker's full-year forecast was not as bad as feared. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,701 to 819. On the Nasdaq, 1,150 issues rose and 1,066 fell. The S&amp;P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 18 new lows.

The upward momentum on Wall Street comes as stocks continue to recover from the sell-off that was seen last Wednesday, which dragged the major averages down to their lowest levels in nearly a month. Many traders felt the pullback was overdone amid lingering optimism about President Donald Trump's ability to implement his pro-business policy agenda. Extending the rebound seen late last week, stocks moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. With the upward move on the day, the major averages further offset the sell-off that was seen last Wednesday. The major averages closed firmly in positive territory for the third straight session. The Dow rose 89.99 points or 0.4 percent to 20,894.83, the Nasdaq advanced 49.92 points or 0.8 percent to 6,133.62 and the S&P 500 climbed 12.29 points or 0.5 percent to 2,394.02. The markets continued to benefit from the upward momentum seen over the two previous sessions, which helped the major averages climb off their worst levels in nearly a month. Trading activity was somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. Later this week, trading may be impacted by reaction to reports on new and existing home sales and durable goods orders. The Federal Reserve is also due to the release the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting, which may shed some light on the outlook for interest rates. Among individual stocks, shares of Blackstone Group (BX) moved sharply higher after the private equity firm and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia announced they are launching $40 billion investment vehicle to finance infrastructure renovation in the U.S. Auto giant Ford (F) also posted a notable gain after announcing it has named Jim Hackett as its new president and CEO. Hackett succeeds Mark Fields, who has elected to retire from Ford. On the other hand, shares of Amgen (AMGN) came under pressure after the biotech company said it does not expect its experimental osteoporosis drug Evenity to win FDA approval this year amid concerns about heart safety. Gold stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index climbing by 1.5 percent. The strength among gold stocks came amid an increase by the price of the precious metal. Significant strength was also visible among networking stocks, as reflected by the 1.4 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Networking Index. Ciena (CIEN) led the sector higher after an upgrade by Stifel Nicolaus. Telecom stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, resulting in a 1.7 percent gain by the NYSE Arca Telecom Index. Qualcomm (QCOM) posted a standout gain after JPMorgan Chase upgraded its rating on the company's stock to Overweight from Neutral. Software, transportation, and electronic stocks also moved notably higher, while most of the other major sectors showed more modest moves. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are slipping $0.04 to $51.09 a barrel after rising $0.46 to $51.13 a barrel on Monday. Meanwhile, after climbing $7.80 to $1,261.40 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are dipping $0.80 to $1,260.60 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.21 yen compared to the 111.30 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1233 compared to yesterday's $1.1237. Asia Asian stocks reversed early gains to end mixed on Tuesday as investors digested news of a terrorist attack in Manchester, England, and fresh revelations provided additional evidence that the White House actively sought to undermine the FBI investigation into Russia. At least twenty-two people were killed and around 50 others injured in a suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert late Monday in Manchester, police have said. Separately, the Washington Post reported that U.S. President Donald Trump urged two senior intelligence officials in March to publicly deny any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia. Chinese shares extended losses for a second straight session on renewed concerns over a regulatory crackdown on shadow banking and speculative trading. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 13.95 points or 0.45 percent to 3,061.72, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index inched up 11.81 points or 0.05 percent to 25,403.15. Japanese shares fell as news of the suspected terrorist attack in Britain and the political crisis gripping Washington lifted the safe-haven yen and kept export-oriented shares under pressure. Manufacturing activity in Japan expanded at the weakest pace in six months in May, preliminary data from IHS Markit showed, further weighing on the markets. The Nikkei 225 Index ended down 65 points or 0.33 percent at 19,613.28, while the broader Topix index closed 0.16 percent lower at 1,565.22. Australian shares fell slightly, dragged down by banking and material stocks. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index reversed early gains to end the session down 11 points or 0.19 percent at 5,760.20. The broader All Ordinaries index slipped 8.40 points or 0.14 percent to 5,802.80. The big four banks fell between 0.3 percent and 1 percent as concerns about the government's new bank levy persisted. Mining giant Rio Tinto shed 0.7 percent after launching an offer to buy back up to $2.5 billion of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. Rival BHP Billiton dropped 1.2 percent and Fortescue Metals Group lost over 2 percent. Meanwhile, biopharmaceutical firm CSL and gold miners were among the prominent gainers. Europe European stocks have moved higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic reports helped investors shrug off worries over U.S. political risks, the suspected terrorist attack in the U.K. and the lack of progress on Greek debt talks. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the German DAX Index is up by 0.5 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.7 percent. Nokia shares have jumped after the Finnish network giant settled a patent dispute with Apple. Severn Trent has also moved higher after the British water utility upgraded its dividend policy after reporting an increase in annual profits. HomeServe shares have surged in London after the repair and insurance firm posted a big jump in full-year profits and hiked its dividend for the year by 20 percent. Vivendi has also advanced on a Wall Street Journal report that the French media firm could float a minority stake in Universal Music Group. On the flip side, Switzerland's Clariant has dropped after announcing a tie-up with U.S. competitor Huntsman. In economic news, the eurozone private sector logged the fastest growth in six years in May, flash data from IHS Markit showed. The flash composite output index came in at 56.8, unchanged from April's six-year high, while economists expected the index to fall slightly to 56.7. Other reports on German business sentiment, German GDP and French manufacturing sentiment also painted a positive picture of regional economies. The pound slipped against both the euro and the dollar after official data showed Britain recorded a larger-than-forecast budget deficit in the first month of the new fiscal year. U.S. Economic Reports At 10 am ET, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a report on new home sales in the month of April. New home sales are expected to drop to an annual rate of 602,000 in April from 621,000 in March. The Treasury Department is due to announce the results of its auction of $26 billion worth of two-year notes at 1 pm ET. At 3:15 pm ET, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari is scheduled to participate in a conversation about "Homeownership in Indian Country" at a CICD Roundtable in Minneapolis. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker is due to give a presentation with audience and Q&A in New York at 5 pm ET. Stocks In Focus Shares of Sonus Networks (SONS) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the company announced a merger with GENBAND in a transaction valuing the combined company at approximately $745 million. Medical equipment and technology company Agilent (A) may also see early strength after reporting better than expected fiscal second quarter results and raising its full-year guidance. Shares of Toll Brothers (TOL) are also likely to move to the upside after the luxury home builder reported fiscal second quarter results that exceeded estimates. On the other hand, Auto Zone (AZO) may come under pressure after the auto parts retailer reported weaker than expected fiscal third quarter results. Shoe retailer DSW (DSW) reported first quarter earnings that came in below expectations, although its revenues beat estimates. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The 10 Lowest-Paying College Majors Thrills and Chills: The 10 Most Fun States In America Dubai For Lunch?

To be sure, the baker’s dozen are soundly outperforming the market this year. The firm added the 13 new names to its hedge fund VIP list after analyzing the positions of 821 hedge funds with total long and short stock holdings of $1.9 trillion, CNBC reported. Four times a year, hedge funds file their long positions with the SEC and the information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends. Goldman's current hedge fund VIP list consists of the 50 stocks that "appear most often among the top 10 holdings of fundamentally-driven hedge fund portfolios" for the March quarter, CNBC reported. The bank analyzed the positions of 821 hedge funds with total long and short stock holdings of $1.9 trillion. "Our Hedge Fund VIP list of the most popular long positions has outperformed the S&P 500," strategist Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. "From an implementation standpoint, the hedge fund VIP list represents a tool for investors seeking to 'follow the smart money' based on 13-F filings." The firm's basket of the top holdings of hedge funds is up 10 percent this year through May 18 versus the S&P 500's 7 percent return. Here are the 13 picks: Allergan (AGN) Mead Johnson (MJN) Adient (ADNT) Athene (ATH) Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Salesforce (CRM) DXC Technology (DXC) JD.com (JD) Monsanto (MON) Mobileye (MBLY) Gilead (GILD) Humana (HUM) Pioneer Natural (PXD) Meanwhile, several big-name hedge fund investors trimmed their stakes in financial companies in the first quarter as hopes for immediate tax cuts and loosening of regulations after President Donald Trump’s victory in November began to fade.  Boston-based Adage Capital Management cut its position in Wells Fargo & Co, which has come under fire for its sales practices, by 3.9 million shares, according to regulatory filings, while John Burbank’s Passport Capital cut its stake in the company by 947,000 shares, Reuters reported. Third Point cut its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co by 28 percent, to 3.75 million shares, while Suvretta Capital Management sold all of its shares of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc. Overall, financial companies in the S&P 500 were up 2.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for the index as a whole. Financials significantly outperformed the broad market following Trump's Nov. 8 election. Trump had pledged to do a "big number" on the landmark Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which raised banks’ capital requirements and restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customers’ money. The Treasury Department is still filling vacancies and will not be able to complete a review of the law by Trump’s June deadline, sources told Reuters.

(Photo: Will Culpepper/flickr/cc) In normal times, Dee from New York would have ordered her copy of The Handmaid’s Tale from Amazon, but these are not normal times. Amazon is on the Grab Your Wallet list, a campaign to boycott retailers that sell Trump family products, which began as a response to the video revealing our now-president’s penchant for grabbing women "by the pussy." Dee bought her book from a smaller retailer instead. Since Donald Trump’s election in November, and especially since his January inauguration, hundreds of small and not-so-small organizations have sprung up to oppose the president.  They joined the ranks of established left-leaning and liberal groups already revving up their engines to fight the administration. Among all the ways you can now voice your dissent, though, there’s one tactic that this president will surely understand: economic resistance aimed at his own businesses and those of his children. He may not be swayed by protesters filling the streets, but he does speak the language of money. Through a host of tactics -- including boycotting stores that carry Trump products, punishing corporations and advertisers that underwrite the administration’s agenda, and disrupting business-as-usual at Trump companies -- protesters are using the power of the purse to demonstrate their opposition and have planned a day of resistance against his brand on June 14th. Such economic dissent may prove to be an especially apt path of resistance, especially for the millions of Americans who reside in blue states and have struggled with a sense of powerlessness following the election. After all, it’s not immediately obvious how to take effective political action in the usual American way when your legislators already agree with you. But what blue-state dwellers lack in political sway they make up for in economic clout, since blue states have, on average, greater household incomes and more purchasing power than their red-state compatriots. The impact of coordinated blue-state boycotts could be enormous. That’s why Grab Your Wallet, along with Color of Change, a racial-justice group, and numerous other organizations are encouraging individuals to see their purchasing power as political muscle. “It was close at the polls, but it’s not close at the cash register,” Shannon Coulter, a founder of Grab Your Wallet, told me recently. And yet, even as throngs of organizations and hundreds of thousands of individuals throw their energy into economic tactics intended to weaken the president, it’s still an open question whether this type of resistance -- or, more specifically, its current implementation -- can precipitate anything in the way of meaningful change. “A Sprawling Landscape of Resistance” At first glance, Grab Your Wallet is a modest website: a Google spreadsheet that lists about 50 companies to boycott.  Included are the department stores Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Lord & Taylor, as well as online retailers like Overstock.com, Zappos, and Amazon, all of which sell some type of Trump swag. (The precise number of companies listed continues to decline, as retailers dump the Trump brand.) The site gets an impressive two million unique visitors every month, and when I spoke with Coulter, she told me that 22 retailers had dropped Trump products since the start of the boycott. She believes that this is just the beginning. “I don’t think we’ll see the full impact of the boycott until summer, because of how the retail cycle works,” she explained. The department store Nordstrom, for instance, the biggest company to date to drop the Ivanka Trump brand, sold through its existing inventory before indicating that it would not reorder. That announcement even attracted attention from the president, who tweeted: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Color of Change has long deployed strategies of economic resistance, specifically by going after advertisers who underwrite hate. Now that Trump is in the White House, Rashad Robinson, the group’s executive director, told me that they’re focusing on the role of corporate enablers “who’ve made this administration possible.” He described a strategy in which his organization carefully selects a corporate target and then rallies its million-plus members to participate in a campaign designed to tarnish the company’s brand -- unless its executives make more ethical advertising choices. Color of Change played a role in the recent ouster of Bill O’Reilly from Fox News by helping to influence some of the more than 50 major advertisers who pulled their financial support from his top-rated program. After advertisers fled, Fox gave O’Reilly the boot. Progressive groups are proving increasingly savvy when it comes to designing such consumer-driven tactics. The Center for Popular Democracy and the immigrant-rights group Make the Road New York recently co-launched a campaign called Corporate Backers of Hate, which targets Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, The Walt Disney Company, and a handful of other corporations that have provided various forms of support for Trump and his agenda. Wells Fargo, for instance, has lent millions of dollars to the president’s companies, is an investor in immigrant detention centers run by private, for-profit contractors, and has loaned money to developers for the Dakota Access Pipeline, the 1,172-mile oil pipe that would cross Standing Rock Sioux Tribe lands in North Dakota. (Trump signed a memo authorizing that pipeline within days of taking office.) The Corporate Backers of Hate website allows protesters to bypass customer service staff at these corporations and send messages directly to top executives and board members to express their disapproval. This strategy of going after the funding underlying Trump’s network has won some early victories. Several groups have been trying to cut off the flow of advertising dollars to Breitbart, the xenophobic pseudo-news site formerly run by White House strategist Steve Bannon. Leading the charge in this work is a Twitter-based group, Sleeping Giants, with a relatively simple proposition: it asks followers to take screenshots of ads on Breitbart -- preferably next to an offensive headline -- and then tweet that screenshot to the company in the ad along with a polite message asking it to stop underwriting hate. This approach has been wildly successful; according to Sleeping Giants, thousands of advertisers have pulled out of Breitbart. Nicholas Reville is a seasoned online organizer who has become a leading figure in the campaign to, as he says, make “hate unprofitable.” He believes that the Sleeping Giants model of digital resistance represents a new and important type of political action. “It’s very, very rare that you have an activism campaign where people are doing something other than signing a petition, showing up to a rally, [or] donating money,” he told me. Instead, he pointed out, an individual can now take a discrete action on his or her personal device and actually help win a victory when an advertiser pulls out of Breitbart. Some activists are going beyond screenshots and tweets. Journalist Naomi Klein recently released a video highlighting the fact that Trump’s brand is one of his most important sources of revenue and suggesting that “jamming” the brand -- by turning it from a money-maker into a money-loser -- would be a powerful form of resistance. She mentions tactics like clogging phone lines at Trump companies or making, and then canceling, reservations at his hotels. One activist who has been working on jamming those Trump phone lines, and who spoke with me on condition of anonymity, said that resisters like her had discovered that it was surprisingly easy to disrupt the president’s businesses. “The phone lines do not have the capacity to handle even medium-volume call traffic,” she said, and assured me that there was more phone jamming planned for the future. When I asked what she hoped to achieve through this tactic, she responded that the goal was to weaken President Trump financially, politically, and in every way imaginable. “These strategies are complements to other kinds of organizing,” she went on. “None of these tactics alone are going to bring down the Trump administration... that’s not how it works. This is part of a sprawling landscape of resistance.” Easy to Resist, Hard to Win The multitude of groups, campaigns, and individuals going after Donald Trump, Trump businesses, and companies supporting him or his political agenda do indeed form a sprawling, often chaotic landscape of resistance. I receive a dozen different, mostly uncoordinated action-alert messages in my inbox daily. In the weeks immediately following the inauguration, I found all that frenetic energy strangely appealing. After a couple of months of diffuse efforts, however, I began to wonder whether such efforts would be better spent on fewer, more coordinated campaigns. While Trump oppositionists undoubtedly feel a thrill of satisfaction when Nordstrom drops Ivanka’s product line and legions of advertisers pull out of Breitbart, it’s unclear whether these are steps on the path to a revised political landscape, or whether they are just feel-good wins leading nowhere in particular. This dilemma is perhaps best exemplified by the Boycott Trump app, which has been downloaded 350,000 times. The concept behind it is similar to the one that animates Grab Your Wallet. The app is essentially a list of companies to boycott, though it includes more than 250 of them, rather than the dozens on Grab Your Wallet, many because they sponsored Trump’s NBC show The Apprentice back in 2011. I asked Nathan Lerner, who heads an organization called the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which is responsible for the app, what qualifies a company to be listed, and he said that any company connected to the president was worth listing. I then asked if his group was collaborating with other boycott efforts. “We’ve been a little frustrated with partnering,” Lerner told me. “Right now we’re seeing a ton of enthusiasm around boycotting Trump, but it’s fragmented. Folks are popping up doing great work, but they’re doing it on their own.” That seemed like a remarkably on-target summary of the situation, and Lerner’s group seemed to be an example of those working “on their own.” In search of answers, I called up Marshall Ganz, who would surely be in the hall of fame of community organizing if there were one. He worked with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s to organize California farmworkers and was an architect of Barack Obama’s organizing strategy for his presidential run in 2007. A professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School (and, full disclosure, once my professor), Ganz defines “strategy” as “how we turn what we have into what we need to get what we want.” That applies nicely to the Trump boycott concept, in which activists are trying to turn their discrete consumer power into collective influence great enough to change where our country is headed. When I mentioned to Ganz that so many different boycotts and related campaigns are happening without much coordination, he described the problem this way: “The mechanisms for starting my thing, my thing, my thing, they’re so easy in virtual space.” Bringing those initiatives together is the problem. As he pointed out, back in 2007 the San Francisco Bay Area alone had about 54 different pro-Obama groups registered online; the hard part was getting them to work together in a way that channeled their energy toward a shared goal. When it comes to fighting Donald Trump, Ganz suggested that it would be far more strategic for the many different boycott and pressure groups to pool their efforts. Were this to happen, he suggested, the anti-Trump movement could become more proactive, rather than reactive. Not all experts agree with his assessment. L.A. Kaufman is the author of the recent book, Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism. “I think that the decentralized character of the resistance gives it resilience,” she told me in a phone interview. In her view, the fact that all this activity is totally grassroots and happening outside the Democratic Party is a sign of political renewal in this country. She has a point. Yet it’s hard to see how economic resistance, surely a suitable weapon against a businessman-in-chief, can be effective without a critical mass coalescing around an agreed-upon set of actions and goals. I asked Shannon Coulter whether she’s coordinating with other campaigns, and she pointed out that Grab Your Wallet is now aligned with the organizers of the Women’s March, the vast post-inauguration protest that swept the country. Those same organizers were also the driving force behind the formation of roughly 5,500 groups of local activists who convened after the march to consider the next steps for the emerging anti-Trump movement. This alliance seemed like a promising sign. Recalling what Ganz had said about uniting groups that supported Obama in 2007, I asked Coulter whether she would ever consider merging Grab Your Wallet into a larger organization. To this, she responded in the negative. “I say that,” she explained, “because Grab Your Wallet is one of the only women-led ones in the movement.” Coulter isn’t the only one to offer such reasoning. Since the anti-Trump movement is a heterogeneous collection of groups representing women, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and lots of straight white people, there’s concern that combining efforts could result in a resistance dominated by white men who might compromise the priorities of specific groups and their constituents. In order to be effective, says Rashad Robinson of Color of Change, campaigns must carry the “moral authority of an impacted constituency.” He described situations in which white-led groups had tried to mimic campaigns led by Color of Change -- without realizing that they lacked the moral authority to do so effectively. In 2014, Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina who studies social movements, gave a TED talk titled “Online social change: easy to organize, hard to win,” in which she described the March on Washington in 1963. That historic event, where Martin Luther King delivered his famed “I Have a Dream” speech, drew 250,000 people. Tufekci underscored the significance of attracting such a crowd in 1963, when organizers used landline phones, flyers, and word of mouth, in a landscape lacking today’s easy digital tools. Fifty years ago it was nothing short of awe-inspiring to draw a quarter million people to the National Mall. “If you’re in power,” said Tufekci, “you realize that you have to take the capacity signaled by that march, not just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.” The anti-Trump movement has yet to accomplish anything so awe-inspiring. Nearly half a million people gathered in Washington for the Women’s March -- a number that climbed to more than a million when all the protests around the country were added in -- but it’s not at all clear that such numbers carry the same weight today as smaller crowds did in previous eras. Though protesters filled the streets in Washington one day after the inauguration, anti-Trump activity remains fragmented several months into his term. And when it comes to waging economic resistance against this billionaire president, the pressing question is whether innumerable people across the country, like Dee from New York, who are changing their spending habits, tweeting at advertisers, contacting chief executives, and jamming phones at Trump businesses, will do so in a way that converts their discrete actions into real influence and power.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:50 PM, May 23, 2017 Updated: 5:00 AM, May 24, 2017 Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday after the release of President Donald Trump's budget plan but gains were tempered by declines in consumer discretionary stocks amid weakness in auto-parts companies. While Tuesday's economic data was weak, investors were relieved Trump's first full budget plan was largely as expected, even if it is not expected to be approved in Congress. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," said Wade Balliet, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of the West. Trump's budget called for a hike in infrastructure and military spending, along with a raft of politically sensitive cuts, in areas such as healthcare and food assistance programs, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. The S&P 500 ended below its session high. It topped 2,400 points a few times during the session for the first time since the markets' plunge last Wednesday on concerns about the future of Trump's presidency. While the President is on an overseas trip, stocks were helped by a lack of major news updates related to the government probe on possible ties between his election campaign and Russia. "With the President being away, with the news cycle slowing a little bit, investors have nibbled their way back in," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "This market has had tremendous strength on the idea that the new administration is going to be able to push through a pro-business platform. To the extent it loses political credibility the market has had trouble holding these gains." The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 20,937.91, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 5.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,138.71. In the morning, U.S. economic data showed new single-family home sales in April tumbled from near a nine-and-a-half-year high, while manufacturing activity for May fell to the lowest level since September. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended higher. Financials <.SPSY> rose 0.8 percent, helped by a 1.2 percent gain in the bank subsector <.SPXBK>. Consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> was the biggest laggard with a 0.4 percent drop. The biggest drag on the consumer sector was Autozone Inc <AZO.N>, down 11.8 percent to $581.4. The auto part retailer's quarterly results missed expectations. Advance Auto Parts <AAP.N> fell 4.6 percent while O'Reilly Automotive <ORLY.O> fell 3.3 percent and Genuine Parts <GPC.N> shares fell almost 2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 59 new lows. About 5.95 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Trump is set to propose a raft of politically sensitive cuts, including to healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. The plan also includes selling off half the country's huge oil stockpile, a proposal that weighed on crude oil prices as it threatened a future glut even as OPEC and its allies cut output to try and tighten the market. Congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. "In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump's budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. U.S. futures slipped slightly on Monday evening, before recovering, on news of the suicide attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at a pop concert in the English city of Manchester. European stocks edged up after a sluggish start on Tuesday, with the region's shares made gains as the latest economic data made for some encouraging reading. "Numbers are coming in off the Eurozone so that helped prop the European markets up a bit and that's seeding into the U.S.," said Lovell. Dow e-minis were up 46 points, or 0.22 percent, with 28,878 contracts changing hands at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 3.75 points, or 0.16 percent, with 183,854 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.25 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 32,564 contracts. Wall Street closed higher on Monday boosted by technology shares and by defense companies, which gained after the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a $110 billion arms deal. The deal was struck during Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia over the weekend, a trip the White House hopes will shift focus away from domestic controversies such as the president's firing of the former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief and probes into his administration's possible links to Russia. "Much of Trump "reflation" trade has been unwound and in order for the S&P to move beyond 2,400 we need to see something on the policy front, without that any movement beyond 2,400 will be difficult to sustain," Lovell added. Among stocks, shares of Toll Brothers rose 3.8 percent to $39.49 after the luxury homebuilder reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly profit.

While Tuesday's economic data was weak, investors were relieved Trump's first full budget plan was largely as expected, even if it is not expected to be approved in Congress. "There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that," said Wade Balliet, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of the West. Trump's budget called for a hike in infrastructure and military spending, along with a raft of politically sensitive cuts, in areas such as healthcare and food assistance programs, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. The S&P 500 ended below its session high. It topped 2,400 points a few times during the session for the first time since the markets' plunge last Wednesday on concerns about the future of Trump's presidency. While the President is on an overseas trip, stocks were helped by a lack of major news updates related to the government probe on possible ties between his election campaign and Russia. "With the President being away, with the news cycle slowing a little bit, investors have nibbled their way back in," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "This market has had tremendous strength on the idea that the new administration is going to be able to push through a pro-business platform. To the extent it loses political credibility the market has had trouble holding these gains." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 43.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 20,937.91, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 5.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,138.71. In the morning, U.S. economic data showed new single-family home sales in April tumbled from near a nine-and-a-half-year high, while manufacturing activity for May fell to the lowest level since September. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended higher. Financials .SPSY rose 0.8 percent, helped by a 1.2 percent gain in the bank subsector .SPXBK. Consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was the biggest laggard with a 0.4 percent drop. The biggest drag on the consumer sector was Autozone Inc (AZO.N), down 11.8 percent to $581.4. The auto part retailer's quarterly results missed expectations. Advance Auto Parts (AAP.N) fell 4.6 percent while O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY.O) fell 3.3 percent and Genuine Parts (GPC.N) shares fell almost 2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 59 new lows. About 5.95 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Trump is set to propose a raft of politically sensitive cuts, including to healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade. The plan also includes selling off half the country's huge oil stockpile, a proposal that weighed on crude oil prices as it threatened a future glut even as OPEC and its allies cut output to try and tighten the market. Congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. "In the U.S. all eyes are on Trump's budget proposal. The budget will not pass in its current state but people will keep an eye on any sort of indication of corporate tax reform as well as infrastructure spending," said Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. U.S. futures slipped slightly on Monday evening, before recovering, on news of the suicide attack that killed at least 22 people and wounded 59 at a pop concert in the English city of Manchester. European stocks edged up after a sluggish start on Tuesday, with the region's shares made gains as the latest economic data made for some encouraging reading. "Numbers are coming in off the Eurozone so that helped prop the European markets up a bit and that's seeding into the U.S.," said Lovell. Dow e-minis were up 46 points, or 0.22 percent, with 28,878 contracts changing hands at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 3.75 points, or 0.16 percent, with 183,854 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.25 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 32,564 contracts. Wall Street closed higher on Monday boosted by technology shares and by defense companies, which gained after the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a $110 billion arms deal. The deal was struck during Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia over the weekend, a trip the White House hopes will shift focus away from domestic controversies such as the president's firing of the former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief and probes into his administration's possible links to Russia. "Much of Trump "reflation" trade has been unwound and in order for the S&P to move beyond 2,400 we need to see something on the policy front, without that any movement beyond 2,400 will be difficult to sustain," Lovell added. Among stocks, shares of Toll Brothers rose 3.8 percent to $39.49 after the luxury homebuilder reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly profit. U.S.-listed shares of Nokia were up 6.6 percent at $6.62 after the company settled a patent dispute with Apple . Apple was 0.4 percent higher at $154.60. Autozone fell 7.7 percent to $608.65 after the company's quarterly results came in below expectations.

The information you need to start your day, including top headlines from PaymentsSource and around the Web: Apple Pay gets bigger in U.K.: Apple Pay can now offer something in the U.K. that contactless cards cannot: a higher spending limit. Apple Pay is no longer restricted to payments of £30 and below, according to The Telegraph, which cites an interview with Jennifer Bailey, the head of Apple's payments business. Over half of U.K. contactless payment terminals can now permit higher Apple Pay transactions, she told the paper, which predicts that the removal of this restriction will lead to more use of Apple's mobile wallet. The £30 limit was in place for contactless cards as a fraud deterrent, as those cards do not use the same level of authentication as mobile wallets. When Apple Pay launched in the U.K. in 2015, it had the support of most large banks but had to wait until April 2016 for Barclays to join the pack. Android Pay came to the U.K. in 2016, and Samsung Pay joined them just this month. Bloomberg News Smart contract coop triples in size: As the R3 blockchain consortium sheds members, another group building standards for distributed ledger technology is expanding quickly. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has signed 86 new members, which will triple the consortium's size and add weight to the group's effort to build a foundation for smart contracts, reports Coindesk. Smart contracts, which are automatic triggers for payments and other transactions based on certain terms, are a key part of distributed ledger use cases, since they allow for a faster flow of information and assets. Ethereum is an open source public blockchain platform that was founded by Vitalik Buterin, a virtual currency researcher. JPMorgan Chase, CME Group, BNY Mellon and Banco Santander are among its backers, with Rabobank, ING, National Bank of Canada and the Taiwan Fintech Association signing on later. Ethereum has had its own challenges, including a web theft that forced the initiative to update its security last year. Not Pandora's pal: When PayPal debuted a simplified blue logo in 2014, it probably never expected to share its design sense with music streaming app Pandora, which unveiled its own simplified blue logo in October. The Verge reports PayPal is now suing Pandora for the similarity, accusing Pandora of deliberately copying PayPal so as to "[latch] itself onto the increasingly popular PayPal Logo as part of its efforts to catch up to its competition," according to PayPal's allegations in the lawsuit. The article notes there are some anecdotal reports of people confusing the logos, and these are included in the filing, but it still calls PayPal's allegations "unusually harsh for a corporate lawsuit." A compromise on screen scraping?: A squabble over screen scraping is threatening to delay new European data sharing regulations, causing the European Union's financial services division to suggest a compromise. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's financial services chief, is calling on the European Banking Authority to reconsider its ban on screen scraping, reports Finextra. The EBA has proposed banning screen scraping in favor of open data sharing as part of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Financial technology companies are opposed to this approach, contending it gives banks too much control over data sharing. The banks have countered screen scraping is old technology and newer sharing tools such as application programming interfaces would work better. Dombrovskis has suggested the EBA should not ban screen scraping, but use it as a backstop if the new bank data sharing interfaces suffer a failure. This would protect access for financial technology companies while allowing banks to require third parties to use dedicated interfaces to access data, Dombrovskis said. From the Web TransferWise offers foreign currency business accounts, debit cards Reuters | Tue May 23, 2017 - London-based startup TransferWise has launched a new service in the UK and Europe that will make it easier for small businesses to keep money and get paid in more than 15 currencies, as the company branches beyond its core money transfer business. Similar to having a bank account in multiple countries, the new service will allow small businesses to activate unique account and routing numbers for the United States, UK and the rest of Europe and get paid as if they were a local company, TransferWise said on Tuesday.

Barely 3 years old, Symphony quickly caught on in the world of high finance and now counts Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Societe Generale and Google among its investors. BNP Paribas recently joined in, helping bring Symphony’s estimated value to nearly $1 billion. Created in 2012 and officially launched 2 years later in Palo Alto, California, the system allows users to send private messages, confidentially exchange research and trading strategies and place orders— all in real time. Some have even portrayed the technology as a threat to Bloomberg terminal’s dominance in trading rooms, although others say that is premature. Gurle, 50, says he further developed the idea after working for France Telecom, Microsoft and Skype, and chose to “disrupt” the financial world because it could open doors to other enticing industries. He said he hopes to diversify Symphony beginning in 2018, moving into sectors such as insurance, health, defence and aviation, building a secured network for businesses. While Symphony is not really a head-to-head competitor with Bloomberg it is gaining ground on the dominant player on Wall Street. Bloomberg, which has existed since 1983, offers a vast panoply of services, including research, analysis, trading, data and news, in addition to messaging, at an average annual cost of $22,000 per terminal. While Bloomberg is a closed ecosystem, Symphony by contrast integrates outside services—and with annual subscriptions at just $180. But Spencer Mindlin of the business research firm Aite Group notes that “Bloomberg has been the incumbent for a very, very long time.” Bloomberg is still the favoured channel between clients and traders, according to one Wall Street broker who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that his firm prohibited traders from using Symphony for outside communications. Even so, most major banks are using Symphony for internal communications and for employees with administrative and marketing roles, Mindlin said. Unlike earlier messaging systems such as FIX, AOL IM or Wickr, which moved into the financial world with mixed results, Symphony is arriving as major banks are cutting costs and keeping a closer eye on traders after the Libor exchange and interest rate manipulation scandals. “Symphony has sophisticated, real-time surveillance tools,” Gurle said. “If there’s an information policy violation, the firm can automatically cut off communication.” He has agreed to let New York’s Department of Financial Services, which was unnerved by the degree of encryption promised to clients, access chat logs in suspected cases of wrongdoing.

Home  >   News  >   People Moves  >   NEX hires JP Morgan derivatives exec with post-trade overhaul PEOPLE MOVES NEX hires JP Morgan derivatives exec with post-trade overhaul NEX Infinity will allow customers to access all of its post-trade businesses through a single master agreement. By Joe Parsons joe.parsosn@strategic-i.com May 23, 2017 10:55 AM GMT NEX Group has hired JP Morgan’s former US derivatives head following an overhaul of its post-trade businesses, while simultaneously preparing to test a new distributed ledger service. Andres Choussy joins NEX Optimisation from the US bank where he headed the derivatives and clearing business for the Americas. He will head up a new Trade and Portfolio Management solutions pillar for NEX, which is powered by its post-trade businesses. Choussy also served as global co-head of OTC clearing, global head of FX prime brokerage and head of credit derivatives clearing in the Americas at JP Morgan. As part of its post-trade restructure, NEX has created five ‘solutions pillars’, consisting of portfolio management, analytics, regulatory reporting, resource optimisation and data insights. The restructuring will support the launch of NEX Infinity, a distributed ledger and artificial intelligence system, which will keep a remote record of all trading data via Amazon. The system will use blockchain technology to test processing data on spot FX and cash equities trades from July this year. NEX Infinity will also allow clients to sign a master services agreement enabling them to on-board with all of its post-trade businesses such as Traiana, TriOptima, Abide Financial and ENSO. “By combining our services which have natural synergies into end-to-end solutions, we are transforming ourselves and organising our business in a way that helps clients solve their own financial, regulatory and operational challenges,” said Jenny Knott, CEO, NEX Optimisation. The launch of the system comes as competition to harness blockchain technology in financial markets hots up. Cobalt, a post-trade FX blockchain network, has most recently won the backing of Citadel Securities and Citi.  related articles most popular most e-mailed FROM GLOBALCUSTODIAN.COM People Moves NEX hires JP Morgan derivatives exec with post-trade overhaul People Moves GC legends team up on new data tech firm’s board People Moves Former SS&C MD appointed Centaur US chief People Moves Former Barclays post-trade head joins DTCC People Moves Broadridge appoints industry veteran to investment management role People Moves State Street appoints BNY securities finance head for custody role FROM THE GC TV Tim Gokey on industry transformation FROM GLOBALCUSTODIAN.COM Technology State Street and DTCC join blockchain alliance Custody BNP Paribas chief hails ‘strong start’ to 2017 as custody deals roll in Fund Administration RBC selected as custodian for new Irish UCITS fund Features The BIG interview: Euroclear’s Olivier Grimonpont Custody State Street to promote ESG standards through new deal Fund Administration Deutsche Bank secures fund admin mandate for Boston-based manager FROM THE GC TV Tim Gokey on industry transformation FROM GLOBALCUSTODIAN.COM People Moves GC legends team up on new data tech firm’s board Custody State Street to promote ESG standards through new deal Fund Administration Athene Asset Management and MUFG agree outsourcing deal Custody JP Morgan tipped to overtake State Street in custody rankings Technology SunTrust Converts Operations to SunGard's InTrader FROM THE GC TV Tim Gokey on industry transformation Get GLOBAL CUSTODIAN Email Alerts Trending Most Read Most E-mailed TechnologyState Street and DTCC join blockchain alliance CustodyBNP Paribas chief hails ‘strong start’ to 2017 as custody deals roll in FeaturesThe BIG interview: Euroclear’s Olivier Grimonpont CustodyState Street to promote ESG standards through new deal Fund AdministrationDeutsche Bank secures fund admin mandate for Boston-based manager CustodyTop 10 trends for 2016 People MovesGC legends team up on new data tech firm’s board CustodyState Street to promote ESG standards through new deal Fund AdministrationAthene Asset Management and MUFG agree outsourcing deal TechnologySunTrust Converts Operations to SunGard's InTrader Upcoming Events MORE EVENTS > The Future of Post-TradeMay 22, 2017 / BT Auditorium, 81 Newgate Street, London, EC1A 7AJ With central clearing of derivatives becoming widely accepted, and the enforcement of collateral rules taking shape, market participants will have to significantly change their models to adapt.

Speaking at the OPDU annual conference - held in London last week - Hitchen said: "Don't abandon your securities lending programs. Having stock to lend and borrow is crucial for efficient markets." His comments were welcomed by JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services global head of sales for securities lending Paul Wilson. He said: "Re-starting stock lending programs will help provide the markets with much needed liquidity. Some investors may be waiting for the markets normalise, though what is normal going forward may be very different." BNY Mellon Asset Servicing head of international securities lending Rob Coxon said many pension funds had not left the market following the FSA's ban on short selling - but had instead adjusted their program parameters, most notably in respect of cash collateral. One of the big issues faced by pension funds involved in stock lending had been the use of cash collateral which pension funds had logged in money market funds. These funds had then come under pressure as investors had all looked to unwind their programs at the same time. Coxon added: "Philosophically, most pension funds have bought into the idea that securities lending is good for the markets and is needed to provide liquidity." eSecLending chief executive Chris Jaynes also welcomed Hitchen's comments. He said: "His view has been echoed by many industry participants in recent months with regulators, investment managers and pension funds citing the critical role securities lending plays in the efficient functioning of capital markets." However, Wedlake Bell partner Jane Wolstenholme warned trustees to take greater care when it came to stock lending. She said: "Trustees have a duty to exercise their powers of investment prudently and predominantly by investments in traded securities, and it could be argued that trustees who have lent stock without adequate safeguards are in breach of these principles, which could expose them to claims." This comes as falls in the prices of UK financial shares prompted Treasury committee chairman John McFall to write to the Financial Services Authority expressing his concerns over short selling activity on financial companies since its ban was lifted on 16 January. In a letter to FSA chief executive Hector Sants, McFall asked for a confirmation the FSA was actively monitoring the connection between the volatility in bank shares and the repeal of the ban on short selling of UK financial sector companies. The letter said: "I am particularly concerned given that I have heard disturbing anecdotal evidence that some hedge funds have been shorting stocks in UK banks. "To this end, could you also please confirm that you will not hesitate to re-introduce the ban if it is found that short selling has contributed to the undermining of stability in the banking sector." An FSA spokesperson said the regulator would respond to the letter in due course.

The FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies was up 0.1 percent by 0900 GMT, near Monday's record level of 7,533.70 points. "I think there are reasons why the market can go higher from here. It doesn't look expensive versus earnings growth, and it doesn't look expensive in historical terms," said Callum Abbot, UK equity fund manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. "The market is trading at 15 times forward earnings, which doesn't seem unreasonable given you are looking at earnings growth in the mid-teens," he added, pointing also to the index's yield being relatively higher than other developed equity markets. Blue-chip gains were underpinned by banks RBS and Barclays, and defence contractor Babcock. Babcock rose 3 percent after a positive note from Deutsche Bank saying the stock could rebound if the defence contractor reports solid results on Wednesday. Among top gainers, EasyJet rose more than 2 percent after a top-rated RBC analyst upgraded the stock, saying the airline had reached its profit nadir, and pointing to an expanding gap of strong customer rankings versus competitors. The airline's shares recovered all the lost ground since a badly-received earnings update last week sent the stock tumbling. Miners dragged on the index after shares in conglomerate Noble Group sold off aggressively in Singapore, with the firm forced to halt trading after a 32 percent plunge as ratings agency S&P downgraded it on weak cash flows and profitability. Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Randgold Resources fell 0.2 to 1.2 percent. Merlin, which runs London attractions including waxworks museum Madame Tussauds and the aquarium, was among the biggest fallers at the open, down 1 percent after a deadly attack in Manchester caused a kneejerk reaction against the stock, which is exposed to domestic tourism. The European travel and leisure sector was down 0.4 percent. The more domestically-focused mid-cap stocks outperformed large-caps again, hitting a fresh record high at 19,984.66 points and up 0.3 percent as company results impressed. Home emergency insurance provider Homeserve surged 13 percent to a record high after its full-year results beat expectations. "Homeserve has increased investment in its front line staff and network," said Liberum analysts, adding that the firm's acquisition of online trader listings website Checkatrade in February could boost its access to an as yet untapped clientele. Britain's biggest sandwich maker Greencore jumped 7.8 percent after its results came in ahead of expectations, alleviating investors' concerns about inflation denting consumer appetite, with what Jefferies analysts called 'reassuring commentary' around inflation recovery. Small-cap tile retailer Topps Tiles was less upbeat about the economy, pointing to a challenging trading environment and saying full-year profit would come in at the low end of analysts' expectations. Its shares fell 5.6 percent, the top small-cap losers. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

The FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies was up 0.1 percent by 0900 GMT, near last Tuesday's record level of 7,533.70 points. "I think there are reasons why the market can go higher from here. It doesn't look expensive versus earnings growth, and it doesn't look expensive in historical terms," said Callum Abbot, UK equity fund manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. "The market is trading at 15 times forward earnings, which doesn't seem unreasonable given you are looking at earnings growth in the mid-teens," he added, pointing also to the index's yield being relatively higher than other developed equity markets. Blue-chip gains were underpinned by banks RBS and Barclays, and defence contractor Babcock. Babcock rose 3 percent after a positive note from Deutsche Bank saying the stock could rebound if the defence contractor reports solid results on Wednesday. Among top gainers, EasyJet rose more than 2 percent after a top-rated RBC analyst upgraded the stock, saying the airline had reached its profit nadir, and pointing to an expanding gap of strong customer rankings versus competitors. The airline's shares recovered all the lost ground since a badly-received earnings update last week sent the stock tumbling. Miners dragged on the index after shares in conglomerate Noble Group sold off aggressively in Singapore, with the firm forced to halt trading after a 32 percent plunge as ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded it on weak cash flows and profitability. Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Randgold Resources fell 0.2 to 1.2 percent. Merlin, which runs London attractions including waxworks museum Madame Tussauds and the aquarium, was among the biggest fallers at the open, down 1 percent after a deadly attack in Manchester caused a kneejerk reaction against the stock, which is exposed to domestic tourism. The European travel and leisure sector was down 0.4 percent. The more domestically-focused mid-cap stocks outperformed large-caps again, hitting a fresh record high at 19,984.66 points and up 0.3 percent as company results impressed. Home emergency insurance provider Homeserve surged 13 percent to a record high after its full-year results beat expectations. "Homeserve has increased investment in its front line staff and network," said Liberum analysts, adding that the firm's acquisition of online trader listings website Checkatrade in February could boost its access to an as yet untapped clientele. Britain's biggest sandwich maker Greencore jumped 7.8 percent after its results came in ahead of expectations, alleviating investors' concerns about inflation denting consumer appetite, with what Jefferies analysts called 'reassuring commentary' around inflation recovery. Small-cap tile retailer Topps Tiles was less upbeat about the economy, pointing to a challenging trading environment and saying full-year profit would come in at the low end of analysts' expectations. Its shares fell 5.6 percent, the top small-cap losers. (Editing by Louise Heavens) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
