But Goldman (ticker: GS), remains, as before the crisis, the largest pure investment bank and institutional broker in the business, serving big companies and asset managers in raising capital and moving it around the world. Sure, the company hurriedly filed paperwork in late 2008, along with Morgan Stanley, to convert to a bank holding company. But this was a change in legal status, meant simply to enable possible help from the Federal Reserve, not an alteration of Goldman's business endeavors, which remain more lucrative than most others in the financial-services industry. Enlarge Image Close Rob Bennett/Redux WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE before the generational asset-value collapse of 2008 is the market's perception of Goldman, and the way it has been converted into the valuation of the company's shares. In the boom years, encompassing 2006, when Barron's last took a close look at Goldman in an admiring cover story ("Minting Money: The Goldman Sachs Way," April 10, 2006), the company was viewed as a can't-miss money machine, and slandered as a hedge fund in investment-banking disguise, for its tendency to win the greatest spoils in a spoiled era. Its shares traded at a heady premium to the broader financial sector, and routinely fetched more than 2.5 times tangible book value. Today, in contrast, Goldman is viewed as an exemplar of Wall Street's hamstrung, postcrisis fate: forced to carry more inert capital, unable to trade as much for its own book, embarrassed by criticism of some past sales practices, hampered by lethargic trading and merger volumes, and tangled in a regulatory regime whose only certainty is that it will be more onerous than what came before. The shares, which closed Friday at $113.68, are well off their 2007 peak of $248, and below tangible book value of $126. Granted, all major bank stocks trade below book, and none would be immune to another financial scare. But the negative perception of Goldman is far more dour than the reality justifies. The company maintains an abiding leadership position in most of its activities, and is financially sturdier and less burdened by irrational competition than it was a half-decade ago. Based on the likely outlook for capital-markets activity and Goldman's ability to continue growing its book value, it is easy to conclude that the shares could rise at least 25% within a year. Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA known for his apt skepticism toward many bank strategies and stocks, recently upgraded Goldman's shares to Buy, with an upside target of $142. He argues that the company is less financially risky than it had been when its stock was much higher, and that it remains "one of the more adept financial firms at dynamically allocating capital." Enlarge Image Close CEO Lloyd Blankfein (left) and heir-apparent, President Gary Cohn, are revered risk managers. Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News (left), Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News Goldman has been building its capital cushion carefully, while buying back as much stock as is prudent, and maintaining its leading role in advising companies on mergers and in helping them raise capital. As of June 30, its "global core excess"—the trove of equity capital and cash-like instruments that is the foundation of its balance sheet—hit $175 billion, up from $111 billion at the end of 2008. Total balance-sheet assets are down to $950 billion from $1.1 trillion, and leverage—the ratio of assets to equity capital—is now 13 times, versus a peak around 26. Goldman is better capitalized than most large peers, and well on its way to meeting the global Basel III capital standards that take effect in 2019. While most banks issued large amounts of stock and slashed their dividends in the crisis, Goldman has bought in 7% of its shares since the end of 2009 and continues to buy its stock below tangible book value. It never cut its dividend, currently at $1.84 a share. The stock yields 1.6%. KEEPING ALL THAT CAPITAL ON HAND has punished profitability. Return on equity, the key measure of a securities firm's earnings, has hovered in the high single digits for the past year and a half. On some level, this represents a decision by management to "under-earn" for a time as regulatory rules and market conditions sort themselves out, while simultaneously taking costs out of the firm. Goldman is in the midst of a $500 million expense-reduction program on top of $1.4 billion last year, relying in part on relocating support functions to lower-cost venues, such as Salt Lake City and Dallas. Enlarge Image Close Says Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York: "Goldman has been more aggressive than most...[in] reducing head count at higher levels" to ensure both that it can make an adequate return at low activity levels and retain operating leverage in the event markets heat up. Thus, it's playing defense without sacrificing its ability to get aggressive as opportunities arise, a tack echoed by senior Goldman executives in recent conversations. The bear case on Goldman, and by extension all firms operating by the traditional rules of Wall Street economics, is that regulation, lower financial leverage, reputational damage and a long-lasting ebb in capital-market volume will prevent the firm from earning an acceptable rate of return on shareholders' capital, even as it continues to overpay teams of trading cowboys to take undue risks. Each point can be countered, at least enough to suggest that Goldman's share price currently discounts them. TO BE SURE, LOWER LEVERAGE will dampen absolute levels of profitability: The bank is expected to net $6.5 billion, or $12.55 a share, in 2013, below its precrisis peak of $11.4 billion. But not all the profits of the precrisis period owed to leverage. What's more, in this year's first quarter, in a modestly better environment for client risk-taking and deal-making, Goldman notched a 12% return on equity, respectable enough to keep book value and the stock price rising nicely if it becomes the new norm. Plus, Goldman's valuation reflects barely, if at all, the value of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, one of the world's top 10 investment firms, whose performance recently has revived, and which provides steadier revenue and earnings than the market-sensitive businesses. As for regulation, no one knows what its precise impact will be. But the Volcker Rule prohibiting proprietary trading has mostly been implemented at the firm level. And, contrary to the popular view, pure "prop" trading was never a major source of profit at Goldman and other firms. Goldman has been resolute in assuming it still will be able to post its own capital in the service of client needs for liquidity, hedging, and market positioning, which in truth has been the basis for its dominant fixed-income, currencies, and commodities business for decades. Money Machine Investment banking is Goldman's most profitable unit, followed by securities. Trading and deal volumes have been undeniably soft. Global wholesale market-related revenue across the industry, encompassing investment banking, equities, credit trading, foreign exchange, commodities, and interest-rate trading, was down 21% last year from 2006 levels, according to consultants Oliver Wyman. Discussion at many a post-close Wall Street happy hour revolves around how much of this reduced trading and deal flow is cyclical, and how much is a long-lived response to the financial crisis and an impaired financial industry. Likely, it's a bit of both. But the long-term backdrop continues to suggest that global capital flows will quicken again. McKinsey & Co. says that global financial assets totaled $219 trillion last year, with 22% overseen by professional asset managers. Capital will continue to move around in search of good returns. And emerging-market economies will produce plenty of capital-raising and conglomerate-building activity, and the long-tenured Western banks will remain in the middle of the action. All this bodes well for Goldman, among the first firms to bet on emerging-markets growth. With professionals on the ground in developing nations and financial capitals, it could see an outsized portion of the global underwriting and investing business, especially with the Swiss universal banks retrenching and Britain shortening the leash on its largest institutions. IN RISK MANAGEMENT, Goldman operates via institutionalized paranoia. Even in 2006, carefree times in the markets, outgoing CFO David Viniar, who has held the job for 13 years, would begin discussions of the firm's performance by noting his zeal for maintaining far more capital and liquidity than Goldman was likely to need. The company promotes executives known for risk management, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein and his odds-on successor, President Gary Cohn, who are both revered for such. Goldman keeps its trading inventory fresh, turning over 50% of assets every 45 days and 80% every six months, while marking nearly everything to market. The firm charges its trading desks the full cost of financing positions, and makes traders pay for the cost of insuring the liquidity they use. No investment bank can sidestep every market hazard, but Goldman has come closer to doing so than most. That's why an investor paying 90% of current tangible book value, and about 75% of what book value likely will be in a couple of years, looks like a pretty good risk manager, too.  E-mail: editors@barrons.com Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Barron's Cover 1.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan with conspiring to restrain trade. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion some of the biggest banks in the world have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton participated with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the foreign currency exchange spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former chief currency trader, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' former global head of spot trading, was a trader at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offense," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the foreign exchange probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

Ashton, Barclays' ex-global head of spot trading, was at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said. In addition to the criminal case, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Usher and Ramchandani $5 million each, and the banking regulator banned them from working in the U.S. banking industry.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 10 January 2017 | MYT 11:44 PM S&P, Nasdaq flat; Goldman leads Dow lower At 9:40am ET (Tuesday) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2%, at 19,848. The AFP photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were flat on Tuesday morning, while Goldman Sachs led the Dow lower, as investors await the earnings season to test if Wall Street’s record levels are justified by corporate earnings in the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs fell 1.4% after Citigroup downgraded the stock, a move that comes ahead of reports by JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Friday. JPMorgan was down 0.4%, while the other two were flat. Banks have led a record-breaking run in US equities since Donald Trump’s election on Nov 8. But the rally’s momentum has stalled of late as investors now wait to see if he can deliver on his promises of fiscal stimulus. The US President-elect will hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first since his election. Wall Street’s rally has also led to soaring valuations - the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “It’s the increasing weight of valuation in the market that maybe leading to less enthusiasm in 2017. The dollar is going to be a very important factor for the earnings season,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America for Russell Investments. “We expect a choppy, range-bound US equity market until we get more clarity on earnings.” At 9:40am ET (1440 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2%, at 19,848, the S&P 500 was down 1.42 points, or 0.06%, at 2,267.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.56 point, or 0.01%, at 5,532.37. The dollar index has risen 4.3% since Trump’s victory. A strong dollar crimps US companies’ revenue from overseas markets. However, S&P 500 companies overall are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Three of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were flat on Tuesday, while five were lower, led by a 0.6% drop in telecom services sector. A jump in healthcare stocks helped limit losses. Illumina surged 17.4% to US$166.17 and was the top boost to the S&P after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Valeant jumped 10% following a deal to sell its Dendreon cancer business and three skincare brands for about US$2.12bil as the troubled firm looks to pay down its more than US$30bil debt. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,063. On the Nasdaq, 1,365 issues rose and 829 fell. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and three new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Wall St gains as bank earnings boost confidence US stocks off to worst start in 2017 after Trump speech Banks, oil stocks weigh on Wall St, keep Dow from 20,000 Wall St flat as banks, discretionary stocks fall, tech rises Wall St opens 2017 with big gains as banks surge You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Goodies for readers Adebayor returns to international stage with Togo Do we really need to fear China money?

The Dow's 20,000 milestone remained elusive as it was weighed down by declines in IBM (IBM.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Traders were holding fire ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season and the Jan. 20 inauguration after which they expect a better sense as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will fulfil campaign promises of fiscal stimulus, lower tax and lighter regulation. "Investors are now waiting for the inauguration and the first 100-day agenda," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at brokerage Convergex in New York. "They just want a little more information about what the new administration is planning before the Dow takes the plunge over 20,000. There's a lot of high expectations about what happens after January 20." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 31.85 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,855.53, the S&P 500 .SPX was unchanged at 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.00 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,551.82. The S&P Energy sector .SPNY ended down 0.95 percent as oil futures fell 2 percent on doubts about output cuts. [O/R] Following a 9 percent jump in the S&P since Nov. 4, investors will also monitor earnings season, which starts this week, to assess if the record levels are justified. "We've shifted from that exuberance post the election and the rotation into some of the sectors and now we are entering a wait-and-see mode with earnings knocking at the front door," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in News York. "Earnings may be the pivot to move things higher." S&P 500 companies are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by financials, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P financial sector .SPSY, which has risen 17.4 percent since the election, closed up 0.4 percent. Bank of America (BAC.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) - scheduled to report results on Friday - were its biggest drivers on Tuesday with 1.7 percent, 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent rises respectively. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher. S&P Healthcare stocks .SPXHC gained 0.33 percent and the Nasdaq biotech index .NBI ended 0.8 percent higher, both enjoying their sixth session of gains in a row. Illumina (ILMN.O) surged 16.6 percent to $165.04 after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 18 new lows. More than 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Continue Reading Below A number of bank stock analysts have worked through broad tax proposals by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump and estimate that a new tax law could increase Citigroup earnings per share only half as much as some rivals. At the same time, Citigroup may have to slash $4 billion or more of the value of an unusually large income tax asset that the bank holds as a result of losses it suffered during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. "If the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, they will still benefit, just benefit less," said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. The differences between Citigroup and its competitors highlight how corporations have different interests in the details of a new tax law, such as how foreign income is treated and how bank business customers might be favored less than individuals. The blueprint for tax reform put forward by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives calls for reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has proposed 15 percent. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Banks are expected to benefit more from corporate tax cuts than other industries as they tend to pay more taxes as a result of receiving fewer investment credits and deductions, such as those available for oil and gas exploration. Tax cuts could be the icing on the cake for banks as they look forward to higher profits in the coming year. They are already benefiting from higher U.S. interest rates, and lighter regulation under the Trump administration could allow Wall Street banks to re-enter risky but potentially profitable trading business.   EARNINGS LIFT The impact of a new tax law is among the topics likely to come up this Friday when JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, the three biggest U.S. banks by assets, report quarterly results. Citigroup reports the following Wednesday, Jan. 18. The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. "There's nothing they can do other than explain it," said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan.   MORE MONEY FOR DIVIDENDS More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts' estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. "The devil is in the details," said Goldberg. "There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out."   (Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Bill Rigby) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

The 'best ideas' portfolio, which generally comprises 60-80 holdings, currently numbers 63. Stocks are selected on a bottom-up basis from a universe of c 1,000 companies, which constitute the Euromoney Smaller Companies ex-UK index, the trust's benchmark. Long-term performance has been strong, as evidenced by its 10- and 20-year NAV and share price returns, which comfortably outstrip the benchmark and the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. JPMorgan European Smaller Companies Trust (JESC) aims to achieve capital growth from a diversified portfolio of shares in smaller European companies (excluding the UK). Liquidity and borrowings are actively managed (investments 80-120% of net assets) with a view to enhancing returns to shareholders. As JESC's investment policy emphasises capital growth, rather than income, the dividend is expected to vary from year to year. JESC is benchmarked against the Euromoney (formerly HSBC) Smaller European Companies ex-UK total return index in sterling terms. Click here [1] to view the full report.

Indonesia has barred US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co from submitting submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds. (Reuters) JAKARTA: Indonesia has barred US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. from submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds, a finance ministry official said on Monday. The government has asked other banks to submit proposals by Thursday for a planned dollar sukuk offering, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Monday. The government’s exclusion of JPMorgan comes shortly after the finance ministry said it was penalyzing the US bank following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia in November. “The point is (JPMorgan) will no longer do business with the government,” said Suahasil Nazara, head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, when asked if JPMorgan could make a proposal for the US dollar sukuk offering. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. In the report issued after Donald Trump’s election as US president, JPMorgan downgraded its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight.” On Jan. 4, Nazara defended the penalyzing of JPMorgan, saying its research was “not credible and not objective.” Research rule coming Indonesia is planning to issue a rule to ensure primary bond dealers produce only “factual” research, senior government officials said last week. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. Officials have met with primary dealers to convey the message that they should “help the government to maintain stability,” Nazara said on Monday. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the US bank’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Before the punishment, JPMorgan helped Indonesia to raise at least $11 billion by selling global bonds between 2012 and 2016, according to data from the Finance Ministry and the central bank. JPMorgan was part of a syndicate of banks working on Indonesia’s sale of $3.16 billion worth of bonds last June, but it was not listed for two more offerings in US dollar and yen since then. In 2015, JPMorgan was one of the lead managers for a dollar sukuk offering for Indonesia that raised $2 billion. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia’s sovereign bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.

In fact, he's anticipating earnings for the S&P 500 could grow somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent for 2017. "A lot of the headwinds to profit growth over the past couple of years, namely the dollar and energy, are largely now behind us," the global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch." Add in the dividend yield and he sees a mid- to high-single digit return for U.S. equities over the next 12 months. And that doesn't factor in the potential of "animal spirits." While those animal spirits have powered the market higher since President-elect Donald Trump won the election, a lot of it has now been priced in, Lebovitz said. "Anything we get from animal spirits in the form of multiple expansion would really be icing on the cake," he noted. show chapters Focus on what Trump administration will do, not say: Pro    Monday, 9 Jan 2017 | 2:10 PM ET | 02:02 Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, is also bullish on U.S. equities. The growth picture looks "pretty dependable"; there's been an improvement in momentum and consumer confidence; and there may be tax reform and regulatory relief, he pointed out. In this environment, he would be overweight U.S. stocks, U.S. high yield and natural resources. However, McDonald warned inflation could be a risk. "If the economy starts to heat up, inflation ticks up, the Fed raises rates more than people expect. We think that's the number one risk to a continued rally in 2017," he noted. As for Trump's recent tweets that have targeted specific companies, McDonald said he believes it is more important to focus on what the new administration will do versus what it says. "There have been several circumstances where they've raised a lot of ruckus around individual areas or initiatives of the government but then have proven to taken relatively centrist approaches. So, I wouldn't be too worried about that individual company risk," he noted. Meanwhile, in addition to U.S. stocks, JPMorgan's Lebovitz thinks Europe is attractive in the medium to longer term. He also thinks there is value in emerging markets, although he would cautious. "After five years of pretty significant underperformance, the fundamentals feel like they're beginning to turn. There are some risk from trade, but I think the story is evolving there," Lebovitz said.

A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that he conspired to operate an illegal bitcoin exchange, which prosecutors said was owned by an Israeli who oversaw a massive scheme to hack companies, including JPMorgan Chase. Anthony Murgio, 33, entered his plea in federal court in Manhattan to three counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, a month before he was to face trial. Under a plea agreement, Murgio agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of about 12½ years in prison or less. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled his sentencing for June 16. The Tampa, Florida-resident is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Murgio operated Coin.mx, which without a license exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin, including for victims of ransomware, a computer virus that seeks payment, often in the virtual currency, to unlock data it restricts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was operated from 2013 to 2015 through several fronts, including one called "Collectibles Club," to trick financial institutions into believing it was a members-only group interested in collectibles like stamps. Coin.mx was owned by Israeli citizen Gery Shalon, according to prosecutors, who say he and Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies. An attack on JPMorgan resulted in the information of more than 100 million people being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Murgio, who was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, was tied not only to Shalon but also to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio called Aaron "my friend" and said he "showed me the ropes to online marketing." Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U.S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin.mx, including Murgio's father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 11:40am   Comments Share: Related ZIOP Ziopharm Traders Got A Little Too Excited Watch These 5 Huge Call Purchases In Tuesday Trade Benzinga recently had the chance to speak with ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: ZIOP) CEO Dr. Laurence James Neil Cooper about the upcoming JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, partnerships with Intrexon Corp (NYSE: XON) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and whether shareholders should be concerned about the company’s rising expenses. JPMorgan Conference Cooper will be presenting at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday. Cooper said that his presentation at the conference will focus on the cancer side of Ziopharm’s gene therapy research. Ziopharm’s viral therapy program involves using engineered adenovirus to control delivery of a cytokine called interleukin 12, or IL-12. “We have essentially completed the Phase 1 trial,” Cooper told Benzinga. “We expect to be at the FDA to discuss that trial and the next steps, and we are anticipating that we’re going to be a Phase 3 company next year.” Cooper added that a pivotal trial for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) could be a banner moment for Ziopharm. “I can’t promise, but all the indications are going in that direction,” he said. Strategic Partnerships Last year, Ziopharm renegotiated a long-standing partnership with Intrexon for an 80/20 split of unpartnered programs in favor of Ziopharm. “We renegotiated out relationship with Intrexon for the purposes of essentially looking more like a biotechnology company, in other words a company that if somebody is interested in us, I am not saying they are, but if they were interested in us, they would essentially be able to understand the relationship with Intrexon as a partner with us,” Cooper clarified. In addition, Merck has partnered with Ziopharm and selected a pair of undisclosed CAR targets, a project about which Cooper says he is “very happy at the moment.” R&D Spending Cooper noted that Ziopharm has made a conscious decision to ramp-up its spending in recent quarters. “We needed to complete essentially the adenoviral trial to get to the FDA so we could turn the corner and be in the pivotal trials,” Cooper told Benzinga. “So our cash position supports all of that, supports our ability to take on the registration trial.” However, Cooper acknowledged that the cash won’t last forever. When asked about the possibility of raising cash in the coming quarter, Cooper said the company will explore all options. “We may or may not. We have not made a decision about that,” he said, adding that partnering some of the programs, such as the NK cell program or the adenoviral program, could also help solve any cash issues. Looking Ahead When Benzinga asked what investors have in store in coming quarters, Cooper said he is hoping to provide shareholders with some important updates. “We are really looking forward to being able to update the Street about our adenoviral program with GBM. If we can get this essentially through the next period of regulatory review, we have a complete shot on goal to make a drug and commercialize it,” he said. In addition to the adenoviral trial, Cooper said Ziopharm will continue to explore the viability of its TCR program and its NK cell programs in 2017.

Anthony Murgio, 33, entered his plea in federal court in Manhattan to three counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, a month before he was to face trial. Under a plea agreement, Murgio agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of about 12-1/2 years in prison or less. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled his sentencing for June 16. The Tampa, Florida-resident is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Murgio operated Coin.mx, which without a license exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin, including for victims of ransomware, a computer virus that seeks payment, often in the virtual currency, to unlock data it restricts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was operated from 2013 to 2015 through several fronts, including one called "Collectables Club," to trick financial institutions into believing it was a members-only group interested in collectables like stamps. Coin.mx was owned by Israeli citizen Gery Shalon, according to prosecutors, who say he and Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies. An attack on JPMorgan resulted in the information of more than 100 million people being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Murgio, who was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, was tied not only to Shalon but also to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio called Aaron "my friend" and said he "showed me the ropes to online marketing." Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U.S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin.mx, including Murgio's father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-769.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 9 January 2017 | MYT 6:45 PM Indonesia bars JPMorgan from next dollar sukuk issuance - official JPMorgan Chase is being penalised following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia in November. The Reuters photo shows people passing the JP Morgan Chase corporate headquarters in the New York City, JAKARTA: Indonesia has barred US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co from submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds, a finance ministry official said on Monday. The government has asked other banks to submit proposals by Thursday for a planned dollar sukuk offering, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Monday. The government’s exclusion of JPMorgan comes shortly after the Finance Ministry said it was penalising the US bank following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia in November. “The point is (JPMorgan) will no longer do business with the government,” said Suahasil Nazara, head of the Finance Ministry’s fiscal policy office, when asked if JPMorgan could make a proposal for the US dollar sukuk offering. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. In the report issued after Donald Trump’s election as US president, JPMorgan downgraded its Indonesian stocks recommendation to “underweight” from “overweight”. On Jan 4, Nazara defended the penalising of JPMorgan, saying its research was “not credible and not objective”. Research rule coming Indonesia is planning to issue a rule to ensure primary bond dealers produce only “factual” research, senior government officials said last week. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov 25. Officials have met with primary dealers to convey the message that they should “help the government to maintain stability,” Nazara said on Monday. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the US bank’s services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Before the punishment, JPMorgan helped Indonesia to raise at least US$11bil by selling global bonds between 2012 and 2016, according to data from the Finance Ministry and the central bank. JPMorgan was part of a syndicate of banks working on Indonesia’s sale of 3 billion euros (US$3.16bil) worth of bonds last June, but it was not listed for two more offerings in US dollar and yen since then. In 2015, JPMorgan was one of the lead managers for a dollar sukuk offering for Indonesia that raised US$2bil. Foreigners hold more than 37% of Indonesia’s sovereign bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Banking , Indonesia , k JPMorgan Chase Co Related Stories Indonesia won't flood nickel market, say top officials Go-Jek races to kill cash Indonesia tells bond dealers to avoid conflicts of interest Trump’s Indonesia man to boost ties with theme park JPMorgan lashing by Indonesia signals global threat to analysts You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Can wearable sensors tell when you’re sick?

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Hidayat Setiaji and Gayatri Suroyo | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia has barred U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) from submitting an underwriting proposal for its next issuance of dollar-denominated Islamic bonds, a finance ministry official said on Monday. The government has asked other banks to submit proposals by Thursday for a planned dollar sukuk offering, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported on Monday. The government's exclusion of JPMorgan comes shortly after the Finance Ministry said it was penalizing the U.S. bank following its issuance of a negative report on Indonesia in November. "The point is (JPMorgan) will no longer do business with the government," said Suahasil Nazara, head of the Finance Ministry's fiscal policy office, when asked if JPMorgan could make a proposal for the U.S. dollar sukuk offering. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. In the report issued after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, JPMorgan downgraded its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". On Jan. 4, Nazara defended the penalizing of JPMorgan, saying its research was "not credible and not objective". RESEARCH RULE COMING Indonesia is planning to issue a rule to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said last week. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. Officials have met with primary dealers to convey the message that they should "help the government to maintain stability," Nazara said on Monday. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Before the punishment, JPMorgan helped Indonesia to raise at least $11 billion by selling global bonds between 2012 and 2016, according to data from the Finance Ministry and the central bank. JPMorgan was part of a syndicate of banks working on Indonesia's sale of 3 billion euros ($3.16 billion) worth of bonds last June, but it was not listed for two more offerings in U.S. dollar and yen since then. In 2015, JPMorgan was one of the lead managers for a dollar sukuk offering for Indonesia that raised $2 billion. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's sovereign bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

The one-count indictment, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Richard Usher (former Head of G11 FX Trading-UK at an affiliate of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as well as former Managing Director at an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase & Co.), Rohan Ramchandani (former Managing Director and head of G10 FX spot trading at an affiliate of Citicorp) and Christopher Ashton (former Head of Spot FX at an affiliate of Barclays PLC) with conspiring to fix prices and rig bids for U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market. “Whether a crime is committed on the street corner or in the corner office, no one gets a free pass simply because they were working for a corporation when they broke the law,” said Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates.  “Today’s indictment reiterates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct.”   “The charged conspiracy involved competitors manipulating the exchange rate for the hundreds of billions of dollars traded on foreign exchange markets for their benefit and to the detriment of their customers,” said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Bill Baer.  “We previously secured criminal convictions of the financial institutions involved in the misconduct. Today we seek to hold accountable the individuals who conspired on their behalf.” “These former bank traders are alleged to have gained an unfair advantage on their counterparts by committing corporate fraud involving the manipulation of the foreign currency exchange,” said Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.  “Their actions affected worldwide trading positions in the global marketplace.  Today’s announcement reinforces the FBI’s commitment to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for criminally interfering with the global financial markets.” The indictment follows the May 20, 2015 agreements of Barclays PLC, Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices and rig bids for U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market, and to pay criminal fines totaling more than $2.5 billion.  On Jan. 5, 2017, the federal district court in Connecticut accepted those plea agreements and sentenced the banks accordingly. The charge in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by victims if either amount is greater than $1 million. According to the indictment, from at least December 2007 through at least January 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton (along with unnamed co-conspirators) conspired to fix prices and rig bids for the euro – U.S. dollar currency pair.  Called “the Cartel” or “the Mafia,” this group of traders participated in telephone calls and electronic messages, including near-daily conversations in a private electronic chat room, to carry out their conspiracy.  Their anticompetitive behavior included colluding around the time of certain benchmark rates known as fixes, such as coordinating their orders and trading to manipulate the price of the currency pair by the time of the fix.  In another example of collusion, the conspirators coordinated their orders and trading to manipulate the price of the currency pair, such as by refraining from entering orders or trading at certain times. The charge in the indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. The Department of Justice has now charged six individuals in the FX investigation.  On July 20, 2016, fraud charges were brought by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division against two FX executives for conspiring to defraud a client of their bank through a front running scheme.  On Jan. 4, 2017, an antitrust charge and plea agreement were announced for a trader in connection with a conspiracy to manipulate emerging market FX rates. This investigation is being conducted by the FBI’s Washington Field Office.  This prosecution is being handled by the Antitrust Division’s New York Office.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section also provided substantial assistance in this matter. The charge in this case was brought in connection with the President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  The president established the task force to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.  With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and state and local partners, it is the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud.  Since fiscal year 2009, the Justice Department has filed over 18,000 financial fraud cases against more than 25,000 defendants.    For more information about the task force, please visit www.StopFraud.gov.  Anyone with information concerning price fixing or other anticompetitive conduct in the FX market should contact the Antitrust Division’s Citizen Complaint Center at (888) 647-3258, visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html or call the FBI tip line at (415) 553-7400.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jan 10, 2017 at 12:01PM It's been a busy week for owners of Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock -- and it's only Tuesday. As explained in a series of reports from TheFly.com, Illumina appeared at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference yesterday, where it announced: New guidance indicating that it will report $619 million in sales for Q4 2016 (analysts are still looking for $610 million) The launch of a "single-cell" gene sequencing solution in cooperation with Bio-Rad Labs (NYSE:BIO) A new partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to integrate IBM's Watson artificial intelligence supercomputer with Illumina's own BaseSpace Sequence Hub and tumor sequencing process A separate partnership with Phillips (NYSE:PHG) aimed at large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function A new NovaSeq Series scalable sequencing architecture, to replace its HiSeq architecture dating from 2010, which the company predicts will "one day" permit gene sequencing for just $100 Big news on several fronts. Today, Illumina is reaping its reward in the form of a series of price target hikes from the likes of Leerink and Piper Jaffray -- and scoring a big upgrade to "buy" from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Here are three things you need to know. Gattaca: For Illumina, it's more than a movie; it's a business model. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Up 15% -- and heading higher? Illumina stock is already up 15% today on the news, but according to Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit, it could be headed higher. Priced at $163 after today's surge in stock price, Merrill thinks Illumina stock won't stop running before it hits $175 a share -- a gain of 7% more. Of course, even if Merrill Lynch is right, this means that two-thirds of the potential gains have already been priced into Illumina's stock. 2. Is it too late to buy? Once that realization sinks in, many investors may decide that even if Merrill Lynch is right, it is now too late to buy Illumina stock. In fact, Leerink seems to have already come to this conclusion. As TheFly reports, Illumina is planning to sell its new sequencers for anywhere from $850,000 to $985,000 per unit, with shipments to begin in March. But while Leerink praises the introduction of NovaSeq as "meaningful," the analyst also warns that the gene sequencing market is still oversupplied with more machines than its end users can absorb. Leerink grudgingly raised its price target back to $132 this morning (the analyst had just finished cutting its price target less than a month ago), but even so, with Illumina stock selling for nearly $164 a share already, Leerink sees little prospect for further gains in share price -- rather, the opposite. 3. Even Merrill may have second thoughts For that matter, I wouldn't be too awfully surprised if even Merrill Lynch begins rethinking its endorsement of Illumina stock in rather short order -- given how quickly the market has already reacted to its upgrade, and to Illumina's own announcements. Yes, the partnerships with Phillips, IBM, and Bio-Rad are important. Yes, the introduction of new products is also a revenue driver. But as Merrill explains in a write-up (reported on StreetInsider.com this morning), Illumina's real prize is the oncology market, and Merrill doesn't see NovaSeq as cracking that open for Illumina just yet. Ultimately, Merrill would love to see cancer doctors using Illumina's products, and the gene sequencing data they provide, to treat individual cancer patients. But in the meantime, Merrill will be satisfied if the company simply grows its revenue through "the increasing prevalence of precision medicine and use of sequencing by pharmaceutical companies, large scale population studies (including GRAIL), and an emphasis on bioinformatics." The most important thing: Valuation So what kind of growth rates are we looking at here? According to estimates posted on S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts still see Illumina growing at no more than 10% annualized over the next five years, and earning $3.27 per share this year, and perhaps $3.77 the year after that. Those are nice numbers to be sure -- but they still leave Illumina stock trading for a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 50, which seems a bit pricey for a stock growing at 10%. Meanwhile, the $619 million revenue estimate that Illumina provided yesterday, while ahead of estimates, still works out to a growth rate of only 5% when compared to Q4 2015 revenue, so even the 10% growth rate isn't set in stone. Long story short? Illumina has a great story. It's a story that's getting a lot of investors -- and analysts -- excited. But at these prices, maybe it's time they all curbed their enthusiasm a bit.

Nate Raymond NEW YORK — Reuters Published Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 10:04AM EST Last updated Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017 10:25AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The U.S. Justice Department was set to bring charges on Tuesday against three ex-traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Barclays Plc arising from a probe into the manipulation of foreign-exchange prices at major banks, a person familiar with the matter said. Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, are expected to face criminal charges in a case filed in federal court in New York, the person said. The expected charges were first reported by Bloomberg News. Lawyers for Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton could not be immediately identified. The case comes after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5-billion in criminal fines. Prosecutors have said that from 2007 to 2013, euro-dollar traders at the banks belonging to an electronic chat group called “The Cartel” manipulated benchmark exchange rates in an effort to increase their profits. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. He was the third person to date to face U.S. criminal charges in connection with the foreign-exchange probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5-billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday brought charges against three former traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Barclays Plc arising from a global probe into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates at major banks. Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion that some of the world's biggest banks have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton schemed with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the currency spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former head of G10 spot trading, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' ex-global head of spot trading, was at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said. In addition to the criminal case, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Usher and Ramchandani $5 million each, and the banking regulator banned them from working in the U.S. banking industry. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offence," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA, Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a rate-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

Goldman Sachs fell 1.4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock, a move that comes ahead of reports by JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Friday. JPMorgan was down 0.4 percent, while the other two were flat. Banks have led a record-breaking run in U.S. equities since Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8. But the rally's momentum has stalled of late as investors now wait to see if he can deliver on his promises of fiscal stimulus. The U.S. President-elect will hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first since his election. Wall Street's rally has also led to soaring valuations - the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "It's the increasing weight of valuation in the market that maybe leading to less enthusiasm in 2017. The dollar is going to be a very important factor for the earnings season," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America for Russell Investments. "We expect a choppy, range-bound U.S. equity market until we get more clarity on earnings." At 9:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.38 points, or 0.2 percent, at 19,848, the S&P 500 was down 1.42 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,267.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.56 points, or 0.01 percent, at 5,532.37. The dollar index has risen 4.3 percent since Trump's victory. A strong dollar crimps U.S. companies' revenue from overseas markets. However, S&P 500 companies overall are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Three of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were flat on Tuesday, while five were lower, led by a 0.6 percent drop in telecom services sector. A jump in healthcare stocks helped limit losses. Illumina surged 17.4 percent to $166.17 and was the top boost to the S&P after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Valeant jumped 10 percent following a deal to sell its Dendreon cancer business and three skincare brands for about $2.12 billion as the troubled firm looks to pay down its more than $30 billion debt. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,063. On the Nasdaq, 1,365 issues rose and 829 fell. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and three new lows.

Tim Shufelt The Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Jan. 08, 2017 5:18PM EST Last updated Sunday, Jan. 08, 2017 7:11PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article As the first earnings season since the U.S. election gets started, investors are eager for evidence that corporate executives’ optimism matches their own. Fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with a number of big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co., among the S&P 500 companies to report their results. Amid the wave of financial statements and management conference calls this week, investors will be looking for confirmation that the profit backdrop is strong enough to justify the remarkable rally in stocks. “Will management start to hint at what they expect under different policy prescriptions?” asked Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s investment arm. In the two months since Mr. Trump became U.S.president-elect, the market has been bidding up stocks, confident that his agenda will translate into policies that strengthen the U.S. economy. Promises he made through the campaign, such as cuts to household and corporate taxes, increased infrastructure spending, reduced regulations and the repatriation of foreign cash, helped lift U.S. equities to record highs. American banks are arguably the segment of the market set to benefit the most from Donald Trump’s policy agenda. Fewer regulations, rising interest rates and lower taxes could together disproportionately boost bank profits. Plus, if the new administration’s policies mean improving business and consumer confidence, that should translate into a higher propensity to borrow. As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 index has increased by nearly 10 per cent since early November and 6.4 per cent since election night. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average came within a hair of breaking through the 20,000-point mark for the first time. The KBW bank index, which tracks U.S. financial shares, is up 23 per cent since the vote. Canadian markets have been nearly as strong, rising 5.7 per cent since Mr. Trump’s victory, led by energy and some financial stocks. This equity strength has happened despite an absence of much concrete news on the earnings front; stock valuations have been rising largely on sentiment. The S&P 500 index now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 17, based on earnings estimates for the next year, according to FactSet. That compares to a five-year average of about 15 times. As a result, further stock gains are more likely going to have to come from earnings growth rather than continued multiple expansion, according to a number of strategists. That’s what makes this earnings season so important. The fourth quarter is expected to add to the evidence of a turnaround in U.S. profit growth, following the worst earnings recession since the financial crisis. Dragged down by the collapse in energy prices, S&P 500 earnings declined for five consecutive quarters before hitting an inflection point in the third quarter of 2016. Building on that growth, FactSet estimates that when the final numbers are in, fourth-quarter earnings will prove to have grown by 3.2 per cent. If that estimate proves true, earnings growth for the entire 2016 calendar year will amount to 0.1 per cent, with an energy sector decline of 75 per cent proving the overwhelming negative influence, according to FactSet data. Excluding oil and gas stocks, the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate rises to 3.4 per cent for last year. “The stagnation in earnings wasn’t quite what it appeared to be. You had a huge drag from the energy sector and the rest of the market looked quite reasonable,” Mr. Golub said. With the global energy market having stabilized, and with West Texas Intermediate trading at more than double its $26 (U.S.) low set last February, the sector’s growth is expected to turn modestly positive in the fourth quarter, after grinding through eight straight quarters of decline, according to Zacks Investment Research. In addition to energy, the market will be keen for results from the financial sector, which has driven the equity gains of the last two months more than any other. Of course, the policy changes yet to come will have had no effect on fourth-quarter bank profits. Any potential boost to corporate earnings from Mr. Trump’s policies is not likely to materialize for several more quarters. But earnings calls could shed some light on the level of confidence within the financial sector, Mr. Golub said. “If you look at Wall Street analysts, they are unwilling to adjust their estimates, without having more specificity around policies, or at least guidance from management on what those policies might mean for earnings.” Report Typo/Error Follow Tim Shufelt on Twitter: @tshufelt   WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$55.31 +0.81 (+1.49%) BAC-NBank of America Corp Latest Price$23.01 +0.09 (+0.39%) JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$86.70 +0.46 (+0.53%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,274.64 +4.20 (+0.18%) Updated January 13 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Queensland and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited." While many money managers remain bearish - they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight - wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the US and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, US Department of Agriculture data show. Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.86 3/4 on August 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Shipping more Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on December 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the US to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management, which oversees about $5.2 billion.

The London-based International Grains Council in November  predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the US, Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century low In the US, the number 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest US producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labour expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of January 6.  A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a November 23 report. In December, the condition of dormant US wheat crops declined, including in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, the USDA reported on January 3. Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to US Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. Deep freeze In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said January 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on January 9.

Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. “Right now, we’ve fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, US,” which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minnesota. “We are not going substantially lower."

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Research in Motion reporting a huge $192 million fiscal first-quarter loss after the closing bell. The BlackBerry maker says shipments for its smart phones fell sharply for the second straight quarter and that it will cut 5,000 jobs. It is also delaying the launch of its next generation phone until early next year. Investors caught off guard by the Supreme Court ruling, which upheld a key part of President Obama's healthcare overhaul. It requires Americans to get health insurance by 2014 - or face a penalty. Shares of insurance companies were under pressure- because of concerns about how much the ruling could cost their bottom lines: Jeffrey Kraws of Crystal Research: SOUNDBITE: JEFFREY KRAWS, CEO, CRYSTAL RESEARCH (ENGLISH) SAYING: "In the insurance sector right now the insurance companies are picking up 30 plus million people who previously weren't included in their coverage. For them unfortunately you are going to have a lot of people who have pre-existing conditions who are very expensive to them that they have to now pick up and cover for a very small premium." The court did strike down the requirement that states dramatically expand Medicaid health insurance for the poor. Banks getting hit hard. JPMorgan Chase will likely lose between $4 and $6 billion on its botched trade according to a person familiar with the matter. That is two to three times the original estimate. The source also said JPMorgan has exited more than half its losing position. U.S. consumer spending still sputtering. The commerce department confirmed the economy grew at an annual pace of 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. But consumer spending, which is 70 percent of U.S. economic activity - grew at a lower rate than previously reported. A separate report showed fewer Americans filed for jobless claims last week. In the end it was a losing day on Wall Street; all the major indexes closing to the downside. In Europe, shares closed lower, dragged down by Barclays. Its stock down 15 percent after the bank agreed to pay $453 million dollars to settle allegations it manipulated key interest rates. Bobbi Rebell, Reuters.

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Western Australia and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited." While many money managers remain bearish -- they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight -- wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the U.S. and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Lower Prices Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.8675 on Aug. 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on Dec. 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the U.S. to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, which oversees about $5.2 billion. Already the prolonged slump in prices has discouraged farmers. The London-based International Grains Council in November predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century Low In the U.S., the No. 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest U.S. producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labor expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of Jan. 6.  Wheat Surplus A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a Nov. 23 report. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said Jan. 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on Jan. 9. Wheat Stockpiles With the USDA predicting global wheat consumption rising 3.5 percent to a record 734.3 million tons in the 2016-17 season, JPMorgan says inventories will drop in 2018 to 228 million tons from an estimated 249 million this year. Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. They are up 4 percent so far this year in Chicago at $4.24 1/4 a bushel, off to the best start since 2010. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. “Right now, we’ve fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, U.S.,” which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minnesota. “We are not going substantially lower."

Metro Denver’s housing market developing a split personality, sending rents down and home prices up For the second month, Denver residents charged on their Chase credit cards and used their Chase debit cards at a higher growth rate than the rest of nation, according to JPMorgan Chase Institute, which culled anonymized data from records of its 54 million customers. Restaurants and small businesses saw the biggest gains for Denver consumer spending in September 2016 — with growth rates of 5.01 percent and 7.41 percent from a year ago, respectively. Overall, consumer spending in Denver grew 6.9 percent from the year-ago September. Nationwide, Chase customers were more thrifty, spending 1.5 percent less than they did a year ago, which was the third-largest decline since October 2013. Only one-third of the 15 cities studied had positive growth. Those included Atlanta, Seattle, Phoenix and Portland, Ore. Denver also topped the nation for the highest growth in consumer spending during August, with a 5 percent year-over-year spending growth rate.

January 13, 2017 Climbing mortgage rates take bigger bites from budget, but the news is worse in some places than others January 12, 2017 Metro Denver home prices more overvalued than any time since the 1980s So, what’s happening in Denver? People of all ages are spending money, said Marvin Ward, with the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Most cities see a negative correlation between age and spending growth, and the same goes for income,” Ward said. “It is unusual to see all groups exhibiting growth, which means baby boomers are growing their spending more in Denver than most of our cities.” Chase noticed a “remarkable growth” in spending for other services too, including transit, telecom, beauty salons and health providers, plus entertainment options like theaters, golf courses, amusement parks and aquariums. “The latter services would bolster the tourism argument, but again, it’s hard to assign causality here,” he said. Screengrab from ChaseJPMorgan Chase found that consumers in Denver spent more than others nationwide on their Chase credit and debit cards during Sept. 2016.

Will Trump finally kill it? by Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 January 9, 2017: 1:32 PM ET The Volcker Rule Explained Big banks shouldn't act like hedge funds by making dangerous bets that can ruin the economy. That's the principle behind the Volcker Rule, a controversial part of the post-crisis Wall Street reform. The rule prohibits banks like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan from making risky wagers with their own money and bans them owning big stakes in hedge funds or private-equity firms. The banks hate it. Wall Street has bitterly complained about the Volcker Rule for years, arguing it's overly complex and does more harm than good. With Republicans gaining control of Congress and the White House, this key part of Dodd-Frank financial regulation could soon be weakened or be placed on the chopping block. The rule was named after legendary Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who came up with the idea and fought hard to include it in Dodd-Frank. But recently, the push to defang the Volcker Rule received support from an unlikely source: the Federal Reserve itself, which is also the chief regulator of the big banks. Staffers at the Fed studied whether it was easy to buy and sell bonds during times of stress, a critical feature for the smooth functioning of financial markets, known as liquidity. The December 22 research paper found that the 2015 implementation of the Volcker Rule had a harmful effect on corporate bond liquidity. Firms subject to the Volcker Rule become "less willing to provide liquidity during stress times," the paper concluded. It's a critical finding, especially considering the 2008 financial crisis was worsened by a liquidity crunch. "That Fed report really does give ammunition to opponents of the Volcker Rule," said Bloomberg Intelligence financial policy analyst Nathan Dean. Related: Elizabeth Warren watchdog under siege Deregulation hopes lift bank stocks While the Fed research was conducted by staffers, policymakers don't often oppose their own staff findings. "This is the regulator dropping bread crumbs to Congress to act," said Thomas Michaud, CEO of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank that specializes in financial services. Michaud said the 2008 meltdown has resulted in too much "heavy regulation" and "penalties" for banks. "All you need is to move it into neutral to have a positive effect. It's a lot like my golf game -- It just needs to be less bad," he said. Investors are betting that's exactly what will happen. Hopes of deregulation, in addition higher interest rates and tax cuts, have sent bank stocks skyrocketing since Donald Trump's victory. Morgan Stanley (MS) stock has surged 26% since the election, while Goldman Sachs's (GS) huge rally accounts for nearly one-quarter of the Dow's post-election gains. These are just two of the big banks that would benefit from Congress defanging the Volcker Rule. Related: Big banks counting on love from Trump and Fed Volcker backers: Don't forget Bear Stearns Defenders of financial reform warn against the Volcker Rule disappearing. "Hedge fund-like gambling should not be permitted in the banking space," said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit coalition pushing for Wall Street accountability. He pointed to the infamous Bear Stearns hedge fund division that imploded in 2007 after making bad bets on real estate. The failure triggered a loss of confidence and heavy losses for Bear Stearns. Less than a year, later Bear was the first Wall Street firm to collapse during the financial crisis. "We are very concerned about the repeal or dialing back of the Volcker Rule," said Stanley. GOP blueprint calls for Volcker Rule repeal If the Volcker Rule does get watered down, it would likely be part of a broader rewriting of Dodd-Frank. The Financial Choice Act, a key bill championed by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, calls for repealing the Volcker Rule entirely. Analysts say the bill wouldn't get through Congress as currently written, but it serves as a key blueprint for efforts to rewrite Dodd-Frank. Its success could hinge on whether Democrats are willing to negotiate. Elizabeth Warren and other champions of Wall Street reform could impede such a bill by choosing to filibuster. Liberal groups are already signaling they will fight to keep the Volcker Rule. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee told CNNMoney that overturning the rule would be "blatant proof that Trump favors corporate profits at the expense of American working families." Related: Trump wants to unshackle Main Street banks Trump could choose not to enforce Volcker Rule Of course, big banks wouldn't object to getting rid of the Volcker Rule. "We're not specifically pushing for the elimination of it, although it's fine if that happens," Francis Creighton, head of Wall Street lobbying group Financial Services Roundtable, told CNNMoney. Creighton complained that the Volcker Rule has led to "massive costs inside financial institutions that make it harder to serve customers." He said concerns about banks betting with their own money -- a practice known as proprietary trading -- have been resolved by "punishing" capital rules that make these types of trades unattractive. "Prop trading is gone. We're not looking for it to come back," Creighton said. Wells Fargo (WFC)CEO Tim Sloan specifically cited the Volcker Rule as one of many parts of financial regulation he wants Trump to dial back. "You kind of scratch your head and say, 'Is there really a lot of added benefit to that?" Sloan said last month. Even if Congress doesn't kill Dodd Frank, Trump could undermine it by picking regulators who choose not to enforce it. "You could unravel the Volcker Rule by just downgrading enforcement of it," said Stanley.

Morgan Stanley stock has surged 26% since the election, while Goldman Sachs’s huge rally accounts for nearly one-quarter of the Dow’s post-election gains. These are just two of the big banks that would benefit from Congress defanging the Volcker Rule. Volcker backers: Don’t forget Bear Stearns Defenders of financial reform warn against the Volcker Rule disappearing. “Hedge fund-like gambling should not be permitted in the banking space,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit coalition pushing for Wall Street accountability. He pointed to the infamous Bear Stearns hedge fund division that imploded in 2007 after making bad bets on real estate. The failure triggered a loss of confidence and heavy losses for Bear Stearns. Less than a year, later Bear was the first Wall Street firm to collapse during the financial crisis. “We are very concerned about the repeal or dialing back of the Volcker Rule,” said Stanley. GOP blueprint calls for Volcker Rule repeal If the Volcker Rule does get watered down, it would likely be part of a broader rewriting of Dodd-Frank. The Financial Choice Act, a key bill championed by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, calls for repealing the Volcker Rule entirely. Analysts say the bill wouldn’t get through Congress as currently written, but it serves as a key blueprint for efforts to rewrite Dodd-Frank. Its success could hinge on whether Democrats are willing to negotiate. Elizabeth Warren and other champions of Wall Street reform could impede such a bill by choosing to filibuster. Liberal groups are already signaling they will fight to keep the Volcker Rule. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee told CNNMoney that overturning the rule would be “blatant proof that Trump favors corporate profits at the expense of American working families.” Trump could choose not to enforce Volcker Rule Of course, big banks wouldn’t object to getting rid of the Volcker Rule. “We’re not specifically pushing for the elimination of it, although it’s fine if that happens,” Francis Creighton, head of Wall Street lobbying group Financial Services Roundtable, told CNNMoney. Creighton complained that the Volcker Rule has led to “massive costs inside financial institutions that make it harder to serve customers.” He said concerns about banks betting with their own money — a practice known as proprietary trading — have been resolved by “punishing” capital rules that make these types of trades unattractive. “Prop trading is gone. We’re not looking for it to come back,” Creighton said. Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan specifically cited the Volcker Rule as one of many parts of financial regulation he wants Trump to dial back. “You kind of scratch your head and say, ‘Is there really a lot of added benefit to that?” Sloan said last month. Even if Congress doesn’t kill Dodd Frank, Trump could undermine it by picking regulators who choose not to enforce it. “You could unravel the Volcker Rule by just downgrading enforcement of it,” said Stanley.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that he conspired to operate an illegal bitcoin exchange, which prosecutors said was owned by an Israeli who oversaw a massive scheme to hack companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co(JPM.N). Anthony Murgio, 33, entered his plea in federal court in Manhattan to three counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, a month before he was to face trial. Under a plea agreement, Murgio agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of about 12-1/2 years in prison or less. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled his sentencing for June 16. The Tampa, Florida-resident is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Murgio operated Coin.mx, which without a license exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin, including for victims of ransomware, a computer virus that seeks payment, often in the virtual currency, to unlock data it restricts. Prosecutors said Coin.mx was operated from 2013 to 2015 through several fronts, including one called "Collectables Club," to trick financial institutions into believing it was a members-only group interested in collectables like stamps. Coin.mx was owned by Israeli citizen Gery Shalon, according to prosecutors, who say he and Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies. An attack on JPMorgan resulted in the information of more than 100 million people being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Murgio, who was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, was tied not only to Shalon but also to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio called Aaron "my friend" and said he "showed me the ropes to online marketing." Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U.S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin.mx, including Murgio's father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-769.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 6:33am   Comments Share: The 35th JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Healthcare Conference gets underway on January 9 and will go on until January 13. Touted as the life science industry's largest conferences of the year, the event showcases innovations of healthcare companies, which are out to scout for their next partners or investors. Why Attendance Matters? The conference, one of the oldest held in San Francisco usually in the second week of January, will be attended by thousands of investors and executives from around the world. The conference provides a platform for discussing deals and partnerships. More importantly, companies see the conference as an opportunity to present their product candidates before investors and executives who are seeking an attractive opportunity. More than the events organized at the headquarters, several parallel events such as Biotech Showcase, Medtech Showcase, RESI, etc. will draw people. Alternatively, people may also schedule one-to-one meetings with the conference attendees, who are key decision markers at their respective companies. Major Takeaways From The 2016 Conference Last year's conference allayed fears concerning gene therapy stemming from some botched clinical trial results. Companies such as bluebird bio Inc (NASDAQ: BLUE) and Spark Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ONCE) affirmed the prospects of the therapy at the conference. Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE: NVS) CEO Joe Jimenez said at the conference, "Tech companies, with the digitization of healthcare, are coming in from a different angle, and it's going to be an area where we have to watch leverage and pay real attention." The now scuttled deal between Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Allergan plc Ordinary Shares (NYSE: AGN) was discussed by the respective CEOs at the conference. Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ: ESRX) shares took a tumble, dropping close to 7 percent, after Anthem Inc (NYSE: ANTM)'s CEO took a shot at the former at the conference for not passing on more savings it negotiates from drug makers. Anthem threatened to ditch Express Scripts if the latter could not deliver $3 billion more per year in cost savings on drugs. What to Watch For In 2017 Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG), which usually kickstarts the conference, will present a business update in addition to unaudited 2016 financial results and an updated financial outlook at 10:30 a.m. ET on January 9. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)'s CEO Kenneth Frazier and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories, are scheduled to participate at 4:00 p.m. PST (7:00 p.m. EST) on January 9. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) will present at 8:00 a.m. PT (11:00 a.m. ET) on January 9. Immediately following the presentation, the company will webcast the Q&A breakout session at 8:30 a.m. PT (11:30 a.m. ET). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) Executive Vice Chairman and CEO Stefano Pessina, and Co-Chief Operating Officer Alex Gourlay scheduled to appear at 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET) on January 11. Pfizer Inc. has scheduled a discussion with Albert Bourla, group president, Pfizer Innovative Health; Frank D'Amelio, executive vice president, business operations, and chief financial officer; and Mikael Dolsten, president, worldwide research and development at 10:30 PT, January 10. Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRPT) CEO Edward Kaye is scheduled to present at 7:30 a.m. PT (10:30 a.m. ET) on January 10. The company's lead drug candidate Eteplirsen to treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene received accelerated approval in September last. Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GILD) President and Chief Executive Officer John Milligan, will provide an overview of the company at the conference at 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET) on January 9.

The lira was down more than 2 percent to 3.72 to the dollar after Friday's data showed U.S. wages rose in December prompting U.S. rate hike expectations. . "The lira has always been one of the most exposed EM currencies to any sign that monetary policy in the U.S. will tighten because of its large external financing requirement," said William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. "(Turkish) domestic policy-making is playing a role too as it seems the central bank is responding to political pressure not to raise interest rates, so it is likely to be behind the curve in reacting to pressure in the currency," he added. The lira lost 3.2 percent last week, pounded by higher-than-expected inflation and security fears after a series of gun and bomb attacks. The economy has remained sluggish, with a smaller-than-expected rise in industrial production in November, whilst Moody's has warned that bank profits will be hit by increased non-performing loans. Turkish 5-year credit default swaps rose 3 basis points (bps) from Friday's close to 273 bps, whilst the yield premium paid by Turkish sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out 9 bps to 359 bps. The stronger dollar and expectations of faster Fed tightening also created headwinds for other vulnerable emerging market currencies and contributed to more subdued investor appetite for riskier assets, with the benchmark emerging stocks index down 0.4 percent. The yield premium on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified also widened out 3 bps to 327 bps. The Mexican peso, which remains vulnerable to any restrictions on trade, weakened 0.23 percent. It was still trading above record lows hit last week, which had prompted the Mexican central bank to intervene. On Friday, Trump said Mexico repeated that Mexico would repay the United States for his planned border wall , capping a week in which carmaker Ford cancelled a planned factory in Mexico following criticism from Trump. China's onshore yuan slipped 0.24 percent and the offshore yuan gave back some of the sharp gains it made last week. But borrowing costs retreated from record highs, with overnight yuan deposit rates falling to around 10 percent from Friday's high of 87 percent. In recent weeks the Chinese authorities have intervened in both onshore and offshore currency markets by selling dollars aggressively to prevent the yuan from depreciating too quickly, with Trump vowing to label China a currency manipulator. Data released at the weekend showed China's foreign exchange reserves fell for a sixth consecutive month in December to near-six year lows of $3.011 trillion. Central bank adviser Fan Gong said the decline in forex reserves was good news in the long-run, adding that the yuan had been overvalued for the last three or four years. Chinese mainland stocks were up about 0.5 percent and Hong Kong shares rose 0.25 percent, with China confident it reached 6.7 percent economic growth in 2016. The Russian rouble weakened 0.6 percent versus the dollar and Moscow dollar-denominated stocks retreated 0.8 percent with oil prices falling 1.7 percent to around $56 a barrel. Trump has now accepted that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response. This may prompt a reversal of the view that Western sanctions on Russia will soon be lifted. The South African rand slipped 0.3 percent against the dollar. Over the weekend the chances of President Jacob Zuma's ex-wife becoming the next leader of the ruling ANC party were given a boost with an endorsement from the party's women's division. Zuma also called for an end to ANC infighting. The Polish zloty weakened 0.4 percent against the euro. The central bank is seen keeping interest rates on hold at a record low of 1.5 percent at its rate setting meeting on Wednesday.

But starting on January 12, Chase is slashing the reward bonus to 50,000 points, which means consumers who have been sitting on the fence may want to apply before January 11, said NerdWallet credit and banking expert Sean McQuay.  How you can score free trips with credit card rewards “It’s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping sign-up bonus,” McQuay said. “That card went from not existing to being the most popular premium credit card on the market overnight.” While Chase succeeded in propelling its card into the wallets of thousands of well-heeled consumers, that popularity has come with a downside for the bank: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last month that the card would lower the company’s fourth-quarter profits by $200 million. That helps explain why the bank is slashing the card’s sign-up bonus in half starting on Thursday.  Even without the huge 100,000-point bonus, the card will remain a good deal for some consumers, McQuay noted.  7 times you shouldn't use your credit card “At that point, on January 12, it’s still the best travel card on the market, but I think most Americans are better off with a cash-back card” because they tend to have no annual fee, he said. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card may continue to make sense for consumers who can afford its hefty annual fee, which stands at $450, and who also travel regularly. It’s also important to understand that the bonus is contingent on spending $4,000 within the first three months, which might only make sense for consumers who plan to make a large purchase soon after signing up.  While the rewards points bonus will be slashed, other perks will remain past January 12, such as a $300 credit each year for any travel spending a card holder puts on the card. Other perks include access to airport lounges through the Priority Pass network and $100 for paying for TSA Pre-Check or Global Entry.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

The lira was down more than 2 percent to 3.72 to the dollar after Friday's data showed U.S. wages rose in December prompting U.S. rate hike expectations. . "The lira has always been one of the most exposed EM currencies to any sign that monetary policy in the U.S. will tighten because of its large external financing requirement," said William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. "(Turkish) domestic policy-making is playing a role too as it seems the central bank is responding to political pressure not to raise interest rates, so it is likely to be behind the curve in reacting to pressure in the currency," he added. The lira lost 3.2 percent last week, pounded by higher-than-expected inflation and security fears after a series of gun and bomb attacks. The economy has remained sluggish, with a smaller-than-expected rise in industrial production in November, whilst Moody's has warned that bank profits will be hit by increased non-performing loans. Turkish 5-year credit default swaps rose 3 basis points (bps) from Friday's close to 273 bps, whilst the yield premium paid by Turkish sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out 9 bps to 359 bps. The stronger dollar and expectations of faster Fed tightening also created headwinds for other vulnerable emerging market currencies and contributed to more subdued investor appetite for riskier assets, with the benchmark emerging stocks index down 0.4 percent. The yield premium on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified also widened out 3 bps to 327 bps. The Mexican peso, which remains vulnerable to any restrictions on trade, weakened 0.23 percent. It was still trading above record lows hit last week, which had prompted the Mexican central bank to intervene. On Friday, Trump said Mexico repeated that Mexico would repay the United States for his planned border wall , capping a week in which carmaker Ford cancelled a planned factory in Mexico following criticism from Trump. China's onshore yuan slipped 0.24 percent and the offshore yuan gave back some of the sharp gains it made last week. But borrowing costs retreated from record highs, with overnight yuan deposit rates falling to around 10 percent from Friday's high of 87 percent. In recent weeks the Chinese authorities have intervened in both onshore and offshore currency markets by selling dollars aggressively to prevent the yuan from depreciating too quickly, with Trump vowing to label China a currency manipulator. Data released at the weekend showed China's foreign exchange reserves fell for a sixth consecutive month in December to near-six year lows of $3.011 trillion. Central bank adviser Fan Gong said the decline in forex reserves was good news in the long-run, adding that the yuan had been overvalued for the last three or four years. Chinese mainland stocks were up about 0.5 percent and Hong Kong shares rose 0.25 percent, with China confident it reached 6.7 percent economic growth in 2016. The Russian rouble weakened 0.6 percent versus the dollar and Moscow dollar-denominated stocks retreated 0.8 percent with oil prices falling 1.7 percent to around $56 a barrel. Trump has now accepted that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response. This may prompt a reversal of the view that Western sanctions on Russia will soon be lifted. The South African rand slipped 0.3 percent against the dollar. Over the weekend the chances of President Jacob Zuma's ex-wife becoming the next leader of the ruling ANC party were given a boost with an endorsement from the party's women's division. Zuma also called for an end to ANC infighting. The Polish zloty weakened 0.4 percent against the euro. The central bank is seen keeping interest rates on hold at a record low of 1.5 percent at its rate setting meeting on Wednesday.

Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. The projected upper bound is: 89.48. The projected lower bound is: 83.45. The projected closing price is: 86.47. Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 28 white candles and 22 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. Three black candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three black crows, the steady downward pattern is bearish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 47.8590. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 62.88. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 2 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -15. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 6 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 14 period(s) ago.

CNN Money China fears protectionist Trump may thwart its exports China's customs agency said on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump may limit the growth of China's exports by imposing greater trade protectionist measures. According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Another test for the rally will be the start of fourth-quarter earning seasons, and first up are financials, the leaders of the Trump rally with a near 18 percent gain since Nov. 8. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial (PNC) and others report Friday. Earnings for theS&P 500 (.SPX) are expected to increase by 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but the S&P financial sector earnings are expected to have the biggest gains, with earnings up 15.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. The sector has bounced hard on the prospect of higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve, which would help bank profitability. The stocks also are rising on Trump's vow to end excess regulation. Besides banks, names like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are in that financial group and both are trading at near decade highs. Goldman is up 35 percent since the election, and has been leading the Dow. "I suspect earnings are going to be pretty darn good, but the problem is expectations are going up too," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. "Given the movement in some of these stock prices, you better hope they're outperforming expectations." President-elect Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's rally since election day, though some analysts say the market and economy were already poised for improvement. "Right now the market has been floating on the illusion of optimism, and does that turn into a false sense of security?" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said Trump sparked the rally when he spoke in the early hours of Nov. 9. That victory speech has been credited with turning collapsing stock futures into a two-month rally. Trump focused on the pro-growth programs, like infrastructure spending and corporate tax breaks, that Wall Street has latched on to. He did not dwell on tariffs or trade proposals that had made Wall Street nervous before the election and are still a concern for some strategists. "All eyes will be on [President Barack] Obama's farewell speech Tuesday and then President-elect Trump's first press conference on Wednesday," said Redler. "We'll be trying to figure out what his tone is like. It will be a kind of pre-game for the inauguration. Traders would like the tone to be like he had in his election speech when he was claiming victory, versus what we've seen in the last few sessions." In the past week, Trump has repeatedly doubted the intelligence community's findings on Russian interference with the election. The intelligence findings concluded that President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" but it turned into a "clear preference" for Trump. After a briefing with U.S. intelligence officials Friday, Trump said other nations like Russia and China are consistently attempting cyber break-ins against U.S. institutions, and he would form a team to combat these attacks. He also said there was no impact on the outcome of the election. In some of his first dealings with Congress in the past week, he called Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York "head clown" in a tweet. He has also criticized car companies, including Toyota, this past week. He warned the Japanese company in a tweet that it will face hefty taxes at the border if it tries to import cars into the U.S. from a new plant in Mexico. "I'd be more worried about his tweets than his press conference," said Paulsen, adding the press briefing is "going to capture more attention. We've never had one since he's been elected president." Besides the news conference, there will be confirmation hearings for the Trump Cabinet, including former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Wall Street economists and strategists have been trying to handicap the Trump agenda, and put time frames around when his programs could start spurring more growth. Expectations vary on when there will be some impact. They also want to see a timeline on the tax overhaul, since companies will be more inclined to start spending and taking other action if they see a concrete plan. Because of the unknowns, some economists do not forecast much impact at all this year, yet the stock market has run higher on the prospect of positive change. "I would think there would be a lot of questions as to what his agenda is, what he looks to accomplish in his first 100 days. It could have some short-term impact, in terms of what he chooses precisely. I don't think this is going to have much lasting impact, but it could create some volatility," Paulsen said. Besides earnings, there are also a few key economic reports including retail sales, consumer sentiment and producer price inflation data, also all on Friday. Stocks hit some bumps in the first week of the new year but finished strong. The Dow came within 0.37 of a point of Dow 20,000 on Friday. It ended the session at 19,963 and a gain of 1 percent for the week. The S&P 500 was up 1.7 percent for the week at 2276, after hitting a new all-time high of 2,282 intraday. The Nasdaq gained a solid 2.5 percent to 5,521 as some big tech, like Amazon.com, played catch up. China could also be a big influence in the week ahead. Traders will continue to watch the volatility in the yuan, which had a swift run-up in the past week before pulling back. "The big thing is China's reserves. They're trying to thread a pretty small needle in trying to keep the exchange rate stable, trying to keep reserves at around $3 trillion as a confidence thing and to have flexibility in policy," said Robert Sinche, chief global strategist at Amherst Pierpont. Reserves data were to be reported over the weekend, but there is also trade data on Friday. Sinche said the market will be looking to see if exports are gaining any momentum. "The market thinks they're going to be losing some momentum in December," he said. "[But] there's definite signs things have improved across the Asian region." "I think the world's come to the realization that growth has picked up at the end of the year. Some of the data coming out of Europe is pretty robust," he said. "The question is going to be how much inflation is there going to be in the system. It looks like so far it's primarily an energy measurement phenomena. Except in the U.S., where I think there are some capacity pressures and pressures on wages." Inflation has become a bigger theme for markets and was very apparent in the December hourly wages growth of 0.4 percent, providing the biggest boost in year-over-year wage growth since 2009. Economists expect wages to continue to rise. They also expect to see a blip higher in inflation in the next several months because oil and gasoline prices are much higher than they were at the same time last year.

His nomination is a strong signal that the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. Share story By Leslie Picker The New York Times The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider’s insider — a dealmaker. As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency’s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. Walter ‘Jay’ Clayton Education: Bachelor’s degrees from both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge; law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School Current position: Partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, a leading Wall Street law firm Deals: Worked on Chinese web giant Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO, Goldman Sachs’ $5 billion infusion from Warren Buffett. Source: NYT He had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Bros. in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013.

A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agency’s current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise & Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive. Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission’s ethics officer. “An ethics officer at the SEC knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts,” she noted. Yet Clayton’s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan & Cromwell, where Clayton is a partner, has been Goldman’s go-to law firm for more than a century. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Clayton’s wife works as a private-wealth adviser at Goldman. The SEC nomination follows the appointment of Goldman’s No. 2 executive, Gary Cohn to be the top economic-policy adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, and the selection of a hedge-fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be Treasury secretary. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Trump, who met with Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer “will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.” Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan & Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury Department role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’” Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the SEC oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis.” One issue could be Clayton’s representation of Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant is under investigation by the SEC over its accounting practices. Clayton also represented Och-Ziff Capital Management in its $1.2 billion initial public offering a decade ago, and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New York-based hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the government’s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which argued that “the current anti-bribery regime” was causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U.S. regulated companies and the U.S. capital markets.” Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Clayton at Sullivan & Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the 50-year-old practitioner could be at the helm of the SEC. “He’s a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real-deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand,” said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis Polk’s global capital-markets group, who has worked with Clayton on several deals. “There’s been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn’t pleasantly surprised by the choice.” The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Trump’s economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the SEC appointed by President George W. Bush, said Clayton was a “high-quality appointment.” “It is especially logical with respect to the agency’s obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned,” Pitt said in an email. “Mr. Clayton’s background is very impressive — both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts.” Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor’s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush’s primary campaign in 2015, according to public records. Those who know Clayton describe him as the roll-up-his-sleeves type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Cohen at Sullivan & Cromwell. “The guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial-regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes,” said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Clayton over many years. “He’s got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth.” Leslie Picker Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion that some of the world's biggest banks have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton schemed with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the currency spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former head of G10 spot trading, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' ex-global head of spot trading, was at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said. In addition to the criminal case, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Usher and Ramchandani $5 million each, and the banking regulator banned them from working in the U.S. banking industry. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offence," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a rate-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

(NYSE: JPM). He is bullish on the financial sector because he expects to see deregulation in the U.S. and he also expects the net interest margin to increase and corporate tax rate to decrease. Kelly thinks that JPMorgan might guide its dividend higher and he finds its price-to-earnings ratio attractive. He wants to initiate a long position in the name with a risk reversal options strategy. Kelly wants to sell the April 80 put and buy the April 87.5 call and the whole structure would cost him $1.65. The trade breaks even at $89.15 or 3.15 percent higher at the April expiration. If JPMorgan trades below $80, Kelly is going to have to buy the stock. Posted-In: Bloomberg Markets Kevin KellyOptions Markets Media © 2017 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed their way into the green after beginning Tuesday below their respective closes on Monday. The two indexes aim to push forward despite the broad decline across sectors and blue-chip companies. The Nasdaq was also striving to finish in the green after the tech-focused index closed at an all-time high for a second consecutive session on Monday. Many investors and market participants will be anxiously awaiting President-elect Donald Trump's news conference Wednesday. Analysts expect the stock rally to continue if Trump is able to provide optimism regarding the markets. Additionally, major companies will commence the corporate earnings season on Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) will be leading the banks due to report. Stocks on the Move Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) were on the rise Tuesday after the company announced Monday night that it would be selling its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group Co. for $819.9 million in cash. Quebec-based Valeant also disclosed on Monday that it was selling three skin care brands to French giant L'Oréal for $1.3 billion. Valeant CEO Joseph Papa stated that the sale will help the company better align its product portfolio and repay its outstanding loan debt. Yahoo (YHOO) shares were also on the move Tuesday after the company reported that CEO Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo would be resigning from Yahoo's board of directors once Verizon (VZ) completes its acquisition. Yahoo will also change its post-acquisition name to Altaba to reflect its stake in Alibaba (BABA) assets. Foreign Markets Asian markets slumped on Tuesday following less-than-stellar economic news from major countries in the region and uneasiness ahead of Trump's news conference Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was down 0.79%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.80%. Chinese markets fared no better as the Shanghai Composite Index finished in negative territory, down 0.30% after consumer inflation was shown to have slowed down in December. There are fears among traders that Trump's news conference will include comments criticizing Asian manufacturers. In Japan, specifically, there is worry that the United States may turn on the country as the president-elect looks to place a greater emphasis on American manufacturing. Economic data releases led to Australian markets trading in the red as the country's economy was reported to have contracted in the third quarter--the first time it has done so since early 2011. Rallies from supermarket chains and mining companies had the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index trading higher on Tuesday. Not only has the U.K. benchmark been trading in the green for 11 straight sessions, but it also looks to finish out the trading day with a ninth-straight all-time closing high. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index's momentum slowed, however, after disappointing business updates from major companies, including Lufthansa.

The major averages closed on opposite sides of the unchanged line for the second consecutive session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed higher for the sixth straight session, climbing 20.00 points or 0.4 percent to a new record closing high of 5,551.82. The S&P 500 ended the day unchanged at 2,269.90, while the Dow dipped 31.85 points or 0.2 percent to 19,855.53. The choppy trading on Wall Street came as traders seemed reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets. Traders also continue to keep an eye on the performance by the Dow, which climbed within striking distance of 20,000 but was once again unable to break through that key psychological level. The lackluster performance also came amid a relatively quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to reports on producer prices and retail sales due on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also due to report their quarterly results later this week. Among individual stocks, shares of Pacific Continental (PCBK) moved sharply higher after the regional bank agreed to be acquired by Columbia Banking System (COLB) for approximately $644.1 million. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) also posted a strong gain after announcing an agreement to sell its CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion in cash. Meanwhile, shares of WD-40 (WDFC) came under pressure after the lubricant maker reported weaker than expected first quarter results. Sector News While many of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, steel stocks showed a substantial move to the upside. The NYSE Arca Steel Index surged up by 4.9 percent to its best closing level in almost a month. Mechel (MTL), Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF), and Olympic Steel (ZEUS) turned in some of the steel sector's best performances. Considerable strength was also visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 2.4 percent gain posted by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. The rebound by the index came after it ended the previous session at a one-month closing low. On the other hand, oil service stocks came under pressure as the day progressed amid another steep drop by the price of crude oil. Reflecting the weakness in the oil service sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index slumped by 1.5 percent. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index closed just above the unchanged line, the German DAX Index edged up by 0.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction before ending the session nearly flat. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, inched up by less than a basis point to 2.379 percent.

Mixed but generally positive results are expected from the first three quarterly reports. Expectations are also positive for the flood of bank earnings reports that follow. The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks into high gear later this week when the first of the big banks begin sharing their results. But expectations are somewhat mixed, based on the analysts' consensus forecasts for the period when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and a new president was elected. Solid results are expected from Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) for the period that included the so-called Trump rally. Solid bottom-line growth is also anticipated from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) but with minimal top-line growth. Its CEO during the period saw Trump's election as good news for business and the economy. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), on the other hand, is expected to say that its earnings slipped from a year ago, in the period when it latest analyst ratings and price targets on these three banks. Below is a quick look at what is expected from the results of these three, as well as a peek at a few of the other upcoming quarterly reports from financial companies. Bank of America The fourth-quarter profit of this bank is anticipated to come in at $0.38 per share, which would be nearly a 30 percent gain from the year-ago period, according to Wall Street analysts. The consensus of 116 Estimize respondents has earnings pegged at $0.40 per share. Note that both Wall Street and Estimize underestimated earnings in the prior two quarters. In Friday morning's report, analysts will also be looking for $20.91 billion in revenue for the three months that ended in December, compared with the $21.00 billion that Estimize predicts and the $19.56 billion in the year ago period. Here too, the results in the previous quarter topped Wall Street and Estimize estimates. JPMorgan In its report before Friday's opening bell, the largest U.S. bank by assets is expected to say that it had earnings of $1.47 per share in its fourth quarter, according to Estimze. That would be up from $1.32 per share a year ago. Wall Street is a bit more pessimistic, with a consensus estimate of $1.43 in earnings per share (EPS). But JPMorgan blew out EPS estimates in the previous two quarters. Estimize has underestimated revenue in the past few quarters, and this time the 88 respondents are looking for $23.72 billion. That would be about the same as in the year-ago period. Wall Street anticipates it will be $23.95 billion, which would still be the lowest level in the past three quarters. Wells Fargo The consensus Wall Street forecast calls for this bank to post fourth-quarter EPS of $1.00 (down three cents from in the same period of last year) but for revenue to have risen around 4 percent to $22.48 billion. Note that analysts underestimated both the top and bottom lines in the prior quarter. Also, this latest revenue projection would be the greatest in more than eight quarters. Estimize is a bit more optimistic on the bottom line, with the consensus of 68 respondents pegging EPS at $1.02, with revenue of $22.45 billion also predicted for the three months that ended in December. Estimize likewise underestimated earnings results in the third quarter. And the bank is scheduled to share its latest results before trading begins on Friday as well. And Others Regional bank PNC Financial is also on tap to share its results on Friday, and Wall Street anticipates an earnings decline here too. Looking ahead to next week, consensus forecasts so far call for at least a little earnings growth from BB&T, Citigroup, Citizens Financial, Comerica, Goldman Sachs, KeyCorp, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, Regions Financial, Synchrony Financial and U.S. Bancorp. On the other hand, shrinking profits are in the cards for American Express and SunTrust Banks, if analysts are correct.

While you were sleeping: Nasdaq hits record high Jan. 11 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street gained as better-than-expected data from China underpinned optimism about the outlook as investors geared up for a fresh round of US corporate earnings. In 1.18pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.5 percent. In 1.03pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq touched a record high 5,564.25. “We’ve shifted from that exuberance post the election and the rotation into some of the sectors and now we are entering a wait-and-see mode with earnings knocking at the front door,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in News York, told Reuters. US banks JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report their latest quarterly earnings on Friday. “Earnings may be the pivot to move things higher,” Hogan noted. In the Dow, gains in shares of American Express and those of Caterpillar, recently up 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent respectively, outweighed falls in shares of IBM and those of Procter & Gamble, down 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. In the latest US economic data, the National Federation of Independent Business’s index climbed 7.4 points in December to 105.8, the highest in 12 years. “Rising confidence adds to the economy’s upward momentum,” Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, said in a note, Bloomberg reported. At the same time, the “NFIB membership appears to be disproportionately Republican, so it is possible that the data will start overstating strength, opposite the pattern during the Obama administration.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.1 percent advance from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index edged 0.01 percent higher, Germany’s DAX Index increased 0.2 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5 percent to close at a record high. Metals including copper and iron ore advanced after China’s producer price index climbed at the fastest pace in five years, exceeding expectations. The producer price index rose 5.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the most since September 2011, compared with a 3.3 percent increase in November, the National Statistics Bureau said. “Reflation continues in the factory sector,” Julia Wang, an economist at HSBC Holdings in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg. “The stable CPI suggests that the reflation is confined mostly in the industrial sector and hasn’t filtered into the real economy. So the PBOC would possibly not respond to it until inflation expands to the real economy.” (BusinessDesk) Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

 There's something missing from one of the largest healthcare investor meetings of the year Lydia Ramsey Jan. 10, 2017, 1:53 PM 1,543 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sean Gallup/Getty Images "Woo, another woman!" a woman holding an information sign shouted at me at a hotel in San Francisco. I was headed into a meeting as part of the craze that surrounds the JPMorgan healthcare conference. At the conference, you're far more likely to come across men than women. This is no secret: Even the organizers are aware of the discrepancy. Last year, financial communications firm LifeSci Advisors threw a party at the conference in which the company hired models to mingle. Word about the party spread, prompting Kate Bingham, a managing partner at UK-based venture capital firm SV Life Sciences and Karen Bernstein, whose company runs the news site BioCentury, to circulate an open letter to pharmaceutical executives. For Michael Rice, founding partner of LifeSci Advisors, it was a wake-up call.  "We made a mistake," Rice told Business Insider over the phone in January. "We were wrong. We didn't understand the outrage." After meeting with one of the women who penned the letter, Rice said he and the LifeSci team got to work on initiatives aimed at fixing the problem, including getting more women placed on the boards of biotech companies and looking internally to try and get more women into the company.  In pharma and biotech, the number of women in leadership roles is still fairly low. In September 2015, GSK announced that Emma Walmsley would become CEO, making her the first female chief executive of a big pharma company. In biotech, it's estimated that only about 7-9% of chief executive roles are filled by women. It's not an issue that's unique to drugmakers: Among the Fortune 500, 4.2% were led by femal CEOs.  But for those few, there's some optimism about what the future may bring.   Headed in the right direction When Lion Biotechnologies CEO Maria Fardis started her PhD program at UC Berkeley, the class was made up about half men and half women. By the end, the number of women in the program had dropped to about 20%, she said.  But, Fardis said she now feels more optimistic about the number of women in science in 2017, particularly in leadership roles at healthcare companies. "I am encouraged in the past few years, I think that people are making a cognizant effort to make sure that the opportunities that are created are equal," she said. "I don't think that women are getting any extra benefit compared to their colleagues, but I think that at a minimum they are given that equal opportunity to shine." Fardis noted that many of the members of Lion's executive team, for example, are women, though that wasn't intentional.  Helen Torley, CEO of Halozyme, is the only female CEO of a publicly traded biotech in San Diego, California. When she realized this in 2016, she decided to take a look at the gender breakdown of the company as a whole. Torley said that, at least across the different levels of the company, there was a balance between men and women who were hired. That could bode well for future generations. Both Fardis and Torley said they observed a change in the upcoming generation, with more female scientists staying in the workforce to make it up to senior levels.  "While I'm a rarity at this stage, I think 10 years from now we're going to have very many more female CEOs because they're getting the right training and exposure."  This year, LifeSci Advisors will not be throwing a party. Instead, Rice said he's focusing on making sure gender diversity is something that everyone is thinking about by having that conversation with the people attending the conference.  SEE ALSO: A startup that wants to create a simple blood test for every form of cancer is trying to raise at least $1 billion DON'T MISS: The biggest healthcare investor conference starts this week — here are the 5 things we expect to get out of it NOW WATCH: The most important question you should ask before hiring a financial adviser Loading video...

Recent Posts: 5 Chinese Stocks to Sell Before China’s Internet Bubble Bursts The Future of Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is Overhyped Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Looks for a Cheney Bump View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) still has the wind at its back entering 2017. Inflation is returning, which means interest rates are rising, and the shine is off rival Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC). All these factors have propelled Bank of America stock up 40% in just the last three months, and all remain in play. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr In that time frame, BAC stock’s price-to-book value has risen from less than 0.7 to over 0.9, meaning it will soon be worth the stated value of its assets. But it is still well behind its banking peers, with JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) at 1.37 and Wells at 1.56. For the first time in a decade, banks look like healthy investments and Bank of America stock still has ground to make up. Analysts are also continuing to pound the table for BAC stock, with 19 of 34 still having it on their buy lists despite the run-up. The most recent bullish call comes from Barclay’s, which sees another 15% upside. But is it too late to get in on Bank of America stock? BAC Stock’s Catalysts Mortgages were the big catalyst for WFC when it was a hot stock. For BofA there are a more reasons for optimism. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017: The Experts’ Picks Interest rates should continue to rise, which means the margins the bank gets on its loans should also rise. Costs are declining thanks to technology, with 400 branches having been closed just in the last two years. The regulations of the last decade look likely to disappear over the next few years, which will reduce costs further. Don’t forget, too, that BAC includes Merrill Lynch, which means a range of investment banking income from mergers to global finance come its way as a matter of course. BofA is now focused on increasing revenue rather than trimming costs, meaning more gains from investment banking should be on the way. Bank of America stock now stands out as among Warren Buffett’s great investments. The $5 billion he invested in the bank in 2011, when it was on its knees, is now worth over $17.4 billion. The returns are bigger than those you might enjoy, as he got preferred stock and low-cost options for his money, but the investment helped fuel recent gains by stabilizing the bank’s finances. What Could Go Wrong for BofA? Whenever a stock runs up quickly it’s wise to look at the bearish case. Bank of America stock is doing the same kind of “cross-selling” that got Wells in trouble, and with Merrill Lynch, it has more products to cross-sell to larger clients.

Generally speaking, a rising tide will lift all the boats, which does in fact help companies raise their valuations for how much money they can get in their initial public offerings (IPO). Previously, we took a look at a couple other IPOs that just came up on the radar. Yet, here we have included some of the more recent companies that are registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Invitation Homes Invitation Homes recently filed an S-11 form with the SEC for its IPO. No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $100 million. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol INVH. The underwriters for the offering are Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital, Blackstone Capital Markets, BTIG, Evercore ISI, FBR, JMP Securities, Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Raymond James, Siebert Cisneros Shank and Zelman Partners. This is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease in the United States. Its portfolio of nearly 50,000 high quality homes is wholly owned and is concentrated in attractive in-fill submarkets of major metropolitan statistical areas. It has selected locations with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry and high rent-growth potential. The company is highly concentrated in the western United States and Florida, with 72% of its revenues generated in those regions and 54% of revenues coming from California and Florida alone during the three months ended in September 2016. Invitation Homes intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay indebtedness, with the remainder going to working capital and general corporate purposes. Kimbell Royalty Partners This company filed its first S-1 form with the SEC as well for its IPO. Similarly, the company values its offering up to $100 million, although this number is usually just a placeholder. Kimbell Royalty Partners intends to list its units on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KRP. The underwriters for the offering are Raymond James, RBC Capital, Stifel, Stephens and Wunderlich. This is a Delaware limited partnership formed to own and acquire mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties throughout the United States. As an owner of mineral and royalty interests, this company is entitled to a portion of the revenues received from the production of oil, natural gas and associated natural gas liquids from the acreage underlying its interests, net of post-production expenses and taxes. It is not obligated to fund drilling and completion costs, lease operating expenses or plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well’s productive life. The primary business objective is to provide increasing cash distributions to unitholders resulting from acquisitions from its sponsors, the contributing parties and third parties and from organic growth through the continued development by working interest owners of the properties in which it owns an interest. The company intends to use the net proceeds to make a distribution to the contributing parties. Keane Group Keane Group registered an amended S-1 form with the SEC for its IPO. The company priced its 16.7 million shares in the range of $17 to $19, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.505 million shares. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $364.90 million. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FRAC. The underwriters for the offering are Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Simmons, Houlihan Lokey, Guggenheim, Scotia Howard Well and Stephens. This is one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion services in the United States, with a focus on complex, technically demanding completion solutions. Its primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical fracturing, wireline perforation and logging and engineered solutions, as well as other value-added service offerings. With approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower spread across 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets and 23 wireline trucks located in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and other active oil and gas basins, Keane provides industry-leading completion services with a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. The company described its plan for the net proceeds as follows: We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fully repay our existing balance of approximately $99 million under our Existing Term Loan Facility (and, in addition, approximately $16 million of prepayment premium related to such repayment), repay approximately $50 million of our Notes and to pay fees and expenses related to this offering. We intend to use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.

Take Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock on a Bullish Test Drive View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), a Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent and the country’s second largest financial institution, reports fourth-quarter earnings Friday morning. The big question that awaits: Will BofA’s corporate confessional be enough to drive BAC stock even higher, or will the mega-bank miss expectations? Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr We’ll take a look at recent announcements from Bank of America, BAC’s stock chart and what the options market is suggesting to traders. Bank of America’s Earnings Picture Ahead of Bank of America’s Q4 earnings release, analysts are forecasting profits of 38 cents per share. Range estimates are from 35 cents to 42 cents. Wall Street expectations imply an increase of 35% in earnings growth over the year-ago period’s result of 28 cents and a sequential decline of 7.25%. Revenues are estimated to grow by 7% to $20.9 billion compared to 2015’s sales of $19.5 billion. Sequentially, BAC is forecast to decline modestly by 3%. Most recently, Credit Suisse chimed in on BAC stock and other financials such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) with a bullish stance. Unsurprisingly, they see an improving yield curve, GDP and more supportive regulatory environment as translating into upwardly-revised top and bottom-lines. Short-Term Trading Record for BAC Stock Bank of America has established a consistent pattern of beating Street profit views by topping estimates in 9 of its last 12 reports. Investor reaction has proven even stronger. Shares have gained immediately following earnings in five of the past six announcements. Working backwards from the most recent release, BAC has moved 0.31%, 3.32%, 2.57%, -1.54%, 0.79% and 3.22% on a close-to-close basis. The net reaction has produced an average gain of 2.19% in the first full session of trading. Variability of 2.02% based on a one-standard-deviation reading yields an estimated range of 0.02% to 4.21%. BAC’s seven-day stock performance has shown a similar net positive result 83% of the time. The average gain has been 3.29%, though a higher standard deviation of 5.69% sets up a bumpier range of -2.40% to 8.98%. BofA’s Stock Chart Click to Enlarge BAC stock has gained more than 100% since last February’s ignominious low of $10.99. And looking at the current price chart, it’s easy enough to establish that Bank of America is in fact in a bullish uptrend. What’s also apparent is an overbought condition in Bank of America shares. Weekly stochastics now are turning lower from extremes. The aggressive way in which BAC stock climbed to its current levels are typically exhaustive and lead to backing and filling.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is moving to the upside for the sixth straight session, climbing to a new record intraday high. Currently, the major averages are hovering in positive territory. The Dow is up 49.42 points or 0.3 percent at 19,936.80, the Nasdaq is up 29.02 points or 0.5 percent at 5,560.84 and the S&P 500 is up 7.80 points or 0.3 percent at 2,276.70. The strength on Wall Street partly reflects an extension of the upward momentum seen in the weeks following President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory. Traders seem optimistic Trump's proposed policies will bolster the economy and contribute to increased corporate profitability. Nonetheless, trading activity on the day is somewhat subdued as traders look ahead to reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also due to report their quarterly results later this week. Among individual stocks, shares of Pacific Continental (PCBK) have moved sharply higher after the regional bank agreed to be acquired by Columbia Banking System (COLB) for approximately $644.1 million. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is also posting a strong gain after announcing an agreement to sell its CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion in cash. Meanwhile, shares of WD-40 (WDFC) have come under pressure after the lubricant maker reported weaker than expected first quarter results. Sector News Steel stocks have shown a substantial move to the upside on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Steel Index up by 4.1 percent. With the jump, the index has reached its best intraday level in almost a month. Mechel (MTL), Olympic Steel (ZEUS), and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) are turning in some of the steel sector's best performances. Considerable strength is also visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 2.7 percent gain being posted by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. Alaska Air (ALK) is posting a standout gain. Gold, railroad, and banking stocks have also moved notably higher, contributing to the upward move by the broader markets. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index closed just above the unchanged line, the German DAX Index edged up by 0.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have shown a lack of direction following the strength seen in the previous session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.378 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 10, 2017: 12:03 PM ET Here is Obama's record on jobs If Donald Trump is lucky, he may never be faced with a market crash as gruesome as the one that welcomed President Barack Obama when he first took office in 2009. Stocks, which already had plunged in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis, continued to collapse in the first few weeks after Obama was inaugurated. The Dow plummeted 20% from mid-January to early March 2009. But as anyone who follows stocks closely knows, the market bottomed in March 2009 and has been off to the races ever since. With that in mind, it may be tough for stocks to enjoy nearly as explosive a rally under Trump in the next four (or eight) years as it has during Obama's tenure. The Dow has gone up more than 140% since Obama's inauguration in January 2009. If you look at how the Dow has done since it hit its low point on March 6, 2009, it's up 210%. If the Dow goes up 140% during the next eight years (yes, I am going to hypothetically assume that Trump winds up a two-term president for the purposes of this story) then it would be trading around 47,800. And if it goes up 210%? The Dow would be at about 61,500. 61,500. That seems unimaginable, doesn't it? Heck, 47,800 seems (say like Wallace Shawn in "The Princess Bride") inconceivable! But how did the Dow go from just around 6,450 at its low point eight years ago to the precipice of 20,000 today? Obama does deserve some, albeit not all, of the credit. The $787 billion economic stimulus package approved by Congress just a month after Obama became president helped get the economy (and market) back on track. However, the bank bailout (love it or hate it) that was put into place during the last few months of the George W. Bush administration also is largely responsible for stabilizing large banks, one of the primary culprits of the 2008 collapse. Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) have skyrocketed since the bailout and are not far from their record highs. Emergency programs put into place by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and early 2009 -- and the maintaining of historically low interest rates throughout Obama's tenure -- also played a role in stabilizing the markets. The dramatic rise of several big technology stocks in the past eight years has also helped propel the market higher. That may have little to do with Obama. Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) shares have surged more than 415% since he took office. Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) are up an astonishing 900%. And Facebook (FB, Tech30), which went public during the last few months of Obama's first term in 2012, is up 230% from its offering price. Does Obama deserve credit for the genius of the late Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg? Not really. All this goes to show that a President is partly (but not entirely) responsible for how well stocks do during their term. It's also worth noting that the market is not the same thing as the economy. The market may have set records over the past eight years, but the pace of the economic recovery remains frustratingly slow for many Americans -- and that helped fuel Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. But if earnings keep humming along under Trump and economic growth picks up thanks to plans to boost infrastructure spending and other stimulus, then maybe the Dow will be above 45,000 (or even 60,000) by the time he's leaving the White House. After all, consider that the Dow went up more than 130% during Ronald Reagan's two terms. And it rose more than 225% during Bill Clinton's eight years in office. Economic growth was higher during the Reagan and Clinton years than it has been under Obama. Of course, there is another recent two-term president that didn't enjoy a big rally. Stocks plunged under George W. Bush -- in large part due to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the Great Recession. But if GDP growth accelerates under Trump, then the market could wind up climbing, just as it did for many of his predecessors. A stronger economy should be good news for construction giant (and Dow component) Caterpillar (CAT) -- which has already popped on stimulus hopes. It would also benefit many other cyclical Dow companies like retailers Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) and other brand name consumer firms such as Coca-Cola (KO) and Disney (DIS). So scoff if you want at the notion that the Dow could hit gaudy targets like 45,000 or 60,000 within the next few years. But just remember that it seemed equally laughable for the Dow to pass round number milestones like 2,000, 10,000 and 15,000 under Reagan, Clinton and Obama. Yet they did.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jan 10, 2017 at 12:01PM It's been a busy week for owners of Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock -- and it's only Tuesday. As explained in a series of reports from TheFly.com, Illumina appeared at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference yesterday, where it announced: New guidance indicating that it will report $619 million in sales for Q4 2016 (analysts are still looking for $610 million) The launch of a "single-cell" gene sequencing solution in cooperation with Bio-Rad Labs (NYSE:BIO) A new partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to integrate IBM's Watson artificial intelligence supercomputer with Illumina's own BaseSpace Sequence Hub and tumor sequencing process A separate partnership with Phillips (NYSE:PHG) aimed at large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function A new NovaSeq Series scalable sequencing architecture, to replace its HiSeq architecture dating from 2010, which the company predicts will "one day" permit gene sequencing for just $100 Big news on several fronts. Today, Illumina is reaping its reward in the form of a series of price target hikes from the likes of Leerink and Piper Jaffray -- and scoring a big upgrade to "buy" from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Here are three things you need to know. Gattaca: For Illumina, it's more than a movie; it's a business model. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Up 15% -- and heading higher? Illumina stock is already up 15% today on the news, but according to Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit, it could be headed higher. Priced at $163 after today's surge in stock price, Merrill thinks Illumina stock won't stop running before it hits $175 a share -- a gain of 7% more. Of course, even if Merrill Lynch is right, this means that two-thirds of the potential gains have already been priced into Illumina's stock. 2. Is it too late to buy? Once that realization sinks in, many investors may decide that even if Merrill Lynch is right, it is now too late to buy Illumina stock. In fact, Leerink seems to have already come to this conclusion. As TheFly reports, Illumina is planning to sell its new sequencers for anywhere from $850,000 to $985,000 per unit, with shipments to begin in March. But while Leerink praises the introduction of NovaSeq as "meaningful," the analyst also warns that the gene sequencing market is still oversupplied with more machines than its end users can absorb. Leerink grudgingly raised its price target back to $132 this morning (the analyst had just finished cutting its price target less than a month ago), but even so, with Illumina stock selling for nearly $164 a share already, Leerink sees little prospect for further gains in share price -- rather, the opposite. 3. Even Merrill may have second thoughts For that matter, I wouldn't be too awfully surprised if even Merrill Lynch begins rethinking its endorsement of Illumina stock in rather short order -- given how quickly the market has already reacted to its upgrade, and to Illumina's own announcements. Yes, the partnerships with Phillips, IBM, and Bio-Rad are important. Yes, the introduction of new products is also a revenue driver. But as Merrill explains in a write-up (reported on StreetInsider.com this morning), Illumina's real prize is the oncology market, and Merrill doesn't see NovaSeq as cracking that open for Illumina just yet. Ultimately, Merrill would love to see cancer doctors using Illumina's products, and the gene sequencing data they provide, to treat individual cancer patients. But in the meantime, Merrill will be satisfied if the company simply grows its revenue through "the increasing prevalence of precision medicine and use of sequencing by pharmaceutical companies, large scale population studies (including GRAIL), and an emphasis on bioinformatics." The most important thing: Valuation So what kind of growth rates are we looking at here? According to estimates posted on S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts still see Illumina growing at no more than 10% annualized over the next five years, and earning $3.27 per share this year, and perhaps $3.77 the year after that. Those are nice numbers to be sure -- but they still leave Illumina stock trading for a current-year price-to-earnings ratio of 50, which seems a bit pricey for a stock growing at 10%. Meanwhile, the $619 million revenue estimate that Illumina provided yesterday, while ahead of estimates, still works out to a growth rate of only 5% when compared to Q4 2015 revenue, so even the 10% growth rate isn't set in stone. Long story short? Illumina has a great story. It's a story that's getting a lot of investors -- and analysts -- excited. But at these prices, maybe it's time they all curbed their enthusiasm a bit.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 10, 2017 11:38am   Comments Share: Related SRPT For Sarepta, Today's Good News Might Be Just The Beginning A Possible Short Squeeze Also Pushes Sarepta Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRPT) spiked higher by more than 24 percent Tuesday. The catalyst for the move appears to be the company's 10:30 a.m. presentation at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, followed by an encouraging report by TheStreet's Adam Feuerstein. As noted by Feuerstein, Sarepta said its recently approved therapy for the treatment of boys suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) saw sales of $5.4 million in the fourth quarter, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations of $4.9 million. The therapy, marketed as Exondys 51, achieved good sales in the quarter and should put to rest the worst-case fear of insurance reimbursement denials — an overhang that plagued the stock as of late. Feuerstein said Sarepta released a second key metric, which will further alleviate investor concerns: The number of boys who have started the process required to receive insurance reimbursement is 250 to date. There is no consensus among Wall Street analysts as to how many boys will be receiving Exondys 51 moving forward, but 250 within the first three months is in line with comparable orphan drug commercial launches. Feuerstein noted that if all 250 patients secure insurance coverage at a cost of $300,000 to $500,000 per year, than Sarepta will record sales rate of $75 million to $125 million. "That's a very rough forecast for Exondys 51 sales, particularly absent the actual rate of reimbursement approvals or denials, but it compares reasonably well to the current analyst consensus estimate of $138 million for 2017, according to Factset," Feuerstein wrote. Finally, Sarepta suggested that the clinical review of its drug in Europe will likely take between 12 to 15 months to complete. If approved, the company will likely reach a settlement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRN) related to intellectual property rights which will pave the way for the therapy's European launch.

The major averages have all moved to the upside, although buying interest has remained subdued. Currently, the major averages are holding above the unchanged line. The Dow is up 19.98 points or 0.1 percent at 19,907.36, the Nasdaq is up 12.08 points or 0.2 percent at 5,543.90 and the S&P 500 is up 3.37 points or 0.2 percent at 2,272.27. With the modest move to the upside on the day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq managed to reach a new record intraday high. Nonetheless, traders seem somewhat reluctant to make more significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets. Traders may also be looking ahead to reports on producer prices and retail sales as well as earnings news from financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC). Steel stocks have shown a substantial move to the upside, however with the NYSE Arca Steel Index surging up by 3.9 percent. With the advance, the index has reached its best intraday level in almost a month. Considerable strength is also visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 2.2 percent gain being posted by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. Railroad and gold stocks are also seeing notable strength, while most of the other major sectors are showing more modest moves. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.6 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are up by 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have shown a lack of direction following the strength seen in the previous session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 2.374 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

The ex-traders — Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan; Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup; and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, are facing charges in a New York federal court, according to news reports.  In May 2015, JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate currency prices and agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. ADVERTISEMENT From 2007 to 2013, the traders were part of a group that aimed to skew the exchange rates to increase their profits.    View the discussion thread.

Stocks, which already had plunged in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis, continued to collapse in the first few weeks after Obama was inaugurated. The Dow plummeted 20% from mid-January to early March 2009. But as anyone who follows stocks closely knows, the market bottomed in March 2009 and has been off to the races ever since. With that in mind, it may be tough for stocks to enjoy nearly as explosive a rally under Trump in the next four (or eight) years as it has during Obama’s tenure. The Dow has gone up more than 140% since Obama’s inauguration in January 2009. If you look at how the Dow has done since it hit its low point on March 6, 2009, it’s up 210%. If the Dow goes up 140% during the next eight years (yes, I am going to hypothetically assume that Trump winds up a two-term president for the purposes of this story) then it would be trading around 47,800. And if it goes up 210%? The Dow would be at about 61,500. 61,500. That seems unimaginable, doesn’t it? Heck, 47,800 seems (say like Wallace Shawn in “The Princess Bride”) inconceivable! But how did the Dow go from just around 6,450 at its low point eight years ago to the precipice of 20,000 today? Obama does deserve some, albeit not all, of the credit. The $787 billion economic stimulus package approved by Congress just a month after Obama became president helped get the economy (and market) back on track. However, the bank bailout (love it or hate it) that was put into place during the last few months of the George W. Bush administration also is largely responsible for stabilizing large banks, one of the primary culprits of the 2008 collapse. Dow components JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have skyrocketed since the bailout and are not far from their record highs. Emergency programs put into place by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and early 2009 — and the maintaining of historically low interest rates throughout Obama’s tenure — also played a role in stabilizing the markets. The dramatic rise of several big technology stocks in the past eight years has also helped propel the market higher. That may have little to do with Obama. Apple’s shares have surged more than 415% since he took office. Amazon’s are up an astonishing 900%. And Facebook, which went public during the last few months of Obama’s first term in 2012, is up 230% from its offering price. Does Obama deserve credit for the genius of the late Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg? Not really. All this goes to show that a President is partly (but not entirely) responsible for how well stocks do during their term. It’s also worth noting that the market is not the same thing as the economy. The market may have set records over the past eight years, but the pace of the economic recovery remains frustratingly slow for many Americans — and that helped fuel Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. But if earnings keep humming along under Trump and economic growth picks up thanks to plans to boost infrastructure spending and other stimulus, then maybe the Dow will be above 45,000 (or even 60,000) by the time he’s leaving the White House. After all, consider that the Dow went up more than 130% during Ronald Reagan’s two terms. And it rose more than 225% during Bill Clinton’s eight years in office. Economic growth was higher during the Reagan and Clinton years than it has been under Obama. Of course, there is another recent two-term president that didn’t enjoy a big rally. Stocks plunged under George W. Bush — in large part to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the Great Recession. But if GDP growth accelerates under Trump, then the market could wind up climbing, just as it did for many of his predecessors. A stronger economy should be good news for construction giant (and Dow component) Caterpillar — which has already popped on stimulus hopes. It would also benefit many other cyclical Dow companies like retailers Walmart and Home Depot and other brand name consumer firms such as Coca-Cola and Disney. So scoff if you want at the notion that the Dow could hit gaudy targets like 45,000 or 60,000 within the next few years. But just remember that it seemed equally laughable for the Dow to pass round number milestones like 2,000, 10,000 and 15,000 under Reagan, Clinton and Obama. Yet they did.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan with conspiring to restrain trade. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion some of the biggest banks in the world have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton participated with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called "The Cartel" to suppress competition in the foreign currency exchange spot market. Usher, JPMorgan's former chief currency trader, and Ramchandani, Citigroup's ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays' former global head of spot trading, was a trader at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. The U.S. charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticized the Justice Department's decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. "The UK authorities looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that there were no offences, and we continue to believe that Mr. Usher has done nothing wrong," said Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer for Usher. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. "It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offense," Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. To date, three other individuals have faced U.S. charges stemming from the foreign exchange probe. Last week, a former trader at Barclays and BNP Paribas SA , Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe. In July, an HSBC Holdings Plc executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Usher et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-19.

The deal is the latest episode in Italy's long battle to clean up its banking system, however, it could dent confidence even further. Banco Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, two banks rescued by the Italian bailout fund Atlante, have offered shareholders more than 600 million euros ($634.92 million). Although shareholders have yet to approve the deal, the banks would "re-pay shares at a pre-defined value in next few months, avoiding the risk of uncertain evolution of huge claims by shareholders and clients," Maria Paola Toschi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC on Tuesday via email. Last October, the European Central Bank demanded both banks cut their bad loans valued at 17 billion euros. The ECB declined to comment on this subject. According to Toschi, both banks may need to raise about 2.5 billion euros in fresh capital. "This situation is a big obstacle for recreating interest for new shareholders to invest and underwrite capital increases. Investors are not willing to put in money due to the uncertainty on the eventual impact of these claims in terms of costs and losses on profits and on the net worth," Toschi added. This has been a recurrent theme when trying to improve the state of the Italian banking system. Recently, the Italian government had to step in to help the oldest lender in the world –Monte dei Paschi di Siena – after the Italian bank failed to attract enough private capital to boost its balance sheet. The Italian banking system has been a problem for the third-largest euro zone economy since the financial crisis due to the high level of bad loans across all institutions. Several attempts to deal with each one of them have also affected customers' confidence on the system. In the cases of Banco Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca local clients withdrew money, leading to deposits plunging by 30 percent, Toschi told CNBC. "These two small banks are not the next big problem. They are the latest symptoms of the slow-burning non-performing loan crisis that Italy will have to tackle," Erik Jones, professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC via email. According to the International Monetary Fund, Italy's non-performing loans represent 18 percent of loans, one of the highest in the euro area. Furthermore, the ongoing problems with the banking system are set to continue impacting the political scene. Italy is being governed by an interim government after the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and is expected to hold elections this year. Further issues with the banks and potential big losses for shareholders could spark further support for anti-establishment and anti-euro parties. "This all depends upon how much more pain the shareholders of the bank are willing to take. I am sure it will generate significant complaints," Jones added.

Traders may remain reluctant to make significant moves after the strength seen on Wall Street in the weeks following President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have reached new record highs in recent sessions, while the Dow has encountered resistance around the 20,000 level. A relatively quiet day on the U.S. economic front may also keep some traders ahead on the sidelines ahead of the release of closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Stocks turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday following the strength seen in the previous week. While the Dow and the S&P 500 slid into negative territory, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted a modest gain. The Nasdaq edged up 10.76 points or 0.2 percent to 5,531.82, while the Dow dropped by 76.42 points or 0.4 percent to 19,887.38 and the S&P 500 fell by 8.08 points or 0.4 percent to 2,268.90. The mixed performance on Wall Street came after last week's gains lifted the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record highs. The Dow also flirted with the 20,000 level last Friday but was unable to break through the key psychological level. A lack of major U.S. economic data kept some traders on the sidelines, although reports on producer prices and retail sales are scheduled to be released on Friday. Additionally, financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are due to report their quarterly results this week. Energy stocks showed a notable move to the downside on the day amid a sharp drop in the price of crude oil. Reflecting the weakness in the energy sector, the NYSE Arca Natural gas Index tumbled by 2.4 percent, while the Philadelphia Oil Service Index slumped by 1.7 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index slide by 1.4 percent. Railroad and utilities stocks also saw considerable weakness, with the Dow Jones Railroads Index and the Dow Jones Utilities Average both falling by 1.3. On the other hand, semiconductor stocks saw significant strength on the day, resulting in a 1.1 advance by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) posted a standout gain. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are inching up $0.10 to $52.06 a barrel after tumbling $2.03 to $51.96 a barrel on Monday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,182.80 an ounce, down $2.10 from the previous session's close of $1,184.90 an ounce. On Monday, gold climbed $11.50. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 116.19 yen compared to the 116.03 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0570 compared to yesterday's $1.0574. Asia Asian stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as oil prices steadied following steep overnight losses and the dollar remained broadly weaker despite worries over the likelihood of a "hard Brexit" and the prospect of more rate hikes in the U.S. this year. China's Shanghai Composite Index shed 9.56 points or 0.30 percent to finish at 3,161.67 as investors booked some profits after recent sharp gains on hopes of reforms in state-owned enterprises. Mixed inflation data also dented investor sentiment. Chinese consumer prices rose an annual 2.1 percent in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said, coming in below expectations for a 2.2 percent increase. Producer prices jumped 5.5 percent from a year earlier versus expectations for a 4.6 percent advance. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 186.16 points or 0.83 percent to 22,744.85, extending gains for a fourth consecutive session. Japanese shares lost ground as traders returned to their desks after a holiday on Monday. The Nikkei 225 Index fell 152.89 points or 0.79 percent to 19,301.44 as the dollar weakened for a second day to drift further away from a multi-year high reached at the beginning of 2017. The broader Topix index closed 0.71 percent lower at 1,542.31. Automaker Toyota Motor lost 1 percent after saying it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Takeda Pharmaceutical closed marginally higher after it agreed to acquire cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) in a $5.2 billion deal. Investors ignored survey data from the Cabinet Office showing that Japan's consumer confidence index rose more than expected to hit the highest level in more than three years in December. Australian shares fell sharply after five straight days of gains, as oil prices tumbled on doubts over the effectiveness of OPEC's agreed supply cuts and official data showed retail sales in the country rose less than expected last month. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 46.70 points or 0.80 percent to 5,760.70, while the broader All Ordinaries Index closed 44.70 points or 0.76 percent lower at 5,813. Primary Health Care slumped 4.8 percent after revelations its chief executive Peter Gregg will face court over allegations relating to his tenure as an executive of Leighton Holdings. Europe The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is just below the unchanged line, the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.3 percent. Total SA rose and Tullow Oil fell after the companies entered into a package agreement under which Total will acquire an additional 21.57 percent interest from Tullow in the Uganda Lake Albert oil project. Carbon products maker SGL Carbon came under pressure after it agreed to sell its carbon fiber production site in Evanston. L'Oréal has edged lower as the French cosmetics group announced a definitive agreement with Valeant to acquire the skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and Ambi for a cash purchase price of $1.3 billion. WM Morrison Supermarkets climbed in London as the supermarket operator raised its profit guidance after delivering its strongest holiday performance in seven years. U.S. Economic Reports At 10 am ET, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its report on wholesale inventories in the month of November. Economists expect wholesale inventories to climb by 0.9 percent in November following a 0.4 percent drop in October. The Treasury Department is also scheduled to release the results of its auction of $24 billion worth of three-year notes at 1 pm ET. Stocks in Focus Shares of WD-40 (WDFC) may come under pressure after the lubricant maker reported weaker than expected first quarter results. Rent-to-own operator Rent-A-Center (RCII) announced the resignation of Robert D. Davis as Chief Executive Officer and director, effective immediately. Meanwhile, shares of Barracuda Networks (CUDA) are likely to see early strength after the cybersecurity company reported third quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) may also move to the upside after announcing an agreement to sell its CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion in cash. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

Posted 10 Jan 2017 21:10 Updated 11 Jan 2017 08:30 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 9, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: The S&P 500 ended the day unchanged on Tuesday as lower oil prices hurt energy stocks, offsetting advances in healthcare and financial sectors, while the Nasdaq ended at another record high. The Dow's 20,000 milestone remained elusive as it was weighed down by declines in IBM , Merck & Co , Exxon Mobil and Procter & Gamble . Traders were holding fire ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season and the Jan. 20 inauguration after which they expect a better sense as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will fulfill campaign promises of fiscal stimulus, lower tax and lighter regulation. "Investors are now waiting for the inauguration and the first 100-day agenda," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at brokerage Convergex in New York. "They just want a little more information about what the new administration is planning before the Dow takes the plunge over 20,000. There's a lot of high expectations about what happens after January 20." The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 31.85 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,855.53, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.00 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,551.82. The S&P Energy sector ended down 0.95 percent as oil futures fell 2 percent on doubts about output cuts. Following a 9 percent jump in the S&P since Nov. 4, investors will also monitor earnings season, which starts this week, to assess if the record levels are justified. "We've shifted from that exuberance post the election and the rotation into some of the sectors and now we are entering a wait-and-see mode with earnings knocking at the front door," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in News York. "Earnings may be the pivot to move things higher." S&P 500 companies are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by financials, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P financial sector , which has risen 17.4 percent since the election, closed up 0.4 percent. Bank of America , Wells Fargo and JPMorgan - scheduled to report results on Friday - were its biggest drivers on Tuesday with 1.7 percent, 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent rises respectively. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher. S&P Healthcare stocks gained 0.33 percent and the Nasdaq biotech index ended 0.8 percent higher, both enjoying their sixth session of gains in a row. Illumina surged 16.6 percent to US$165.04 after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 18 new lows.

The Dow's 20,000 milestone remained elusive as it was weighed down by declines in IBM (IBM.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Traders were holding fire ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season and the Jan. 20 inauguration after which they expect a better sense as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will fulfill campaign promises of fiscal stimulus, lower tax and lighter regulation. "Investors are now waiting for the inauguration and the first 100-day agenda," said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at brokerage Convergex in New York. "They just want a little more information about what the new administration is planning before the Dow takes the plunge over 20,000. There's a lot of high expectations about what happens after January 20." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 31.85 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,855.53, the S&P 500 .SPX was unchanged at 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.00 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,551.82. The S&P Energy sector .SPNY ended down 0.95 percent as oil futures fell 2 percent on doubts about output cuts. Following a 9 percent jump in the S&P since Nov. 4, investors will also monitor earnings season, which starts this week, to assess if the record levels are justified. "We've shifted from that exuberance post the election and the rotation into some of the sectors and now we are entering a wait-and-see mode with earnings knocking at the front door," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in News York. "Earnings may be the pivot to move things higher." S&P 500 companies are set to post their strongest quarterly growth in three years, with earnings estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by financials, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P financial sector .SPSY, which has risen 17.4 percent since the election, closed up 0.4 percent. Bank of America (BAC.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) - scheduled to report results on Friday - were its biggest drivers on Tuesday with 1.7 percent, 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent rises respectively. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher. S&P Healthcare stocks .SPXHC gained 0.33 percent and the Nasdaq biotech index .NBI ended 0.8 percent higher, both enjoying their sixth session of gains in a row. Illumina (ILMN.O) surged 16.6 percent to $165.04 after the diagnostics company gave a strong quarterly forecast and launched a new product. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 18 new lows. More than 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

A number of bank stock analysts have worked through broad tax proposals by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump and estimate that a new tax law could increase Citigroup earnings per share only half as much as some rivals. At the same time, Citigroup may have to slash $4 billion or more of the value of an unusually large income tax asset that the bank holds as a result of losses it suffered during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. "If the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, they will still benefit, just benefit less," said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. The differences between Citigroup and its competitors highlight how corporations have different interests in the details of a new tax law, such as how foreign income is treated and how bank business customers might be favored less than individuals. The blueprint for tax reform put forward by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives calls for reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has proposed 15 percent. Banks are expected to benefit more from corporate tax cuts than other industries as they tend to pay more taxes as a result of receiving fewer investment credits and deductions, such as those available for oil and gas exploration. Tax cuts could be the icing on the cake for banks as they look forward to higher profits in the coming year. They are already benefiting from higher U.S. interest rates, and lighter regulation under the Trump administration could allow Wall Street banks to re-enter risky but potentially profitable trading business. EARNINGS LIFT The impact of a new tax law is among the topics likely to come up this Friday when JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, the three biggest U.S. banks by assets, report quarterly results. Citigroup reports the following Wednesday, Jan. 18. The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. "There's nothing they can do other than explain it," said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan. MORE MONEY FOR DIVIDENDS More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts' estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. "The devil is in the details," said Goldberg. "There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out."

Jan 10, 2017 - 09:59 Banking executives in Singapore say their smaller businesses have a local advantage(Keystone) The natural optimism of the seasoned Asian private banker has been hard to dent. It has withstood the implosion of BSI in Singapore, the private banking operation found culpable of anti-money laundering failings, and the continuing problem that Asia has the some of the lowest private banking margins in the world – a factor in the withdrawal of some banks from the region. In fact, ABN Amro’s recent sale of its business to LGT Bank has been spun into a benefit by some rivals. One less competitor for a market that bearish analysts describe as one of the most overbanked in the world – but also undoubtedly home to some of the deepest pockets among the new generation of Asian super-rich that may require private banking help in the future. “There’s opportunity as others exit,” says Julius Baer’s head of Greater China private banking David Shick. “There’s less pressure on the cost side.” Shick, one of the less effusive among his Asian private banking peers in Singapore and Hong Kong, admits that margin compression has been “quite severe” and that “each year the competition is getting more intense”. But he also says those competitive forces also mean that western banks have the conditions to thrive given “the size and scale to play in this market”. Julius Baer has $75 billion (CHF76 billion) of assets under management (AUM) in APAC, which makes it the region’s fifth-largest private bank, according to the latest rankings from Asian Private Banker. Fellow Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse, Asia’s largest and third-largest wealth managers respectively, also believe size will be an advantage. When Credit Suisse slashed its overall profit targets for Asia Pacific at a recent investor day, the original targets for APAC wealth management were kept in place. UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, is hiring aggressively, and particularly in China, where the bank has vowed to double its overall headcount between 2016 and 2021. “Everything we see in Asia is that the strategy we are driving is working and accelerating,” said Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam last month at an investor day, explaining why he still believed his bank can more than double its APAC wealth management pre-tax profits between 2015 and 2018. Credit Suisse’s strategy is founded on a belief that an explosion in Asian wealth over the coming years will deliver a boon for private banks, particularly large ones that can link their clients to global networks and investment banking services. Selling point Similar sentiments are shared among the big US banks with smaller Asian operations, where executives insist they can also find opportunities in a crowded market. The Wall Street giants cannot rely on the brand recognition that helps win them business in Europe and the US – one banker recalls a meeting with a Chinese billionaire who had never heard of Goldman Sachs – but they have another big selling point. Andrew Cohen, JPMorgan’s head of international private banking, says balance sheet is “critical” for the bank’s Asian business, adding that the fastest growth came from clients “monetising an asset” with its help or dealing with new “situational needs” in fast changing market conditions. JPMorgan is the ninth-largest investment bank in Asia with $65 billion of AUM. Citigroup also uses its large balance sheet to support lending at its private bank in Asia, which is the second-biggest after UBS. The Asian banks may not have the same sort of global scale, but executives at Singapore’s UOB and Bank of Singapore say that their much smaller businesses have a local advantage. “We have a huge franchise in Asia, so we understand the Asian businessman very well,” says Yeng Fang Ong, head of UOB private bank, which has an AUM of about S$30 billion (CHF21 billion). “The bank was founded 80 years ago. A lot of the clients – the first generation – have been with us since then. The bank and the clients grew together.” Bank of Singapore chief executive Bahren Shaari says that knowing the market better also helps Asian banks avoid costly compliance failings. With diverse national markets, Asia has become a compliance headache for banks expected to know the source of client funds. An EY survey in 2016 found that 39% of firms in the region said compliance was the main focus of their strategic budget, far higher than the 11% of Europeans and 9% of North American firms that ranked compliance as the top priority. “If you have not seen things in life, if you have not known clients over the years . . . [how can] you know who you can believe and what you need to check further,” says Shaari. “You need people who are here, not only here as in being sent over here, but people who built up their careers here. So they understand the dynamics of Indonesia or China.” Profit margins Ong stresses that European banks are not her “direct competitors” because it is common for clients to have relationships with both European banks and Asian ones. EY found that APAC had the highest percentage of clients with relationships at more than five wealth management firms. Fifteen per cent of private banking clients in the region dealt with more than five banks, and 29% of APAC’s very richest clients had relationships with more than five. But this also has a negative impact on profitability. While ensuring that everyone gets a slice of the pie, Asian clients’ tendency to bank with several institutions is one of the reasons that the market’s margins are so low. Pre-tax profit margins in Asia-Pacific private banking are 21 basis points of assets under management – compared with 25-26 basis points in Europe, according to research from the Boston Consulting Group. This means that every $100 million of client funds generates pre-tax profits of $210,0000 in Asia, but between $250,000 and $260,000 in Europe. It is little surprise that EY found Asian private banking was ripe for further consolidation. Julius Baer’s Shick says that the retreat of ABN Amro from Asian private banking was “just the start”. He predicts three or four rivals will follow in the next five years. Shick believes that once consolidation happens, the tide will turn on the sector’s profitability. Until then, Asian private bankers will have to keep the faith. Luckily, they’re good at that.

Private banks eye Asia’s new super-rich

Financial News HomeNewsViewPeopleBrexit Search Profile News Ex-Barclays ECM boss: Problems of yesteryear still persist Julian Macedo, now running his own advisory firm, says there will be limited opportunities in Europe to get IPOs to market Julian Macedo, founder of advisory firm The ECM Team FN Library By Tim Burke 10 Jan. 2017 11:04 a.m. GMT A former equity capital markets head at Barclays who went solo last year is predicting the tough times for new issuance in Europe will continue this year. Julian Macedo, founder of advisory firm The ECM Team, published his thoughts on 2017 in a blog on his website on January 9. “Life in 2016 wasn’t pretty,” he wrote. “And the problems of those 12 months haven’t gone away.” The value of initial public offerings, follow-on fundraisings and convertible deals in Europe stood at just shy of $163 billion in 2016 - the lowest annual total since the $134.8 billion raised in 2012, according to data provider Dealogic. Meanwhile, the number of IPOs on London’s main and junior markets also hit a four-year low. Macedo wrote: “Just to be level with 2015, ECM issuance in Emea in 2017 will need to increase by a shocking 60% versus 2016.” That will probably prove difficult. Viswas Raghavan, JP Morgan’s head of banking for Emea, told FN in early January that the fee pool for banks was unlikely to grow in the near term. And Macedo said that a typical eight-week IPO process - covering “usual transaction constraints” as well as the necessary recovery period after a spell of market volatility - mean there will be few windows in which to launch deals between upcoming events such as European elections. “The crowded European political calendar doesn’t leave much room to get deals done, if every event is a Trump/Brexit-style upset,” Macedo wrote. “Worst case, watch out for the future of the EU coming into play. Although as always, be ready to hit the launch button immediately if the outcome is positive.” However, Macedo offered a crumb of hope for ECM bankers: “Throughout the last two decades, tough market conditions did not mean that equity new issues didn’t take place. There have always been periods of stability in investor sentiment which create the right opportunity. Healthy greed by investors will maintain the desire to own companies with credible, secular cash flow or growth stories. Those issuers which are first to market in each window will capture the attention of investors.” Macedo established The ECM Team in November to advise companies on ECM deals. He had spent five years at Barclays, where he was co-head of ECM for central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, leaving in February 2016. In earlier jobs he had worked at Deutsche Bank, where he was head of Iberian ECM, Lazard and Robert Fleming.

The lira lost 1.6 percent to hit 3.77 against the dollar, having weakened 6.8 percent since the start of the year. It also passed 4 to the euro for the first time on Tuesday, with a deputy prime minister saying the economy was being targeted by "sabotage and attacks". Turkey's large external borrowing requirement makes the lira one of the most vulnerable currencies to tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Economic growth has remained sluggish and inflation is rising, yet the central bank is under pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan not to hike interest rates. "Nobody wants to be the last one in there and everyone is running for the door. There are no signs from the authorities that they are taking it seriously," said Jakob Christensen, head of EM research at Danske Bank. A series of gun and bomb attacks have heightened security concerns. On Tuesday the Turkish parliament voted to press on with a debate about constitutional reform to strengthen the powers of President Tayyip Erdogan. Christensen said the risk of further attacks was undermining the tourist sector, which is vital for the economy and balance of payments. Turkish five-year credit default swaps rose four bps to 288 bps according to Markit data, a one-month high, and the yield premium paid by Turkish sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out 4 bps to 377 bps. Away from Turkey, MSCI's emerging equity index rose 0.5 percent and other emerging assets also gained as the dollar's rise paused before U.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's Wednesday news conference. He is expected to reveal details of a promised fiscal expansion which many reckon will benefit emerging markets. There were also signs of further improvement in China's industrial sector, with producer price inflation surging to a five-year high. Hong Kong stocks gained 0.8 percent but Chinese mainland shares slipped 0.2 percent . The onshore yuan firmed 0.2 percent and overnight borrowing costs for the offshore yuan eased to 6.82 percent from 14.05 percent a day earlier as authorities relaxed their grip on the market. "Recent restrictions may have helped to contain flows and supported last week's rally, but more outflows, albeit at reduced volumes, are likely over the coming months," Susan Joho, an economist at Julius Baer, said in a note. The rouble firmed 0.3 percent after oil prices steadied following big losses on Monday. Czech crown forwards tested record highs after annual inflation reached 2 percent for the first time since 2012, opening the door for the central bank to abandon the weak crown policy it has been following since 2013. In the new issuance market, action is picking up. Petrobras placed a $4 billion bond on Monday that attracted bids of over $20 billion. A number of other Latin American issuers have embarked on roadshows and Middle East mandates are also being announced, with Egypt planning a roadshow next week.

It has withstood the implosion of BSI in Singapore, the private banking operation found culpable of anti-money laundering failings, and the continuing problem that Asia has the some of the lowest private banking margins in the world – a factor in the withdrawal of some banks from the region. In fact, ABN Amro’s recent sale of its business to LGT Bank has been spun into a benefit by some rivals. One less competitor for a market that bearish analysts describe as one of the most overbanked in the world – but also undoubtedly home to some of the deepest pockets among the new generation of Asian super-rich that may require private banking help in the future. “There’s opportunity as others exit,” says Julius Baer’s head of Greater China private banking David Shick. “There’s less pressure on the cost side.” Shick, one of the less effusive among his Asian private banking peers in Singapore and Hong Kong, admits that margin compression has been “quite severe” and that “each year the competition is getting more intense”. But he also says those competitive forces also mean that western banks have the conditions to thrive given “the size and scale to play in this market”. Julius Baer has $75 billion (CHF76 billion) of assets under management (AUM) in APAC, which makes it the region’s fifth-largest private bank, according to the latest rankings from Asian Private Banker. Fellow Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse, Asia’s largest and third-largest wealth managers respectively, also believe size will be an advantage. When Credit Suisse slashed its overall profit targets for Asia Pacific at a recent investor day, the original targets for APAC wealth management were kept in place. UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, is hiring aggressively, and particularly in China, where the bank has vowed to double its overall headcount between 2016 and 2021. “Everything we see in Asia is that the strategy we are driving is working and accelerating,” said Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam last month at an investor day, explaining why he still believed his bank can more than double its APAC wealth management pre-tax profits between 2015 and 2018. Credit Suisse’s strategy is founded on a belief that an explosion in Asian wealth over the coming years will deliver a boon for private banks, particularly large ones that can link their clients to global networks and investment banking services. Selling point Similar sentiments are shared among the big US banks with smaller Asian operations, where executives insist they can also find opportunities in a crowded market. The Wall Street giants cannot rely on the brand recognition that helps win them business in Europe and the US – one banker recalls a meeting with a Chinese billionaire who had never heard of Goldman Sachs – but they have another big selling point. Andrew Cohen, JPMorgan’s head of international private banking, says balance sheet is “critical” for the bank’s Asian business, adding that the fastest growth came from clients “monetising an asset” with its help or dealing with new “situational needs” in fast changing market conditions. JPMorgan is the ninth-largest investment bank in Asia with $65 billion of AUM. Citigroup also uses its large balance sheet to support lending at its private bank in Asia, which is the second-biggest after UBS. The Asian banks may not have the same sort of global scale, but executives at Singapore’s UOB and Bank of Singapore say that their much smaller businesses have a local advantage. “We have a huge franchise in Asia, so we understand the Asian businessman very well,” says Yeng Fang Ong, head of UOB private bank, which has an AUM of about S$30 billion (CHF21 billion). “The bank was founded 80 years ago. A lot of the clients – the first generation – have been with us since then. The bank and the clients grew together.” Bank of Singapore chief executive Bahren Shaari says that knowing the market better also helps Asian banks avoid costly compliance failings. With diverse national markets, Asia has become a compliance headache for banks expected to know the source of client funds. An EY survey in 2016 found that 39% of firms in the region said compliance was the main focus of their strategic budget, far higher than the 11% of Europeans and 9% of North American firms that ranked compliance as the top priority. “If you have not seen things in life, if you have not known clients over the years . . . [how can] you know who you can believe and what you need to check further,” says Shaari. “You need people who are here, not only here as in being sent over here, but people who built up their careers here. So they understand the dynamics of Indonesia or China.” Profit margins Ong stresses that European banks are not her “direct competitors” because it is common for clients to have relationships with both European banks and Asian ones. EY found that APAC had the highest percentage of clients with relationships at more than five wealth management firms. Fifteen per cent of private banking clients in the region dealt with more than five banks, and 29% of APAC’s very richest clients had relationships with more than five. But this also has a negative impact on profitability. While ensuring that everyone gets a slice of the pie, Asian clients’ tendency to bank with several institutions is one of the reasons that the market’s margins are so low. Pre-tax profit margins in Asia-Pacific private banking are 21 basis points of assets under management – compared with 25-26 basis points in Europe, according to research from the Boston Consulting Group. This means that every $100 million of client funds generates pre-tax profits of $210,0000 in Asia, but between $250,000 and $260,000 in Europe. It is little surprise that EY found Asian private banking was ripe for further consolidation. Julius Baer’s Shick says that the retreat of ABN Amro from Asian private banking was “just the start”. He predicts three or four rivals will follow in the next five years. Shick believes that once consolidation happens, the tide will turn on the sector’s profitability. Until then, Asian private bankers will have to keep the faith. Luckily, they’re good at that.

The A-Z of investments in 2016 JSE can benefit from curb in Zuma's power - money managers   Francisco - Moderna Therapeutics, one of the best-funded private biotechnology companies in the US, unveiled its long-secret research and development pipeline on Monday, including experimental vaccines, cancer treatments and a cardiovascular therapy. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based start-up has about $1.3bn in cash on hand from investors, pharmaceutical partners and government grants, according to a presentation on Monday at the JP Morgan Chase & Company. Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. It’s privately valued at about $5bn, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter wasn’t public. Moderna’s treatments are based around the idea of using genetic instructions to turn a patient’s own cells into miniature drug making factories. Given by injection or intravenously, the therapies encode fragments of genetic instruction using what’s known as messenger RNA. That code then instructs cells to make proteins to fight a disease or infection. Part of investors’ interest is the potential at Moderna and companies like it to create a whole new industry of drugs using the techniques. The company’s unveiling comes at a time of great excitement - and caution - in the sector. Venture investors have put more than $1.5bn every quarter into biotech start-ups since the end of 2014, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Yet the industry has faced criticism over how new treatments are priced, and skepticism of breakthrough claims has risen following the discrediting of medical diagnostics company Theranos. Easier, cheaper Messenger RNA is relatively quick to create and can be easily mass-produced, and the hope is that mRNA therapies will be faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional biotechnology drugs, which are typically grown in labs or harvested from living organisms. "It’s almost plug-and-play," said Rick Bright, director of the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, also known as BARDA. The agency, which develops countermeasures to bioterrorism, gave Moderna funding because it sees the platform as potentially being a fast responder in an emergency situation. “All you need is a sequence from a part of the virus you want to make, drop it into the basic machinery, and you could rapidly have dozens of vaccines,” Bright said. High promise It sounds simple, but to succeed Moderna will have to demonstrate that it can accurately target specific cells in different organs in the body. Moderna is working on the eye, lungs, joints and even the brain, said chief executive officer Stephane Bancel, though those programs are still in early research stages.   The company, which was was created in part by venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering, has financing to cover "three to four years" of operations and won’t seek an initial public offering this year, Bancel said. Its most advanced assets are for two strains of flu, H10N8 and H7N9, and the treatments are in early-stage human studies, the company said Monday. Both strains have barely affected humans at this point, but they have pandemic potential. "It’d be nice to have one ready to go," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Normally, however, pharmaceutical companies don’t prepare vaccines ahead of time because there isn’t a market for them. "I’m not sure what their business plan would be," he said. Bancel said they picked the two influenzas because they’re good proof-of-concept cases with clear paths to approval by drug regulators. The company says it’s also working on vaccines for Zika, Chikungunya, human metapneumovirus and cytomegalovirus. Zika effort BARDA is backing a Zika vaccine the company is developing and Bright said he’s enthusiastic, but cautious about the potential. "There is no major safety concern," he said, "but because we have limited experience, we have to tread cautiously with the unknown." In cancer, Moderna has a previously disclosed collaboration with Merck & Company to develop personalized cancer vaccines. On Monday, it revealed two additional targets that are meant to help a patient’s immune system attack tumors, which often have developed ways of evading the body’s defences. The two targets are known as OX40L and IL-12. "The IL-12 can turn a cold tumour hot, and the OX40L decorates the tumour like a Christmas tree," said Bancel, making them vulnerable to attack. None of the cancer treatments have started human studies. Finally, Moderna is collaborating with London pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop an injection intended to stimulate blood vessel creation and improve blood supply in patients who have suffered heart failure or a heart attack. That program has started its first study in humans.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Chinese high-yield bonds have gotten expensive, and heavily indebted issuers throughout Asia need to refinance existing loans, Darryl Flint, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based hedge fund, wrote in a newsletter to investors. Double Haven, which has traded more than $10.7 billion of public and private Asian securities since 2011, said a wave of refinancing activity could also amplify price volatility. Double Haven is joining peers such as BFAM Partners (Hong Kong) and Value Partners Group Ltd. in taking a bearish view on Chinese junk bonds this year after such securities helped regional fixed-income managers return nearly eight-fold the average Asian hedge fund gain in 2016. Double Haven did even better, climbing 8.7 percent last year as the average Asia hedge fund rose 0.8 percent for the worst annual performance since 2011, according to preliminary data from Eurekahedge in Singapore. “Given 2017 is likely to be dominated by events similar or extensions to those of 2016, the strategy is to enter the year in a defensive way,” Flint wrote in the commentary in late December. “We are net short China high-yield beta, given the yield multiple to investment grade is at all time tights." Commodity Rebound High-yield bonds in Asia returned 11.2 percent last year, more than double that of 2015, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. Credit managers focused on the region benefited last year from the rebound of bonds from commodity-related issuers and emerging markets such as Indonesia. This year, they’re bracing for a bumpy ride on expectations of interest rate hikes and a stronger dollar as Donald Trump takes over as U.S. president this month. Price fluctuations could also rise on political risks as Trump has promised to slap punitive tariffs on imports from China and back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Return on China high-yield bonds may drop to 6 percent to 8 percent this year, down from double-digit gains in 2016, Gordon Ip, manager of the $2.1 billion Greater China High-Yield Fund at Hong Kong-based Value Partners Group Ltd., said in October. BFAM, the more than $2 billion hedge-fund firm led by Benjamin Fuchs, has also been taking profits on bonds issued by Chinese property companies that it owned, the former Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. trader said in an interview last month. Increases in the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which determines the borrowing rate investors use to finance such trades, are making them less attractive. Many Risks "The companies themselves are fine but the underlying securities have a lot of risks, because short-term Libor funding rates are going up and yields have come in," said Fuchs, whose fund returned an estimated 17.5 percent last year. If the Libor rate moves significantly higher, those bonds will come under pressure, he said. Fuchs has made money from Chinese property junk bonds he bought during the sell-offs in the last two years, including those of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., the first Chinese property developer to default on dollar debt. Double Haven favors Asia speculative-grade dollar bonds where issuers are involved in corporate events such as mergers, debt buy-backs and asset sales, according to Flint. The firm also likes dollar-denominated investment-grade debt from Chinese issuers in the utility, technology and financial industries and remains bullish on Asian investment-grade issuers in the oil, coal, gold, copper, iron ore and steel industries, Flint wrote.

Chinese developers account for about 26 percent of the $10.7 billion in regional high-yield dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2017, the single biggest group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About $18.5 billion of junk bonds from Asia will come due in 2018, more than triple last year’s amount. Double Haven is also bearish on export-reliant South Korea and markets most likely to be hit by the sell-off of emerging-market bonds by international investors, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Unlike China, Hong Kong and South Korea, which are more driven by domestic investors, the three Southeast Asian countries are more dependent on demand from international investors, Flint wrote. In addition, some bond exchange-traded funds invest heavily in debt from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines relative to their weightings in Asian markets, making the bonds vulnerable to investor outflows during market sell-offs such as the one seen after the U.S. presidential election, he said.

 US STOCKS-Banks, oil stocks hinder Dow's pursuit of 20,000 Reuters Jan. 9, 2017, 11:37 AM 66 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Oil prices fall 2.5 pct, energy index top index loser * Health sector gains on string of multi-billion dollar deals * Tech stocks surge push Nasdaq to record high * Dow down 0.13 pct, S&P down 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.19 pct (Adds details, comments, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 9 (Reuters) - Declines in bank and energy companies weighed on Wall Street on Monday, distancing the Dow from the 20,000 mark, while gains in technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq to a record intraday high. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Goldman Sachs's 0.7 percent decline weighing the most. P&G and Coca-Cola dropped 0.9 percent after Goldman downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the energy sector's 1.3 percent drop. Oil prices fell 2.5 percent on concerns that rising U.S. output could dampen the impact of a recent deal among major producers to limit output. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 11:08 a.m. ET (1608 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.53 points, or 0.13 percent, at 19,937.27. The S&P 500 was down 2.48 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,274.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10.27 points, or 0.19 percent, at 5,531.32. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,538.295. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, was up 1.1 percent at $119.14, after hitting a 13-month high of $119.30. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A string of multi-billion dollar healthcare deals boost the sector on Monday. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. Acuity Brands fell 12.3 percent to $207.51 after the lighting solutions provider gave a disappointing sales forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,167. On the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues fell and 1,149 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 11 new lows.

By Bloomberg | Updated: Jan 10, 2017, 12.00 PM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » stock market | markets | JPMorgan Chase | JPMorgan | Goldman Sachs | economy By Mohamed A. El-Erian The Dow Jones Industrial Average came tantalizing close to 20,000 on Jan. 6, a record level that is being closely watched (and hyped) by the financial media. At one point during the trading session, it was within 0.37 points, or 0.0002 per cent. Most agree that it is just a matter of time before this milestone is attained. The longer-term significance, however, is subject to more debate. Let’s start by acknowledging that the DJIA is far from comprehensive when it comes to analytical content. The index covers a very narrow set of stocks and therefore is lacking in representation. Its calculation methodology also is problematic, placing way too much emphasis on the absolute share price, as opposed to market capitalization. As a result, a few names can move the index significantly -- as has occurred recently with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which account for a substantial part of the upward surge since early November. Nonetheless, the Dow is heavily mentioned when it comes to headline information about stock market performance. Moreover, it is not the only US flirting with record levels. The more representative Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq are at or near their all-time highs. Accordingly, assessing the implications of the hype about the Dow reaching 20,000 comes down to evaluating the volume of the signal, the influence on investing and business behaviors, and the implications for economic governance. We should have little doubt about the signaling outcomes. Dow 20,000 will be the stuff of front-page headlines of both general-interest and financial newspapers, and will be a trending topic in social media. Photos of celebratory hats and banners will be published widely. And the majority of market professionals will remember where they were when this milestone was attained. Many hope that all this will act as a catalyst for wider participation of the general population -- and millennials in particular -- in stock ownership. After all, a bigger investor base is the best contributor to a fundamentally healthy and less volatile market. The problem is that it may take a lot more than headlines and social media likes for this to happen. At the most fundamental level, Dow 20,000 does little to reduce the general mistrust of the financial establishment that was heightened by the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath. Still too many people believe that the financial markets are “rigged” to benefit “insiders.” Moreover, the stock market’s strong performance stands in stark contrast to the general malaise and unsettling feelings resulting from too many years of low and insufficiently inclusive growth, along with an unusual level of uncertainty regarding economic, financial and political conditions. The same caution is also warranted when it comes to “animal spirits” in the corporate sector. The exuberance associated with the impressive post-election surge in stocks has, until now, been mainly a financial phenomenon. It has made it easier for companies to issue bonds, but has yet to translate into consequential changes in business investment and other productivity-enhancing behaviors that fuel more durable drivers of corporate profitability and economic growth. And this is unlikely to change just with the attainment of a financial milestone. The most consequential immediate impact of Dow 20,000 may in fact have less to do with broadening the investor base and turbo-charging productive business behavior, and more to do with encouraging politicians to step up to their economic governance responsibilities. After all, politicians like to be popular. The main reason the Dow is so close to this record level is the combination of pro-growth policy announcements by the president-elect and the hope that a less-dysfunctional Congress will act on these proposals. Politics can help change market and economic sentiment and, with that, set up a more enabling environment for growth. Indeed, the real hope for investors -- and, more importantly, the broader economy -- is that this financial milestone ends up helping to encourage and empower a Congress that, for too many years, has failed to step up to its economic governance responsibilities.

 US STOCKS-Futures dip with oil prices; all eyes on Dow 20,000 Reuters Jan. 9, 2017, 7:25 AM 305 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Futures: Dow down 21 pts, S&P down 2.25 pts, Nasdaq up 0.75 pts By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower as oil prices dipped on Monday, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average came tantalizingly close to 20,000 on Friday. * The Dow hit 19,999.63 points on Friday after a late pop in Apple and other technology stocks. Wall Street has rallied since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. * But the rally has led to lofty valuations - the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14. That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season. * The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo . ** S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. * Oil prices fell 1.8 percent on Monday as signs of growing U.S. production outweighed optimism that other producers were sticking to a deal to cut supplies in a bid to bolster prices. * Meanwhile, investors looking for more insight on the future path of interest rates await a speech at 9:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) by Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve bank. * Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak later in the day. * Merrimack's shares rose more than 40 percent to $5.06 premarket after the company agreed to sell its oncology assets to France's Ipsen SA in a deal worth about $1 billion. * Vertex Pharma lost 5.2 percent to $75.25 after the company gave a full-year revenue forecast for its Orkambi cystic fibrosis treatment, which an Evercore ISI analyst said appeared to miss analysts' expectations. Futures snapshot at 6:54 a.m. ET: * Dow e-minis were down 21 points, or 0.11 percent, with 12,708 contracts changing hands. * S&P 500 e-minis were down 2.25 points, or 0.1 percent, with 60,650 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.01 percent, on volume of 12,419 contracts.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By David Henry | NEW YORK NEW YORK Citigroup Inc (C.N) stands to get less of a profit boost than other big U.S. banks from lower corporate tax rates expected from the new government in Washington. A number of bank stock analysts have worked through broad tax proposals by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump and estimate that a new tax law could increase Citigroup earnings per share only half as much as some rivals. At the same time, Citigroup may have to slash $4 billion or more of the value of an unusually large income tax asset that the bank holds as a result of losses it suffered during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. "If the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, they will still benefit, just benefit less," said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. The differences between Citigroup and its competitors highlight how corporations have different interests in the details of a new tax law, such as how foreign income is treated and how bank business customers might be favored less than individuals. The blueprint for tax reform put forward by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives calls for reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has proposed 15 percent. Banks are expected to benefit more from corporate tax cuts than other industries as they tend to pay more taxes as a result of receiving fewer investment credits and deductions, such as those available for oil and gas exploration. Tax cuts could be the icing on the cake for banks as they look forward to higher profits in the coming year. They are already benefiting from higher U.S. interest rates, and lighter regulation under the Trump administration could allow Wall Street banks to re-enter risky but potentially profitable trading business. EARNINGS LIFT The impact of a new tax law is among the topics likely to come up this Friday when JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the three biggest U.S. banks by assets, report quarterly results. Citigroup reports the following Wednesday, Jan. 18. The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. "There's nothing they can do other than explain it," said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan. MORE MONEY FOR DIVIDENDS More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts' estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. "The devil is in the details," said Goldberg. "There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out."

The New York-based bank earns about half of its profits overseas, where corporate tax rates are mostly lower than the United States, so it stands to benefit less from lower U.S. tax rates than its rivals with more domestic business, analysts said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Goldberg estimates Citigroup will get an 11 percent lift to earnings per share this year due to tax cuts, much less than the 21.4 percent gain he is projecting for JPMorgan. Citigroup executives disclosed a few days after the Nov. 8 election that the bank could have to write down the value of deferred tax assets by $4 billion to $12 billion depending on how the tax law changed and when. The tax assets would be less useful offsetting future taxes if corporate rates were lower. "There's nothing they can do other than explain it," said Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Cannon estimates Citigroup annual earnings per share could be 9.6 percent better with tax changes, about half as much as the 18.9 percent improvement he sees for JPMorgan. MORE MONEY FOR DIVIDENDS More profits left after taxes should make more capital available for additional dividends and share repurchases that could help lift bank stock prices. Analyst Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley said in a research note on Friday that the most pressing question she is getting from clients is how lower taxes will impact banks. Graseck has estimated that lower taxes would boost Citigroup earnings per share by 7 percent, Wells Fargo by 19 percent and JPMorgan by 22 percent. John McDonald of Bernstein Research estimates a 10 percent lift for Citigroup, compared with a 13 percent boost for JPMorgan and 19 percent for Wells Fargo. The differences in the analysts' estimates underscore how much uncertainty there is about tax reform. The estimates vary with different assumptions about the tax rate that ultimately comes out of Washington, as well as a possible shift in how foreign income is taxed and when the changes would take effect. A tax overhaul in 1986 took more than two years, Cannon noted. Cannon based his estimates on a 25 percent cut in the corporate tax rate, arguing that concerns about funding the federal budget and tax cuts for individuals will temper the corporate rate reduction proposed by Republicans and Trump. The more the rate is cut, the less Citigroup would benefit compared with competitors, generally. But the degree of its relative benefits could change, too, if congress also shifts how foreign income is taxed, which Republicans have proposed. How the final U.S. rate compares with rates in particular countries where Citigroup does more or less business than other banks would then come into play, said Cannon. "The devil is in the details," said Goldberg. "There is a lot of uncertainty how this plays out."

For one of those appointees, the grim new reality became apparent early on Election Night. "Whatever final speech I had planned in my head in November would have to wait," recollected Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, speaking Monday evening at the JPMorgan Healthcare Investor Conference. "I started a new speech in my head early in the evening on Nov. 8," Slavitt told attendees here at the major, annual biotech conference.

In his final major address as head of the chief agency implementing Obamacare, Slavitt praised the healthcare law's coverage expansions and insurer regulations, predicted a brighter future for its insurance plans and sharply rebuked Republicans intent on repealing its biggest provisions. Slavitt encouraged Americans to support any health reform that's better than Obama's law, echoing sentiments Obama himself expressed in a Vox interview last week. In that interview, Obama said he'd support repealing and replacing Obamacare if the GOP can come up with something better. "If a plan can improve the Affordable Care Act, we should all embrace it," Slavitt said Monday. "There should be no pride of authorship. It doesn't matter whether a plan comes from a Democrat or a Republican." But to Slavitt, an improvement upon Obamacare must involve four things. It must cover as many people as Obamacare. The coverage must be on par with Obamacare plans. It must bend the healthcare cost surve. And it must be fiscally responsible. "We should build on what we started, not start over," Slavitt said. "That should be a clear message to the incoming administration." Also from the Washington Examiner Trump to meet UK Prime Minister May about U.S.-U.K. trade pact 'I think we're gonna get something done very quickly' By Joel Gehrke • 01/15/17 6:36 PM The Trump administration will preside over the final week and a half of 2017 open enrollment in the law's individual insurance marketplaces. The administration weathered heavy criticism about the marketplace over the past year as insurers hiked premiums and some dropped out entirely. While the law has halved the U.S. uninsured rate and made care more affordable for millions who previously couldn't pay for it, the marketplaces have also suffered from far fewer enrollees than originally projected and plans widely deemed unaffordable for those without federal subsidies. Slavitt, known for his candid Twitter style, has been a strong defender of the law through the firestorm, insisting its advances far outweigh its drawbacks. To him and other administration officials, things are looking up for 2018, when they say insurers will have recovered from the initial shock of losing payments to spread out the risk of sick enrollees. But as they make their exit, a dark cloud hangs over Obama's signature domestic reform, as GOP leadership vow they'll repeal much of it. Slavitt called it "irresponsible" to repeal the law without simultaneously proposing a replacement. Such a maneuver would also seed multiple political challenges down the road, as Republicans almost certainly struggle to unite around a replacement and figure out how to pay for it, he said. Also from the Washington Examiner Trump lashes out at 'Saturday Night Live' Trump called the comedy show "really bad television" after it mocked his news conference By Caitlin Yilek • 01/15/17 6:05 PM "Getting support and finding brand new money is infinitely harder than improving existing legislation," Slavitt said. Asked his deepest fear about what might happen to the healthcare law, Slavitt later told reporters it's that "they would check the box on a repeal vote without having any sense of how they're going to replace it." "It's not entirely obvious once you pass repeal [that] you're going to be able to get a second vote," Slavitt said.

Photo Credit: Dan Dalton/Getty Images The best cash back credit cards offer generous rewards and sign-up bonuses. But the card that's best for you depends on your spending habits and financial situation. Choosing the right card can mean hundreds or thousands of dollars back on your purchases annually. Some cash back cards offer a flat-rate percentage on purchases, while other cards come with bonuses on specific categories and a flat-rate percentage on general purchases. CreditCards.com recently rounded up the best cash back credit cards for its 2016 cash back card competition, which were then rated by a panel of judges to narrow down the top 3. CARD SEARCH: Compare cash back credit cards. Notably, the judges declared a tie for the 2nd place card in this category. <!-- iframe --> Here are the 3 best cash back credit cards, according to CreditCards.com: 1. Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card earns 1st place in the competition for its generous 1% cash-back on everyday purchases and 1% when you pay your credit card bill on time. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no cap on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The Citi® Double Cash credit card offers a chance to earn cash back twice: 1% cash back on general purchases and an additional 1% when you pay your bill on time. With that 1% plus 1% cash-back structure, this is an industry-leading card for cash back on general purchases. There's no annual fee on the Citi® Double Cash card, making it cheaper than competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. In addition to generous cash back, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has perks including purchase protection, and trip cancellation and interruption protection. This card comes with a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. Citi® Double Cash cardholders may also benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. If you register your purchases online, the company will search for lower prices on those items and refund you the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%. Notes: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like an affordable everyday cash back card with generous rewards on all purchases and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Perhaps the best feature of the Citi® Double Cash card, aside from the chance to earn cash back twice, is its simplicity. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with the Citi® Double Cash card. And this card requires you to pay on time monthly in order to earn an additional 1% cash back. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's also no sign-up bonus, something you'll find on other competing cards. 2. Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® card tied for 2nd place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. Very generous rewards – 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets and 3% cash back on gas stations and select department stores – make the Blue Cash Preferred® a top competitor in the cash back category. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also comes with 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchase, this card pays 1%, filling in gaps between its bonus categories. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card pays 5% cash-back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. This card offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 on the card within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has an APR between 13.24% and 23.24%, comparable to the other 2 cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Notes: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. If you're looking for a card that rewards for more general spending habits, another cash back card may be more beneficial. In addition to its sign-up bonus and rewards, this card offers 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months. That makes it a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6% before the relatively low 1% rate kicks in. In addition, American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card or to use this card strategically with others. 3. Chase Freedom Unlimited Card The Chase Freedom Unlimited card tied for 2nd place with the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card for its low-maintenance rewards and 1.5% cash back on every purchase. It's ideal for the busy cardholder who doesn't have time to worry about spending on bonus categories. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5% cash back on all purchases. While that isn't as generous as competing cards, its simplicity and reliable rewards system makes up for the lower rate. This card offers a $150 statement credit for spending $500 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card allows you to redeem for cash anytime at any amount. Cash back rewards don’t expire as long as the card stays open. This card offers a 15-month 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers, making it a good card for those looking to finance a large purchase or pay off debt. Car rental insurance, roadside assistance, price protection and extended warranties are included with this card. Fees: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card comes with a variable APR between 14.24% and 23.24%, on par with competing cards. There's no annual fee with this card, making it a more affordable option than the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express, but on the same fee level as the Citi® Double Cash credit card. Notes: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is best for those who want an easy-to-use everyday cash back card with rewards for all purchases. Those who sign up for the Chase Freedom Unlimited will enjoy its flat 1.5% cash back on all purchases, easy redemption, large sign-up bonus and 15-month 0% APR period. Disadvantages: While this card can boost your rewards across the board, it isn't ideal if you do a lot of spending in one particular area. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, the Blue Cash Preferred® card might be a better option. This card also comes with a lower flat rate (1.5%) than other cards in its class. The Citi® Double Cash card offers a higher 1% cash-back on all purchases and an additional 1% cash-back for paying your bill on time. Compare Cash Back Cards The bottom line The best cash back credit cards offer generous rewards and easy redemption options, but the card that's ideal for you depends on your spending habits. If you're looking to maximize your rewards across the board, a flat-rate cash back card is your best bet. Likewise, if you spend a lot in certain areas, look for a card with a high cash back rate on particular bonus categories. The Best Cash Back Credit Cards Cash back credit card Rate Cash back reward Citi® Double Cash card 13.24% to 23.24% variable Up to 2% cash back on all purchases Blue Cash Preferred® card 13.24% to 23.24% 6% cash back on groceries, 3% on gas and select department stores Chase Freedom Unlimited 14.24% to 23.24% 1.5% cash back on all purchases Related posts: Best rewards credit cards – Top Picks for 2016 Best Chase credit cards: Top picks for 2016 Best business credit cards: Top 3 picks for 2016 The best balance transfer credit cards Best Visa credit card: Top picks for 2016 « Credit card rates for Thursday, September 29 Best credit card rates for Tuesday, October 4 » Bankrate wants to hear from you and encourages comments.

The lira was down more than 2 percent to 3.72 to the dollar after Friday’s data showed US wages rose in December prompting US rate hike expectations. “The lira has always been one of the most exposed EM currencies to any sign that monetary policy in the US will tighten because of its large external financing requirement,” said William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. “(Turkish) domestic policymaking is playing a role too as it seems the central bank is responding to political pressure not to raise interest rates, so it is likely to be behind the curve in reacting to pressure in the currency,” he added. The lira lost 3.2 percent last week, pounded by higher-than-expected inflation and security fears after a series of gun and bomb attacks. The economy has remained sluggish, with a smaller-than-expected rise in industrial production in November, whilst Moody’s has warned that bank profits will be hit by increased non-performing loans. Turkish five-year credit default swaps rose 3 basis points (bps) from Friday’s close to 273 bps, whilst the yield premium paid by Turkish sovereign bonds over US Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified widened out 9 bps to 359 bps. The stronger dollar and expectations of faster Fed tightening also created headwinds for other vulnerable emerging market currencies and contributed to more subdued investor appetite for riskier assets, with the benchmark emerging stocks index down 0.4 percent. The yield premium on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified also widened out 3 bps to 327 bps. The Mexican peso, which remains vulnerable to any restrictions on trade, weakened 0.23 percent. It was still trading above record lows hit last week, which had prompted the Mexican central bank to intervene. China’s onshore yuan slipped 0.24 percent and the offshore yuan gave back some of the sharp gains it made last week. But borrowing costs retreated from record highs, with overnight yuan deposit rates falling to around 10 percent from Friday’s high of 87 percent. In recent weeks the Chinese authorities have intervened in both onshore and offshore currency markets by selling dollars aggressively to prevent the yuan from depreciating too quickly. The Russian rouble weakened 0.6 percent versus the dollar and Moscow dollar-denominated stocks retreated 0.8 percent with oil prices falling 1.7 percent to around $56 a barrel. The South African rand slipped 0.3 percent against the dollar. Over the weekend the chances of President Jacob Zuma’s ex-wife becoming the next leader of the ruling ANC party were given a boost with an endorsement from the party’s women’s division. Zuma also called for an end to ANC infighting. The Polish zloty weakened 0.4 percent against the euro. The central bank is seen keeping interest rates on hold at a record low of 1.5 percent at its rate setting meeting on Wednesday.

"We want things cool. There is too much heat. That is why I'm hoping we get some more down days this week, just in case the earnings aren't as perfect as they need to be after this historic run," the "Mad Money" host said. Looking at the overall context of the market, Cramer wasn't impressed. In fact, he thinks that is the major reason why the Dow failed to hit 20,000 again. The banks have led the rally, especially Bank of America, which has jumped to $22 from $17 since the election, and Goldman Sachs, which has gained 46.5 percent in the past three months. "The issue with these stocks, so vital to the next leg of the rally, is that they need interest rates to go higher if they are going to keep rising, and interest rates seem to have peaked for the moment," Cramer said. Joe Belanger | Getty Images JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America all report on Friday and Goldman reports next week, and the backdrop right now is sub-par for Cramer. It would be better if the stocks sold off ahead of their quarters, he said. The second problem Cramer found was in healthcare. The group has bounced since the election, but investors don't know when Donald Trump could tweet about drug prices. As the market heads into the important JPMorgan health care conference this week, Cramer suspects that the event has been more muted because of worries over pricing. Many pharma companies also have a large amount of overseas currency exposure, which could hurt earnings when compared to the strengthening dollar. Cramer also worried about the price of crude at $52, as it could prevent oil stocks from going higher. If anything, he expects them to move lower. Thus, investors may not be able to count on the oil patch to do the heavy lifting in the market. The final worry on Cramer's list was technology, especially Apple, which was anointed as a top pick by Morgan Stanley because of the impending iPhone 8 and the possibility of repatriation relief. "I much prefer downbeat talk that keeps expectations low," Cramer said. That is why moving into earnings season, Cramer is hoping for more downgrades and negativity in the stock market in general. More sell ratings could create much-needed pessimism to cool stocks down. After all, when everyone is bullish, that means there's no one left to buy. More negativity could help sustain the move.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT Stocks closed mixed Monday, with and utilities lagging as investors geared up for the start of earnings season and assessed falling oil prices.  The Nasdaq advanced about 0.2 percent to a new all-time high as the iShares Nasdaq biotechnology ETF (IBB) and Apple advanced around 1 percent. Leading IBB higher was Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which spiked more than 70 percent after announcing it's being taken over by Takeda, a leading Japanese pharmaceutical company. The Dow fell 76 points, with ExxonMobil and Chevron contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.35 percent, with energy and utilities falling more than 1 percent. U.S. oil prices dropped around 3 percent to $52.30 per barrel, amid U.S. production worries. The three major indexes posted new all-time intraday highs on Friday, as the Dow came within a third of a point of hitting the psychological mark of 20,000. "Valuations here are rich by almost any measure," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "If we slip into not-so-strong earnings growth, then stocks could be vulnerable." Financial giants Bank of America, BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies slated to report this week. The financial sector has posted a sharp rally since Donald Trump's U.S. election victory, rising 17.9 percent since Nov. 8, as of Friday's close. The broader indexes have also gained sharply since the election. "Markets have been focused on his economic policies, ... but there has always been uncertainty," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Market participants are trying to figure out which Trump they are going to get." "The concern that we would express is that there's a lot of excitement about these policies, but they haven't been enacted yet," said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank. S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to record a 4.4 percent year-over-year increase, Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said in a Friday note. "The key thing for me was how quiet the the pre-announcement season was," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "A quiet pre-announcement season portends for a positive earnings season." There are no major economic data due Monday. However, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said in a speech the central bank should step aside, as the economic crisis is "largely done." Lockhart is due to retire from his post in February. Separately, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the U.S. central bank should step up its pace of interest-rate increases from the once-a-year pattern it has pursued since 2015, warning of inflation risks if it does not. "I expect that appropriate monetary policy will need to normalize more quickly than over the past year," Rosengren said in prepared remarks. Overseas, European equities fell broadly, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index sliding 0.5 percent as the banking sector shed around 2 percent. U.K. stocks bucked the trend, however, as the FTSE 100 rose 0.38 percent on the back of a falling pound. Sterling dropped more than 1 percent against the dollar to $1.216, amid talk of Britain drastically reworking trade ties with the European Union after Brexit. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against six other currencies, traded 0.25 percent lower. U.S. Treasurys rose on Monday, with the two-year note yield slipping to 1.19 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.376 percent. About four stocks declined for every three advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 301 million and a composite volume of 1.41 billion in midday trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.6. Reuters contributed to this report.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Jan 9, 2017 at 3:48PM Image source:  PayPal Holdings, Inc. The mobile payment landscape is getting crowded. Major technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, along with big banks and credit card issuers, are jockeying for position in a fast growing market. As mobile payments adoption expands, the services that are easy to access and easy to use are in the best position to lead the race. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been leading the race for over ten years. Two competitors that could give PayPal a run for its money is a new peer to peer (P2P) payment service, ClearXchange, and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) own mobile payment service Apple Pay. Big banks have an answer for Venmo ClearXchange is owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial Services Group, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo. Some of the top banks in the world are already in the ClearXchange network and reach over 250 million people. It is the banks' response to the popularity and growth of PayPal's P2P payment service, Venmo, which is growing rapidly and is on pace to process about $20 billion in annual transaction volume over the next four quarters. ClearXchange offers a very straightforward and convenient service. All you need to send someone money is an email address or mobile phone number. The money is sent directly from the senders' bank account to the recipients'. Even if someone holds a bank account not included in the ClearXchange network, they can still sign up to receive payments. On top of the convenience of transferring money directly in and out of bank accounts, the service is fee free. However, Venmo is also free for all transaction types except credit cards. While the ability to directly transfer money to and from bank accounts is attractive, it's not clear whether ClearXchange differentiates itself enough to persuade Venmo's core users, millennials, to use it. One reason for the growth of Venmo is that it is not associated or owned by traditional financial institutions, an aspect that appeals to a younger generation. Both PayPal and Venmo users can still send money or pay for goods even if there is insufficient funds in their account balance, making these services as easy and convenient to use as ClearXchange. Apple has the numbers Perhaps a more significant elephant to battle against is Apple Pay. Since Apple Pay's launch in 2014, Apple has been quietly signing up banks and credit unions worldwide to allow credit and debit cards to be enrolled in Apple Pay. Recently, Apple added support for 17 more credit unions and banks bringing the total to over 1,600 worldwide. Although Apple doesn't disclose specific numbers, the service seems to be enjoying growing adoption. In 2016, CEO Tim Cook reported that 75% of all contactless payments in the U.S. were through Apple Pay.  Apple Pay transactions increased nearly 500% year over year in the most recent quarter. More transactions were completed in September 2016 than the entire fiscal 2015. Apple's major partners reported that Apple Pay has the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet, and management expects two-thirds of the top 100 retailers to support Apple Pay in 2017. Apple Pay was launched for the Safari web browser for the first time in September 2016, opening up another avenue for users to engage with the service.   This success is not surprising. Apple is one of the most recognized brands in the world and has sold over one billion iPhones since the launch of the original in 2007, giving Apple a huge installed base. Of course, some of these purchases are upgrades for existing users, and some people may not even use an iPhone anymore. One analyst estimates the total installed base of Apple's iPhone is around 400 million. By comparison, PayPal had 192 million active customer accounts at the end of September 2016. Whatever the exact number for Apple's installed base, it's reasonable to assume Apple has a potential customer base that rivals PayPal's. The important distinction for Apple is its control over both hardware and software. Since Apple designs the hardware and software, it can control access to hardware components and software functionality inside an iPhone. Because of this closed system, only Apple can program software to access the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip inside iPhones and Apple Watches. The NFC chip in an iPhone 6 or later model connects wirelessly to a NFC chip reader in a retail store, for example, to share payment data. The NFC chip enables Apple Watch users to simply turn the crown or wave their wrist in the air, wait for a beep, and, voila, payment sent. Third-party app developers, such as PayPal, do not have the luxury of allowing its users to wave their wrists in the air to send payment.   There's no winner-take-all Although Apple does not disclose specific operating metrics for Apple Pay, the statistics CEO Tim Cook discloses on conference calls are enough to assume Apple's total payment volume (TPV) is growing along with the mobile payments industry. The good news for PayPal is that its own TPV has been growing consistently at 20% or more since the launch of Apple Pay. The parallel growth of these two services along with the continued growth of credit card issuers, Visa and MasterCard, highlights the size of the opportunity for all payment solutions. PayPal management puts the company's addressable market at $100 trillion. Over the last four quarters, PayPal's TPV is $336 billion, so there is a very long runway of growth, not only for PayPal, but its competitors as well.

While the Dow and the S&P 500 slid into negative territory, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted a modest gain. The Nasdaq edged up 10.76 points or 0.2 percent to 5,531.82, while the Dow dropped by 76.42 points or 0.4 percent to 19,887.38 and the S&P 500 fell by 8.08 points or 0.4 percent to 2,268.90. The mixed performance on Wall Street came after last week's gains lifted the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record highs. The Dow also flirted with the 20,000 level last Friday but was unable to break through the key psychological level. A lack of major U.S. economic data kept some traders on the sidelines, although reports on producer prices and retail sales are scheduled to be released on Friday. Additionally, financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are due to report their quarterly results this week. Sector News Energy stocks showed a notable move to the downside on the day amid a sharp drop in the price of crude oil. Crude for February delivery plunged $2.12 to $51.87 a barrel amid concerns increased U.S. production will offset an OPEC output reduction. Reflecting the weakness in the energy sector, the NYSE Arca Natural gas Index tumbled by 2.4 percent, while the Philadelphia Oil Service Index slumped by 1.7 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index slide by 1.4percent. Railroad and utilities stocks also saw considerable weakness, with the Dow Jones Railroads Index and the Dow Jones Utilities Average both falling by 1.3. On the other hand, semiconductor stocks saw significant strength on the day, resulting in a 1.1 advance by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) posted a standout gain. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Monday, with the Japanese markets closed on the day. China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.5 percent, while India's BSE Sensex edged down by 0.1 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.4 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries moved back to the upside following the pullback seen last Friday. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dropped by 4.2 basis points to 2.376 percent. Looking Ahead The U.S. economic calendar remains relatively light on Tuesday, although the Commerce Department is due to release its report on wholesale inventories in the month of November. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Jan 9, 2017 at 3:48PM Image source:  PayPal Holdings, Inc. The mobile payment landscape is getting crowded. Major technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, along with big banks and credit card issuers, are jockeying for position in a fast growing market. As mobile payments adoption expands, the services that are easy to access and easy to use are in the best position to lead the race. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been leading the race for over ten years. Two competitors that could give PayPal a run for its money is a new peer to peer (P2P) payment service, ClearXchange, and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) own mobile payment service Apple Pay. Big banks have an answer for Venmo ClearXchange is owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial Services Group, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo. Some of the top banks in the world are already in the ClearXchange network and reach over 250 million people. It is the banks' response to the popularity and growth of PayPal's P2P payment service, Venmo, which is growing rapidly and is on pace to process about $20 billion in annual transaction volume over the next four quarters. ClearXchange offers a very straightforward and convenient service. All you need to send someone money is an email address or mobile phone number. The money is sent directly from the senders' bank account to the recipients'. Even if someone holds a bank account not included in the ClearXchange network, they can still sign up to receive payments. On top of the convenience of transferring money directly in and out of bank accounts, the service is fee free. However, Venmo is also free for all transaction types except credit cards. While the ability to directly transfer money to and from bank accounts is attractive, it's not clear whether ClearXchange differentiates itself enough to persuade Venmo's core users, millennials, to use it. One reason for the growth of Venmo is that it is not associated or owned by traditional financial institutions, an aspect that appeals to a younger generation. Both PayPal and Venmo users can still send money or pay for goods even if there is insufficient funds in their account balance, making these services as easy and convenient to use as ClearXchange. Apple has the numbers Perhaps a more significant elephant to battle against is Apple Pay. Since Apple Pay's launch in 2014, Apple has been quietly signing up banks and credit unions worldwide to allow credit and debit cards to be enrolled in Apple Pay. Recently, Apple added support for 17 more credit unions and banks bringing the total to over 1,600 worldwide. Although Apple doesn't disclose specific numbers, the service seems to be enjoying growing adoption. In 2016, CEO Tim Cook reported that 75% of all contactless payments in the U.S. were through Apple Pay.  Apple Pay transactions increased nearly 500% year over year in the most recent quarter. More transactions were completed in September 2016 than the entire fiscal 2015. Apple's major partners reported that Apple Pay has the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet, and management expects two-thirds of the top 100 retailers to support Apple Pay in 2017. Apple Pay was launched for the Safari web browser for the first time in September 2016, opening up another avenue for users to engage with the service.   This success is not surprising. Apple is one of the most recognized brands in the world and has sold over one billion iPhones since the launch of the original in 2007, giving Apple a huge installed base. Of course, some of these purchases are upgrades for existing users, and some people may not even use an iPhone anymore. One analyst estimates the total installed base of Apple's iPhone is around 400 million. By comparison, PayPal had 192 million active customer accounts at the end of September 2016. Whatever the exact number for Apple's installed base, it's reasonable to assume Apple has a potential customer base that rivals PayPal's. The important distinction for Apple is its control over both hardware and software. Since Apple designs the hardware and software, it can control access to hardware components and software functionality inside an iPhone. Because of this closed system, only Apple can program software to access the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip inside iPhones and Apple Watches. The NFC chip in an iPhone 6 or later model connects wirelessly to a NFC chip reader in a retail store, for example, to share payment data. The NFC chip enables Apple Watch users to simply turn the crown or wave their wrist in the air, wait for a beep, and, voila, payment sent. Third-party app developers, such as PayPal, do not have the luxury of allowing its users to wave their wrists in the air to send payment.   There's no winner-take-all Although Apple does not disclose specific operating metrics for Apple Pay, the statistics CEO Tim Cook discloses on conference calls are enough to assume Apple's total payment volume (TPV) is growing along with the mobile payments industry. The good news for PayPal is that its own TPV has been growing consistently at 20% or more since the launch of Apple Pay. The parallel growth of these two services along with the continued growth of credit card issuers, Visa and MasterCard, highlights the size of the opportunity for all payment solutions. PayPal management puts the company's addressable market at $100 trillion. Over the last four quarters, PayPal's TPV is $336 billion, so there is a very long runway of growth, not only for PayPal, but its competitors as well.

"And the kinds of things we're talking about is how can we take what I believe is one of the very best health-care systems in the world and how can we make it even better? How can we make changes, recognizing the challenges, economic pressures, regulatory pressures, but keep essential elements like innovation through better integration?" Gorsky said on CNBC's "Power Lunch." Gorsky's comments, speaking at the 35th annual JPMorgan health-care conference in San Francisco, come after Trump said he intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Last month Trump also blasted the entire drug industry in an interview with Time magazine, sending shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies lower. "I'm going to bring down drug prices," the president-elect said. "I don't like what has happened with drug prices." Despite Trump's rhetoric around the drug industry, Johnson & Johnson's stock is up so far in 2017. Gorksy said the company is pleased with its performance overall, but far from satisfied. "The underlying driver in all that is about innovation. It is about execution and it is about delivering on our commitments," he said. "Over the past four years, we've been able to launch 15 brand new pharmaceutical products that have been great for patients, but also have been a real driver in our business." Johnson & Johnson is currently negotiating a deal to acquire Swiss biotechnology company Actelion. On Friday, a Reuters report said the two companies have asked Switzerland's takeover board about the viability of a complicated takeover deal. Gorksy said the company will look to make more deals in 2017. "We're always a deal maker. Take a look at us historically over the 20, 10, five years," he said.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 2:10pm   Comments Share: Related EGLT KemPharm CEO On Recent Results, Catalysts And Prospects: 'ADHD Is By Far The Larger Market Opportunity' 15 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Tuesday Egalet Corp (NASDAQ: EGLT) shares jumped as much as 17 percent on Monday before being halted following news that the FDA has approved ARYMO ER. In its JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation, the company said it plans to launch ARYMO ER starting in Q1 2017. The positive news and subsequent halt is a nightmare scenario for the many Egalet short sellers in the market who are now powerless to cover their positions as word of the approval spreads. For Egalet bulls, the FDA approval is a double-bullish catalyst for the stock. In addition to the potential for ARYMO ER to hit the market within months, the stock’s 17 percent spike may the beginning of a massive short squeeze. While Egalet shares have drifted lower by 7.6 percent in the past year, short sellers have piled on. In fact, Egalet’s short interest is up 226.0 percent from a year ago. According to shortsqueeze.com, Egalet currently has a staggering short percent o float of 60.8 percent. The stock has more than 7.4 million shares held short with 11.5 days to cover. When the stock resumes trading, short sellers must hope their fellow shorts will not panic and rush to cover all at once. If they do, the resulting short squeeze could dwarf the 17 percent move the stock made prior to the halt.

By Andrew DePietro January 9, 2017 David M G / Shutterstock.com Choosing the right bank is a crucial financial decision — but often the search can be difficult if you don’t know what to look for. The editors at GOBankingRates identified the best banks, checking accounts, savings accounts, certificate of deposit accounts and online banks in its Best Banks of 2017 study. Take a look at the Editors’ Picks of the Best Banks for 2017 and why these financial institutions really stand out from the pack. Bank Category Editors’ Pick Award Citibank Best National Banks Excellence of Products Chase Bank Best National Banks Top Credit Card Rewards Bank5 Connect Best Online Banks Top Customer Service Discover Bank Best Online Banks Quality and Range of Products Ally Bank Best Savings Accounts No Fees or Minimums Barclays Bank Delaware Best Savings Accounts No Fees or Minimums AloStar Bank of Commerce Best Savings Accounts High Yields Capital One Best Checking Accounts No Fees or Minimums Discover Bank Best Checking Accounts Rewards CIT Bank Best CD Accounts Bonus Offer Barclays Bank Delaware Best CD Accounts No Minimums Ally Bank Best CD Accounts No Minimums Best National Banks Although TD Bank was recognized as the best bank in the U.S., many other national banks in the 2017 Best Banks study offer top-of-the-line financial products, and two of them really stood out. Don’t Miss: 10 Best National Banks of 2017 Excellence of Products: Citibank Recognized as one of the best national banks of 2017, Citibank offers several ways to grow your wealth and reach your financial goals. Citibank earned an Editors’ Pick because of the institution’s range and quality of bank products, which include checking accounts with no minimum deposit, mortgage loans, credit cards, CD laddering, and much more. Top Credit Card Rewards: Chase Bank Chase Bank’s savings accounts and CDs might not offer the highest yields, but the bank does offer several products such as credit cards, checking accounts, savings accounts, auto loans, student loans and mortgages, which is why Chase was recognized as one of the best national banks of 2017. Chase earned an Editors’ Pick, however, because of its great credit card rewards: Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card, for example, rewards you with a $150 bonus after you spend $500 in the first three months of opening an account, plus unlimited 1.5 percent cash back on every purchase automatically. Best Online Banks With online banking, you tend to get the best bank interest rates because, unlike traditional banks, they don’t have to devote resources to brick-and-mortar branches and other overhead costs. As a result, online banks have the capacity to redistribute their business savings back to customers. Here are two of the best online banks that editors recognized for specific excellence. Top Customer Service: Bank5 Connect If you’re looking for one of the best online banks, Bank5 Connect is one of the finalists in that category. Bank5 Connect also earned an Editors’ Pick for its excellent customer service. What makes Bank5 Connect’s customer service really stand apart from most banks is its live customer support chat feature — a technical perk that only two other top online banks offer. Quality and Range of Products: Discover Bank Besides offering some of the best savings accounts, best checking accounts and best CD accounts, Discover Bank earned an Editors’ Pick for its convenient, high-quality financial products and features. Discover provides flexible CD terms between three months and 10 years, over 60,000 free ATMs, no monthly maintenance fees on checking and savings accounts, and 0.95% APY on online savings accounts. Best Savings Accounts The key to saving money is keeping more of your earnings than you spend. In terms of finding the best savings account, that means identifying accounts that don’t drain your balance with fees and that reward your savings with high APYs. See: 10 Best Savings Accounts of 2017 No Fees or Minimums: Ally Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware Ally Bank was awarded the top position in the best online bank category for the third consecutive year. And Ally Bank has been further recognized by GOBankingRates’ editors as one of the best savings accounts, along with Barclays Bank Delaware, for having no fees or minimum deposits. In addition, Ally and Barclays do not require a minimum balance to maintain a savings account, and both banks’ online savings accounts have a 1.00% APY — which is one of the best savings rates you can get. High Yields: AloStar Bank of Commerce AloStar Bank of Commerce is a repeat contender across multiple categories of the Best Banks study. This year, AloStar Bank earned recognition for having one of the best savings account rates and garnered an Editors’ Pick due to its excellent 1.05% APY. AloStar Bank also garnered high marks in the Best CD category, offering 1.05% APY for 12-month CDs with a minimum deposit of $1,000 and 1.61% APY for 60-month CDs. Best Checking Accounts If you want to open a checking account, keep in mind that most checking accounts tend to earn less interest than savings accounts, but a high yield might not be the best criterion for choosing a checking account. GOBankingRates’ editors recognized two best banks for their exceptional checking account features. No Fees or Minimums: Capital One Capital One Bank’s 360 Checking offers a solid bang for your buck. With 360 Checking, you get an interest checking account — capable of earning 0.90% APY with a deposit of $100,000 or more — while at the same time avoiding annoying fees and the need to maintain a minimum balance. As long as you have an account balance of $0 to $49,999, you earn 0.20% APY with your 360 Checking account. Rewards: Discover Bank With Discover Cashback Checking, you get the features of a checking account as well as the benefit of earning money, but not in the usual way. Instead of earning interest, you earn 10 cents on everyday purchases, such as using your debit card, clearing a check or paying a bill online. As you build up your rewards, you can redeem your Cashback Bonus as cash or transfer your rewards to your Discover credit card. Best CD Accounts When choosing the best CD account to open, high interest rates are often central to the decision. The best interest rate isn’t the only factor you should be evaluating when deciding which CD bank account makes sense for you, though. Bonus Offer: CIT Bank CIT Bank ranked among the top 10 best banks for CD accounts in 2017. The bank earned an Editors’ Pick due to its bonus offers for its CD account options. For instance, CIT Bank’s RampUp Plus CDs allow account holders to adjust their rate once if rates go up and add to their deposit once during the CD’s term, while at the same time having the flexibility of short-term, 1-year and 2-year CD accounts. No Minimums: Ally Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware Once again, Ally Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware stand out for requiring no minimum deposit, in this case for their top-rated CD accounts. Ally and Barclays offer lower CD APYs than some of the other banks in the best CD accounts category, but those banks require minimum deposits in the thousands. Methodology: To determine the two editors’ picks for each category, the nine finalists in the savings, checking, certificate of deposit, online bank, and national brick-and-mortar bank categories were reviewed for standout factors. The editors’ pick symbolizes that that bank excelled in a certain area over the rest of the nine finalists. Data was compiled via the GOBankingRates interest rate database and verified against the individual institutions’ websites between Oct. 11 and Oct. 26, 2016. Rates, terms and conditions are subject to change at the discretion of the individual financial institutions. GOBankingRates is a personal finance and consumer interest rate website owned by ConsumerTrack, Inc.,an online marketing company serving top-tier banks, credit unions, and other financial services organizations. Some banks mentioned in the Best Banks of 2017 survey are clients of ConsumerTrack, Inc., which serves more than 100 national, local and online financial institutions.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The energy sector dropped 1.4 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Exxon Mobil's 2.1 percent decline weighing the most, followed by a 1.3 percent drop in Chevron. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1728 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 48.65 points, or 0.24 percent, at 19,915.15, the S&P 500 was down 3.53 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,273.45. The Nasdaq Composite was up 17.96 points, or 0.33 percent, at 5,539.01, easing slightly after hitting an all-time high of 5,539.14. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, rose 1.3 percent to a 13-month high of $119.43. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared in the previous quarter will be provided later this week by big banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The financial sector was however off 0.34 percent on Monday. Other big-name decliners were P&G and Coca-Cola , which dropped about 1 percent each after Goldman downgraded the stocks to "sell". The healthcare sector gained 0.34 percent, boosted by a string of multi-billion dollar deals. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after agreeing to a $7.7 billion buyout offer from candy and pet foods maker Mars Inc. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. One dim spot in the sector was Celgene, which lost 1.1 percent after issuing a full-year revenue forecast that missed analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,276. On the Nasdaq, 1,498 issues fell and 1,294 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 14 new lows.

The FTSE Index rose 27.72 points to an all-time closing high of 7,237.77, as the market continued to benefit from the pound's slump. It marks the longest record closing streak since the beginning of May 1997, putting the London market on course for its longest ever record closing streak if it reaches an all-time closing high on Tuesday. Theresa May said she does not accept the terms hard and soft Brexit, while Angela Merkel says the UK may not be allowed access the Single Market The further push into record territory came during a remarkable rally on Monday, with the top-flight delivering a new mid-session record of 7,243.76 after investors snapped up stocks on the back of the pound's plunge to a two-month low against the US dollar. Sterling was under severe pressure on the currency markets following an interview with Theresa May on Sunday, in which she stated the importance of taking control of immigration over access to the European single market. The pound hit lows not seen since last October, dropping 0.9 per cent versus the greenback at 1.21 and falling 1.3 per cent against the euro at 1.151.

'The bulls are out in force and there¿s no stopping the FTSE... Share this article Share Sterling's lows remained entrenched despite Mrs May moving to clarify her comments, telling a London press conference: 'I'm tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I am talking about a hard Brexit (and that) it's absolutely inevitable there's a hard Brexit. 'I don't accept the terms hard and soft Brexit.' The UK currency's fall since the Brexit vote has proved beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index, as many tend to benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are performing more strongly than sterling. Across Europe, Germany's Dax was down 0.5 per cent and the Cac 40 in France slipped 0.3 per cent. On the oil markets, the price of Brent crude slipped amid concerns over growing US production and the Opec cartel's ability to drive through cuts to support prices. The price of oil was down three per cent - or one dollar and 71 cents - to 55.39 US dollars a barrel In UK stocks, London-listed miner Glencore was sitting at the top of the biggest risers after a positive note from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry. Shares were up more than three per cent, or 10.3p to 298.7p, after the bank said that an ongoing infrastructure spending splurge from China, coupled with potential fiscal stimulus from Western countries, made the sector's valuation look reasonable. Lloyds Banking Group was among the biggest fallers, dropping 0.7p to 65.2p, after the Government reduced its stake in the lender to less than six per cent, meaning the taxpayer is no longer the group's largest shareholder Away from the top tier, betting giant William Hill was nursing hefty losses after warning that profits would suffer a £20million hit following a string of 'customer-friendly' results in December. The high street bookmaker said full-year operating profit for 2016 would come in at around £260 million, the bottom end of its £260million-£280million range. Shares were down more than two per cent, or 6.1p to 291.6p, on the FTSE 250 index. The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 Index were Glencore up 10.3p to 298.7p, Randgold Resources up 145p to 6,660p, British American Tobacco up 101p to 4,675p, Imperial Brands up 78p to 3,616.5p. The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 Index were Capita down 15p to 500.5p, Land Securities down 23p to 1,034p, Royal Bank of Scotland down 5p to 227.4p, Whitbread down 76p to 3,865p. 15:30: The Footsie was cruising towards another record close, despite US stocks opening up lower at the start of the earnings season on Wall Street. With an hour to go the FTSE 100 index was up 14.2 points at 7,224.2, slightly lower than it had been at lunch. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60 points at the bell, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. Proctor & Gamble and Coke were also down after downgrades from analysts. The Dow had hit a record close on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also clocked up all-time highs following a late rise in Apple and other technology stocks. Wall Street has rallied since Donald Trump won the US election in November as investors bet he will introduce business-friendly policies. But the rally has led to lofty valuations - with the S&P is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, compared to its average of 14.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next MIDAS SHARE TIPS UPDATE: Bumper year projected for Cineworld... British factories 'on the mend' as weak pound has made UK... 'The bulls are out in force and there¿s no stopping the FTSE... Share this article Share That could make investors cautious as they gear up for the fourth-quarter earnings season.  The first peek into how companies fared last quarter will be provided later this week by big US banks, including JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Reuters. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers this session Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'After stalling within a whisker of 20k on Friday the Dow opened slightly lower today as investors mulled over whether further gains in US markets are sustainable in the longer term. 'There is also the fact that we will get to see some important earnings announcements later this week from the main US banks, and if these disappoint we could well see some profit taking start to kick in, particularly given that we've seen big gains in this sector in the last six months, with JP Morgan up 37 per cent, Bank of America up 69 per cent and Wells Fargo up 13 per cent, with a good proportion of those gains since November 8th.' Back in London it has been a poor session for bank stocks, with Royal Bank of Scotland rooted to the bottom of the leaderboard. Its shares are off 2.8 per cent, or 6.6p, at 225.7p.  Lloyds is also down 1.8 per cent, or 1.2p, at 1,036.5p, despite the Government selling another stake in the bank. Michael Hewson, at CMC Markets, explained: 'Banking stocks have also slipped back a touch with Lloyds Banking Group lower after the government sold off another part of its stake in the bank, taking it below 6 per cent, and bringing ever closer the day the bank is completely back in the private sector.  'This morning's further sales also serves to highlight the contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, whose problems still remain very much front and centre given it still has to arrive at a settlement with the US Department of Justice over mortgage backed securities mis-selling. 'The weakness in banking stocks may also be down to a slight softening in yields and a narrowing of interest rate differentials between short and long term debt on government debt markets.' But the major story this session has been the pound's dramatic fall over comments Prime Minister Theresa May made yesterday Brexit. This afternoon May tried to clarify the Government's position on Hard or Soft Brexit. She said: 'I'm tempted to say that the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I'm talking about a hard Brexit, (that) it is absolutely inevitable there's a hard Brexit. 'I don't accept the terms hard and soft Brexit. What we're doing is going to get an ambitious, good and best possible deal for the United Kingdom in terms of... trading with and operating within the single European market.'  At the same time German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also waded in stating that if the UK does not accept the EU's 'four freedoms' in Brexit negotiations, attention will need to turn to restricting Britain's access to the single market. 13:00: The Footsie remained in comfortable territory at lunch, driven higher by internationally focused stocks following a sharp fall in the pound.  The FTSE 100 index was up 21.7 points at 7,232.7, on course for its eighth straight record close. Mark Ward at Sanlam Securities UK said: 'The FTSE is still currency-led, with Brexit uncertainty over the weekend grinding it higher. I don't think these markets will go lower anytime soon.' On the up: Glencore was the biggest gainer after positive comments from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry As a result stocks with a large proportion of overseas earnings rose to the top of the FTSE 100, led by miners. Glencore was the biggest gainer after positive comments from Barclays on the outlook for the mining industry.  Shares were up more than 2 per cent, or 6.7p to 295.2p, after the bank said that China's ongoing infrastructure spending splurge, coupled with potential fiscal stimulus from Western countries, made the sector's valuation look reasonable. Anglo American lifted 2 per cent at 1,154.5p and BHP Billiton added 1.5 per cent to 1,334.5p. Tobacco stocks also rose, led by British American Tobacco, up 1.4 per cent at 4,639.5p, and Imperial Brands up 1.2 per cent higher at 3,593.0p. On the FTSE 250 Ashmore was the biggest faller, down 6.7 per cent at 279.2p after analysts at Barclays said the emerging markets-focused fund manager was vulnerable to outflows following Donald Trump's election as US president. William Hill was another heavy faller, down 3.8 per cent at 286.4p after the bookmaker said profits would fall to £260million for the year, down from £291.4million last year, after a number of horse racing and football results went against it. But the session has been dominated by sterling's collapse following hints from Prime Minister Theresa May that Britain may opt for a so-called 'hard Brexit'.  Sterling plunged to a two-month low against the US dollar - dropping 1.2 per cent to $1.214 - in response to an interview with May on Sunday, in which she stated that importance would be given to gaining full control over immigration during divorce negotiations with the European Union. The pound was also down 0.9 per cent versus the euro at €1.154. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the markets were reading May's comments as a move towards leaving the European single market in favour of World Trade Organisation rules. Naeem Aslam, analyst at ThinkMarkets added: 'The political crisis is brewing and you can see that when you look at pound. The UK government is playing with fire and creating more uncertainty. Last year, we said that the British pound has tendency of touching the mark of 1.18 against the dollar and we are still maintaining our call.' 'The government needs to be consistent with their message so that market can digest all the bad news and move on with it.'.  The pound has dropped around 18 per cent against the US dollar and 10 per cent versus the euro since the June 23 vote, as traders expect the British economy to be significantly weaker once it quits the EU.  On the oil markets, the price of Brent crude slid 1.7 per cent - or 97 cents - to $56.13 a barrel, as traders became concerned about the Opec cartel's ability to drive through production cuts.   08:20: The Footsie was quick off the block on Monday morning, jumping higher after a strong session overnight in Asia. In opening deals the FTSE 100 index was up 21.6 points at 7,232.5 - a fresh intraday high. On Friday it closed up 14.74 points at 7210.05 - yet another record finish for the buoyant London market.   The Santa rally from December has continued into January, driven by what is expected to be a new era for US politics and European politics in 2017. Issue: UK equity markets have been flying but the pound remains worryingly weak Overnight the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was marginally up and the Shanghai Composite rose by 0.4 per cent. South Korea's Kospi edged higher by 0.2 per cent, while Australia's ASX/200 finished 0.9 per cent up.  But the pound is feeling the pain as stocks rise. Already this morning it has dropped by 0.8 per cent against both the dollar and the euro following Theresa May's Sky News interview at the weekend.  In her first major interview of 2017, May told Sky News that: 'Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.' The Prime Minister's comments were read as falling decidedly on the 'hard' end of the Brexit spectrum, with 'control of borders' likely to be prioritised over continued access to the single market. This left sterling at a two-month low against both the dollar and the euro.  The pound is likely to drop around 5 per cent to $1.15 against the dollar after May triggers Article 50 in March, starting the two-year countdown to leaving the EU, according to a Reuters poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists In the UK, the week ahead will be dominated by Christmas trading updates from the country's largest retailers. Analysts anticipate that results will be mixed.  In focus today will be UK Halifax House Price data which is seen holding its ground to the benefit of the housebuilders which already got a boost past week from Persimmon's positive trading update and several broker upgrades.  Elsewhere global oil prices fell as increased exports from Iran undermined efforts by other oil producers to curb a global fuel supply overhang.   Stocks in focus in London include:   LLOYDS BANKING - Britain has cut its stake in the bank to below 6 per cent as it attempts to return the lender to full private ownership this year. BOVIS HOMES - Boss chief executive David Ritchie had stepped down with immediate effect, days after it warned on profit because it failed to complete the number of homes it expected at the end of 2016.     UK SUPERMARKET OPERATORS - Britain's three quoted major supermarkets are expected to report this week that they enjoyed solid Christmas trading, though investor concern about a potential squeeze on consumer spending in 2017 means the focus is on their outlooks.   Data:  Germany industrial production at 7am Halifax House Price Index at 8.30am Eurozone unemployment at 10am Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Fly to New York for £56!

By Daan Pepijn January 09, 2017 We bleed data daily. Sites like Facebook and Foursquare, connected devices like smartphones, and the Internet of Things heralded by smart refrigerators, cars and FitBits – all these take our daily habits, our opinions and our impulses, generate a picture from the data, and send it out to the ether. Every single day. Compromised privacy is the price we users pay for the convenience these services bring. But is the cost too onerous to bear? In an ideal world, we can trust tech companies to keep our data safely under lock and key. But reality gets in the way: businesses, pranksters or criminals often take this data and use it to serve their interests, not yours. Risks to Your Data Some providers' terms of service give them carte blanche to share your data. Snapchat's TOS, for example, grant the company permission to “exhibit, and publicly display [users'] content in any form and in any all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed),” and to share the data with third parties. Spotify had to back down after releasing a privacy policy that granted them permission to collect GPS data, images and contacts from your smartphone. Data leaks can also emerge when Moore's Law gives way to Murphy's. In Australia, a completely wiped iPhone continued to download the old owner's voicemails for the new owner to hear. Telstra, the telecom provider involved, has yet to get to the root of the problem - “They know what the symptoms are,” explained Richard Thornton, the iPhone's previous owner, “but they don't know what the cause is.” The greatest risk to your data security comes from the booming cybercrime industry. A visualization of  the world's biggest data breaches should make anyone nervous: a 2014 breach involving over 200 million personal records held by Court Ventures; a cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase that affected 76 million households; and $300 million in lost revenue due to a Russian hacking team gaining access to over 160 million credit and debit card numbers and reaching deep into the NASDAQ stock exchange itself! Tech Companies Bear Responsibility We can't put the genie back in the bottle. We want to keep the convenience of tracking our fitness and sharing LOLs on social media. We want to keep our data absolutely out of harm's way. But, we can't have both. Tech companies must be primarily responsible for ensuring their users' data stay safe. Conscientious providers make use of protocols like HTTP/2 (where most client implementations take advantage of its mandatory encryption over TLS 1.2); and end-to-end encryption services (PGP for email; Tresorit for cloud storage) to keep their clients' data away from prying eyes. As a growing amount of data courses through content delivery networks (CDNs), more providers now leverage these solutions as an additional layer of data security on top of their hosting infrastructure. For instance, on top of improving website access speed by caching content across servers in different parts of the globe, a CDN can act as a barricade against DDoS and other attacks on websites and Web applications. What Providers Can Do Far beyond dealing with infrastructure, providers also need to address the human factor – with actions as simple as restricting or controlling BYOD (bring your own device) policies and restricting access to individuals whose role in the organization do not require the use of sensitive data. A 2014 report by McKinsey and Company sets out seven practices that optimize cyber resilience, or strength in the face of cyberattacks. These notably include performing a triage based on the risks and importance of assets, actively testing and deploying defenses, and integrating cyber resistance throughout the enterprise. But the report asserts that the buck on data security ultimately stops at the C-suite: “Given the cross-functional, high-stakes nature of cybersecurity, it is a CEO-level issue, and progress toward cyber resiliency can only be achieved with active engagement from the senior leaders of public and private institutions,” it explains. Growing Risk, Growing Liability This is not to minimize the role of individual users in safeguarding their personal data – each of us is individually only as safe as our personal privacy habits allow. But with the data of millions of users on the line, tech companies are on the hook for all of them. “The risk of consumer injury increases as the volume and sensitivity of the data grows,” explains Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Edith Ramirez – pointing out that leaky tech companies will answer to both their clients and regulators. “If they fail to secure the life cycles of their big data environments, they may face regulatory consequences, in addition to the significant brand damage that data breaches can cause,” Ramirez says.  Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Daan Pepijn Contributing Writer Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles A WebRTC-like Standard for the Internet of Things?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The following is excerpted from the report: After remaining stuck around 3 per cent for the past five years, global economic growth appears set to improve in 2017, as suggested by the OECD Leading Indicator indexes for G7 and BRIC countries. The JPMorgan Global Composite PMI and the IFO World Economic Expectations index are entering 2017 in a strong uptrend. A board on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, May 17, 2016 in New York, New York. Getty Images Full report Chasing growth in 2017 In fact, for the first time since 2006, the global economy could experience a late-cycle growth synchronisation between developed and emerging market economies. The IMF pegs global GDP growth at 3.4 per cent (up from 3.1) for 2017, with emerging markets expected to account for 78 per cent of world GDP growth. Investors are reminded that global growth re-acceleration does not necessarily imply the outperformance of growth vs. value stocks. In fact, there is a negative correlation as investors pay a premium for growth only when it is scarce. When global growth accelerates, globally geared (i.e., technology and industrials) and resource sectors (energy and materials) usually lead markets. Inflation-sensitive groups, such as REITs and golds, also tend to perform relatively well. Read the full report here. Globe app users click here for the full report Read other research reports here.

Two-thirds of the 30 Dow components were lower, with Goldman Sachs's 0.7 percent decline weighing the most. P&G and Coca-Cola dropped 0.9 percent after Goldman downgraded both the consumer staple stocks. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the energy sector's 1.3 percent drop. Oil prices fell 2.5 percent on concerns that rising U.S. output could dampen the impact of a recent deal among major producers to limit output. The declines meant the Dow stayed shy of the psychologically significant 20,000 mark. It came tantalizingly close on Friday, hitting a record of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. At 11:08 a.m. ET (1608 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.53 points, or 0.13 percent, at 19,937.27. The S&P 500 was down 2.48 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,274.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10.27 points, or 0.19 percent, at 5,531.32. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,538.295. The tech sector was the top gainer. Apple , which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, was up 1.1 percent at $119.14, after hitting a 13-month high of $119.30. "As we move into the next couple of weeks, the focus will move towards the micro and to specific company earnings and expectation going forward," Jones said. The first peek into how companies fared will be provided later this week by big U.S. banks. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 6.1 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A string of multi-billion dollar healthcare deals boost the sector on Monday. Ariad Pharma surged nearly 73 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda. Pet hospital operator VCA jumped 28 percent after Mars Inc said it would buy the company for $7.7 billion. Surgical Care Affiliates jumped 16 percent on a deal to be bought by UnitedHealth for about $2.30 billion. Dow component UnitedHealth dipped 0.6 percent. Acuity Brands fell 12.3 percent to $207.51 after the lighting solutions provider gave a disappointing sales forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,167. On the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues fell and 1,149 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 11 new lows.

While the Dow and the S&P 500 have slid into negative territory, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is posting a modest gain. Currently, the Nasdaq is up 12.50 points or 0.2 percent at 5,533.56, while the Dow is down 42.40 points or 0.2 percent at 19,921.40 and the S&P 500 is down 4.03 points or 0.2 percent at 2,272.95. The mixed performance on Wall Street comes after last week's gains lifted the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to new record highs. The Dow also flirted with the 20,000 level last Friday but was unable to break through the key psychological level. A lack of major U.S. economic data may be keeping some traders on the sidelines, although reports on producer prices and retail sales are scheduled to be released on Friday. Additionally, financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are due to report their quarterly results this week. Sector News Energy stocks have shown a notable move to the downside on the day amid a sharp drop in the price of crude oil. Crude for February delivery is tumbling $1.62 to $52.37 a barrel amid concerns increased U.S. production will offset an OPEC output reduction. Reflecting the weakness in the energy sector, the NYSE Arca Natural gas Index is down by 1.9 percent, while the Philadelphia Oil Service Index is down by 1.3 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil & Gas Index is down by 1.1 percent. On the other hand, gold stocks have moved significantly higher over the course of the session, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2 percent. The strength in the sector comes as gold for February delivery is climbing $9.90 to $1,183.30 an ounce. Considerable strength is also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.4 percent gain being posted by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Monday, with the Japanese markets closed on the day. China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.5 percent, while India's BSE Sensex edged down by 0.1 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.4 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.4 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved back to the upside following the pullback seen last Friday. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 3.9 basis points at 2.379 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?
