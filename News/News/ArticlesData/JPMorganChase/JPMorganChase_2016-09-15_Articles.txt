Over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, JPMorgan Asset Management, and Nuveen have all marked respective “firsts” with regard to exchange-traded funds. The JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield (JPHY) is J.P. Morgan's first fixed-income ETF. The ETF will face stiff, established competition from the Pimco Total Return Active ETF (BOND), and the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF (TOTL), as well as passive high-yield bond ETFs, SPDR Barclays High-Yield (JNK), and iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bonds (HYG). The Goldman Sachs Treasury Access 0-1 Year (GBIL) is the first ETF to offer same-day settlement of creation and redemption in the short-term Treasury market, which essentially makes it a money market substitute. And Nuveen's NuShares Enhanced Yield U.S. Aggregate Bond (NUAG) is the first product launched on the NuShares ETF Platform. The recent launches follow patterns of expansion in the ETF space by firms such firms as John Hancock Financial Services, Legg Mason, and Franklin Templeton, according Todd Rosenbluth, director ETF research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “You don't just enter the ETF market lightly, and a lot of companies have started paying more attention to building ETF lineups,” he said. In terms of the recent string of bond ETFs, Mr. Rosenbluth said, “The appeal of getting in is the significant money that has gone into fixed-income ETFs, and these active-management firms like JPMorgan have a lot of prowess in that area.” JPMorgan, which launched its first ETF in June 2014, now has 10 products and $850 million in ETF assets. But they are just getting started, according to Joanna Gallegos, head of product development for ETFs at JPMorgan. The company currently has a multi-sector global fixed income ETF, and an ultra-short bond ETF in registration. “The appeal of ETFs for us is we're able to reach new client segments and expand our business,” Ms. Gallegos said. “We will continue to launch products over the next few years.” It's a similar story at Nuveen, which is an operating division of TIAA Global Asset Management. Nuveen's new strategic-beta ETF, which is designed to squeeze maximum yield out of a broad bond universe is just the beginning, according to Martin Kremenstein, managing director and head of ETFs at Nuveen. “We're bringing strategic-beta methodology to the fixed-income world, and this is quite different from anything we already offer,” he said. “There are lots more planned, but what we've done with this new ETF is a good guide of what we have planned.” So far, none of these firms are suggesting a move away from traditional open-end mutual funds as they migrate into the ETF space, and the mutual-fund industry at $12.5 trillion still towers over the $2.4 trillion ETF market. But the trend toward ETFs continues to mount. According to Morningstar, U.S. open-end mutual fund assets are sitting at an all-time high, but so far this year the industry has suffered more than $8.7 billion in net outflows, which follows $35.1 billion in net outflows last year. The total number of distinct funds, not counting multiple share classes, stands at 8,155, down from 8,208 in December. ETFs, meanwhile, are in the midst of a growth spurt, including net flows this year of more than $141 billion, following two consecutive years of more than $240 billion in net inflows. Morningstar counts a total of 1,927 ETFs, up from 1,848 in December. “It's nice to see some legitimate firms coming into the ETF space,” said Matt Collins, head of U.S. product operations at ETF Securities. “Generally, it seems like what the fund companies are offering in the form of ETFs is what they've done for decades, but some of the business dynamics of active management and/or higher fees is putting pressure on the way they've always done things,” he added. Since roughly 80% of his firm's $22 billion in ETF assets is in specialized commodity strategies, Mr. Collins doesn't yet see a major threat from the giant asset managers pushing deeper into ETFs. But, he said, the potential to have an impact on the ETF space is there. “Their presence will be felt in the marketing dollars they spend, because they have the ability to allocate huge amounts of money,” Mr. Collins said. “They also have huge distribution networks, but the trick for them might be finding a way to leverage that distribution by giving each product enough attention.” 0 Comments What do you think?

(Photo: Thinkstock) (Bloomberg) — Just when the world is most craving clarity on the future of Japan’s monetary policy, currency markets show it has become particularly hard to predict. With so little consensus on what Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will come up with for the Sept. 21 policy decision, Eaton Vance Corp. and a unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are abstaining from any positions in the yen, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. says some investors have closed out bets on declines in the dollar versus the Asian currency. Such is the consternation that the options premium on contracts to buy the yen in a month’s time disappeared for the first time since November, before reversing course this week. Japan became the epicenter of a global bond selloff this month, amid speculation the central bank will pull back from buying long-term bonds after Kuroda ordered a comprehensive review of its easing program. The governor acknowledged last week that low long-term yields hurt returns on pension and insurance investments, even as he signaled there would be no reduction in easing. The Federal Reserve will decide on interest rates just hours after the BOJ’s meeting, adding to the quandary about the yen’s direction. No position “There is a chance that the yen weakens from these levels if the BOJ is more aggressive in new monetary easing than people expect, but getting the timing of that right is difficult,” said Eric Stein, Boston-based co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance, which oversees about $330 billion. “Given the current risk-reward and all other variables in the world such as the trend in the dollar and U.S. rates, we don’t currently have a position in the yen.” The currency, as well as the central bank, has the potential to surprise. Kuroda’s shock announcement of a negative deposit rate on Jan. 29 weakened the yen only briefly, to the low for the year of 121.69 per dollar. After that it strengthened — reaching as high as 99.02 in June for the first time since 2013 after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The exchange rate was at 101.86 as of 6:55 a.m. in New York. Related: Treasuries gain as Brexit vote dampens bets on higher U.S. rates Just over half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate expanded easing next week, with a rate cut seen as the most likely option. “There is an expectation that the BOJ might do something, but the problem is the market is mixed on what that might be or whether it’s something new that we haven’t even seen yet,” said Laura Fitzsimmons, Sydney-based vice president for rates and foreign-exchange sales at JPMorgan, the world’s second-largest currency trader. “Dollar-yen, if anything, probably has a slight bias higher still from these levels.” Mixed messages Options traders are also sending mixed messages. The premium for contracts to buy the yen versus the dollar in one month, over the cost of those to sell, was at 0.5 percentage point Thursday, after largely disappearing from end-August through last week. Shorter term they have turned more bearish, paying a premium of 0.8 percentage point for one-week contracts to buy the dollar against the yen over those allowing for sales. On June 22, the right to purchase the Japanese currency cost 4.5 percentage points, the most in more than seven years. Yield curves The Japanese currency has traded within a six-yen range versus the dollar since the last BOJ gathering on July 29, when the central bank underwhelmed markets with a stimulus boost that fell short of analyst expectations. Its  announcement of a comprehensive review of its policy framework then intensified concern that Kuroda had few tools left to revive the economy as his goal of raising inflation to 2 percent proved to be elusive. Related: Taiwan mulls shielding insurers from callable corporate bonds Fluctuations in the debt market have been more volatile than the yen before next week’s meeting. Yields on Japan’s long-term government bonds climbed Wednesday to a six-month high on speculation policy makers would seek a steepening in the curve that plots yields of different maturities to mitigate the pain on banks and savers from negative interest rates. While it’s unclear what a steeper yield curve that might be sought by the BOJ would mean for the yen, the threat of a pullback in higher-yielding assets could fuel demand for the Japanese currency as a haven, said Paul Lambert, the London-based head of currencies at Insight Investment Management Ltd., a unit of Bank of New York Mellon, which manages about $580 billion. Bullish bets on the currency remained close to the record high reached in April as hedge funds and other large speculators added to wagers that sought to profit from its strength since the start of the year, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. “The market’s already very long the yen so that would make you cautious to buy,” Lambert said. “Our conclusion is the best place to be in the short term is on the sidelines and let these things play out.” Related: Pimco at odds with Goldman on Yellen as September rate bets rise Life insurers swap liquidity for yield Have you followed us on Facebook?

Shares in Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG fell after Deutsche Bank AG disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking $14 billion to settle claims it sold faulty securities before the financial crisis. While U.S. rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have reached settlements, banks across the Atlantic have yet to resolve similar probes. While Deutsche Bank said it’s not willing to pay “anywhere near” $14 billion to resolve the DOJ case, the claim has added to concerns about the ultimate size of the agreements and whether European banks will need to raise more funds to cover them, analysts said. The region’s largest lenders have seen a slump in earnings, hurt by volatile markets and negative rates, with the U.K.’s vote to exit the European Union adding to uncertainty about Europe’s growth prospects. “News flow over last couple of months has been centered on one major topic: Brexit,” said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in London. “The market may have become slightly complacent, and this serves as a reminder the numbers could prospectively be quite large.” Stock Drops Deutsche Bank fell 7.9 percent to 12.06 euros at 12:05 p.m. in Frankfurt, the biggest drop in almost three months. Credit Suisse fell 4.7 percent to 12.72 Swiss francs in Zurich, while RBS, Barclays and UBS also slid. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index has tumbled 24 percent this year, eroding about 215 billion euros ($241 billion) of market value. The DOJ and the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, have been probing whether the biggest banks sold shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Six European banks, including HSBC Holdings Plc, sold almost $80 billion of securities that have been subject to FHFA complaints, according to data collected by Bloomberg Intelligence. The $14 billion sought by U.S. authorities is quadruple the $3 billion to $3.5 billion that JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said would be in line with their litigation estimates. It would also be more than what U.S. banks with larger mortgage operations paid. ‘Pushing Back’ “It seems that with every settlement the DOJ wants to get more from European companies,” said Andreas Domke, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors whose fund holds about 2 million Deutsche Bank shares. “It’s good Deutsche Bank is pushing back while asking to lower the fine.” The amount of securities subject to the FHFA’s complaints can serve as a guide as to how much the DOJ will seek in penalties, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. RBS, based in Edinburgh, sold $32.1 billion, more than Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse combined. RBS has set aside about $7 billion to cover the probes, Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said last month that his bank has yet to enter talks over a settlement amount with the DOJ. An agreement is one of the biggest issues the bank must overcome before it can pay dividends. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, both in the midst of lengthy overhauls to boost profit, sold about $14 billion each of the mortgage-backed securities that were included in the FHFA complaints. While analysts said the DOJ’s claim was just an initial request in the settlement process, the number has only added to uncertainty. “Everyone’s just stabbing in the dark,” said Andreas Brun, an analyst with Mirabaud Securities LLP. “All there’s to do is wait.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Elizabeth Warren is calling for an investigation into the Department of Justice to understand why it failed to bring any Wall Street bankers to trial. (Photo: Getty) Though President Barack Obama is set to leave office in matter of months, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is not willing to let him go without a full explanation as to why his administration refused to jail the Wall Street banksters behind the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In a letter sent to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz on Thursday, the progressive firebrand demanded an investigation into why the DOJ refused to file criminal charges against individuals despite "'serious indications of violation[s]' of federal securities and other laws," uncovered by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) probe into the causes of the economic crash. Warren said her staff reviewed thousands of documents recently made public by the FCIC, and identified "11 separate FCIC referrals of individuals or corporations to DOJ in cases where the FCIC found" such evidence. According to Warren, "Nine individuals were implicated in these referrals (two were implicated twice)." The DOJ, she continued, "has not filed any criminal prosecutions against any of the nine individuals. Not one of the nine has gone to prison or been convicted of a criminal offense. Not a single one has even been indicted or brought to trial." Further, she notes that her staff review "identified potentially illegal activity at 14 corporations (including five that were implicated in multiple referrals)." Though there were five corporations that reached a settlement with the DOJ, not one was criminally indicted or brought to trial. Summarizing the letter, financial reporter David Dayen noted that the corporate criminals examined in the FCIC documents included most of America’s largest banks—Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America)—along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Société Generale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moody’s, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FCIC presented DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave false representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law.  And the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae, CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG, CEO Stan O’Neal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch, and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup. "The DOJ's failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable," Warren concludes. "This failure requires an explanations." Thursday also marks 8 years since Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Warren said the anniversary is "a good occasion to stop and ask where the real accountability is and get some answers out of the Justice Department about why they haven’t prosecuted anyone." On social media, Warren reiterated that point: 8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy & millions of people suffered for it. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 15, 2016 Warren also wrote to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), on Thursday asking for his department to release "any and all materials related to the FBI's investigations and prosecutorial decisions regarding" the FCIC referrals, noting that the "additional information may help in the examination of this failure." In the Comey letter, Warren acknowledges that the FBI "does not typically release internal documents from its investigations," but that the bureau under Comey recently set new precedent for doing so with its disclosure of information pertaining to the investigation of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's email server. At the time, Comey said that "making these materials available to the public [was] in the interest of transparency." "These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals," Warren writes. "If Secretary Clinton's email server was of sufficient 'interest' to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then sure the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to he same level of transparency." She concludes: "For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of 'intense public interest' about which 'the American people deserve the details' than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is not willing to let him go without a full explanation as to why his administration refused to jail the Wall Street banksters behind the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In a letter sent to Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general Michael Horowitz on Thursday, the progressive firebrand demanded an investigation into why the DOJ refused to file criminal charges against individuals despite “‘serious indications of violation[s]’ of federal securities and other laws,” uncovered by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) probe into the causes of the economic crash. Warren said her staff reviewed thousands of documents recently made public by the FCIC, and identified “11 separate FCIC referrals of individuals or corporations to DOJ in cases where the FCIC found” such evidence. According to Warren, “Nine individuals were implicated in these referrals (two were implicated twice).” The DOJ, she continued, “has not filed any criminal prosecutions against any of the nine individuals. Not one of the nine has gone to prison or been convicted of a criminal offense. Not a single one has even been indicted or brought to trial.” Advertisement Square, Site wide Further, she notes that her staff review “identified potentially illegal activity at 14 corporations (including five that were implicated in multiple referrals).” Though there were five corporations that reached a settlement with the DOJ, not one was criminally indicted or brought to trial. Summarizing the letter, financial reporter David Dayen noted that the corporate criminals examined in the FCIC documents included: ... most of America’s largest banks—Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual (now part of JPMorgan), and Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America)—along with foreign banking giants UBS, Credit Suisse, and Société Generale, auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, credit rating agency Moody’s, insurance company AIG, and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FCIC presented DOJ with evidence that these institutions gave false representations about the loan quality inside mortgage-backed securities; misled credit ratings agencies; overstated assets and earnings in financial disclosures; failed to disclose credit downgrades, subprime exposure and the financial health of their operations to shareholders; and suffered breakdowns in internal company controls. All of these were tied to specific violations of federal law. And the FCIC named names, specifying nine top-level executives who should be investigated on criminal charges: CEO Daniel Mudd and CFO Stephen Swad of Fannie Mae, CEO Martin Sullivan and CFO Stephen Bensinger of AIG, CEO Stan O’Neal and CFO Jeffrey Edwards of Merrill Lynch, and CEO Chuck Prince, CFO Gary Crittenden and Board Chairman Robert Rubin of Citigroup. “The DOJ’s failure to obtain any criminal convictions of any of the individuals or corporations named in the FCIC referrals suggests that the department has failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable,” Warren concludes. “This failure requires an explanations.” Thursday also marks eight years since Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Warren said the anniversary is “a good occasion to stop and ask where the real accountability is and get some answers out of the Justice Department about why they haven’t prosecuted anyone.” On social media, Warren reiterated that point: 8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy & millions of people suffered for it.— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 15, 2016 Warren also wrote to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), on Thursday asking for his department to release “any and all materials related to the FBI’s investigations and prosecutorial decisions regarding” the FCIC referrals, noting that the “additional information may help in the examination of this failure.” In the Comey letter, Warren acknowledges that the FBI “does not typically release internal documents from its investigations,” but that the bureau under Comey recently set new precedent for doing so with its disclosure of information pertaining to the investigation of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s email server. At the time, Comey said that “making these materials available to the public [was] in the interest of transparency.” “These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals,” Warren writes. “If Secretary Clinton’s email server was of sufficient ‘interest’ to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then sure the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency.” She concludes: “For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of ‘intense public interest’ about which ‘the American people deserve the details’ than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.” TAGS: 2008 bailout bank of america banksters citigroup doj elizabeth warren fcic goldman sachs jpmorgan chase president obama wall street Related Entries None of Them Has Ever Been My President Throw Wall Street Out of the Democratic Party Elizabeth Warren Sends Letter to Trump: ‘You Already Appear to Be Failing’ on Campaign Promises Glenn Greenwald on Who’s to Blame for Trump’s Election Email to a friend Get truth delivered to your inbox every day.

(VIAB), Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) and Bluebird Bio Inc (BLUE) AERI and BLUE should open Thursday strongly higher, while VIAB is trending up against a few headwinds Sep 15, 2016, 8:31 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Tech stocks rose 0.6% yesterday, which was a bright spot among what was otherwise a dreary day for U.S. equities. The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4%. Thursday morning could see a bit of a rebound, however, led in part by Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:AERI), Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAB) and Bluebird Bio Inc (NASDAQ:BLUE) Here’s what’s moving these stocks today: Viacom Inc. (VIAB) VIAB shares were up in early trade despite a price-target cut from JPMorgan. JPMorgan analysts have dropped their PT on VIAB shares from $50 to $48. Shares are off about 9% this year as the company heads into the second day of their regularly scheduled board meeting. 7 Energy Stocks You Need to Dump Right Now One of the potential topics making the rounds: A cut to the company’s dividend, spurred by murmurs of potential debt rating cuts and the reported hiring of Morgan Stanley and Lion Tree to look over Viacom’s capital structure. The dividend rumor is mostly based around the fact that Viacom has not yet announced its next payment — something it typically would’ve done by the end of August. VIAB shares were up 1% in morning trade nonetheless. Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) Aerie Pharmaceuticals shares are skyrocketing following an update surrounding its new drug, which treats eye illnesses. The company examined the most recent 90-day period of a 12-month study known as Phase 3 that treats patients with Roclatan. The medication helps ameliorate glaucoma and other symptoms related to eye diseases. The clinical trial proved to be stronger than Aerie’s other products, including Rhopressa, which is used for similar purposes. Patients receive one dosage of the drug a day. 61% of patients experienced a reduction of diurnal intraocular pressure, which refers to the pressure that eye fluids cause. AERI shares were set to open Thursday up 66%. Bluebird Bio Inc (BLUE) BLUE shares were up strongly in Thursday’s morning trade amid news that Goldman Sachs has added the company to its Conviction Buy List. Goldman sees a whopping 115% upside in Bluebird Bio, citing a price target of $135. The firm points out that Bluebird is at a “value-inflection point,” citing the company’s upcoming Gen1 vs. Gen2 data in October and a LentiGlobin update in December, as well as pivotal readouts in mid-2017. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Sells Out iPhone 7 Plus, Punishes Be Per the Gen1/Gen2 data, Goldman says “We expect higher transduction efficientcy (~80%-90% vs. ~40% prior) and vector copy number (2x-4x higher) to drive substantial efficacy improvements, which may be underappreciated by the Street.” BLUE stock was up 5% before Thursday’s open.

Morgan Asset Management Launches First Fixed Income ETF: JPHY --strategy takes advantage of potential opportunities in the high yield market-- News provided by J.P. Morgan Asset Management Sep 15, 2016, 09:30 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- J.P. Morgan Asset Management announced that the JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield (JPHY) actively-managed ETF officially launched today for trading. With interest rates at historically low levels high yield investments offer increased income potential with lower rate sensitivity and reduced correlations to U.S. Treasuries. However, the high yield universe includes segments where risk has not been rewarded with commensurate return. JPHY provides high yield exposure by systematically excluding securities that exhibit what may be considered unattractive risk-reward profiles. The result is a low-cost solution seeking higher risk-adjusted returns and lower credit risk relative to existing passive options. "Fixed income is an important component of an investor's diversification strategy and JPHY makes the high yield segment of the market more accessible, in a cost-effective manner," said Robert Deutsch, Global Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "Additionally, corporate high yield bonds tend to outperform during periods of rising rates and economic growth, which has been a concern for our clients given the challenging market conditions." The fund is run by a seasoned and well-resourced high yield investment team with over $35bn in AUM. Each of the senior managers has more than 20 years of experience navigating multiple market cycles. With the launch of JPHY, J.P. Morgan Asset Management expands its ETF suite to 10 products. About J.P. Morgan Funds J.P. Morgan Funds is the mutual fund arm of J.P. Morgan Asset Management.  It is the 7th largest long-term manager in the U.S., with over $263 billion in long-term assets under management across a broad range of investment strategies in fixed income, equity, multi-asset, alternatives and absolute return.  J.P. Morgan Asset Management, with assets under management of $1.7 trillion (as of December 31, 2015), is a global leader in investment management. J.P. Morgan Asset Management's clients include institutions, retail investors and high-net worth individuals in every major market throughout the world.  J.P. Morgan Asset Management offers global investment management in equities, fixed income, real estate, hedge funds, private equity and liquidity.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), the parent company of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, is a leading global financial services firm with assets of approximately $2.4 trillion (as of December 31, 2015) and operations in more than 60 countries.  Information about JPMorgan Chase & Co. is available at www.jpmorganchase.com. Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of the fund before investing. The summary and full prospectuses contain this and other information about the fund. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. (Call 1-844-4JPM-ETF or visit jpmorganetfs.com to obtain a prospectus). Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. International investing has a greater degree of risk and increased volatility due to political and economic instability of some overseas markets. Changes in currency exchange rates and different accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can affect returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and decreased trading volume. The Fund is actively managed and may not achieve its objective. Actively-managed funds typically charge more than index-linked products. Investments in smaller companies may be riskier, more volatile and more vulnerable to economic, market and industry changes. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. The value of investments in mortgage-related and asset-backed securities will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market. They may decline in value, face valuation difficulties, become more volatile and/or become illiquid. They are also subject to prepayment risk. REITs are subject to the same risks as direct investments in real estate and mortgages, including default, prepayments, changes in interest rates, demand for real and rental property, and the management skill and creditworthiness of REIT issuers. The market value of a zero-coupon, pay-in-kind or deferred payment security is generally more volatile than other fixed income securities with similar maturities and credit quality that pay interest periodically. Privately placed securities generally are less liquid than publicly traded securities and the Fund may not always be able to sell such securities without experiencing delays in finding buyers or reducing the sale price for such securities. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. The fund is actively managed and may not achieve its objective. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss. J.P. Morgan Exchange-Traded Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co, One Freedom Valley Dr., Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any of its affiliates.

Tracy Alloway tracyalloway September 15, 2016 — 3:58 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Should Bond Traders Brace for Bubble of a Lifetime? Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp We’ve seen this movie before. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Jay Barry point out that the latest sell-offs in government bonds and the rising yields they've produced resemble the 'taper tantrum' that engulfed markets back in 2013 as investors fretted about the potential for the Federal Reserve to reduce the pace of its asset purchases. Yields on sovereign debt have jumped in recent days thanks in part to concerns over the ability or willingness of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to continue their unconventional monetary policies, JPMorgan argues. But if those concerns were the spark that lit the fire, investors' collective positioning was the gasoline that fanned the subsequent flames. "At least a portion of the recent rise in Treasury yields has been driven by shifting perceptions of monetary policy at other developed market central banks," the JPMorgan analysts said. "Coupled with still-long position technicals and rich valuations, the setup is somewhat similar to the preconditions before the taper tantrum in 2013 and the euro tantrum in 2015." A JPMorgan survey of its clients showed investors were unusually long sovereign debt in the run-up to the recent sell-off. Portfolios were nearly two standard deviations longer relative to their medium-term average, while the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded richer relative to its fair value than they had been at any point in more than four years.  Source: JPMorgan Source: JPMorgan All of which sets the scene for a potential move higher as investors focus on upcoming central bank gatherings including the Fed's and the BOJ's two-day policy meetings next week.  Instead of buying more Japanese government debt (JGBs), the BOJ may opt to turn its purchasing to corporate bonds and local government bonds as it attempts to avoid further harming banks, pension funds, and insurers, JPMorgan economists have argued. Less JGB-buying would likely steepen the so-called yield curve and could cause a further sell-off in government debt. "Our Japanese economists continue to expect a 20 basis point cut in the policy rate, but they now think the BOJ will attempt to mitigate the cost of [its negative interest rate policy] in part by trying to steepen the yield curve," the analysts conclude. "Any attempt by the BOJ to steepen the yield curve next week could potentially lead Treasury yields to rise further from current levels."   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In 2010, he was the chief financial officer at Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, Italy’s third-largest bank, and a member of the senior management team that led it to the edge of collapse. Now, six years after leaving the firm, Morelli is returning as chief executive officer, charged with averting a failure that would reverberate throughout Italy and beyond. Marco Morelli Photographer: Augusto Casasoli/A3/contrasto via Redux Morelli is joining from Bank of America Corp. just as Monte Paschi is preparing to execute a last-ditch plan to sell 27.7 billion euros ($31.1 billion) of bad loans and raise 5 billion euros. That’s after the bank tapped shareholders twice and took two state bailouts since 2009. Some longtime observers are surprised the board chose an executive from the bank’s troubled past at the very moment it’s trying to secure its future. “Mr. Morelli was a key manager during a disastrous epoch,” said Fabrizio Bernardi, a Milan-based analyst with Fidentiis Equities who has a sell rating on Monte Paschi’s shares. “It’s counterintuitive that a manager is called back to restore a situation created when he was the bank’s CFO.” Chairman Resigns Yet Federico Santi, an analyst at Eurasia Group specializing in southern Europe, says the board’s selection makes sense. Morelli was steeped in the inner workings of Monte Paschi. What’s more, he has the support of the government and formerly ran the Italian business of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a lead adviser to Monte Paschi on the capital-raising strategy and an arranger of the planned stock offering. "Morelli knows Monte Paschi inside and out and is intimately familiar with the turnaround plan," Santi said. "Having an ‘insider’ at the helm will increase the chances the restructuring and recapitalization will be successful." Morelli’s appointment, announced Wednesday evening, punctuated a tumultuous week for the embattled lender. On Sept. 8, the bank abruptly announced that CEO Fabrizio Viola, who oversaw the recapitalization plan, was quitting. Then Monte Paschi dropped the bombshell Wednesday that Massimo Tononi, chairman since September 2015 and a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was stepping down, too. Morelli will assume the CEO and general manager positions on Sept. 20, the bank said. “Tononi’s departure is a further signal that those who are running the deal from the financial side want different people managing the bank,” said Jacopo Ceccatelli, CEO of Marzotto SIM SpA, a Milan-based broker-dealer. Monte Paschi’s shares rose 2 percent to 22.85 cents by 10:45 a.m. in Milan trading, the biggest gain on the 30-member Euro Stoxx Banks Index. That said, the stock remains down 80 percent this year. Morelli, 54, a wiry Rome native, is known in Italian banking circles as a sometimes brusque but hard-working professional who can deliver under pressure. A 1984 graduate of Luiss University of Rome with a degree in economics and finance, he ascended the ranks while toggling between executive roles at American banks in Italy and domestic lenders. Morelli was considered among the top candidates for recent CEO openings at UniCredit SpA, Italy’s No. 1 bank, and No. 2 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, according to press reports. Judgment Issue Described by friends and former colleagues as a fitness enthusiast who cycles, skis and plays tennis, Morelli cut a sober figure in a 2015 speech to students at his alma mater. Clad in black suit, white shirt and black necktie, he stressed the importance of judgment in building a successful career. “The more you move on the more you’ll understand that what counts is judgment,” he said in English. “You will be asked to opine on a number of things, people will seek your advice, so slow down and think about it, because that’s what’s going to build your CV. That’s the way your judgment is gauged by others.” Now Morelli’s decisions -- both past and present -- will be scrutinized like never before. He returns to Monte Paschi at a time of mounting anxiety in Italy. The country’s commercial banks are straining under 360 billion euros in doubtful loans, even as a national referendum looms that could make or break the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who wants to end Italy’s chronic political dysfunction and solidify his hold on power. Political and financial leaders in Berlin, Brussels, and Frankfurt are watching closely. For more information on Italy’s banking problems, click here "The Italian banking problem in the short term is the biggest issue facing the euro zone, counting Brexit," said Nicolas Veron, a Washington-based senior fellow with Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels. Renzi and his finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, have been improvising ways to shore up lenders without resorting to direct state aid under European Union rules, which would probably force losses on retail investors. In April, they persuaded Italian banks to set up a 4 billion-euro rescue fund dubbed Atlante. Critics have deemed the program too small to restore confidence given that non-performing debt is equivalent to a fifth of Italian gross domestic product.  Monte Paschi, a lender that’s anchored civic life in the Tuscan city of Siena for more than five centuries, has become the flash point in the escalating drama, and Morelli has found himself center stage. He joined Monte Paschi’s capital markets unit in 2004 after an eight-year term as CEO and general manager of JPMorgan’s Italian operations. By 2007, he’d become deputy general manager, one of the bank’s top executives. That year the board, led by Chairman Giuseppe Mussari, attempted to vault Monte Paschi into the big leagues by spending 9 billion euros in cash for Banca Antonveneta SpA in northern Italy. Horse Race When the global financial crash struck the following year, more than $925 million in losses largely from the deal poleaxed the Tuscan bank. Monte Paschi hired global investment banks to create derivative contracts that could ease the losses. Meantime, it suffered the ignominy of no longer being able to pay for the medieval costumes worn by riders in the famous Palio horse race that’s run in Siena every summer. In 2013, Monte Paschi became the target of national outrage when news broke that it used complex derivatives transactions fashioned by Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura Holdings Inc. to hide millions of euros in losses. This February, prosecutors in Milan sought indictments of 13 former and current executives at Monte Paschi, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura for allegedly colluding to falsify the Italian bank’s accounting between 2008 and 2012, manipulate its share price, and obstruct investigations by the authorities. The executives have denied the allegations, and preliminary hearings to determine whether they will face trial are continuing to take place this week in Milan. Not Implicated Morelli was not implicated in the case. As CFO, he was one of three Monte Paschi executives involved in discussing one of the swap transactions, according to Deutsche Bank documents seen by Bloomberg News. Two people briefed on Morelli’s role at the time say Morelli didn’t approve the transactions. In 2013, the Bank of Italy fined Morelli 208,500 euros for his role in a Monte Paschi transaction dubbed FRESH, according to central bank records. More than a dozen other executives were also penalized. Morelli denied the allegations and appealed the action, and the matter is pending. In a separate action in December 2013, prosecutors cleared Morelli of alleged wrongdoing in the case. Morelli, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on his tenure at Monte Paschi. Atlante Fund In 2010, he decamped to Intesa, where he served as general manager and deputy to the CEO. Two years later he moved to Bank of America. He worked closely with government officials on the privatization of Poste Italiane SpA, which raised 3.1 billion euros in an equity sale. As one of the bankers who helped design the Atlante rescue fund, Morelli worked side-by-side with Finance Minister Padoan and his team, according to a person familiar with the situation. Selling Paschi’s stock and bad loans will be no mean feat in a market wracked with doubt about Italy’s prospects, especially if Renzi’s referendum fails. JPMorgan, whose history in Italy dates back to the 19th century, has a lot riding on a successful offering. In July, CEO Jamie Dimon discussed the fate of Monte Paschi with Renzi over lunch in Rome, according to a person familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified. Within days, JPMorgan had elbowed its way onto Monte Paschi’s equity offering as co-lead adviser. Now former JPMorgan executive Morelli is taking charge of the bank. ‘Banking Fragility’ While a successful restructuring may buy the world’s oldest bank some time, it will do little to address the deeper problems that plague the euro zone’s third-largest economy, says Bruegel’s Veron. Bad loans are the easy part. Disentangling Italy’s banking and political systems, a governance regime that fosters inefficiencies and poor underwriting, remains the larger task. "Italy has a pervasive problem of banking fragility and that problem won’t go away even if Monte Paschi is patched up," Veron said. "And that means the economy and the people will continue to suffer." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

What's Killing Branches Can Make Them Stronger By Tanaya Macheel September 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 1 Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Related B of A Digital Team Has a Fat Budget and a Whole Bunch of Plans UMB Emulates Apple in Push to Encourage Mobile, Online Use Bank Branches Don't Die, They Evolve JPM Introduces Mobile Authentication at ATMs How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Smaller, yet service-oriented. Compatible with digital banking. Profitable. That is the vision increasingly being painted of the bank branch of the future. And before dismissing it as a delusion of the glass-is-half-full crowd, consider that notably tech-savvy companies like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and UMB Financial are among those making the case that branches are still essential to setting a bank apart from its rivals. JPMorgan's branches have been crucial in building long-term relationships with more lucrative customers, even in today's high-tech world, said Erin Hill, the company's head of consumer branch banking and wealth management. Its younger, "more digitally active" employees spend time helping customers with more complex questions, using mobile phones and tablets to provide service and develop a rapport, she explained. "If we were trying to shift to an all-digital channel I don't think we'd have nearly the success we've had," Hill said. The future-of-the-branch debate took a new twist this month after Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle charges that thousands of employees created unauthorized bank and credit card accounts for customers from 2011 to 2014 in order to meet sales goals and collect bonuses for themselves. It has sparked a discussion about whether banks, worried about the crushing overhead from quieter branches, are putting too much pressure on employees to generate revenue. "The declining transaction volumes render sales more difficult," said Steven Reider, founder and president of the marketing and branch-planning adviser Bancography. "Can we keep rationing sales goals inexorably upward when branch traffic is declining? The answer is no." Yet equating transaction decline with branch decline misses the fundamental point that branches no longer exist to cash checks, Reider said. More consumers receive direct deposits now, they pay bills electronically and withdraw cash from ATMs. Business receive less cash now or perhaps offload it through cash back at the point of sale. Branches are starting to shrink in square footage and number of staff, and the average salary for branch employees will increase so they can keep who employees who can deliver more sophisticated services, Reider said. JPMorgan's Hill painted a similar picture, and said it's not necessarily a dire reality. "The truth is: if you look at the activity from customers coming in for basic transactions at the teller line, those are not necessarily the people growing their balances and leading to the growth of the overall business," Hill said. "We try to help our bankers understand the lessening of foot traffic does not at all affect their ability to deepen relationships with customers." Moreover, the point is not to see the branch and digital as antithetical, she and others said. "We cannot be naive to the fact that our customers want to be able to engage with us when and where they want in a very easy manner, hence the continued investment in the other channels," Hill said of mobile, digital and other innovation efforts and initiatives. "You can't have a successful branch network without those." It's still a people business at heart, and the branch is the place to provide a higher level of service that breeds customer loyalty, said Joe Salesky, chief executive of CRMNEXT, a customer-engagement software provider for financial services. "There's no ability to differentiate the self-service. … What's it going to take to be a bank of service, to help the bank transform?" His answer? Bring the physical and digital worlds together in customer interactions, Salesky said. Like Apple Stores, where bank associates would help customers side by side instead of face to face, using mobile devices as tools for service. It would be more comfortable yet still personal. Customers could book appointments with branch representatives in advance or walk in off the street for hands-on digital banking demos. Bank of America is already doing that. Its 3,800 "digital ambassadors," easily identifiable by the lanyards they wear to customers who enter their branches, are trained to help customers better understand and navigate the mobile app or website for themselves — a sort of service for self-service. Inspired by Apple's Genius Bar and Best Buy's Geek Squad, the year-old initiative at B of A also lets customers book appointments to digital ambassador bars. Similarly, in March 2014 UMB in Kansas City, Mo., put tech support specialists in its branches to help customers understand how to make mobile deposits and use online bill pay and other digital services. "In-branch traffic is going down across the country," Christine Pierson, head of UMB's financial consumer division, said at the time. "[We're] interested in ways to get customers to be engaged with the bank." That kind of side-by-side learning would give banks more opportunity to cross-sell. There is also an understanding gap between customers and the products banks are selling — which amount to far more than the number of products Apple has to sell, and with which many customers are largely unfamiliar. Hill emphasized the importance of empathy, acknowledging the personal conversations, sometimes emotional and sometimes uncomfortable, that occur between bankers and clients when the latter are purchasing a home, saving for retirement, funding a child's education or financing a business. She pointed to JPMorgan's branch in the retail area of the new World Trade Center complex in New York. At 2,700 square feet, it's about 35% smaller than the company's typical branch. But there are 11 ATMs throughout the large shopping area that can perform about 60% of basic bank transactions, giving customers a self-service option so JPMorgan can reallocate its branch space for one-on-one meetings. Inside the branch, there are just two teller windows, four offices for customers to discuss their more complex needs with bankers, and a private-banking team. JPMorgan has no plans to incorporate its own Genius Bars or remodel branch floors into a coffee house environment, Hill said, but its philosophy has nuances of Apple's old "Think Different" mantra. "We're continuing to think differently as to what would make something easier for our customer" through focus groups, its innovation lab and feedback from 250,000 employees, she said. "It's not just that we're going to keep doing what we're doing. We're going to continue to think differently."

The challenge still relies on the digital interaction for cross-sell because the customer that choose those channels usually is interested in completing the required operation as fast as possible without spending time to look at different offers.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint A study by JPMorgan Chase Bank’s India economists says the sharp rise in currency holdings with the public in India is explained by a rise in rural wages. “The real growth of currency-in-circulation has a stable, long-run relationship with the rural economy, as proxied by real rural wages,” wrote economists Sajjid Z. Chinoy and Toshi Jain in a 14 September report. Their model shows 67% of the recent increase in higher cash holdings in the economy can be explained by rural wages alone.  At the end of August, annual growth of currency in circulation was 17.6%, a clear 7 percentage points higher than a year ago. The growth in cash holding started around September 2015, led to tighter liquidity conditions and has been one of the reasons for the central bank to shift its liquidity stance.  Click here for enlarge Conventional wisdom said currency holdings with the public shoots up during elections. But public currency holdings growth continued to accelerate after the assembly elections in May.  New reasons came into vogue. Some economists said it was owing to a rise in service taxes, while others said it was driven by the government’s stricter rules for purchase of gold jewellery, leading to people holding on to cash. The JPMorgan economists said the currency holdings growth seems to mimic the rural economy. As rural growth accelerated sharply in the mid-2000s because of government programmes such as Bharat Nirman and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, currency holdings also grew.  Conversely, the rural economy slowdown since led to a moderation in currency holding growth till the end of 2015.  That the currency growth can be explained by the rural economy is also “consistent with the fact that other indicators (motorcycle sales) suggest the rural economy may be inflecting,” wrote Chinoy and Jain. Why is this important?  As rural incomes grow even more—on the back of a better monsoon and good harvests —there is a possibility that currency holdings growth will accelerate even more. Thus, if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stays committed to its stance of keeping the liquidity deficit neutral, it will make the process of liquidity management more challenging. That will either necessitate more dollar purchases (releasing rupees into the system), which appears difficult because of the coming repatriation of FCNR(B) deposits or buying more bonds though open market operations. RBI has already purchased Rs1 trillion worth of bonds this fiscal.  To be sure, a balance of payments surplus and robust capital inflows will reduce the pressure on open market bond purchases. But a large amount of bond buying from RBI will help transmission, Chinoy and Jain added.  However, that also adds to RBI’s problems. If rural growth accelerates, it pushes up inflation and currency in circulation. “But that’s a potential conundrum for a later date,” they wrote.

The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares were down 8.5 percent in premarket trading. Dow component Goldman Sachs fell 0.6 percent, while JPMorgan dropped 0.5 percent. Oil prices fell 1.6 percent on worries of oversupply. Energy stocks were among the biggest losers among S&P 500 components. Dow e-minis were down 59 points, or 0.33 percent at 8:33 a.m. ET, with 29,133 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 8 points, or 0.37 percent, with 262,735 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 16 points, or 0.33 percent, on volume of 39,386 contracts. Investors also await the Federal Reserve's meeting starting next Tuesday. While traders have very low expectations of an interest rate hike, investors will be keen for commentary on how the central bank views on the recent sluggish economic data. The data and contrasting comments from Fed officials on rate hikes have caused the markets to oscillate and volatility to spike in the past few days. "Like it has been before, Mr. Market gets it right in the long term but tends to over react in the short term, and that's what we have seen all this week," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Volatility may rise again on as Friday, which marks the quadruple witching day, a day when investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration. Data showed consumer prices increased more than expected in August, pointing to a steady build-up of inflation - a key factor that the Fed considers while deliberating over monetary policy. Exxon was down 1.28 percent at $83.99 after the Wall Street Journal said the New York Attorney General was investigating the company's accounting practices. Apple was flat at $115.01. The stock has rallied for four days and been the one bright spot in the market on strong demand for the new iPhones, which hit stores on Friday. Oracle dropped 2.72 percent to $39.75 after the company forecast lower-than-expected quarterly profit. Depomed soared 14.2 percent after sources told Reuters the drug maker is preparing to put itself up for sale.

The energy index was a close second, declining 0.94 percent as oil prices fell 2.2 percent on worries of oversupply. At 9:39 a.m. ET (1339 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 90.12 points, or 0.49 percent, at 18,122.36. The S&P 500 was down 10.13 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,137.13. All the benchmark's major sectors were lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.61 points, or 0.28 percent, at 5,235.08. Helping the tech-heavy index was Intel's 3.14 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. However, Oracle was a drag, dropping 2.72 percent to $39.75 after it issued a disappointing quarterly profit. Investors also await the Federal Reserve's meeting starting next Tuesday.

Back in July, he claimed Deutsche’s conservative corporate bankers wanted to spin-off the investment bank into a separate entity. Today’s news that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) wants to slap a $14bn (€12.5bn) fine on Deutsche for mis-selling mortgaged backed securities before the financial crisis would seem to strengthen their hand. Deutsche intends to fight the fine, but the bank’s shares fell 8% this morning after news of its enormity surfaced. They’ve since recovered slightly, but not enough to reassure the likes of Mueller or the markets. The proposed $14bn fine is a huge deal for Deutsche There are various reasons why the DOJ fine is a big deal for Deutsche Bank and the 24,000 people working in Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank, of whom 4,700 are in front office investment banking jobs. 1. Deutsche had expected the fine to be a lot lower As analysts at J.P. Morgan pointed out in a report yesterday, Deutsche had put aside $6.2bn in litigation reserves at the end of June 2016. J.P.M expected Deutsche to put aside a further $2.1bn in the second half of this year and $1.1bn next year, bringing the reserves to $9.4bn in total by the end of 2017. If the $14bn fine goes through, Deutsche’s reserves will therefore be woefully inadequate. To make matters worse, the DOJ isn’t the only authority with Deutsche in its sights. There’s a possible penalty of between $1bn and $4bn for the bank’s alleged involvement in Russian money laundering in the pipeline, and Deutsche’s second quarter results highlighted six other pending investigations, at least. 2. The fine is equivalent to 74% of Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization  Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization currently stands at €16.9bn ($19bn). The DOJ fine is therefore 74% of the bank’s current value. It’s no surprise Deutsche’s shares are plummeting. 3. The fine threatens Deutsche’s capital base This is the crux of the matter. J.P. Morgan’s analysts suggested yesterday that a settlement with the DOJ in excess of $4bn would raise questions about Deutsche’s capital position. – And Deutsche’s capital position was already questionable. By 2018, Deutsche Bank needs a core equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio of 12.25% under the European Banking Association’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).  Even assuming a successful sale of Postbank, J.P. Morgan’s analysts were expecting that Deutsche would be below that, at just 11.2%. That shortfall now looks like being a lot worse. If fines exceed the $9.4bn of litigation provisions Deutsche is expected to have amassed next year, J.P.M says every $1bn extra will reduce Deutsche’s 2017 CET1 ratio by 24bps. Today’s proposed $14bn fine therefore implies a 120bps reduction in Deutsche’s CET1 ratio. This could be supplemented by a further 96 basis point reduction if the Russian fines come through at the top end of the expected range – To say nothing of additional fines for other misdemeanours. In the worst case scenario (and assuming a successful sale of Postbank), J.P. Morgan’s analysis therefore suggest Deutsche could now arrive in 2018 with a CET1 capital shortfall of 216bps due to the DOJ and Russian fines as well as the 105bps shortfall it was facing already. Put another way, Deutsche was already facing a $2.5bn capital hole. Unless the DOJ cuts today’s fine, the German bank is now facing a capital hole of $7.1bn – and more if other Russian and other fines are levied too. 4. Deutsche will struggle to raise additional capital  The implied 321bps capital shortfall and resulting CET1 ratio of just 9.04% would be an issue for any bank, but for Deutsche Bank it’s potentially disastrous. With the bank’s share price down 47% since the start of this year, another rights issue is out of the question. And with the cost of insuring Deutsche Bank’s debt already high and now rising, tapping bondholders looks impossible too. Of course, there’s always the possibility of selling the asset management division – but Cryan ruled this out earlier this week.  5. Deutsche bank will need to make additional big cuts to its risk weighted assets  The other solution is for Deutsche to cut even deeper than it already planned to. The bank had €402bn of risk weighted assets on its books as of the second quarter of 2016.  Deutsche CEO John Cryan already intended to cut the bank’s RWAs by €120bn, but there’s been little real sign of cuts in the global markets division so far. – At the end of the second quarter, RWAs in global markets were actually up on the previous year, at €170bn, vs. €168bn at Q215. So far, the global markets business has been protected, but the impending capital shortfall resulting from today’s fine (even if that fine is cut dramatically) means Deutsche will need to get much more serious about cutting RWAs in future. And, despite Cryan’s previous protestations that Deutsche is “unreservedly committed” to its markets business, it looks like a good place to start. 6. Meanwhile, Deutsche’s unhappy staff stand to become unhappier still  Deutsche insiders say its investment bank staff are unhappy: “They’re scared, and rightfully so.” Senior managing directors at the bank have their deferred stock bonuses tied up for five years, and are angry with this year’s collapse in the bank’s share price. The bank also operates an unusually punitive clawback policy under which the entire tranche of bonuses due to vest in any particular year is wiped out if the bank makes a loss at group level. Not only are 2016 bonuses at Deutsche likely to be awful, and not only have past year’s deferred bonuses collapsed, but past year’s deferred payouts now look likely to be withheld entirely. Deutsche risks having its best salespeople and traders poached by rivals as a result. “Other banks are feeding on our people,” complains one insider. “Remaining employees are super-concerned, again further impacting performance.” Berenberg analyst James Chappell raised eyebrows in May when he said Deutsche was stuck in a “vicious circle” of falling revenues, impaired profitability and limited options for raising more capital. That circle suddenly looks more vicious than ever. 7. Will Deutsche become RBS? In the worst of worse case scenarios, the German government could come to the rescue. This is what the ever-pessimistic Mueller is expecting. “The German banking sector will be the number one story in Europe over the next few years,” he predicts. “The big German banks are not in a position to raise more capital and they need to. At the end of the day, both Deutsche and Commerzbank will be moved under an umbrella run by the German government. Fundamentally, this is their only chance of survival.” Of course, the fine might always be reduced…. The other alternative is for the DOJ to cut the proposed $14bn fine to something more manageable. The fine itself is widely seen as a tit-for-tat response by the U.S. government to the equally large fine slapped on Apple by the European Union at the end of August. If the EU cuts Apple’s fine, maybe the DOJ will cut Deutsche’s too? BreakingViews suggests Deutsche is in a strong bargaining position: perversely, the German bank’s capital weakness and systemic importance should make governments think twice before destabilising it further. The problem is that the DOJ will need to cut the fine by a lot. J.P. Morgan’s analysts think a $2.4bn settlement would be manageable for Deutsche, and that the bank could accommodate a $4bn fine, max. Anything more is an issue. Will the DOJ really cut its proposed fine by 70%? The WSJ says there could be “court battles” on the subject. The problem for Deutsche is that court battles take time – and the bank will need to reassure investors on its capital hole as soon as possible.

If the $14bn fine goes through, Deutsche’s reserves will therefore be woefully inadequate. To make matters worse, the DOJ isn’t the only authority with Deutsche in its sights. There’s a possible penalty of between $1bn and $4bn for the bank’s alleged involvement in Russian money laundering in the pipeline, and Deutsche’s second quarter results highlighted six other pending investigations, at least. 2. The fine is equivalent to 74% of Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization  Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization currently stands at €16.9bn ($19bn). The DOJ fine is therefore 74% of the bank’s current value. It’s no surprise Deutsche’s shares are plummeting. 3. The fine threatens Deutsche’s capital base This is the crux of the matter. J.P. Morgan’s analysts suggested yesterday that a settlement with the DOJ in excess of $4bn would raise questions about Deutsche’s capital position. – And Deutsche’s capital position was already questionable. By 2018, Deutsche Bank needs a core equity tier one (CET1) capital ratio of 12.25% under the European Banking Association’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).  Even assuming a successful sale of Postbank, J.P. Morgan’s analysts were expecting that Deutsche would be below that, at just 11.2%. That shortfall now looks like being a lot worse. If fines exceed the $9.4bn of litigation provisions Deutsche is expected to have amassed next year, J.P.M says every $1bn extra will reduce Deutsche’s 2017 CET1 ratio by 24bps. Today’s proposed $14bn fine therefore implies a 120bps reduction in Deutsche’s CET1 ratio. This could be supplemented by a further 96 basis point reduction if the Russian fines come through at the top end of the expected range – To say nothing of additional fines for other misdemeanours. In the worst case scenario (and assuming a successful sale of Postbank), J.P. Morgan’s analysis therefore suggest Deutsche could now arrive in 2018 with a CET1 capital shortfall of 216bps due to the DOJ and Russian fines as well as the 105bps shortfall it was facing already. Put another way, Deutsche was already facing a $2.5bn capital hole. Unless the DOJ cuts today’s fine, the German bank is now facing a capital hole of $7.1bn – and more if other Russian and other fines are levied too. 4. Deutsche will struggle to raise additional capital  The implied 321bps capital shortfall and resulting CET1 ratio of just 9.04% would be an issue for any bank, but for Deutsche Bank it’s potentially disastrous. With the bank’s share price down 47% since the start of this year, another rights issue is out of the question. And with the cost of insuring Deutsche Bank’s debt already high and now rising, tapping bondholders looks impossible too. Of course, there’s always the possibility of selling the asset management division – but Cryan ruled this out earlier this week.  5. Deutsche bank will need to make additional big cuts to its risk weighted assets  The other solution is for Deutsche to cut even deeper than it already planned to. The bank had €402bn of risk weighted assets on its books as of the second quarter of 2016.  Deutsche CEO John Cryan already intended to cut the bank’s RWAs by €120bn, but there’s been little real sign of cuts in the global markets division so far. – At the end of the second quarter, RWAs in global markets were actually up on the previous year, at €170bn, vs. €168bn at Q215. So far, the global markets business has been protected, but the impending capital shortfall resulting from today’s fine (even if that fine is cut dramatically) means Deutsche will need to get much more serious about cutting RWAs in future. And, despite Cryan’s previous protestations that Deutsche is “unreservedly committed” to its markets business, it looks like a good place to start. 6. Meanwhile, Deutsche’s unhappy staff stand to become unhappier still  Deutsche insiders say its investment bank staff are unhappy: “They’re scared, and rightfully so.” Senior managing directors at the bank have their deferred stock bonuses tied up for five years, and are angry with this year’s collapse in the bank’s share price. The bank also operates an unusually punitive clawback policy under which the entire tranche of bonuses due to vest in any particular year is wiped out if the bank makes a loss at group level. Not only are 2016 bonuses at Deutsche likely to be awful, and not only have past year’s deferred bonuses collapsed, but past year’s deferred payouts now look likely to be withheld entirely. Deutsche risks having its best salespeople and traders poached by rivals as a result. “Other banks are feeding on our people,” complains one insider. “Remaining employees are super-concerned, again further impacting performance.” Berenberg analyst James Chappell raised eyebrows in May when he said Deutsche was stuck in a “vicious circle” of falling revenues, impaired profitability and limited options for raising more capital. That circle suddenly looks more vicious than ever. 7. Will Deutsche become RBS? In the worst of worse case scenarios, the German government could come to the rescue. This is what the ever-pessimistic Mueller is expecting. “The German banking sector will be the number one story in Europe over the next few years,” he predicts. “The big German banks are not in a position to raise more capital and they need to. At the end of the day, both Deutsche and Commerzbank will be moved under an umbrella run by the German government. Fundamentally, this is their only chance of survival.” Of course, the fine might always be reduced…. The other alternative is for the DOJ to cut the proposed $14bn fine to something more manageable. The fine itself is widely seen as a tit-for-tat response by the U.S. government to the equally large fine slapped on Apple by the European Union at the end of August. If the EU cuts Apple’s fine, maybe the DOJ will cut Deutsche’s too? BreakingViews suggests Deutsche is in a strong bargaining position: perversely, the German bank’s capital weakness and systemic importance should make governments think twice before destabilising it further. The problem is that the DOJ will need to cut the fine by a lot. J.P. Morgan’s analysts think a $2.4bn settlement would be manageable for Deutsche, and that the bank could accommodate a $4bn fine, max. Anything more is an issue. Will the DOJ really cut its proposed fine by 70%? The WSJ says there could be “court battles” on the subject. The problem for Deutsche is that court battles take time – and the bank will need to reassure investors on its capital hole as soon as possible.

Back in July, he claimed Deutsche’s conservative corporate bankers wanted to spin-off the investment bank into a separate entity. Today’s news that the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) wants to slap a $14bn (€12.5bn) fine on Deutsche for mis-selling mortgaged backed securities before the financial crisis would seem to strengthen their hand. Deutsche intends to fight the fine, but the bank’s shares fell 8% this morning after news of its enormity surfaced. They’ve since recovered slightly, but not enough to reassure the likes of Mueller or the markets. The proposed $14bn fine is a huge deal for Deutsche There are various reasons why the DOJ fine is a big deal for Deutsche Bank and the 24,000 people working in Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank, of whom 4,700 are in front office investment banking jobs. 1.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 16, 2016 9:36am   Comments Share: Related JPM Kevin Kelly's JPMorgan Options Trade Amazon, JPMorgan, Time Warner, Royal Caribbean: Fast Money Picks For November 15 Preferred Stock Nightmare: How To Avoid A Lifetime Of Low Yield (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s J.P. Morgan Asset Management unit added its second new exchange-traded fund this week with the debut of the firm's first fixed income ETF on Thursday. The JPMorgan Disciplined High Yield ETF (NYSE: JPHY) is actively managed. JPHY holds only dollar-denominated high-yield credit of U.S. and foreign issuers. More About JPHY “The fund is run by a seasoned and well-resourced high yield investment team with over $35 billion in AUM. Each of the senior managers has more than 20 years of experience navigating multiple market cycles,” said New York-based JPMorgan Asset Management in a statement. Related Link: Less Than 10% Of Actively Managed Equity Funds Managed To Beat The S&P 500 The debut of JPHY follows the launch of the JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSE: JPHF), a hedge fund strategy ETF, on Wednesday. JPHF features a long/short equity strategy as well as an event-driven strategy designed to benefit from catalysts that could affect future share prices, including merger arbitrage opportunities. The new ETF also features a global macro strategy that can tap multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. “With interest rates at historically low levels high yield investments offer increased income potential with lower rate sensitivity and reduced correlations to U.S. Treasuries. However, the high yield universe includes segments where risk has not been rewarded with commensurate return. The Appeal Of 'Junk' “JPHY provides high yield exposure by systematically excluding securities that exhibit what may be considered unattractive risk-reward profiles. The result is a low-cost solution seeking higher risk-adjusted returns and lower credit risk relative to existing passive options,” added JPMorgan Asset Management. Junk bond ETFs have been popular with investors this year as oil prices have rebounded and the Federal Reserve has consistently held off on raising interest rates. JPHY charges 0.4 percent per year, or $40 on a $10,000 investment. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

RISING STARS Why Millennials Are Freaking Out Over a Credit Card With a $450 Annual Fee It's the perks, man. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT, a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016, serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. @JustinJBariso Founder, Insight@JustinJBariso WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's official: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has gone viral. JPMorgan Chase, which launched the credit card just a few weeks ago, told Bloomberg it approved "tens of thousands" of applications in the first two days--despite the fact that it carries ... wait for it ... a $450 annual fee. But what's really interesting about this story is who wants these cards. According to Chase spokeswoman Lauren Francis, the majority of cards are going to Millennials. Say what? The same Millennials who are (supposedly) much less interested in credit cards than their older counterparts? Just last month, The New York Times reported that Millennials "aren't pulling out the plastic" like previous generations, under the headline "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards." Take a closer look. The Times continues: Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The problem is, this data doesn't talk about Millennials' possession of credit cards, but only about how much debt they carry. It's the perks, man But if the younger generation doesn't want credit cards for debt management, why do they want them? Put simply, for the perks. For example, I know Millennials who use their credit cards for every single purchase--and pay off their account balance in full every month. They do this solely to rack up points and earn free rewards. (My younger brother, for example, built an entire wardrobe from Old Navy through rewards certificates.) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card is further proof of this. Despite the hefty fee, the card offers the following benefits. (Special shout out to The Points Guy for breaking this all down for us.) 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (with a minimum of $4,000 spend on the card within the initial three months). Points can be transferred to various partners, including multiple airlines and hotels (estimated value: at least $1,500). 3 points per dollar on all travel and dining, worldwide (including money spent on Uber and Airbnb). Automatic $300 annual rebate for travel expenses. Priority Pass Select, allowing access to over 900 travel lounges around the world. $100 Global Entry credit every five years. Enhanced travel protections under the Visa Infinite program. No foreign transaction fees. Just a little understanding of the Millennial mindset gives insight into why the credit card blew up on the internet (with one thread discussing the card on Reddit attracting 10,000 comments). So many Millennials love to travel. And they love finding bargains even more. Looking back at those figures from the Fed, there's a lesson to be learned. The data may have been right, but the conclusion was wrong: Millennials don't dislike credit cards. They just dislike credit card debt. Like this column?

Analysis JPMorgan: Sell dividend stocks, buy banks Giovanny Moreano | @GiovannyMoreano Thursday, 15 Sep 2016 | 2:36 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan technical analysts advised clients to stay away from high-yield plays like utilities as a rotation out of those stocks appears to be underway. Instead, the investment bank recommends getting behind financial names, which in the past have benefited from higher rates. "Our bearish global bond outlook has been one of the main drivers of our equity call over the past month. That favored a sector rotation away from defensive groups like dividend payers and utilities, and into financials, which have shown relative outperformance when rates have trended higher over the past couple of years," wrote JPMorgan technical market strategist Jason Hunter. Into the end of the year, Hunter believes the bearish trend for Treasurys will extend. As a result, he predicts the rotation will continue.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the U.S. company, which oversees $1.7 trillion globally, set up China’s first wholly owned foreign money manager last month and plans to consolidate its business in the nation into the newly established unit in Shanghai. JPMorgan Asset Management (Shanghai) Ltd. will provide the platform for the group’s future development in China and become the parent for potential legal entities to be set up there, country head Desiree Q. Wang said. “As China opens up, cross-border investments will certainly grow because the market used to be a system of its own,” Wang said in an interview in Shanghai on Tuesday. Chinese authorities have been trying to strike a balance between opening up the market to attract more inflows, and further liberalizing the capital account in some areas that could worsen outflows after last year’s surprise yuan devaluation and ensuing stock-market rout. The nation began the free-trade zone in Shanghai in 2013 and has since set up 10 more to carry out trials on loosening movements of capital.
