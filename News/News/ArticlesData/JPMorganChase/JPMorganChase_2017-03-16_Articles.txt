A selloff in equities is now more likely than not, because investors are now underestimating the chances of disruption when France holds presidential elections that start next month, according to JPMorgan Chase’s Marko Kolanovic. The bank’s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy in New York says declines of roughly 5 percent for the S&P 500 Index would make shares worth buying. Kolanovic’s call comes fresh on the heels of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cut its outlook for global stocks this week, and a warning from Allianz Global Investors that equity valuations are becoming stretched. The defeat in this week’s Dutch elections of anti-immigration candidate Geert Wilders is being seen as a blow to populist political leaders, especially France’s Marine Le Pen. Investors should reduce positions in U.S. equities and buy cheaper emerging-market stocks, Kolanovic said in an email to clients Thursday. He also says American stocks will be attractive in the longer term, especially for patient investors ready to wait for a better entry point to buy. “Further complacency may set in in the aftermath of the Dutch elections,” Kolanovic wrote. “There will be an increase of uncertainty related to French elections. Near-term, market weakness is more likely than not.” Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed as of 7:31 a.m. New York time on Friday, with the index on course for a seventh weekly advance in eight. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The Dutch vote attracted an unusual level of global scrutiny as it comes before France’s presidential election. Far-right candidate Le Pen, who is seeking to take France out of the euro zone and stop immigration, is polling at about 27 percent for the first round on April 23 though she’s projected to lose to independent Emmanuel Macron by more than 20 points in the runoff. Volatility bets for the Euro Stoxx 50 Index slipped this week, trading near their lowest levels since July 2014. The bond market seems to be more concerned. The extra yield investors demand to hold French government debt rather than German notes remains elevated, even if it has declined from the recent peak.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow host of "The Rachel Maddow Show" was at the center of the political media Tuesday, March 14, 2017, with a story on Trump's tax returns propelled by social media. The White House pushed back even before the release of the documents Tuesday night, saying that publishing the information was illegal. Leaked pages of President Donald Trump’s 2005 tax return offer no new details about his foreign income and business dealings but highlight a tax he’s vowed to abolish. The alternative minimum tax, or AMT, was responsible for 80 percent of Trump’s 2005 federal income tax bill of $38.4 million, on income of $152.7 million. That’s a “startlingly” large proportion, said Alexander Popovich, a wealth adviser at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s private bank. “It’s very strange -- usually, the AMT is not going to cause anywhere near such a difference,” Popovich said. Trump has contravened 40 years of tradition by declining to release his tax returns, so the two pages of his 2005 return, which veteran tax journalist David Cay Johnston presented on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” Tuesday, offer a rare -- but limited -- peek into the president’s finances. Among the items on view: Trump got hit with a tax that in recent years has affected increasing numbers of well-off, but not necessarily wealthy, Americans. The AMT was introduced to taxpayers in 1970 as a way to prevent high-earning households from winnowing down or zeroing out their federal income-tax bills. The tax works by taking away personal and dependent exemptions, as well as various itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes. Other deductions are capped. It’s triggered by almost two dozen factors, including losses, depreciation, stock options and exemptions for children. State Taxes As inflation boosted incomes, the AMT has captured a larger number of taxpayers -- including roughly 30 percent of households with cash income between $200,000 and $500,000, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based policy group. Higher state and local taxes in states like California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts -- which can’t be deducted under the AMT -- have helped stir complaints about the tax. Trump and House Republicans have both formally called for abolishing it as part of their planned tax overhaul. The tax will raise about $35 billion this year, about 2.2 percent of all individual income tax revenue, according to the Tax Policy Center. “The AMT created this incredibly complicated formula to try to compensate for all of the deductions that are built in on the other side of the tax piece,” Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said Wednesday. Democrats are wary of scrapping it. “I’m an advocate of the AMT,” New York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said. It’s unclear what caused Trump to have to pay the AMT. The large bill “raises more questions than it answers,” said Leonard Burman, co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. “For the vast majority of people, the AMT is only a portion of their tax liability -- just a supplement to their regular taxes.” Trump’s Documents The leaked documents show that Trump and his wife, Melania, paid $5.3 million in federal income tax and more than $31 million in AMT. The combined $38.4 million tax bill gave the Trumps a federal tax rate of about 25 percent. It’s not clear that absent the AMT, they would have paid only a 3.5 percent rate, because of differences in the way deductions are treated by the AMT and regular income tax. It’s unusual that the Trumps were caught by a tax that predominantly hits earners in the $400,000 to $1.2 million gross income range, said Popovich of JPMorgan Chase. Far wealthier taxpayers can typically avoid its effects because capital gains income -- a mainstay for the top 0.1 percent -- largely escapes the AMT. Chuck Collins, a scholar at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, said he assumed that a reported loss of $103 million on Trump’s 2005 return, combined with depreciation for real estate, “probably” triggered the alternative levy. “The AMT tends to catch people who have paper losses,” he said. Depreciation Cited In a statement released Tuesday night before the MSNBC broadcast, the White House cited a “large-scale depreciation for construction,” but didn’t elaborate. Burman said the loss may have been carried over from 1995, when Trump reported a $916 million loss on his New York state tax return, according to documents that were leaked to the New York Times last October. Taxpayers are allowed to “carry forward” losses that they can’t fully use in a given year because they don’t have enough taxable income. Bloomberg reported in October that the $916 million loss probably stemmed from Trump’s use of a now-banished tax provision that allowed investors to turn canceled debt into personal losses for the purposes of reducing their federal tax bills.  “Whoever leaked the two pages didn’t release the supporting schedules to the return, which would show how and why the AMT was triggered,” Burman said. “There could be things on the full tax return that might tell us something about the nature and structure of his businesses and income that triggered the tax.” Prior Year However, the two pages from 2005 may well provide a clue about something else: Trump’s federal tax bill for 2004. The document lists estimated tax payments of $13,291,993 that Trump made in 2005 -- and under federal rules in place at the time, those payments had to total 110 percent of his 2004 tax liability. That means Trump probably had a federal tax liability of roughly $12.1 million in 2004, according to Matthew Morris, a tax attorney at law firm Bowditch & Dewey LLP, who reviewed the 2005 document and made the calculations. It’s also possible that the estimated tax payments were overpayments, but that seems unlikely, Morris said. --With assistance from Sahil Kapur To contact the reporter on this story: Lynnley Browning in New York at lbrowning4@bloomberg.net.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News Macomb Innovation Fund Awards $75,000 to Three Detroit-Area Technology Startups WARREN, Mich.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Three early-stage companies from Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties will receive $75,000 in funding from the Innovation Fund Macomb Community College, Powered by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Since July 2015, the Macomb Innovation Fund has awarded $1.475 million to 27 companies. The Innovation Fund is a $2.7 million effort to stimulate economic development and job growth among promising Detroit-area entrepreneurs and next-stage companies with high-growth potential. Funding is provided by Macomb Community College’s Strategic Fund and JPMorgan Chase, as part of the company’s $100 million commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery. The unique initiative provides mentoring and capital to early-stage businesses, as well as learning opportunities for Macomb Community College’s students. “In addition to enhancing southeast Michigan’s entrepreneurial ecosphere, the Macomb Innovation Fund is providing unique educational experiences to our students that extend classroom learning,” said James Jacobs, president, Macomb Community College. “More than 400 Macomb Community College students have directly interacted with the emerging economic drivers of our community, positioning them with distinctive learning experience.” Three companies will receive $25,000 awards, which are designed to support early-stage businesses taking the initial steps in market introduction. Alchemie Solutions (Troy/ Oakland County). Alchemie Solutions has developed a mobile learning technology for higher education, combining game-based and interactive video with machine learning. Designed for college gateway courses in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math), with chemistry the first subject area of focus, the interactive app is tied to an analytic platform to help both students and their instructors create a deeper understanding of a subjects core concepts. iServe (Northville/ Wayne County) –iServe has invented a soft serve dessert-making system for the home. The system’s concept is like that of a Keurig coffee maker, combining a soft-serve ice cream with single-serve dispensing and pod technology. The ice cream is dispensed in under 10 seconds, and the machine requires no preparation or clean up MySwimPro (Ann Arbor/ Washtenaw County) – MySwimPro is a fitness application for swim training. The mobile app features instructional video content, as well as personalized training and tracking through a free subscription. The premium subscription, which involves a monthly fee, unlocks advance work content and analytics. “Investing in entrepreneurial young people is great way to create economic opportunity that spans beyond Main Street,” said Chauncy Lennon, Head of Workforce Initiatives for JPMorgan Chase. “JPMorgan’s approach to creating inclusive economic growth in Detroit includes boosting the great ideas that are being born out of the city’s neighborhoods and community colleges.” The three companies awarded funding were selected from a field of 25 qualified applicants. Each went through a two-stage process, pitching first to a screening committee. The highest-rated companies moved on to a selection committee comprised of area professionals with experience in business management, finance, law, manufacturing and technology, who make award recommendations. To be eligible for the Innovation Fund, companies must locate within a nine-county region consisting of Genesee, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, Shiawassee, St. Clair, Washtenaw or Wayne counties.

The alternative minimum tax, or AMT, was responsible for 80 percent of Trump’s 2005 federal income tax bill of $38.4 million, on income of $152.7 million. That’s a “startlingly” large proportion, said Alexander Popovich, a wealth adviser at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s private bank. “It’s very strange -- usually, the AMT is not going to cause anywhere near such a difference,” Popovich said. Trump has contravened 40 years of tradition by declining to release his tax returns, so the two pages of his 2005 return, which veteran tax journalist David Cay Johnston presented on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” Tuesday, offer a rare -- but limited -- peek into the president’s finances. Among the items on view: Trump got hit with a tax that in recent years has affected increasing numbers of well-off, but not necessarily wealthy, Americans. The AMT was introduced to taxpayers in 1970 as a way to prevent high-earning households from winnowing down or zeroing out their federal income-tax bills. The tax works by taking away personal and dependent exemptions, as well as various itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes. Other deductions are capped. It’s triggered by almost two dozen factors, including losses, depreciation, stock options and exemptions for children. State Taxes Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up As inflation boosted incomes, the AMT has captured a larger number of taxpayers -- including roughly 30 percent of households with cash income between $200,000 and $500,000, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based policy group. Higher state and local taxes in states like California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts -- which can’t be deducted under the AMT -- have helped stir complaints about the tax. Trump and House Republicans have both formally called for abolishing it as part of their planned tax overhaul. The tax will raise about $35 billion this year, about 2.2 percent of all individual income tax revenue, according to the Tax Policy Center. “The AMT created this incredibly complicated formula to try to compensate for all of the deductions that are built in on the other side of the tax piece,” Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said Wednesday. Democrats are wary of scrapping it. “I’m an advocate of the AMT,” New York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said. It’s unclear what caused Trump to have to pay the AMT. The large bill “raises more questions than it answers,” said Leonard Burman, co-founder of the Tax Policy Center. “For the vast majority of people, the AMT is only a portion of their tax liability -- just a supplement to their regular taxes.” Trump’s Documents The leaked documents show that Trump and his wife, Melania, paid $5.3 million in federal income tax and more than $31 million in AMT. The combined $38.4 million tax bill gave the Trumps a federal tax rate of about 25 percent. It’s not clear that absent the AMT, they would have paid only a 3.5 percent rate, because of differences in the way deductions are treated by the AMT and regular income tax. It’s unusual that the Trumps were caught by a tax that predominantly hits earners in the $400,000 to $1.2 million gross income range, said Popovich of JPMorgan Chase. Far wealthier taxpayers can typically avoid its effects because capital gains income -- a mainstay for the top 0.1 percent -- largely escapes the AMT. Chuck Collins, a scholar at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, said he assumed that a reported loss of $103 million on Trump’s 2005 return, combined with depreciation for real estate, “probably” triggered the alternative levy. “The AMT tends to catch people who have paper losses,” he said. Depreciation Cited In a statement released Tuesday night before the MSNBC broadcast, the White House cited a “large-scale depreciation for construction,” but didn’t elaborate. Burman said the loss may have been carried over from 1995, when Trump reported a $916 million loss on his New York state tax return, according to documents that were leaked to the New York Times last October. Taxpayers are allowed to “carry forward” losses that they can’t fully use in a given year because they don’t have enough taxable income. Bloomberg reported in October that the $916 million loss probably stemmed from Trump’s use of a now-banished tax provision that allowed investors to turn canceled debt into personal losses for the purposes of reducing their federal tax bills.  “Whoever leaked the two pages didn’t release the supporting schedules to the return, which would show how and why the AMT was triggered,” Burman said. “There could be things on the full tax return that might tell us something about the nature and structure of his businesses and income that triggered the tax.” Prior Year However, the two pages from 2005 may well provide a clue about something else: Trump’s federal tax bill for 2004. The document lists estimated tax payments of $13,291,993 that Trump made in 2005 -- and under federal rules in place at the time, those payments had to total 110 percent of his 2004 tax liability. That means Trump probably had a federal tax liability of roughly $12.1 million in 2004, according to Matthew Morris, a tax attorney at law firm Bowditch & Dewey LLP, who reviewed the 2005 document and made the calculations. It’s also possible that the estimated tax payments were overpayments, but that seems unlikely, Morris said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home Market Bad news for Modi and Indian bonds as states go on borrowing binge Bad news for Modi and Indian bonds as states go on borrowing binge Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is finding itself pitted against an unlikely competitor as it pursues bond investors to finance the budget deficit: Indian states. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 16, 2017 1:43 PM That complicates matters for Modi, whose promise of fiscal discipline has lured foreigners to local bonds after a four-month hiatus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is finding itself pitted against an unlikely competitor as it pursues bond investors to finance the budget deficit: Indian states. With an ever-rising supply of debt that offers yields higher than sovereign notes, borrowing by state administrations threatens to overshadow that by the federal government, according to Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd. and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. That complicates matters for Modi, whose promise of fiscal discipline has lured foreigners to local bonds after a four-month hiatus. Increased competition from states is also bad news for the sovereign-debt market, which saw benchmark notes in February post their biggest monthly loss since 2013, after policy makers in Asia’s third-largest economy signaled an end the monetary easing cycle. There is also a growing risk that, unless state deficits are pared, their debt levels could quickly get on to “an explosive path,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a February report. “There’s an increasing amount of concern over the states’ bond supply and the time when it will overtake government bond supply is not far away,” said Dhawal Dalal, chief investment officer for debt at Edelweiss Asset. “Concern about the health of the states is also something that worries market participants.” Working together, India’s 29 states combined would form a bloc that has a bigger economy than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, more members than the European Union, and twice the population of North America. Net borrowing by states will rise 12 percent to 3.8 trillion rupees ($58 billion) in the next financial year, after an estimated 30 percent-surge to 3.4 trillion in the fiscal year ending this March 31, according to ICRA Ltd. Modi plans to borrow a net 4.2 trillion rupees in the coming year. Watch this also: “The disproportionate market focus on central finances masks the fact that India’s fiscal centre-of-gravity has rapidly moved from the center to the states,” Sajjid Chinoy and Toshi Jain, economists at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in the report. Borrowing by states is poised to overtake the centre’s by 2018-19, they said. Financial Stress Why are the states borrowing so much? Revenue losses suffered on account of Modi’s shock currency recall in November and higher wages for staff have strained their finances, according to ICRA, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. “The consolidation of recent years seem to be coming apart,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA in Gurgaon. “Servicing of debt related to the power sector-restructuring” is another factor contributing to the worsening state finances. Borrowing costs reflect the stress. States sold 10-year debt at an average cut-off yield of 7.89 percent at an auction Tuesday, versus 7.15 percent at the Jan. 10 sale. Similar-maturity sovereign bonds paid 6.78 percent in Mumbai Thursday, indicating that the yield spread has widened to more than 100 basis points. The historical mean is 40-50 basis points, according to JPMorgan. That’s an impending challenge for Modi even as he celebrates his party’s resounding victories in just-concluded state elections, including in Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest. While higher yields and the implicit sovereign guarantee are a draw with investors, the securities are hardly a match for government bonds when it comes to liquidity. That’s partly why foreign investors, who were granted access to state debt in late 2015, have largely stayed away from the sector. Investment by global funds stands at 14.8 billion rupees, data from the National Securities Depository Ltd. show. That’s just seven percent of the 210-billion rupee limit available to them. “We buy state bonds only for portfolios where liquidity risk is not a concern, because the yield offered is close to top-rate corporate bond,” said Badrish Kulhalli, Mumbai-based fixed-income manager at HDFC Standard Life. “The extra supply of state bonds means the government bond yield curve will also steepen.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Subhadip Sircar and Kartik Goyal Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is finding itself pitted against an unlikely competitor as it pursues bond investors to finance the budget deficit: Indian states. With an ever-rising supply of debt that offers yields higher than sovereign notes, borrowing by state administrations threatens to overshadow that by the federal government, according to Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd. and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. That complicates matters for Modi, whose promise of fiscal discipline has lured foreigners to local bonds after a four-month hiatus. Increased competition from states is also bad news for the sovereign-debt market, which saw benchmark notes in February post their biggest monthly loss since 2013, after policy makers in Asia’s third-largest economy signaled an end the monetary easing cycle. There is also a growing risk that, unless state deficits are pared, their debt levels could quickly get on to “an explosive path,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a February report. “There’s an increasing amount of concern over the states’ bond supply and the time when it will overtake government bond supply is not far away,” said Dhawal Dalal, chief investment officer for debt at Edelweiss Asset. “Concern about the health of the states is also something that worries market participants.” Working together, India’s 29 states combined would form a bloc that has a bigger economy than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, more members than the European Union, and twice the population of North America. Net borrowing by states will rise 12 per cent to 3.8 trillion rupees ($58 billion) in the next financial year, after an estimated 30 per cent-surge to 3.4 trillion in the fiscal year ending this March 31, according to ICRA Ltd. Modi plans to borrow a net 4.2 trillion rupees in the coming year. “The disproportionate market focus on central finances masks the fact that India’s fiscal centre-of-gravity has rapidly moved from the center to the states,” Sajjid Chinoy and Toshi Jain, economists at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in the report. Borrowing by states is poised to overtake the centre’s by 2018-19, they said. Financial Stress Why are the states borrowing so much? Revenue losses suffered on account of Modi’s shock currency recall in November and higher wages for staff have strained their finances, according to ICRA, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. “The consolidation of recent years seem to be coming apart,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA in Gurgaon. “Servicing of debt related to the power sector-restructuring” is another factor contributing to the worsening state finances. Borrowing costs reflect the stress. States sold 10-year debt at an average cut-off yield of 7.89 per cent at an auction Tuesday, versus 7.15 per cent at the Jan. 10 sale. Similar-maturity sovereign bonds paid 6.78 per cent in Mumbai Thursday, indicating that the yield spread has widened to more than 100 basis points. The historical mean is 40-50 basis points, according to JPMorgan. That’s an impending challenge for Modi even as he celebrates his party’s resounding victories in just-concluded state elections, including in Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest. While higher yields and the implicit sovereign guarantee are a draw with investors, the securities are hardly a match for government bonds when it comes to liquidity. That’s partly why foreign investors, who were granted access to state debt in late 2015, have largely stayed away from the sector. Investment by global funds stands at 14.8 billion rupees, data from the National Securities Depository Ltd. show. That’s just seven per cent of the 210-billion rupee limit available to them. “We buy state bonds only for portfolios where liquidity risk is not a concern, because the yield offered is close to top-rate corporate bond,” said Badrish Kulhalli, Mumbai-based fixed-income manager at HDFC Standard Life. “The extra supply of state bonds means the government bond yield curve will also steepen.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Now, though, after testing the faith of the most patient souls with glimmers that came to nothing, things seem to be warming up. It looks likely that this year, for the first time since 2010, rich-world and developing economies will put on synchronised growth spurts. There are still plenty of reasons to fret: China’s debt mountain; the flaws in the foundations of the euro; Donald Trump’s protectionist tendencies; and so on. But amid these anxieties are real green shoots. For six months or so there has been growing evidence of increased activity. It has been clearest in the export-oriented economies of Asia. But it is visible in Europe, in America and even, just, in hard-hit emerging markets like Russia and Brazil. Latest updates Angela Merkel and her press corps show how big democracies are supposed to operate Democracy in Americaa day ago Free health cover for Britons in Europe is under threat Gulliver2 days ago Where others gawked, John Samson looked with genuine curiosity Prospero2 days ago Donald Trump’s “America First” budget would make deep cuts to domestic programmes Graphic detail2 days ago Hundreds of thousands of people have fled South Sudan for Uganda Middle East and Africa2 days ago An array of churches opposes Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to foreign aid Erasmus2 days ago See all updates The signals are strongest from the more cyclical parts of the global economy, notably manufacturing. Surveys of purchasing managers in America, the euro zone and Asia show factories getting a lot busier (see chart 1). Global trading hubs such as Taiwan and South Korea are bustling. Taiwan’s National Development Council publishes a composite indicator that tracks the economy’s strength: blue is sluggish, green is stable and red is overheating. The overall economy has been flashing green lights for seven months and is pushing up towards the red zone. This reflects, among other things, demand for semiconductors around the world; this February exports from Taiwan were up by 28% compared with 2016. Although that is the most striking example, exports are up elsewhere in the region, too. South Korea’s rose by 20% in February compared with a year earlier. In yuan terms, China’s were 11% higher in the first two months of 2017 than in 2016. This apparent vigour is in part just a reflection of how bad things looked 12 months ago; suppliers who overdid the gloom in early 2016 are restocking. Asia’s taut supply chains also owe something to the two-to-three-year life-cycle of consumer gadgetry. On March 10th LG Electronics launched its new G6 smartphone. Its larger rival, Samsung, is due to unveil its Galaxy S8 phone by the end of the month; a new iPhone will be out later this year. But the signs of life run deeper than just those specifics would allow. Business spending on machinery and equipment is picking up. A proxy measure based on shipments of capital goods constructed by economists at JPMorgan Chase, a bank, suggests that worldwide equipment spending grew at an annualised rate of 5.25% in the last quarter of 2016. The good news goes beyond manufacturing, too. American employers, excluding farms, added 235,000 workers to their payrolls in February, well above the recent average. The European Commission’s economic-sentiment index, based on surveys of service industries, manufacturers, builders and consumers, is as high as it has been since 2011. After a strong fourth quarter, the Bank of Japan revised up its forecast for growth in the current fiscal year from 1% to 1.4%. Such optimism raises two big questions: what is behind this nascent recovery and will it take hold? Lilacs from the dead land The revival’s roots can be traced to the early months of last year, when a possible calamity was averted. At the end of 2015 stockmarkets tumbled in response to renewed anxiety about China’s economy. Prices at the factory gate, which had been falling steadily for several years, had started to plunge. There were fears that China would be forced to devalue its currency sharply: a cheaper yuan might spur China’s oversupplied industries to export more, fatten profits and service their growing debts. Such a desperate measure would, in effect, have exported its manufacturing deflation to the rest of the world, forcing rivals to cut prices or to devalue in turn. The expectation that China’s economy was weakening pushed raw-material prices to their lowest level since 2009. The oil price briefly sunk below $30 a barrel. That worsened the plight of Brazil and Russia, already mired in deep recessions. It also intensified the pressure to cut investment in America’s shale-oil industry. To stabilise the yuan in the face of rapid outflows of capital, China spent $300bn of its foreign-currency reserves between November 2015 and January 2016. Capital controls were tightened to stop money leaking abroad. Banks juiced up the economy with faster credit growth. With capital now boxed in, much of it flowed into local property: house prices soared, first in the big cities and then beyond. Sales taxes on small cars were reduced by half. Between them, these controls and stimuli did the trick. Soon stocks of raw materials that had been hurriedly run down started to look skimpy. Iron-ore prices jumped by 19% in just one day last March. Curbs on Chinese coal production underpinned a mini-revival in global prices. Steel prices rose sharply, helped by the closure of a few high-cost mills as well as more construction spending. Oil climbed back above $50 a barrel (though it has slipped back a bit recently). By the end of the year producer-price inflation in China—and across Asia—was positive again. And China’s nominal GDP, which had slowed more than real GDP, sped up again (see chart 2). Central bankers, who had been employing various measures to forestall global deflation, were mightily relieved. On March 9th Mario Draghi, boss of the European Central Bank (ECB), proudly declared that the risk of deflation had “largely disappeared”. His relief was a recognition that, though a surge in inflation will flood the economy’s engine, a gentle dose can serve as a helpful lubricant. At a global level, a bit more factory-gate inflation lifts profits, since a lot of manufacturers’ production costs are largely fixed. Fatter profits not only make corporate debt less burdensome, they also free cash for capital spending, which creates further demand for businesses in a virtuous circle. Since worries about China and deflation receded, spending on things that show some faith in future income has indeed begun to stir. A revival in producer prices and thus profits is leading to business investment around the world. In the last quarter of 2016 business spending in Japan rose at an annualised rate of 8%, according to official GDP figures. Gartner, a tech consultancy, predicted in December that consumers and companies would increase their spending on IT by 2.7% in 2017, up from 0.5% in 2016. John Lovelock, a research analyst at Gartner, says the biggest jump in spending is forecast for the Asia-Pacific region. Continuous as the stars that shine? In America imports of both consumer goods and capital goods are up. There has been speculation that the “animal spirits” of business folk have been lifted by Mr Trump’s election in November, and that cuts in tax and regulations, and a subsequent return of the estimated $1trn of untaxed cash held abroad by companies based in America, will fuel a big boom in business investment. But James Stettler, a capital-goods analyst at Barclays Capital, notes that “no one’s really pushing the button on capex yet”. And companies which might benefit from an investment boom are not getting carried away. In a recent profits statement Caterpillar, a maker of bulldozers and excavators, said that, while tax reform and infrastructure spending would be good for its businesses, it would not expect to see large benefits until at least 2018. So far the recovery in global capital spending is in line with what you would expect from the recovery in global profits, says Joseph Lupton of JPMorgan Chase (see chart 3). The signs of recovery are encouraging. But can they be trusted? The last few bursts of optimism about the global economy all petered out. In 2010 the rebound from a deep rich-world recession was pulled back to earth by the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area. As soon as Europe gingerly emerged from recession in mid-2013, hints from America’s Federal Reserve that its bond-buying programme would soon tail off prompted a stampede out of emerging markets. This “taper tantrum” blew over in a few months, but it had repercussions. The prospect of tighter monetary policy in America, however distant, hit the supply of credit in emerging markets. The squeeze was made worse in 2014 when the oil price fell from over $100 a barrel to half that in just a few months. The price of other industrial raw materials, which had settled onto a plateau after peaking in 2011, began to fall. The subsequent slump in investment was enough to drag big commodity exporters, such as Brazil and Russia, into recession. Even so, by the end of 2015 the Fed was sufficiently confident about the outlook to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first such increase in a decade. More increases were expected in relatively short order. But the jitters about China, and then Brexit, meant that it was a full year before the next. It has now followed up with another increase in much shorter order (see article). False dawns were perhaps to be expected: recoveries from debt crises are painfully slow. Spending suffers as borrowers whittle away their debts. Banks are reluctant to write off old, souring loans and so are unable to make fresh new ones. And the world has had to shake off not one debt crisis, but three: the subprime crisis in America; the sovereign-debt crunch in Europe; then the bust in corporate borrowing in emerging markets. But the initial and most painful stage of economic adjustment in emerging markets is coming to an end. Current-account deficits have narrowed, leaving most countries less reliant on foreign borrowing. Their currencies are a lot more competitive. And interest rates are high, so there is scope to relax monetary policy to boost demand (see chart 4). Business spending is already rising in response. The breadth of the improvement—from Asia to Europe and America—makes for greater confidence that a pick-up is in train. A broad trend is a good proxy for an established trend, notes Manoj Pradhan of Talking Heads Macro, a research firm. Nevertheless, some countries are in better shape than others. India and Indonesia recovered quickly from the taper tantrum; their GDP growth has been fairly strong and steady. At the other end of the spectrum, Turkey and (to a lesser extent) South Africa look unlikely to see a big revival soon. In the middle, there are signs that brutal recessions in two of the largest emerging markets, Russia and Brazil, are slowly coming to an end. Inflation in both countries is receding, restoring spending power to consumers. In Russia inflation fell to 4.6% in February, down from a peak of 16.9% two years ago. In the three months ending in September, GDP growth probably turned positive, according to the central bank, which has cut its main interest rate from 17% in January 2015 to 10% today; more cuts are likely. Manufacturing activity grew in each of the seven months to February, according to a survey of purchasing managers published by Markit, a data provider. Brazil’s economy shrank again in the final months of 2016, but with inflation tumbling towards the 4.5% target, its central bank has cut its benchmark rate by two percentage points, to 12.25%, since October. Further cuts are again likely. Other commodity-producers in Latin America (bar Mexico, where the peso has weakened since Mr Trump was elected) are also relaxing monetary policy. The recent buds relax and spread That is the bull case. What of the risks? One is that tighter commodity markets will stymie consumer spending in the rich world by raising prices. But core measures of inflation that strip out volatile things like food and energy costs remain low: nowhere in the rich world have they reached the 2% rate that is the goal of central banks, the rate seen as necessary for a “normal” cyclical recovery. America is closest to that target; the index preferred by the Fed puts America’s inflation at 1.9%, with the core rate at 1.7%. In Europe the core rate is stuck below 1%, with wage growth of around 1.3% last year; but oil prices have pushed headline inflation back to 2%. There is also the risk of expecting too much. A pick-up in global aggregate demand is good news. But growth rates will always be constrained by how fast the workforce can expand and how much extra output can be squeezed from each worker. In lots of places there is scope for jobs growth; but in America, Japan, Germany and Britain the labour market is already quite tight. With America close to full employment, wage growth has picked up to 2.8%, which is consistent with 2% underlying inflation if productivity growth stays around 1%. Pay is growing fastest in less well-paid industries, such as construction, retailing, hospitality and haulage, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Wages might perk up yet more if productivity improved. But the post-crisis slump in productivity growth that has affected both rich and developing countries shows no sign of ending. In America output per hour rose by 1.3% in the year to the final quarter of 2016. Europe has not been able to match even that dismal rate. It would take an astonishing shift in productivity for America’s economy to manage the 4% GDP growth promised by Mr Trump. A less fanciful view is that American GDP growth might top 2% this year, a bit better than is expected for Europe. Continued investment, and possibly deregulation, could improve productivity somewhat; but they will not provide a step change. Without one, rich-world interest rates are likely to stay well below the levels that were considered normal before 2007. It is not hard to imagine things that might yet derail the recovery. Though there is a cast-iron consensus that nothing bad will be allowed to happen before the big Communist Party congress in the autumn, China’s growing debt pile could still bring markets tumbling down. Populist victories in Europe’s various elections could bring about a crisis for the euro. Even if they do not, an end to the ECB’s bond-buying programme, which has kept government-borrowing costs at tolerable levels and even allowed a bit of fiscal stimulus to lift the economy, will lay bare the euro’s still-unfixed structural problems. The Fed might tighten policy too quickly, driving up the value of the dollar and draining capital (and thus momentum) from a recovery in emerging markets. Or Mr Trump might make good on the repeated threats he made in his campaign to raise import tariffs on countries he considers guilty of unfair trade, thus taking a decisive step away from globalisation just as the world’s main economic blocs are at last starting to get into sync. These risks are not new or surprising. What brings a freshness to the air is that a cyclical recovery has managed to overcome them. There may actually be some rosebuds to gather, for a while. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon View comments Reuse this content Editors’ picks Andrés Manuel López ObradorMexico’s populist would-be president Mexico City, we have a problem Americas German lessonsAngela Merkel and her press corps show how big democracies are supposed to operateDemocracy in America From deprivation to daffodilsThe world economy is picking up The science of popularityThe magic of making hitsCulture You are seeing the beta version of Economist.com Leave feedback Need assistance with your subscription?

The National Interest originally published this piece. Authors General Raymond Odierno (Ret.) Senior Advisor, JPMorgan Chase Michael E. O’Hanlon Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence Director of Research - Foreign Policy Co-Director - Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence The Sydney Stein, Jr. Chair Twitter MichaelEOHanlon While news coverage about national security understandably focuses on issues such as the Syria and Ukraine crises, even bigger and broader forces are at work in today’s world. They are, in fact, redefining the very meaning of national security in ways that require new responses from policymakers at all levels of government. To secure our nation in this environment, we need much more than military power. Specifically, we need to ask with fresh eyes how Washington, DC can better help state and local governments in what used to be viewed as old-fashioned and largely local police work—but that should increasingly be understood as core national security policy. The United States should broaden its lens about how to secure the nation beyond military tools, and ask how the federal government can better support the work of state and local governments here in the United States. Watch General Odierno, Michael O’Hanlon, His Excellency Juan Carlos Pinzón, The Honorable Mitchell J. Landrieu, Fran Townsend, and Amy Liu discuss the findings in a new report: Securing global cities: Best practices, innovations, and the path ahead. Of all that is changing in today’s world, two forces stand out: urbanization and globalization. The first is happening gradually, but viewed over a generation, the changes are enormous. In the mid-twentieth century, there were some 2.5 billion humans on earth and a third lived in metropolitan areas. Today, there are 7.4 billion people, and 54 percent of that much larger number now live in or around cities. By 2050, there will be at least nine billion humans on Earth, of whom two-thirds will live in metropolitan areas, according to the United Nations. Several dozen megacities, each of 10 million or more souls, will be scattered about the earth from the Americas and Africa to south Asia and east Asia. [T]hese cities are tied together in ways never previously imaginable. With these twin megatrends comes much greater prosperity for many. Yet the downsides are enormous as well, and they have national-security implications far beyond the threat posed by ISIS and al-Qaida. While the world is becoming statistically safer for the average person from generation to generation, the character of crime is changing—and internationalizing. To be sure, the Sicilian or Irish family syndicates, and the drug cartels reaching from South America’s Andes and the Caribbean to the streets of American cities, have been around a long time. In today’s world, however, the tentacles of transnational criminal networks reach further and wider, profiting from social media as well as other rapid means of communication and transport to make their money and settle their scores. Second, these cities are tied together in ways never previously imaginable. Global supply chains, cheaper intercontinental travel, speed-of-light communications networks and worldwide diasporas will continue to allow these cities to interact with each other far more easily. The forces are just too powerful to stop. There is another aspect to it as well. With larger cities, all dependent on infrastructure that is often vulnerable to natural disaster or cyberattack or terrorist strikes, there is a growing potential for catastrophes so big as to have national-security repercussions. The next storm like Hurricane Katrina might hit a city of ten million, or the next massive earthquake might not be in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (as bad as that was) but a huge metropolitan area like Rio or Mexico City or Karachi. The next major typhoon to target a country like the Philippines might strike more than an indirect blow at Manila; the next Ebola outbreak may not be so quickly contained in a remote part of Africa. The next nuclear power plant disaster might require more than just planning for the evacuation of a city like Tokyo, but the actual relocation of millions of people; the next cyberattack may take down an electricity grid serving a city or a region not just for hours, but for days or weeks. Fortunately, these broad trends provide not just scary scenarios but opportunities. Around the United States and around the world, cities are innovating in how they protect their citizens. They are talking with each other more and more about how to do it, too, rather than waiting for diplomats in their respective national capitals to have the conversations for them. Whether it be refining techniques of community policing, adopting sound methods of fighting terrorism by breaking down bureaucratic stovepipes and sharing information, creating public-private partnerships to monitor, deter and respond to crime quickly, or working hard to improve social cohesion to get at the sources of crime and extremism, there is a new global network of like-minded local officials pushing the state of the art.

Baev Tuesday, March 14, 2017 2017 Mar 16 Past Event Securing global cities 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM EDT Washington, DC This new localism needs to continue and expand. But there is a key role for federal authorities too. Washington has responded reasonably well since 9/11 in improving federal attention to counterterrorism, including with FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces and other means. However, we have let key elements of federal support to state and local authorities atrophy. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has declined dramatically, for example, and now provides only a couple hundred million dollars a year to help local police forces grow their ranks when needed. Other federal initiatives are typically also measured in modest sums, such as the $500 million Office on Violence against Women. The Department of Justice’s capacities are impressive, but only a bit more than fifty thousand personnel between the FBI, Marshall Service, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They provide crucial but niche capabilities in the national fight against crime. State and local police are, naturally, funded primarily at the state and local level—the nation spends more than $100 billion a year collectively on such efforts. But in regions hit hard by adverse economic trends or otherwise struggling, there could be a need for more federal help. And of course, it’s not just about the money. Washington can provide better mechanisms for sharing best practices from city to city; as noted, these communications happen now already, but they are largely dependent on specific personalities in the offices of mayors and police chiefs around the land. National doctrine and training on what works best, with cities taking the lead but the national capital providing a central focal point for discussion and cooperation, should be created and shared. Washington’s approach should not be to dictate outcomes, but to encourage those who really know what works on the ground to drive the debates and share what they have learned.

O’Hanlon 2013 The Opportunity By Steven Pifer and Michael E. O’Hanlon 2012 There is another aspect to the challenge as well. While the United States has, due to the hard work of many state and local officials, cut violent crime rates by two-thirds over a generation, there has been a disturbing partial reversal of this trend since roughly 2014. We need to nip this bad trend in the bud—and we need to end the acrimony that has characterized debate around this issue in recent times. A central tenet of providing urban security is this: the endeavor can only work if there is a spirit of teamwork among all key actors, including mayors, police and the communities most at risk from crime. Fortunately, at a time of big deficits, no huge influx of federal funds is needed. But we need a zero-based review of the country’s domestic urban security just as much as another Pentagon review of overseas threats. In fact, the whole domestic-overseas distinction is losing much of its traditional meaning in today’s world. No priority should be higher than this one for the Trump administration and the 115th Congress.Since the criminal networks and other nefarious actors who prey on one city might use it to create a base from which to spread out to others, and since a sufficiently serious catastrophe in one place can affect us all, we need to view this as a matter of national priority—and national security.

They were optimistic that the laws would soon be removed by executive order, and were cheered by the appointment of many of their colleagues to top positions in the administration. The banks reported that they collectively were forced to spend nearly a billion dollars in 2016 alone on political contributions and lobbying Congress to remove burdensome laws such as Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010 in response to the huge taxpayer bailouts extended to most of them after the 2008 collapse. The regulations reduced the banks ability to "develop great innovative products" like subprime mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps, faulted by most for creating the 2008 collapse, in the years following passage of the bill in Congress. "The money we have had to spend on lobbying and contributions could be better spent increasing pay and bonuses to top talent and management at our institutions", exclaimed one banker. "In addition to the hardships encountered by our top traders and managers, some receiving only several million dollars a year in bonuses instead of the tens of millions they might have been accustomed to before 2008, there have been no taxpayer bailouts of major "too big too fail" institutions for several years, eliminating the consulting work needed to fix banks that are threatened with collapse and thus further reducing income in our industry", said another attendee. Participants in the meeting were thankful that the unfair situation created during the Obama Administration had come to a close, counting themselves among the victims of policies enacted during the previous 8 years. "We stand together with the unemployed auto workers, carnage victims in American cities, and the forgotten middle class, in working together with the new administration to allow free enterprise to move forward again" said one trader. In a related development, most of the companies participating in the conference reported sharply higher revenues and profits for fourth quarter and yearend 2016, and many of their share prices recently hit all time highs, despite the unfortunate situation they find themselves in and the onerous spending required for lobbying and campaign contributions.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search These Major Banks Are Poised To Benefit From Rising Rates March 16, 2017 1:36pm NYSE:XLF ShareTweet From Bob Ciura: It’s official: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its March meeting. On March 15, the U.S. central bank announced its second interest rate hike in the past three months. The Fed funds rate, which is the overnight bank-to-bank lending rate that is widely viewed as a benchmark for interest rates more broadly, will rise to a target range of 0.75% to 1%. In addition, the Fed reiterated its intention to raise rates as many as three times in 2017. This represents a remarkable departure from the Fed’s previous policy of monetary easing. Now that the U.S. economy is growing more consistently, and consumers are in stronger financial standing, the assumption is that the economy can withstand higher interest rates. A return to a rising-rate cycle would be a huge tailwind for three big bank stocks in the U.S., all of which pay dividends. Big Bank Stocks: JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) As the largest U.S. bank by assets, JP Morgan will likely be among the biggest beneficiaries from higher interest rates. Higher interest rates mean banks make more money on loans they issue. They also have to pay more to depositors, but the spread between the two expands in a rising-rate environment. Rates are likely to increase faster, and by a larger margin, for longer-dated loans like consumer loans, mortgages, and auto loans, than for short-term deposits. This will help JP Morgan’s net interest margin, which is already showing improvement. Last quarter, the bank grew revenue by 2%, thanks largely to a 5% increase in net investment income. In the core consumer & community banking segment, average loans and deposits rose by 14% and 11%, respectively. There were also pockets of strength across JP Morgan’s other businesses. For example, commercial banking revenue rose 12% to a record $2 billion last quarter. And, JP Morgan’s asset management business saw record average loan balances. For 2016, JP Morgan carried a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.2%, indicating a well-managed balance sheet and comfortable financial position. JP Morgan also pays a solid 2.1% dividend, and last year increased its dividend by 9%. Big Bank Stocks: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Bank of America is one of the largest banks in the country, with a market capitalization above $250 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenue net of interest expense increased 2% to $20 billion. Like JP Morgan, this was due mostly to rising net interest income, which was up 6%. Going forward, Bank of America will see a huge boost if the Fed raises rates three times, because net interest income represents more than half of the company’s total revenue. The other key growth catalysts for Bank of America are an improving loan portfolio, and cost cuts. Last quarter, the company set aside $774 million in provisions for credit losses. This was a huge reduction from $810 million in the same quarter the previous year, and indicates the bank’s loan quality is improving. Plus, Bank of America’s non-interest expense fell 6% year over year. When combined with rising interest rates, these are all positive indicators for future earnings growth. Earnings per share soared 48% last quarter. Such strong earnings growth will help Bank of America continue to reward shareholders with growing dividends and share buybacks. And, the stock is still relatively cheap, trading at just 16 times earnings. Bank of America stock has a 1.2% dividend yield. Big Bank Stocks: U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) U.S. Bancorp had a record year in 2016. The company’s net income grew to $5.9 billion, a company record. Earnings also set a record, at $3.24 per share, up 3% from 2015. Average loans and deposits rose 7% and 9% respectively, in 2016. In addition, U.S. Bancorp is seeing accelerating growth in its investment fees, which rose 10% last quarter. U.S. Bancorp’s commercial banking business enjoyed positive loan growth, in addition to lower delinquency rates in 2016. The rise in rates could spur increased home-buying activity, which would be a huge boost to U.S. Bancorp. As a regional bank, U.S. Bancorp has a large mortgage banking business, which saw 14% growth last quarter. And, it will see similar benefits as the other big banks, from rising rates: U.S. Bancorp’s net interest income increased 5% last year. U.S. Bancorp has a 2% dividend yield, and in 2016 the company hiked its shareholder payout by 10%. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) was trading at $24.84 per share on Thursday afternoon, up $0.1 (+0.40%). Year-to-date, XLF has gained 6.84%, versus a 6.72% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XLF currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 38 ETFs in the Financial Equities ETFs category.

Now it needs to grow print-edition icon From the print edition | BusinessMar 18th 2017 twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon IF YOU ask financial types in New York for their views on the world’s big banks, they usually come up with similar vignettes for each one. They agree that JPMorgan Chase is an unstoppable force under its boss, Jamie Dimon. Goldman Sachs is on a roll, with its shares up by 36% since the election (even if some worry that its Darwinian culture is going soft given all the regulation it faces). Across the pond Deutsche Bank is struggling to keep its head above water; its leader, John Cryan, embarked on a capital-raising and cost-cutting plan on March 5th. Yet one big bank elicits shrugs of bafflement: Citigroup. Its managers are anonymous and they get paid about a fifth less than their peers at other financial groups. No one is quite sure what Citi is up to or what it exists for. Once too big to fail, it is now too drab to mention. That Citi has become the world’s half-forgotten bank is surprising. It was America’s biggest firm before the financial crisis, measured by size of assets; it is now the fourth-largest. After suffering huge losses on loans and subprime securities, in 2008-09 it received the biggest bail-out of any American bank. Citi can still lay claim to being the most important firm in the global financial system. It operates in 97 countries, from Kenya to South Korea to Kuwait. Soon it will confront its next strategic dilemma: when should it start growing again? Latest updates Angela Merkel and her press corps show how big democracies are supposed to operate Democracy in Americaa day ago Free health cover for Britons in Europe is under threat Gulliver2 days ago Where others gawked, John Samson looked with genuine curiosity Prospero2 days ago Donald Trump’s “America First” budget would make deep cuts to domestic programmes Graphic detail2 days ago Hundreds of thousands of people have fled South Sudan for Uganda Middle East and Africa2 days ago An array of churches opposes Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to foreign aid Erasmus2 days ago See all updates Citi’s roots go back to 1812, but it came of age in the 20th century, organising loans and cross-border payments for American companies abroad. In the decade to 2007 it tripled in size as it tried to be a financial supermarket that offered everything to everyone, everywhere. The government sold its last Citi shares in 2011. The men appointed in 2012 to clear up the mess, Michael O’Neill, its chairman, and Michael Corbat, its chief executive, were given three goals: to make Citi safe, to make it profitable and to return cash to shareholders. They have almost finished the job. Consider safety first. Since the nadir in 2009, the bank’s core capital has risen by 59%, and its cash reserves by 28%. Citi’s assets have fallen by 3%, its holdings of “Level-3” (ie, hard-to-value) securities by 80%, and its short-term debts by 78%. Mr Dimon likes to say that JPMorgan’s balance-sheet is a fortress. If so, Citi’s is a nuclear-bomb shelter. If another crisis hit, it has enough capital and earnings to absorb four times the losses it suffered in 2008-09. Mr Corbat is shutting down the bad bank that was created in 2009, which has disposed of $650bn of toxic exposures—think of steaming piles of subprime bonds and Greek mortgages. The second goal is profitability. The bank has made relatively slow progress here, but its headline figures understate returns. An accounting rule means that its balance-sheet appears bloated by tax breaks relating to its losses during the crisis. Its return on tangible equity, after adjusting for this, was 9% in 2016. If the last dregs of its legacy assets are sold this year, the ratio should reach 10%. That is below JPMorgan, at 13%, but acceptable. With its capital base restored, Citi can meet its third goal, of returning cash to shareholders. Its share price has fallen by 88% over the past decade, so they could do with some payback. The bank is producing especially strong cashflows because its former losses can be set against tax bills. It should be able to pay out $17bn-18bn in dividends and share buybacks a year, which would make it one of the seven most generous American firms for the absolute amount of cash returned. Citi shareholders should soon receive a dollar of cash a year for each $10 of stock that they own. If life were fair, Citi’s bosses would each be given a Martini and a medal for years of gruelling work. But investors’ expectations are seldom static. By as soon as the end of this year, Citi will be under pressure to show that it can grow again. Its revenues fell by 2% in 2016 (excluding the sales made by the bad bank). By contrast, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase expanded revenues at a rate of 3-4%. With a third of its business in emerging markets, where growth is picking up, Citi should be doing better. The idea of the bank expanding again is not as mad as it may appear. It has room to grow without upsetting regulators (who still fret about banks being too big). Citi is 28% smaller than Bank of America and 27% smaller than JPMorgan Chase, measured by the risk-adjusted assets of its core business. Unlike European basket-cases such as Deutsche and Royal Bank of Scotland (which recently reported its ninth consecutive annual loss), Citi’s international business is viable. It ships cash globally for big firms and is entrusted with $430bn of deposits abroad—more than in 2006 and almost twice what JPMorgan Chase has. Citi’s bond-trading unit is ranked first in the world. It has a powerful presence in Asia, the only region where it hasn’t lost money in the past decade. Nervous in 97 countries So far, though, Citi’s managers have focused on modest projects. In 2016 the bank bought a credit-card portfolio in America. It is bulking up in equities and is investing more in its Mexican business. The risk is that excessive caution causes the bank’s global position to deteriorate. Citi’s main customer base, of American multinationals, is probably mature. Their profits doubled between 2003 and 2013, but are now falling. Citi needs to find more local corporate customers abroad, but its loan books in the two biggest emerging economies, China and India, stagnated in 2016. As Citi has been recovering, China’s big banks, ICBC, CCB and Bank of China, have built formidable networks across Asia. It is easy to understand why Citi’s top brass are treading gingerly. The urge to make far more of the bank’s global footprint was behind the disastrous expansion of 1997-2007. Of the bank’s 17 directors, 15 are American: a global bank should have more of a mix of nationalities. And the real sign that a company is recuperating is not that it is locked in a permanent state of contrition and austerity. Rather it is that it can grow at a measured and rational pace in its core areas. Over the next couple of years, that’s what Citi needs to become well-known for. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon View comments Reuse this content Editors’ picks Andrés Manuel López ObradorMexico’s populist would-be president Mexico City, we have a problem Americas German lessonsAngela Merkel and her press corps show how big democracies are supposed to operateDemocracy in America From deprivation to daffodilsThe world economy is picking up The science of popularityThe magic of making hitsCulture You are seeing the beta version of Economist.com Leave feedback Need assistance with your subscription?

Scott Applewhite, File) The Associated Press Jamie Dimon is trying to transform what has long been seen as a sleepy Washington club for CEOs into a lobbying powerhouse. The JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer took on a new role in January as chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of 200 corporate leaders. He is quickly shaking things up at the venerable trade association, looking to capitalize on the pro-business agenda of President Donald Trump’s administration. To spearhead the effort, Dimon has hired Joshua Bolten, a former White House chief of staff to then-President George W. Bush, as the organization’s president. Dimon has also set an advocacy agenda focused on just three priorities: tax legislation, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending. “I’m a patriot, I want to make this country better off,” Dimon said in an interview. “Public policy is an area where we haven’t been doing a great job. Instead of Republicans and Democrats finger-pointing, let’s get involved, let’s talk about solutions.” It may not be easy for Dimon to revitalize the Business Roundtable, whose members include the heads of St. Louis area-based Express Scripts, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and Peabody Energy. Though the association’s CEO-only membership gives it heft, the executives have often struggled to reach a consensus on key issues. The current debate over whether Congress should impose a border tax on imports, as well as a tax break on exports, is a case in point because it has pitted retailers against manufacturers. In addition, the Business Roundtable hasn’t in the past been known for engaging in bare-knuckled legislative fights. It doesn’t have a political action committee to direct contributions to lawmakers, nor does it endorse candidates. Both are time-tested ways to ensure lobbying results and have been used to great success by other big business trade groups such as the Chamber of Commerce. Still, Dimon said, he and his fellow executives see an opportunity that was hardly worth pursuing during Barack Obama’s presidency. “We have not been hearing about a growth agenda for the last eight years at all,” Dimon said. Dimon, a longtime Democract, has embraced much of Trump’s economic message and is a member of the president’s business advisory council. Dimon has said he grew frustrated about what he considered anti-business and anti-Wall Street views that began to dominate the party under Obama. Dimon more recently has called himself barely a Democrat.

That makes the Business Roundtable’s role “more important” though also “more complicated,” he added. Bolten’s hiring has also surprised some conservatives, who say his anti-Trump statements during the presidential campaign could damage his influence, especially at the White House. In a widely circulated letter last year, Bolten urged alumni of the Bush administration to vote against Trump, saying the real estate mogul was unfit “for the office our former boss held with such distinction.” “That was then, this is now,” Bolten said. “I’m excited about the opportunity generated by the Trump administration and Republican Congress for enactment of hugely beneficial pro-growth policies.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Investment banking fees paid to lenders in the UAE were 45 per cent higher than in the kingdom last year, according to New York-based research firm Freeman & Co. Saudi Arabia has trailed the UAE for fees earned from merger and acquisitions, equity capital market and financing deals since 2011, and is off to a slower start this year, according to the data. Global banks are investing in Saudi Arabia in preparation for an expected fee bonanza. As part of efforts to repair state finances damaged by a slump in oil prices, the kingdom plans to create the world’s largest sovereign fund and sell hundreds of state assets, including Saudi Arabian Oil Co. The IPO could value the company at $2 trillion (Dh7.34 trillion) and generate millions of dollars in fees, but banks may have to wait before their investments pay off. “There will be fees from Saudi Arabia, but it will take a while to get there,” Richard Segal, a London-based analyst at Manulife Asset Management said. “There is a lot of business to be done, it’s just that banks have to make upfront investments until the first deal.” Citigroup talks Citigroup Inc is in advanced discussions for a banking license after a more than 10-year absence from the kingdom, people familiar with the matter said this month. Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat met the kingdom’s Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal Al Saud — a key Citigroup shareholder — for talks in Riyadh this week. US President Donald Trump also met Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who is spearheading Saudi Arabia’s plans to transform its economy and reduce its reliance on oil, earlier this week in Washington, D. They discussed Saudi investments in the US and providing American companies with the opportunities to enter the Saudi market, a senior adviser to the prince said in a statement after Tuesday’s meeting. Credit Suisse Group AG has allocated about $600 million of its own capital to expand its business in the kingdom and is seeking an onshore license, while Evercore Partners Inc, which is said to have won a role to advise on Aramco’s IPO, plans to open an office in Dubai, people said. International banks already present in the kingdom are adding staff, dispatching top executives to Riyadh and promoting Saudis to senior roles to secure deals. Among the biggest, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. appear to have a head start. Saudi deals HSBC was the top arranger for bonds and loans in the kingdom last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank’s profit in Saudi Arabia last year rose to 279 million riyals ($74.4 million), up from 229 million riyals a year earlier. The London-based lender is said to be among banks hired by Saudi Arabia to help arrange its international Islamic bond sale. JPMorgan planned to increase its Saudi staff of 65 by about 10 per cent, Bader Al Amoudi, who runs its local operations, said in an interview last year. The US bank almost doubled its profit for 2015 to 32.8 million riyals. Deutsche Bank AG has about 80 people in Saudi Arabia. Banks earned $237 million in investment banking fees in the UAE last year, compared with $164 million in Saudi Arabia, the Freeman data shows. Lenders secured $154 million from financing deals in the Emirates, compared with $121 million in Saudi Arabia, even after the kingdom raised $17.5 billion in the largest-ever emerging-market debt sale. M&A fees in the UAE were $70 million, almost triple the $24 million earned in Saudi Arabia. “The UAE was much more proactive with its restructuring and consolidation efforts,” said Khalid Howladar, founder of risk and ratings advisory firm Acreditus. Fees from Saudi Arabia “will inevitably come in 2017 and particularly 2018 as a consequence of the National Transformation Plan, Aramco and associated financial activity in all sectors.” Abu Dhabi is merging two of its biggest banks, First Gulf Bank PJSC and National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, as well as sovereign wealth funds Mubadala Development Co. PJSC and International Petroleum Investment Co. The emirate is also considering a plan to merge Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC and Union National Bank PJSC, and combine Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC with Al Hilal Bank PJSC, people with knowledge of the matter said in November. Low-fee culture With the Aramco IPO slated for the second half of 2018, banks still have some time before they’re able to reap any financial rewards. And even when payday comes, they’ll still face the challenge of the kingdom’s low-fee culture. Banks and advisers working on Saudi Arabia’s $6 billion National Commercial Bank IPO, the world’s second-largest IPO in 2014 after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, received about $6.7 million in fees, or about 0.1 per cent of the offering’s value. By comparison, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley took about 1.2 per cent of proceeds on the Alibaba sale. “The Aramco IPO is likely to have fees hugely squeezed,” said Emad Mostaque, chief investment officer of emerging market hedge fund Capricorn Fund Managers. “Moelis have likely been engaged on their behalf to negotiate down fees to as low as possible as it doesn’t make sense for the fees to scale linearly in this case.” Still, a successful offering could prompt more deals in the kingdom and rebalance the region’s investment banking fee pool. “An upgrade announcement to the MSCI Emerging Markets for Saudi Arabia combined with a positive Aramco IPO would lead to a deluge of deals in Saudi Arabia at an order of magnitude above what one can expect to see in the UAE,” said Mostaque.

HOME Core Team Advertising OakRidgeObserver Sunday , March 19, 2017 Economy Culture Hi-Tech Science Sport World News Medical USA ﻿ Economy The 'Very Strange' Item on Trump's 1040: Alternative Minimum Tax March 16, 2017 15:24· That's a "startlingly" large proportion, said Alexander Popovich, a wealth adviser at JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s private bank. "It's very strange - usually, the AMT is not going to cause anywhere near such a difference", Popovich said. President Donald Trump's tax returns, leaked Tuesday night by journalist David Cay Johnston on the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's show reveals that he incurred the majority of his tax liability from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a feature of the tax code he has vowed to eliminate. President Trump has made clear he doesn't like the Alternative Minimum Tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year. To properly calculate a taxpayer's total effective tax rate, one must divide total tax liability by adjusted gross income, or AGI. The tax works by taking away personal and dependent exemptions, as well as various itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes. It's triggered by nearly two dozen factors, including losses, depreciation, stock options and exemptions for children. That's roughly in line with the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers and with what numerous Top 400 paid in 2005. Whatever the reasons, the AMT meant Trump had to pay much higher taxes than he otherwise would. The AMT, which Trump has proposed eliminating, operates as a sort of parallel tax: If you claim too numerous wrong kind of deductions and try to get by with paying too little, you automatically find yourself bumped into the alternative world of the AMT, where different rules - and higher rates - apply. The AMT is forecast to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025, according to Time. That's because the AMT tends to kick in for certain kinds of deductions more than others. Democrats are wary of scrapping it. At least, Trump and I shared the misery in 2005, when we both paid the AMT. Aside from AMT, Trump paid only $5.3 million in regular taxes and almost $2 million in self-employment taxes on a total income of about $153 million in 2005. That raised their total federal income tax to about $36.5 million, an effective rate of about 24 percent. That's a tax rate of about 3 percent. And it would have been far lower than the average income tax rate of 19.7 percent paid by others in the top 1 percent of income. It turns out that Donald Trump and I are members of the same club. It is also speculated that Trump lowered his regular federal income tax bill by deducting the declining value of his assets, along with his past business' losses from his income, according to Time. Taxpayers are allowed to "carry forward" losses that they can't fully use in a given year because they don't have enough taxable income. Without more pages from his tax return, there's a limit to what we can learn from this. Trump is by no means the first politician to take aim at the AMT.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print New role for Dina Powell By Ben White and Mary Lee 03/16/17 08:00 AM EDT NEW ROLE FOR DINA POWELL — Former Goldmanites in the White House continue to rise. Tara Palmeri and I scooped: “President Donald Trump's senior counselor for economic initiatives Dina Powell will be named deputy national security adviser for strategy … “In her new role, Powell is expected to work closely with national security adviser H.R. McMaster and focus on long-term issues. She is also expected to help lead an inter-agency policy process working with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis.” Read more. Story Continued Below CORKER ON POWELL — “Dina will be outstanding in this role, she's got tremendous relationships with all involved," said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "She's the kind of person I think can create consensus in a role of really being the strategic person. I couldn't be more excited that she accepted the role.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said to MM about Powell: “Dina has a near perfect portfolio to be the deputy for strategy. She’s got deep experiences on Capitol Hill, was an assistant secretary of state and has deep relationships around the world.” HAPPY BUDGET DAY — Or not so happy if you are one of the many agencies Trump proposes to cut, including the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities which according to the NYT, the president would like to wipe out entirely. POLITICO’s Nancy Cook has the big picture on the budget: “Trump’s first budget proposal … will be like many of his policy ideas so far — big on showmanship and playing to his base, short on details. “The blueprint is expected to call for taking an ax to programs and agencies that Republicans love to hate like EPA, Energy, Interior, State, HUD and Commerce; foreign aid; the federal workforce; and Education and Labor training programs, while boosting defense spending by roughly $54 billion — and that covers only so-called discretionary spending, which accounts for just a third of the federal government’s budget” Read more. The likely title, according to POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris and Jennifer Scholtes: “America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.” As of 7am, the so-called “skinny budget” (the fat one will come in May) will be here. REAL TALK on the skinny budget from Nomura: “Although markets remain ravenous for information on fiscal policy, [today’s] release will do little to satiate that appetite. We do not expect this document to provide additional policy detail on tax or health care proposals. “Although we expect this document to garner a lot of attention, Congress may not agree with the Trump administration on spending priorities. Also, it will be difficult to significantly increase defense spending because of the parliamentary procedures in place coupled with the very small Republican majority in the Senate.” BUDGET RIPPED FROM BANNON PLAYBOOK — POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher: The ‘deconstruction of the administrative state’ now comes with line items. … Every dollar of proposed cutbacks to domestic, diplomatic and international aid programs that Trump makes in the spending plan will go to boost defense and law enforcement funding. “‘There’s no question this is a hard-power budget,’ said Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. ‘It is not a soft-power budget.’ Read more BLOW TO NATIONALISTS: WILDERS GOES DOWN — POLITICO’s Naomi O’Leary from The Hague: “It’s not often in politics that you can lose a quarter of your seats in parliament and still call yourself a winner. But that’s what’s happened to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, according to an exit poll and preliminary results from Wednesday’s general election. “Rutte’s center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) remains the largest in the new parliament and far-right firebrand Geert Wilders failed to complete a populist hat-trick after Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. Wilders’ Party for Freedom (PVV) was in a race for second place” Read more. TRUMP GOING SOUTH ON AHCA? — President Trump to the pool on Air Force One Wednesday night on the way back from his MAGA rally in Tennessee: “We will get something through. We're going to mix it up, we're going to come up with something. We always do.” Another tidbit from WH spox Sean Spicer on AF1 — German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be joining Trump at Mar-a-Lago after her visit with the president on Friday. YELLEN/TRUMP ON COLLISION COURSE — POLITICO’s Ben White: “Janet Yellen is looking to hide the punch bowl from President Donald Trump. The Federal Reserve chair … announced the central bank would hike interest rates a quarter point for only the third time in a decade. “The move was the first of what could be three or four increases this year that the Fed hopes will keep a lid on inflation and potentially slow down the kind of economic growth Trump promised to deliver during his populist romp to the White House. HISTORIC SHOWDOWN? — “The emerging tension between the Yellen and Trump world views will test a decades-old principle that has guided central bankers: The Fed’s job, as longtime chair William McChesney Martin once said, was to take the punch bowl away just as the party was getting started. “‘We now have the potential for very strong tensions between the White House and the Fed that we haven’t seen since the 1960s and Lyndon Johnson’s presidency,’ said Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell law school. ‘You have a Fed clamping down versus a very expansionary president. And Trump, like Johnson, is a larger than life ego who doesn’t like to be told no.’” Read more. READING BETWEEN YELLEN’S LINES — Yellen denied that a big fiscal stimulus from Trump and the GOP congress would cause a conflict with the Fed and lead to faster rate hikes. But then she explained exactly why that could absolutely happen: “We would certainly welcome stronger economic growth in the context of price stability. And if policies were put in place to speed growth, I'd certainly urge Congress and the administration to consider policies that would boost productivity and raise the economy's so-called speed limit." This appeared to be a tacit warning against simply pursuing big tax reductions, a top White House priority. Tax cuts are inlfationary and have little to do with productivity. Trade tarrifs could also lead to higher consumer goods prices and thus … inflation. Yellen on Glass-Steagall — The Fed chair did not appear to hot on the idea of a “21st Century Glass-Steagall: “I have not seen any concrete proposals along this line. I don't really know what a 21st century Glass-Steagall would look like … “I don't think it was the cause of the financial crisis, and I do feel that we have significantly strengthened supervision of bank holding companies that incorporate investment banking activities." WHAT’S ALL THE YELLEN ABOUT — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “Yellen said Wednesday that the central bank aims to use the federal funds rate as its main policy tool going forward, but she jumbled some terms in the process, argues the Cato Institute’s George Selgin. Yellen said the Fed has ‘much more experience’ with the federal funds rate, as compared to balance sheet purchases, but that’s misleading, Selgin says. The Fed has historically ‘relied on balance sheet changes, AKA open-market operations, to achieve whatever fed funds rate target it set,’ he said in an email. ‘In other words, it had decades, dating back to the 1930s, of experience using balance sheet asset purchase (or sales) as, not only “a” policy tool, but as its principal policy tool! FIRST LOOK: PROGRESSIVES PUSH SEC — In a letter to acting SEC Chair Piwowar on Thursday the Congressional Progressive Caucus will argue in favor of keeping the CEO-to-median pay ratio rule: “It would be a terrible mistake to delay or weaken the rule simply because, as you allege, some companies are having a difficult time calculating their median-worker pay” Full letter.

THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES — Colin Wilhelm on the OCC's guidance for financial technology firms — and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. — please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com DRIVING THE DAY — Trump’s skinny budget will dominate morning chatter but perhaps signify little … House Budget Committee expected to advance the AHCA … Treasury Steven Mnuchin and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble hold a press conference in Berlin at 1:00 p.m. EST, 6:00 p.m. local time … House Financial Services subcommittees hold two hearings one at 10:00 a.m. on monetary policy and another at 2:30 p.m. on flood insurance … JOLTS Report at 10:00 a.m. expected to show openings rising to 5,562K from 5,501K ** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Business leaders are bullish on America and are gaining confidence about the U.S. economy, according to the 2017 JPMorgan Chase Business Leaders Outlook report. 80% of mid-sized businesses said they were optimistic about the U.S. economy and 76% expect that the new administration will have a positive impact on their business. http://politi.co/2mFsIt4 ** TRAVEL BAN 2.0 HALTED — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “A federal judge in Hawaii issued a worldwide restraining order against enforcement of key parts of … Trump’s revised travel ban executive order just hours before the directive was set to kick in. “U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled that the state of Hawaii and a local Muslim leader had ‘a strong likelihood of success on their claim’ that Trump’s order intentionally targets Muslims and therefore violates the Constitution’s guarantee against establishment of religion.” Read more. MM is still not sure how you get over the establishment clause hurdle when Trump himself during the campaign called it a Muslim ban. Perhaps if it gets that far, SCOTUS could ignore intent and simply rule on the current wording of the order. But that’s no slam-dunk. TRUMP HURTS HIS OWN CASE — POLITICO’s Annie Karnie and Josh Dawsey: “[E]ven as the administration continued to argue in legal briefs that the executive order was not about Muslims, Trump on stage brought up ‘radical Islamic terrorists.’ “His tough-guy remarks were heartening to some activists fighting the ban. ‘He should just continue talking, because he's making our arguments for us,’ said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.” Read more. FED MOVES MARKETS — Bloomberg’s Julie Verhage reports: “The Fed’s policy decision is sending shock waves through financial markets. But it’s not the first rate hike of 2017 that’s got the dollar tumbling and Treasuries rallying with equities. Instead, markets are reacting to Federal Reserve officials’ forecast that rates will rise three times this year, which is in line with its outlook from December. Some investors had thought policy makers might change it to four increases.” Read more. YAHOO HACKERS CHARGED via WSJ: “Federal authorities have charged four men, including two officers from Russia’s spy agency, with hacking computer systems at Yahoo Inc. and stealing personal data that affected hundreds of millions of Yahoo users, in the first such case to directly target the Russian government. “Two of the men, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, are officers at Russia’s secretive Federal Security Service who protected, directed, facilitated, and paid others to collect information through computer intrusions in the U.S. and elsewhere, authorities said.” Read more. FLOOD DEBATE SPLASHES AHEAD — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports: “Companies that sell flood insurance on behalf of the federal government are facing fire from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are threatening to cut their income and rein in their operations. “The firms are in the spotlight as Congress prepares to reform the National Flood Insurance Program before it expires at the end of September. The program is the dominant provider of flood insurance in the United States and helps protects millions of homeowners from the financial risks of flood damage.” Read more. YELLEN’S MESSAGE — NYT’s Neil Irwin: “The economy will keep growing just enough to put more Americans back to work, but without overheating to generate excessive inflation. American workers will see gradual pay raises that keep compensation rising faster than inflation. Interest rates will rise gradually, while staying low by historical standards. And that’s all before accounting for any major stimulative policies that may emerge from the Trump administration and Congress. “That was the view of the economy sketched by the … Yellen, at her first news conference of 2017 on Wednesday. In short, the Fed believes that after nearly eight years of trying to nurse the economy back to health, its work is nearly done.” Read more. BIG WIN FOR AUTOMAKERS — Reuters’ Nick Carey and David Shepardson: “Trump on Wednesday ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration, handing a victory to auto industry executives and provoking criticism from Democrats and environmental groups. “In a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards, Trump told an audience of cheering union workers, he would ‘ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories,’ and promised he would encourage growth in the U.S. auto sector.” Read more. FINTECH FIRMS TO GET BANK CHARTERS — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is pushing ahead with its effort to redefine what makes a bank in the digital age. “The bank regulator on Wednesday issued new guidance for its limited purpose bank charter, primarily for financial technology firms, releasing standards that the startups must meet to obtain one. The move was done in defiance of House Republicans, who have threatened to undo the guidance, and immediately drew fire from state banking regulators.” Read more. WELLS FARGO CEO RECEIVES PAY BUMP — Reuters’ Tina Bellon: “Wells Fargo & Co's board of directors awarded Chief Executive Timothy Sloan $12.8 million for his work last year, a 17 percent increase, despite scrapping executive bonuses in light of an accounts scandal that rocked the bank last year, according to a proxy filing on Wednesday. “Sloan was CEO for only a few months in 2016. He took over after his predecessor, John Stumpf, resigned in light of revelations that thousands of Wells Fargo employees had opened perhaps millions of unauthorized customer accounts.” Read more. BANK OF AMERICA CHAIRMAN DEBATE — Reuters reports: “Bank of America Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan will once again face a shareholder vote on whether he should maintain both roles, according to the bank's proxy filing on Wednesday. “A shareholder proposal calls on the bank's board to install an independent chairman, while it allows for the board's discretion to only apply the policy to the next CEO.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — DIMON REBUTTAL — Better Markets’ Dennis Kelleher on Jamie Dimon’s comments about repatriation working as stealth stimulus: “Jamie Dimon is wrong in seeing repatriation proceeds as a ‘new stimulus’ even if it all goes into dividends and stock buybacks. “With 81 percent of stocks owned by the top 10 percent and 92 percent owned by the top 20 percent, that money will go to those least likely to spend the windfall, as opposed to the bottom 50 percent which need it and would be highly likely to spend almost all of it and quickly” DURBIN FIGHT HITS MARCH MADNESS - The Alliance for Main Street Fairness on Thursday is launching “a March Badness Bracket to let Members of Congress pick between Wall Street banks and credit card companies, or small business owners, consumers and veterans” See it here. MICROSITE TARGETING REPEAL OF DURBIN AMENDMENT — The National Restaurant Association is launching a microsite targeting the repeal of the Durbin Amendment, and includes an animated video explaining the debit card tax and why it hurts consumers, small businesses and restaurants. “After taking billions in bailouts from taxpayers, the country’s biggest banks now want to put a debit card tax on consumers and small businesses — all to fatten their own bottom line. The National Restaurant Association is excited to launch this website to help educate more people about this cash grab by Wall Street as we take the fight to Congress,” said Leslie Shedd, vice president of communications. ** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Business leaders are bullish on America and are gaining confidence about the U.S. economy, according to the 2017 JPMorgan Chase Business Leaders Outlook report. 80% of mid-sized businesses said they were optimistic about the U.S. economy and 76% expect that the new administration will have a positive impact on their business, wanting the government to focus on reducing regulations and lowering taxes.

We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. Have a fine and hopefully dry evening. 4:36pm on 16 Mar 2017 In a session dominated by central bank policy, the local sharemarket initially surged higher after the US Federal Reserve flagged a cautious approach to rate rises this year, only to trim gains after a surprise follow-up move by the People's Bank of China. Benefiting from a surge on Wall Street, the S&P/ASX 200 jumped in early trade, peaking just above 5800 points, only to hit reverse in afternoon trade, before a late spike salvaged some gains and the benchmark index ended the day 0.2 per cent higher at 5785.8. The Fed raised its benchmark lending rate a quarter point, as widely expected, but continued to project two more increases this year, defying predictions it might signal a faster pace of tightening. The immediate market reaction was a drop in the US dollar against most currencies, including the Australian dollar, as well as a rise in commodities, which are mostly prices in US dollar, triggering spikes in the share prices of miners.  "There were some sections of the market that expected dramatically revised forecasts and [interest rate] dot plot and therefore many people have found themselves too short of US funds," said Pimco chief investment officer Scott Mather. Hours after the Fed's move, China's central bank increased the rates it charges, in a move seen as a bid to stave off capital outflows and keep the currency stable. "Today's action is a precautionary action for the stabilisation of the renminbi exchange rate," said ANZ China economist Raymond Yeung. "It provides a signal that China will start to make use of interest rate tools to govern its monetary policy and influence cross border flows." The surprise decision weighed a bit on sentiment, with most regional markets losing momentum in the aftermath. Local miners were still the day's biggest winners after commodities including iron ore and copper gained overnight. BHP Billiton jumped 3.7 per cent, Rio Tinto rose 2.4 per cent and Fortescue rallied 4.4 per cent, all three extending strong gains earlier in the week. A sharp drop in global bond yields following the Fed's dovish decision meant banks - which profit from higher yields - were among the biggest losers of the day, with NAB losing 2.4 per cent, Westpac and ANZ down about 1.5 per cent and Commonwealth Bank slipping 0.3 per cent. In turn, so-called bond proxies edged higher, with Sydney Airport rising 1.9 per cent.  In corporate news, Myer shares fell 5.3 per cent to a four-month low of $1.08 after the department store chain said sales dropped 1.3 per cent in the second quarter and January and February sales came in below expectations. Seymour Whyte shares soared 21.8 per cent to $1.34 after the construction firm received a tentative bid from Vinci Construction, offering a price range of $1.36 to $1.43 cash per ordinary share. 4:14pm on 16 Mar 2017 The plan to rescue Slater and Gordon is under way after its major bankers on-sold their debt to distressed-debt buyers, paving the way for a restructure.  Sources told Fairfax Media that Westpac, National Australia Bank, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which together held in excess of $700 million in debt, exited their holdings in the past 24 hours. Matters are moving quickly, with legal and financial advisers working hard to finalise a restructure of the group in the coming days. Sources said a restructure was being worked out that would dramatically reduce the debt in the company. It is expected the new debt holders will participate in a debt-for-equity swap, where they would exchange their debt for shares in a restructured Slater and Gordon. The final details are being thrashed out, but it is believed existing shareholders will be severely diluted in the process. Here's more A rescue plan is under way. Photo: Paul Jeffers 3:30pm on 16 Mar 2017 Myer boss is trying to shake off the short sellers, and today's profit figures didn't help, writes the AFR companies editor James Thomson: Department store giant Myer is becoming a classic battle between the bulls and the bears – and the company's caveat-heavy profit guidance demonstrates this perfectly. Less than four months after chief executive Richard Umbers sent his share price flying and the short sellers scurrying upgrading Myer's full-year profit outlook, the retailer easily beat expectations for its first-half net profit, with earnings rising 5.3 per cent to $62.8 million, ahead of consensus for $58 million. Good news for the bulls. But Myer's first-half sales figures were not at all pretty. Sales and transaction numbers in January and February were "below expectations, with January being the low point". That's vindication for the bears and particularly the short sellers, who still hold more than 15 per cent of Myer and have made it one of the ASX's most shorted stocks. But Umbers' guidance for the full year provides the perfect example of why the shorts and the longs can find something to love in Myer. In what might be read as a display of corporate bravery given the state of the market, Umbers is sticking to his forecast that net profit (both before and after the costs of the implementation of his New Myer turnaround are included) would be higher than for the 2016 full year. On the face of it, that's more good news for the bulls. Except the guidance came with a pretty big caveat. It is "based on the expectation" that those conditions seen in January and February "do not return". That's a mighty big "if" given how downbeat Umbers was about trading in the early months of the year. Will the sales suddenly turn around from the "low point" of January? Will the sales headwinds Umbers called out on Thursday – including patchy consumer confidence and "widespread" discount fatigue among shoppers – abate in the remaining trading weeks of the financial year? As Umbers says, revenue is "the core building block of a profitable result". To translate, cost cutting has its limits. After delivering five quarters of sales growth before this second quarter's major stumble, Umbers would know he simply must get sales heading north again. Read more at the AFR. Myer chief executive Richard Umbers. Photo: Paul Jeffers 3:10pm on 16 Mar 2017 Dutch anti-Islam, anti-EU firebrand candidate Geert Wilders has conceded defeat in parliamentary elections, congratulating Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on his victory, but promising not to go away. The right-wing populist promised firm opposition if he does not end up, as is likely, in the ruling coalition. "I would rather have been the largest party," the leader of the Party for Freedom told reporters after exit polls showed Rutte's centre-right VVD Party to win 31 of parliament's 150 seats, down from 41 in 2012 but ahead of Wilders' party, which tied in second place with two other parties at 19 each. "[But] we gained seats. That's a result to be proud of," Wilders said adding his party's influence on Dutch politics had been enormous. A beaming Rutte told cheering supporters at a post- election party that "it appears that the VVD will be the biggest party in the Netherlands for the third time in a row". "Tonight we'll celebrate a little." "It is also an evening in which the Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said stop to the wrong kind of populism," Rutte said. The unconfirmed result is a huge relief to other EU governments, facing a wave of nationalism. He said he had spoken to several European leaders, who called to congratulate him. French President Francois Hollande said Rutte's election success was a "clear victory against extremism".  France faces a presidential election starting in April when far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who wants to leave the EU and sharply curb immigration, is expected to make a strong showing. At 81 per cent, turnout was the highest in 30 years in an election that was a test of whether the Dutch wanted to end decades of liberalism and choose a nationalist, nativist path by voting for Wilders and his promise to "de-Islamicise" the Netherlands.

The increase in short-term rates was China's third in as many months, and came a day after the end of the annual session of parliament where leaders warned that tackling risks from a rapid build-up in debt would be a top policy priority this year. In a statement on its website, the PBoC pointed to stronger domestic and external demand, higher inflation, rapid credit growth and an overheating housing market in some cities as factors behind today's hikes. It also mentioned the overnight Fed rate hike. Hours earlier, the Fed raised its benchmark policy rate, as had been widely expected, and signalled more hikes were on the way as the US economy picks up steam. "The higher US rates and tightening of US monetary policy could trigger further capital outflows and have some negative impact on China's financial system," Nomura economist Yang Zhao said. "I think they want to stabilise the currency at this time." Some analysts had expected another such rate rise in China in coming months as authorities look to contain risks from a rapid build-up in debt. The People's Bank of China also strengthened the yuan's daily mid-point reference rate by the most in about two months. The yuan fell 6.5 per cent against the US dollar last year in the face of the rising greenback and uncertainty over China's economy, prompting the government to clamp down on capital outflows to ease a drain on its foreign exchange reserves. The yuan has been largely stable this year as the dollar has paused, but China's government has remained alert as many market watchers expect the US dollar will eventually resume its climb. The latest move reflects the central bank's desire to maintain relatively high yuan rates, increasing the cost of shorting the yuan, and easing depreciation pressure, Zhou Hao, emerging markets economist at Commerzbank, said in a note. After years of super-loose policy, the PBoC has cautiously moved to a modest tightening bias in recent months in a bid to cool explosive growth in debt and discourage speculative activity, though it is treading cautiously to avoid hurting growth. The economy is on more solid footing now than early last year, giving policymakers more room, in theory, to tackle financial risks and push through reforms. In keeping with its cautious tone, the central bank's increases in short-term rates today were a very modest 10 basis points, or a tenth of a percentage point, the same size as moves in January and February. The PBoC insisted the moves did not indicate a change in its monetary policy or constitute a hike in its benchmark policy rate. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard predicts further increases in Chinese interbank rates during the coming quarters as the PBoC moves to slow the pace of credit growth. "Our forecast for the PBoC's 7-day reverse repo rate to end this year at 3.0%, implying a further 55 basis points of hikes, remains unchanged." The People's Bank of China has lifted rates in what is seen as an attempt to avoid downward pressure on the yuan following the Fed's move. Photo: SeongJoon Cho 2:47pm on 16 Mar 2017 NAB has jacked up rates for owner occupiers and residential property investors, but launched a special introductory rate for first home buyers.  NAB's standard variable rate has risen from 5.25 per cent to 5.32 per cent, while the rate for residential investment loan customers rises from 5.55 per cent to 5.8 per cent.  As a sweetener, NAB has introduced a two-year fixed rate loan rate for first home buyers at 3.69 per cent per annum. The increases to owner-occupiers and investors follow a string of rises on investor loan rates across the market as the banks struggle with speed limits on investor loan growth introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority late in 2014. More recently, APRA moved to tighten eligibility among investor borrowers by asking banks to discount rental income by 20 per cent when looking at servicability. NAB is the latest bank to tighten home loan lending. Photo: Boomberg 2:15pm on 16 Mar 2017 The Fed's decision may have hugged the limelight, but another key central bank also met today to discuss monetary policy: The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady in the wake of the Fed's second interest rate hike in three months, underscoring the diverging policy paths of major global central banks. Economists had expected no change in the BoJ's policy settings as rising global protectionist sentiment and an expected series of US rate hikes overshadow budding signs of recovery in the trade-reliant Japanese economy. Investors are now focusing on governor Haruhiko Kuroda's post-meeting briefing later this afternoon for clues on how the Fed's move could affect the BoJ's decision on whether and when to pull back its massive stimulus programme. Kuroda, who will attend this week's Group of 20 finance leaders' meeting in Germany, may also shed light on how the BoJ will defend its ultra-loose policy from any US criticism it is exploiting a weak yen to gain a competitive trade advantage. As expected, the BoJ maintained its short-term interest rate target of minus 0.1 per cent and a pledge to guide the 10-year government bond yield at around zero per cent via aggressive asset purchases. It also kept intact a loose pledge to maintain the pace of its annual increase in Japanese government bond (JGBs) holdings, which is 80 trillion yen ($917 billion). While a rebound in fuel costs is set to accelerate price growth in coming months, Kuroda is likely to stress that no immediate rate hike is on the horizon with inflation still nowhere near his ambitious 2 per cent target. But he may leave open the chance of raising the BoJ's target for the 10-year bond yield if the economic recovery gathers enough momentum to push prices steadily higher, analysts say. The Bank of Japan kept rates on hold today. Photo: Bloomberg 2:05pm on 16 Mar 2017 Seymour Whyte shares are soaring after rhe construction firm received a tentative bid from Vinci Construction. Vinci proposed to acquire 100 per cent of Seymour's issued shares for a price range of $1.36 to $1.43 cash per ordinary share. The offer suggests a structure whereby a special dividend may be incorporated as part of total consideration to unlock the value of franking credits. Seymour Whyte has a franking credit balance of about $17.8 million. The firms say there's no certainty the initial proposal will result in binding offer, but Seymour has agreed to provide Vinci with access to due diligence. Shares have jumped 22 per cent to $1.34. 1:35pm on 16 Mar 2017 Economists are releasing their verdicts on this morning's jobs data, and it's fair to say they don't love them. JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy calls it an "unambiguously weak" report: Importantly, the unemployment rate is now just 0.1 [percentage point] below the upper end of the RBA's forecast range, meaning any increases from here will likely cause the RBA to rethink their outlook for monetary policy The weakness in annual full-time employment growth continues to be borne out in the underemployment rate (the number of underemployed workers expressed as a percentage of the labour force), which popped higher in February and is now tracking at all-time highs again. As we have previously mentioned, wage growth since 2013 has held a strong negative relationship with the underemployment rate, so today's pop higher makes the RBA's objective of engineering a sustained up-tick in core inflation all the more difficult. We still see the cash rate biased lower in Australia. While this might take some time to play out, today's data are a salient reminder that underlying fundamentals in the Australian economy are certainly not consistent with higher rates anytime soon. On a similar line, Citi's Josh Williamson writes that labour market weakness is "a warning to RBA hawks": Ongoing spare capacity in the labour market portends continuing sub-trend wages growth. The February data keeps the rolling average three-month unemployment rate around 5¾%. This is about 0.75ppt above what the RBA views as full employment. Reducing the gap requires a pick-up in GDP growth. However, GDP growth is not strong enough to lift employment growth to a speed that will do so. Furthermore, the earlier pick-up in yearly employment growth now looks out of place. Market pricing for RBA rate hikes needs to be pushed well into [2018], in our view. ANZ economist Felicity Emmett writes: The February labour market report disappointed, with a fall of 6.4k jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9%. The detail was slightly more positive than the headline with full-time jobs rebounding after the previous month's sharp fall. The weakness in the report is at odds with still solid business conditions and ongoing gains in ANZ job ads, and in our view some improvement is likely over coming months. UBS's George Tharenou agrees that lead indicators suggest employment could improve in coming months: Overall, the trends in the labour market over recent months show ongoing modest jobs growth. However, the unemployment rate jumped to 5.9%, which combined with weak hours, saw the broader underutilisation rate surge to only just below a 2-decade high, indicating significant labour market slack, consistent with our view of low inflation & wages. That said, lead indicators of employment still suggest better jobs growth over coming months (~1½ - 2% y/y). Nonetheless, for now, the labour market data strongly argues against growing calls for the RBA to hike (UBS's forecast if for rates on hold ahead). And here's Capital Economics's Kate Hickie: While we are wary about reading too much into a single monthly move, given that the fall in employment followed only modest gains in December and January, it sends a worrying signal about the current momentum in the labour market. What's more, although full-time jobs rose by 27,100 in February, that wasn't enough to reverse the sizeable 44,100 fall in January. Indeed, it is still true that on net all of the jobs created in the past year have been part-time ones. All told, it is clear that there is still plenty of slack in the labour market, which supports our view that wage growth will remain subdued for a few years yet. · Looking ahead, we expect employment growth to remain modest and the unemployment rate to remain around 6.0% this year. That said, in this low underlying inflation environment, if the unemployment rate were to rise notably this could be enough to prompt a further rate cut by the RBA, particularly if concerns about financial stability ease. Photo: JP Morgan Back to top 1:30pm on 16 Mar 2017 And there go the last of today's gains on the sharemarket, and once again it's mainly miners that are driving the overall market. The ASX was already well off the day's highs following the soggy jobs numbers, but since Chinese iron ore futures started turning south about half an hour ago, the selling in the market has accelerated. Dalian iron ore futures have just slumped another 10 yuan to 711 yuan, taking them about 25 yuan below the early high. The big miners are all still posting solid gains, following the tailwind they received from the Fed's more dovish stance this morning, which pushed up commodity prices, but they are all about 1 per cent off the earlier highs. BHP and Rio are both up about 2.3 per cent, while Fortescue has added 2.9 per cent. Meanwhile, selling in the banks has also picked up a bit, with ANZ the worst performer, down 1.7 per cent. Myer is deep in the red, falling 4.6 per cent after its January and February sales numbers disappointed. 1:11pm on 16 Mar 2017 One of Australia's largest fund managers will divest millions of dollars worth of shares in companies that make deadly landmines and cluster bombs as part of an ethical investment overhaul.  AMP Capital will also sell about $440 million worth of tobacco company shares under a new framework that uses degrees of "harm" and "denial of humanity" to determine if an investment is ethical. The $165 billion investment manager said it would divest about $130 million worth of shares of companies that make cluster munitions and landmines because those weapons killed indiscriminately and left a dangerous legacy for civilians.  The company said it was not invested in chemical and biological weapons manufacturers, but ruled out ever doing so under the new ethical framework, developed with the help of The Ethics Centre.  AMP said it was selling out of tobacco because it was a highly addictive product that could not be safe for consumers and hurt others through passive smoking.  "We are not prepared to deliver investment returns to customers at any cost to society," AMP Capital chief executive Adam Tindall said. AMP's new ethical framework takes into account if there are international conventions that prohibit or control a company's products.  The Convention on Cluster Munitions, which bans the use and production of cluster bombs, has been signed by more than 100 states, including Australia. Mr Tindall said AMP still believed that engaging with companies was the best way to change their behaviour, but when it came to makers of tobacco, cluster munitions, landmines, biological and chemical weapons,  "no engagement can override the inherent dangers involved with their products".  "Our analysis has found that our funds can continue to be managed effectively under this new framework without compromising investment objectives," he said.    AMP said landmines and cluster bombs killed indiscriminately and left a dangerous legacy for civilians.  Photo: AP 12:43pm on 16 Mar 2017 BusinessDay columnist Elizabeth Knight explains the real reason the big supermarkets want you to be "loyal": Last November I signed for Coles' flybuys loyalty program by way of researching whether it would make me an additionally loyal customer. This week I discovered I had spent about $3500 and believing this would have earned me a handsome coupon, I was amazed – no gobsmacked – that all this loyalty was rewarded with a $10 discount coupon. Cynicism comes with the turf in the journalistic profession and I had instinctively known that supermarket loyalty schemes are not particularly generous. I didn't believe that I was in line for a business class airfare to anywhere but thought I might be well on my way to earning some cheap electronic appliance, say a waffle maker. And none of the above suggests that Coles – or Woolworths for that matter – doesn't carry some good cheap everyday produce on the shelves. But these are available to all customers, not just those with a loyalty card. Instead, what this loyalty scheme is lavishing on its members is a 0.5 per cent discount. It is hard to imagine spending that much money with any other retailer or service provider and receiving this minuscule discount. Meanwhile, as the Coles checkout operator watched my jaw-dropping look of disbelief she quickly assured me that once I spend another $500 – or $4000 in total – I would get a $20 discount coupon. Can't say that made me feel any more loyal. And at the risk of appearing that Coles is being singled out for its miserly rewards program let it be on the record that the Woolworths scheme is no more generous. The main argument in favour of joining a supermarket loyalty scheme is that there is no downside – you were already going to shop there so even a small benefit is a gift. So why are these supermarkets so keen on giving us something for nothing? They aren't. We are giving them the precious – and valuable – gift of our personal data. Read more. Coles says flybuys does not sell personal data. Photo: Jessica Shapiro 12:23pm on 16 Mar 2017 Now even fast fashion is getting tougher. Inditex, the owner of the Zara chain, said overnight that profitability shrank to an eight-year low. Main rival Hennes & Mauritz reported the first monthly sales drop in almost four years. Shares of both retailers sank. The reports illustrate the difficulties facing the fashion industry as consumers divert spending to leisure activities and buy more of their apparel from a rising number of online suppliers. The increased competition is putting pressure on prices, while higher production costs are also squeezing profitability. "In February, industry data was very challenging," Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC Capital, said in a note. Sales declines of 9 per cent in Germany and 6 per cent in Sweden reflect "some spend rotation into other consumer categories." H&M shares fell as much as 5.1 per cent in Stockholm, the most in three months. A 1 per cent drop in February sales was caused by the month having one day fewer than in the leap year of 2016. Adjusting for that, revenue rose 3 per cent in local currencies, missing estimates. Chamberlain estimates that H&M's same-store sales fell 3 per cent in the month, weighed down by the tough industry conditions and as initiatives to expand online options for customers and improve methods of supply take time to feed through to sales. H&M has been in the shadow of faster-growing competitor Inditex in recent years, though Wednesday's results from the Zara owner suggest it too is finding life more difficult. Inditex's gross margin narrowed to 57 per cent from 57.8 per cent in the 12 months through January, missing the Spanish retailer's goal to keep the measure within 0.5 percentage points of the previous year. H&M reported the first monthly sales drop in almost four years. Photo: Piotr Malecki 12:12pm on 16 Mar 2017 Apart from the soft jobs data, slow to non-existant wages growth is the RBA's other bugbear, and the reason why interest rates are unlikely to go up anytime soon (if it weren't for those pesky house prices): I love the honesty of the RBA about their wage forecasts https://t.co/2Cx6FGJfoy pic.twitter.com/IESmIdP8lW— Cameron Murray (@Rumplestatskin) March 16, 2017 Back to top 12:08pm on 16 Mar 2017 Just for a bit of historical context, here is the full-time/part-time split going back almost 40 years. That split has gone from 85/15 to more like 65/35 over the decades. Not that the recent trend towards P/T isn't significant to today's debate around low wage growth. 11:59am on 16 Mar 2017 And here are some responses from the Twitterati to this morning's jobs data: Even with the full time/ part time switch, Australia still shedding full time jobs & total employment still only running sub 1% - soft data. pic.twitter.com/OsdBxXJfLq— Robert Rennie (@R0bertRennie) March 16, 2017 Jobs data out 5.8% and a big jump in FT jobs of 27K.A positive not sure how much credence the market gives them now.

The Aussie is fetching US76.93¢, after hitting a three-week high of US77.19¢ earlier in the session. Considering the scale of the jobs data miss - the unemployment rate rose to a 13-month high of 5.9 per cent, instead of remaining unchanged as expected - it's a bit surprising the Aussie hasn't fallen further, but the currency seems well supported by the overarching theme of greenback weakness. There are also the usual doubts about the reliability of the highly volatile Australian employment data. "Given the unpredictability and huge variance in this data point, I expect the Aussie to remain supported on dips," said OANDA managing director Illka Gobius. But Gobius also doesn't expect the Aussie to climb much further: "As we find ourselves back in the AUD death valley at .77-.7750, the speed of the move has me erring in buy on dip mode, as opposed to chasing this initial move." 11:36am on 16 Mar 2017 The unemployment rate has jumped to a 13-month high of 5.9 per cent, above the consensus forecast of a steady 5.7 per cent result, after the economy shed 6400 jobs in February on a seasonally adjusted basis. A 27,100 gain in full-time jobs over the month was outmatched by a 33,500 fall in part-time jobs, according to the ABS survey. The market had been expecting an extra 16,000 jobs in total over the month. The participation rate was steady 64.6 per cent. ABS has released latest jobs data. Photo: Bloomberg 11:01am on 16 Mar 2017 The sheer scale of Australia's household debt means lifting interest rates is going to be a far more sensitive operation than in previous times. At present, just two economists think the RBA will hike rates this year as it frets about hefty mortgages and financial stability. Goldman Sachs and TD Securities both expect a single quarter-percentage-point increase in the fourth quarter, while traders are pricing in a 30 per cent chance of a hike by December.But consider a hypothetical scenario where the Federal Reserve turns aggressive in lifting rates, the Australian dollar tumbles, and the RBA seeks to tame a subsequent boost in inflation with monetary policy: too much household debt would pose a risk of the central bank crushing the economy with the hit from rate rises. James McIntyre, head of economic research at Macquarie Bank, has run the ruler over previous tightening cycles in the mid 1990s and turn of the century, the first of which involved 11 quarter-point hikes. He found that the subsequent surge in households' debt servicing ratio -- interest costs as a portion of disposable income -- would be achieved with less than a third of those hikes today, thanks to record high private debt levels. "The RBA's reticence about further increases in household debt-to-income ratios is clear when you begin to consider how potent interest-rate rises might be from a debt-servicing perspective," McIntyre said. ``At the current level of debt-to-income, we estimate that three to four 25 basis-point rate hikes would deliver a bigger increase in debt-servicing costs for households than 10 to 11 rate hikes did in the mid-1990s." McIntyre, who doesn't expect a rate increase until early 2019 when core inflation is likely back inside its 2 per cent to 3 per cent target, notes the other difference between the periods is a wider spread between the cash rate and lenders' mortgage rates: from 180 basis points to about 375 basis points.

Imagine a scenario in which the Federal Reserve turns aggressive in lifting rates, the Aussie dollar tumbles, and the RBA seeks to tame a subsequent boost in inflation with monetary policy: it's a delicate situation. Photo: Louie Douvis Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Shares of Biogen led declines, dropping nearly 5 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight. Analysts also attributed the overall health care stock declines to President Donald Trump's budget blueprint, released Thursday, that proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) spending by $5.8 billion. "The proposed cut in the NIH budget is pretty significant and I don't know if it will happen," said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Funds. "The NIH is a $32 billion budget. It was expected to increase 3 percent. To have it slashed by 18 percent, $6 billion, is a tremendous change." On Wednesday, the health care sector hit a fresh high going back to August 2015. Financials traded about half a percent higher as the top performer in the S&P. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the top contributors to gains the Dow Jones industrial average. "The market saw a bullish reaction to the Fed's announcement yesterday, allowing the S&P futures to clear intraday resistance. The ratio of up- to down-volume was better than 5-to-1, setting the stage for upside follow-through today," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note. However, she still expects stocks to remain in "pullback-mode until short-term momentum improves."  U.S. crude oil futures reversed earlier gains to trade slightly lower below $49 a barrel. WTI snapped a seven-day losing streak Wednesday after weekly inventory data showed a drawdown in stockpiles. In corporate news, Toronto-based luxury apparel maker Canada Goose went public on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Shares opened at US$18 and were last trading near $16, about 25 percent above their IPO price. Canada Goose will also trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and continued to signal two additional hikes this year. Policymakers said inflation should now "stabilize" around 2 percent and they would continue to monitor developments relative to the Fed's "symmetric" inflation goal. Markets had generally expected indication of more aggressive tightening. U.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, with the Nasdaq 100 at a record. Stock index futures held higher after a slew of Thursday morning economic reports. The latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed job openings were little changed at 5.6 million on the last business day of January 2017. Weekly initial jobless claims fell to 241,000. Housing starts rose in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.288 million, more than expected. The Philly Fed Index also topped forecasts at 32.8 for March. Gold futures leaped to their highest since March 6. Futures for April delivery settled up $26.40 at $1,227.10 an ounce. While the Fed statement was "arguably hawkish overall, it was not as hawkish as many people in the market place feared, which lifted commodities and [sent] the dollar lower," said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals. Treasury yields edged higher, steadying after a drop Wednesday afternoon. The 2-year yield was last near 1.32 percent and the 10-year yield traded around 2.52 percent. The U.S. dollar index traded about a third of a percent lower, with the euro around $1.073 and the yen near 113.1. The euro topped $1.07 late Wednesday after the Dutch election gave Prime Minister Mark Rutte a victory over populist rival Geert Wilders. "I think the economic data continues to support the growth thesis," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private bank. "Political risk seems to have pulled back a bit on the Dutch election. Most of the action we're seeing is overseas." Overseas, the STOXX Europe 600 traded more than half a percent higher. The Shanghai composite rose 0.8 percent and the Hang Seng jumped nearly 2.1 percent after China's central bank raised short-term interest rates. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.07 percent higher. U.S. crude oil futures for April delivery settled down 11 cents at $48.75 a barrel. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens — even if it ends up never happening. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world. In the two months since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, people have been making decisions based on perceptions of how he may change the country's direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump's first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast with the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody's Analytics says there were 298,000 new private-sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000. Private educational services jobs were up 29,000. And manufacturing jobs were up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they're doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I'm not sure any economist's statistical model could, either. But it sure looks as if that's what's happening. Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice more this year after doing so twice in the past three months. That's a significant shift from her long-standing reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said March 10 that Trump's agenda of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the "animal spirits" -- economist John Maynard Keynes' phrase — of businesspeople. "Even if he gets (just) part of it done," Dimon, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton contributor, told Bloomberg, "it'll be good for growth." Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on the first of three promised initiatives to repeal and replace Obamacare suggest that he and Trump are trying to strengthen the perception that the private-sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks as if the answer is yes. People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators -- are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are undocumented immigrants and people deciding whether to cross the border illegally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of people who crossed the southern border illegally in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 percent from February 2016. They were also lower than the border crossings in December — traditionally by far the lowest month — in the years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. That's a starling drop. And it's one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, seeing as most people who have crossed the border illegally since the Great Recession have come from Central America. Under Obama administration policy, Central American children (or adults claiming to be younger than 18) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Trump's executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that policy has changed. That message has apparently been delivered to people hundreds or even thousands of miles south of the Rio Grande. Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president's likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president's policies, not so much. As a president's term goes on, perceptions of a president's policies are replaced by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects are modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot on. But it's sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain's vote for Brexit and America's for Trump would crater those countries' respective economies. That hasn't happened yet — and most people seem to perceive it won't. — Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for The Washington Examiner, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News Channel contributor and a co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

Die Resultate des Kali- und Salzkonzerns für das vierte Quartal hätten die Erwartungen erfüllt und der Ausblick sei positiv, schrieb Analyst Jit Hoong Chan in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Diese Entwicklungen seien zwar ermutigend. Er hält die Papiere aber auch schon für hoch bewertet. Das höhere Kursziel begründete der Experte mit angehobenen Margenschätzungen. NordLB hebt Ziel für Lufthansa auf 16,50 Euro – ‘Kaufen’ HANNOVER – Die NordLB hat das Kursziel für Lufthansa nach Zahlen und einer Grundsatzeinigung mit den Piloten von 14,00 auf 16,50 Euro angehoben und die Einstufung auf “Kaufen” belassen. Die Fluggesellschaft habe ein solides Zahlenwerk für 2016 vorgelegt und einen überzeugenden Ausblick abgegeben, schrieb Analyst Wolfgang Donie in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Die Grundsatzeinigung mit den Piloten sei außerdem äußerst positiv. Er geht davon aus, dass es nun zu einem tatsächlichen Abschluss kommen wird. S&P Global hebt Ziel für Lanxess auf 70 Euro – ‘Hold’ LONDON – Das Analysehaus S&P Global hat das Kursziel für Lanxess nach Zahlen von 60 auf 70 Euro angehoben, die Einstufung aber auf “Hold” belassen. Der Chemiekonzern habe im vierten Quartal 2016 die Erwartungen übertroffen, schrieb Analyst Jit Hoong Chan in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Daher habe er seine Gewinnschätzung für 2017 erhöht. Er lobte ferner die sich fortsetzende Kostenoptimierung und die Neuausrichtung des Konzerns. Allerdings sei er wegen des lauen Ausblicks für das Umsatzwachstum aus eigener Kraft vorsichtig. Goldman hebt Ziel für Oracle auf 49 US-Dollar – ‘Conviction Buy’ NEW YORK – Die US-Investmentbank Goldman Sachs hat das Kursziel für Oracle nach Zahlen für das dritte Geschäftsquartal von 47 auf 49 US-Dollar angehoben und die Aktie auf der “Conviction Buy List” belassen. Die Geduld bei dem Softwarekonzern zahle sich aus, kommentierte Analystin Heather Bellini in einer Studie vom Donnerstag die Resultate. Ihre Zuversicht basiere auf den Cloud-Angeboten, deren Umsätze im kommenden Geschäftsjahr höher ausfallen sollten als jene der Lizenzen. Erstmals seit 2013 rechnet sie dann auch mit einer steigenden Profitabilität. NordLB senkt Deutsche Bank auf ‘Verkaufen’ und Ziel auf 16 Euro HANNOVER – Die NordLB hat die Aktie der Deutschen Bank mit Blick auf die anstehende Kapitalerhöhung sowie die neuen Unternehmensziele von “Halten” auf “Verkaufen” abgestuft und das Kursziel von 17,50 auf 16,00 Euro gesenkt. Während die Aufarbeitung der rechtlichen Altlasten großteils abgeschlossen sein sollte, werde sich der erneute Umbau des Geldhauses noch länger hinziehen, schrieb Analyst Michael Seufert in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Damit dürften vor allem die amerikanischen Wettbewerber ihren Vorsprung ausbauen. Seufert rät, die jüngste Kurserholung zum Ausstieg zu nutzen. JPMorgan erhöht Ziel für Volkswagen-Vorzüge – ‘Overweight’ NEW YORK – Die US-Bank JPMorgan hat das Kursziel für die Volkswagen-Vorzugsaktien von 193 auf 197 Euro angehoben und die Einstufung auf “Overweight” belassen. Im Bestreben, die Kernmarke VW rentabler zu machen, nehme der Autokonzern nun so viele Probleme in Angriff wie seit zehn Jahren nicht mehr, schrieb Analyst Jose Asumendi in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Dies müsse zwangsläufig zu einer höheren Bewertung der Marke führen. S&P Global hebt Ziel für Eon auf 8 Euro – ‘Strong Buy’ LONDON – Das Analysehaus S&P Global hat das Kursziel für Eon nach Zahlen für 2016 von 7,50 auf 8,00 Euro angehoben und die Einstufung auf “Strong Buy” belassen. Gewinnseitig habe der Versorger besser abgeschnitten als am Markt erwartet, schrieb Analyst Jia Man Neoh in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Der für 2017 angepeilte Nettogewinn falle ebenfalls deutlich höher aus als gedacht. Eine mögliche Kapitalerhöhung laste zwar auf dem Aktienkurs, doch sei dies eine gute Gelegenheit, um Positionen aufzustocken. Denn die fundamentalen Aussichten seien weiter positiv. Die Aktie sei zudem günstig bewertet und es gebe noch Spielraum für Dividendenwachstum. Citigroup hebt GoPro auf ‘Neutral’ und Ziel auf 9 US-Dollar LONDON – Die US-Bank Citigroup hat GoPro von “Sell” auf “Neutral” hochgestuft und das Kursziel von 8 auf 9 US-Dollar angehoben. Bei der kürzlichen Beobachtungungsaufnahme der Aktie hätten sie sich auf die hohen operativen Aufwendungen des Actionkamera-Herstellers fokussiert, die im Gegensatz zu den vorherigen Renditezielen gestanden hätten, schrieben die Analysten in einer am Donnerstag veröffentlichten Studie. Doch nun peile das Management für 2017 ein stärkeres operatives Ergebniswachstum (Ebitda) an als von ihnen erwartet. Damit sinke das Risiko einer höheren Schuldenaufnahme. Zudem verwiesen die Experten auf die angekündigten, weiteren Investitionskürzungen. Oddo Seydler hebt Ziel für Bet-at-home auf 108 Euro – ‘Neutral’ FRANKFURT – Die Investmentbank Oddo Seydler hat das Kursziel für Bet-at-home nach einer Investorenveranstaltung von 100 auf 108 Euro angehoben und die Einstufung auf “Neutral” belassen. Die Dividendenrendite des Glücksspielanbieters von mehr als 5 Prozent sollte in den kommenden Jahren anhalten, schrieb Analyst Marcus Silbe in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Das neue Kursziel reflektiere den gestiegenen Bewertungsaufschlag der Aktie zu den Wettbewerber-Papieren. Oddo Seydler hebt Ziel für Hugo Boss auf 70 Euro – ‘Neutral’ FRANKFURT – Die Investmentbank Oddo Seydler hat das Kursziel für Hugo Boss nach endgültigen Jahreszahlen von 54 auf 70 Euro angehoben und damit an den jüngsten Kursanstieg angepasst. Die Einstufung wurde jedoch auf “Neutral” belassen. Die finalen Resultate des Modekonzerns für 2016 und der Ausblick auf 2017 hätten den Erwartungen entsprochen, schrieb Analyst Martin Decot in einer Studie vom Donnerstag. Nach der Kursrally in Reaktion auf Spekulationen um einen Einstieg von GBL habe die Boss-Aktie nun nicht mehr viel Aufwärtspotenzial.

The women also are 30% less likely to be rehired than the men within a year following the incident, even though the women are less likely than the men to commit another offense, according to the study's findings. The infractions cover a wide range, including misrepresenting or omitting key facts and committing fraud. But even controlling for factors like the severity of the offense — as well as qualifications and experience level — women fared worse than men. The study identified Wells Fargo Advisors as the biggest offender, saying its female advisers were 25% more likely to experience a "job separation" after misconduct than their male counterparts. That figure is about 20% for Morgan Stanley's female advisers and close to 15% for those from Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities. The report is titled "When Harry Fired Sally." You can access it here. Omission admission: A senior official at the Bank of England, Charlotte Hogg, has resigned following a "serious error of judgment" in which she failed to disclose a conflict of interest — that her brother held a senior position at Barclays during her time at the central bank. Her departure will leave the BOE with a significant shortage of women at the top. It now has no female deputy governors (as chief operating officer and deputy governor for markets and banking, Hogg briefly occupied two of five positions at the deputy governor level). And after the departure of Kristen Forbes from the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee this coming June, there will be just one woman across its three main policymaking committees. Bigger than Uber?: People talk a lot about an "Uber moment" of disruption, but those have been few in the banking industry, according to Marie Floyd, senior vice president of digital customer experiences for Wells Fargo. She contends banks can do bigger and better things than Uber anyway. "I've seen so many moments like that in my lifetime," she said. "When I was going to college in 1983, it was a big deal to get an ATM card. … Online banking was another, where once I started doing that I thought I would never go back to the old way. … I'm sorry, but Uber feels kind of small, compared to the profound change in how money is handled, how we can send it internationally, instantly. I think that's a bigger deal." Sold: CIT has agreed to sell off its 30% ownership stake in a commercial aircraft leasing business called TC-CIT Aviation. Chairman and Chief Executive Ellen Alemany said that the decision is "another point of progress" in CIT's plan to become more of a traditional bank. Tokyo Century Corp., CIT's joint venture partner in the business, will acquire the stake for an undisclosed amount and become the sole owner. Secrets to success: Citizens Bank of Edmond President and CEO Jill Castilla shared her story about saving a struggling bank in 2009 and offered three big lessons she learned along the way: comebacks do happen; engage with the community and be authentic in doing so; and be a good neighbor. For example, Citizens sponsors a popular monthly street festival in its small Oklahoma hometown, where it keeps bank branding to a minimum and commits to giving the spotlight to local vendors. Castilla, a repeat honoree in our rankings of the Most Powerful Women in Banking, gave her talk at the Women in Banking conference hosted by the Pennsylvania Bankers Association. Jill Castilla, president and chief executive of Citizens Bank of Edmond in Oklahoma. Influencer: In other news from the Pennsylvania conference, Patricia Husic, president and CEO of Centric Bank in Harrisburg, Pa., will be the namesake for a new "Woman of Influence" award in the state. Husic is a past chair of the state association, founded the women's conference several years ago, and received the inaugural award at the conference this month. It will be renamed the "Patricia A. Husic Woman of Influence Award" beginning in 2018. Husic is also a repeat honoree in our Most Powerful rankings. Role call Morgan Stanley has named Lisa Shalett head of wealth management investment resources. Shalett is currently head of investment and portfolio strategies for the wealth management business. Beyond banking Identity problem: When a pair of male and female colleagues at an employment service firm switched email signatures for a week, they showed how much gender bias can hamper women's careers. When Martin Schneider began signing all his client emails as Nicole Hallberg, Schneider found clients wouldn't listen to him, even when he was giving the same advice he usually did. People also underestimated, interrupted and disrespected him. One client asked him on a date. Meanwhile, Nicole, whose interactions had been noticeably slower, experienced a dramatic improvement. "Nicole had the most productive week of her career," Schneider tweeted. "I realized the reason she took longer is she had to convince clients to respect her. By the time she could get clients to accept that she knew what she was doing, I could get halfway through another client. I wasn't any better at the job than she was, I just had this invisible advantage." Juxtapose these headlines: We couldn't help but notice two stories about new CEOs recently and the gender pay disparity in each. First, Yahoo replaced its female CEO, Marissa Mayer, with a man. Thomas McInerney will be paid much more than his predecessor (double her salary and twice as much in annual stock awards). He was previously chief financial officer for the media and Internet company IAC. And second, the pharmaceutical giant Glaxo named its very first female CEO, who will be paid 25% less than the man she is replacing. Glaxo cited Emma Walmsley's lack of experience in the top job as the reason for the pay difference. But even so, it's worth noting that Walmsley's targeted bonus is capped at 100% of her salary, whereas Andrew Witty was given the opportunity to collect 125% of his pay as a bonus. Walmsley, who is currently CEO of the company's consumer health care division, is breaking a gender barrier not just at her own company, but for the industry. She is the first female to manage one of the world's top 25 pharmaceutical companies. Masculine feminine: More women are taking "men's jobs," rising to the C-suite and entering fields like medicine, law and business, but men aren't moving into "women's jobs" in the same way — unless they're disadvantaged (i.e., black, Hispanic, less educated, poor and immigrant men). As jobs in middle-skill fields like clerical and manufacturing began to disappear in recent years, men have moved into low-skill, low-paying jobs, while women moved into more high-skill work, according to Rutgers University researchers. The researchers tracked 15 years of census data across 448 occupations, classifying them as male- or female-dominated if they employed more than 60% of one gender in 2000. Work to live, not live to work: Arianna Huffington wants to change the way people work because, she says, burning out isn't a measure of success. "The workplace and all the habits that we embody were introduced by men," she said, citing Eli Whitney, Ransom Olds and Henry Ford as examples. "It's time for women to say [those habits] are not working. I actually believe that women are going to take the lead in changing the way we work and live." Bonnie McGeer contributed to this report.

Did you even double click to understand the reason for differences. Do you all think all men across industries are paid more compared to women? Don't you think some industries have prejudice against men? Are all men alike. I respect your views (if genuinely, this is happening, I am all against any bias based on gender/orientation/color/nationality). Ironically, the articles' tone is very disappointing and biased.

Photographer: Josh Anderson for Bloomberg Businessweek James Michael Logsdon, a Louisville auto mechanic, hadn’t been in a classroom in 40 years when his company went out of business in 2015, but he was keen to learn something new. He enrolled in a free program for blue-collar workers at KentuckianaWorks, a regional job-services group that offers education and training courses and connects students with prospective employers. In five weeks, he got certified production technician (CPT) training and was hired weeks later at Atlas Copco AB, the Swedish tool-and-equipment maker. “I had a long interview, but it wasn’t until I talked about the courses I’d taken and showed my grades that they wanted me,” says Logsdon, 59, who now repairs tools used by automakers and equipment manufacturers. Donald Trump promises to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. from overseas, but many blue-collar workers are hurt more by a lack of skills than by globalization. Unskilled assembly-line work has been replaced by so-called advanced manufacturing jobs that require some computer, information technology, or other technical knowledge. In Detroit, Louisville, Grand Rapids, Mich., and other manufacturing hubs, many employers can’t find workers with those skills. KentuckianaWorks deputy director Cindy Read during a recent class. Photographer: Josh Anderson for Bloomberg Businessweek “Manufacturing jobs are here and growing in numbers, but you can’t just show up at a plant after high school and get hired any longer. You need some specialized training and certifications,” says Chauncy Lennon, head of Workforce Initiatives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which helps fund KentuckianaWorks as part of a $250 million commitment to support training for manufacturing, health-care, and other middle-income jobs. KentuckianaWorks’ other funders include the Louisville Redevelopment Authority, the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, and several foundations. Over the next decade, 3.4 million manufacturing jobs are expected to become available as baby boomers retire and economic growth spurs work opportunities, according to a 2015 study by the Manufacturing Institute, a Washington-based think tank, and Deloitte LLC. But a skills gap could result in 2 million of those jobs staying unfilled. Workers are most lacking in computing and technical skills, as well as basic math and problem-solving, the study found. More than 80 percent of 450 U.S. executives surveyed said the gap will affect their ability to meet customer demand, and 78 percent said it will make it more difficult for them to use new technologies and increase productivity. “If you’re wrapping 300 Hershey chocolate kisses a minute, you need to know how to use a robot, and if you’re making tiny instruments for medical equipment, you need to understand mechatronics,” says Fred Dedrick, president and chief executive officer of the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, a nonprofit that works with 32 job-training programs across the country. “Some big companies have closed and left devastation, but it’s inaccurate to say there aren’t opportunities in manufacturing,” he says. To ensure that its curriculum meets employers’ needs, KentuckianaWorks, which has an annual budget of about $700,000, enlisted local manufacturers, including Cardinal Aluminum, Ford Motor, and Kellogg, to help design two training programs: the five-week CPT course and a basic two-week version. Both programs are intensive and have trained people age 18-60. Only 56 percent of those who start one stick with it to the end, but those who do usually find jobs quickly. Since 2014, when the training was launched, 973 graduates have been hired at partner companies at an average salary of about $13 an hour. Cindy Read, deputy director of KentuckianaWorks, says most are entry-level production jobs, “but if you’ve had the discipline to train and get credentials, and then you stick it out on a job and are willing to learn, you can move up quickly.” That’s the case at KCC Cos., a metal fabricator with 350 employees that makes commercial roof products and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning units. The company has hired 10 KentuckianaWorks graduates in the past year. “The basic training they get sets them apart from other entry-level candidates, and once they’re hired we can expand their knowledge,” says Michael Kopp, a KCC recruiter. He attends at least one session of every course to meet trainees and talk about the company. Kopp also keeps in touch with instructors. “Not everyone we’ve hired has worked out,” he says, “but our retention success rate with these trainees is higher than with other hires.” The most important business stories of the day.

Sign Up Logsdon, the former auto mechanic who works at Atlas Copco, says he was “as green as you can be” when he started the training, after losing his job with a small family-run repair shop. He’d never worked on a computer and had to learn Windows and Excel quickly, because the curriculum was online. Classes ran from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and there were tests every Friday. “I got more than the CPT certificate. I got confidence, mentoring, and help writing a résumé,” he says. Initially, Atlas Copco, which found Logsdon’s résumé online, offered him a temporary job repairing tools for $17.50 an hour, 30 percent less than what he’d earned as a mechanic. Still, he jumped at the chance to work for a growing company where workers are encouraged to make decisions and, he says, “solve our own problems.” In November, Logsdon was offered a permanent job with benefits. He plans to keep working as long as he can. “I put in 10-hour days here, starting at 5 a.m.,” he says, “and I’ve never been happier in a job.” The bottom line: Over the next decade, as 3.4 million manufacturing jobs become available, a skills gap could result in 2 million staying unfilled.

That’s according to a new working paper that finds female employees who engage in misconduct at Wells Fargo Advisors are 27% more likely than their male counterparts to have lost their jobs. Wells Fargo Advisors had the highest rate of female workers leaving among the 44 firms studied between 2005 and 2015. It was followed closely by A.G. Edwards, which is also a division of Wells Fargo. The researchers connected the dots and concluded the employees were often leaving because they were fired. “The financial industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance, while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry,” wrote professors Mark Egan of the University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos from the University of Chicago and Stanford’s Amit Seru. The research was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a prestigious nonprofit group known for declaring when recessions begin and end. The findings are likely to add to concern about the cultural problems at Wells Fargo exposed by the bank’s fake account scandal. Former Wells Fargo employees have told CNNMoney they were retaliated against after calling the bank’s ethics hotline about the illegal sales activity. Wells Fargo Advisors said in a statement it’s examining the study’s “assumptions and conclusions carefully” and said there are “substantial questions” about the data and analysis behind it. “As always, our focus is on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment,” Wells Fargo said. SunTrust Investment Services and Allstate Financial Services also ranked high, with female workers there over 20% more likely to lose their jobs than men with misconduct. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities were also in the top 10. After examining data on roughly 1.2 million registered financial advisers in the U.S., the study found that females industrywide face “harsher punishment” than men. They are 20% more likely to be fired after missteps and 30% less likely to find new jobs. That’s despite the fact that researchers found that men are three times more likely to engage in misconduct and twice as likely to be repeat offenders. Men also engage in conduct that is 20% costlier, the paper found. “Our results suggest that firms, and the industry as a whole, exhibit substantial discrimination against women when doling out punishments following misconduct,” the paper said. The financial advisory industry has a history of misbehavior. Roughly one in 13 licensed employees in the industry has a record of misconduct, but that drops to 1 in 33 for females, researchers said. Julie Nugent, vice president and center leader at workplace inclusion nonprofit Catalyst, blamed the findings on gender stereotypes. “Women can be judged more harshly. I call it the Goldilocks Syndrome. Women are perceived as too soft or too tough, but never just right,” Nugent told CNNMoney. It’s worth noting that a Wall Street lobbying group has accused the authors of using methodology that “significantly overstates” misconduct by including all licensed securities personnel. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA, notes that “less than half” of these employees are actually client-facing financial advisers. However, SIFMA acknowledges that the other half do still hold critical roles such as traders, investment bankers or compliance and legal employees. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it’s “committed to treating all employees fairly and equally” and has “extensive programs in place to build a diverse, inclusive network of financial advisers.” Representatives from SunTrust, Allstate and Bank of America did not respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. The paper, titled “When Harry Fired Sally,” acknowledges that the gap between terminating men and women could simply be evidence of “statistical discrimination.” After all, firms could be deciding to punish women more severely because they engage in more expensive bad behavior or are less costly to replace. Yet the academics found “empirical evidence suggests the exact opposite.” They compared male and female advisers at the same firm, in the same location and at the same point in time. The research shows “large and pervasive differences in the treatment of male and female advisers.” For instance, female advisers experience a “disproportionate share” of misconduct complaints that are filed by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, companies with a greater percentage of male executives tend to punish women more severely and hire fewer females who have a history of misbehaving. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story said women at Wells Fargo were over 25% more likely to lose their job than males.

Wells Fargo will stop setting the sales goals that employees say led to pressure to open millions of fake customer accounts. The embattled bank says the change, announced early Tuesday, will be effective Jan. 1. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Female financial advisers get punished more severely than men, especially at Wells Fargo. That's according to a new working paper that finds female employees who engage in misconduct at Wells Fargo Advisors are 27% more likely than their male counterparts to have lost their jobs. Wells Fargo Advisors had the highest rate of female workers leaving among the 44 firms studied between 2005 and 2015. It was followed closely by A.G. Edwards, which is also a division of Wells Fargo. The researchers connected the dots and concluded the employees were often leaving because they were fired. "The financial industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance, while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry," wrote professors Mark Egan of the University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos from the University of Chicago and Stanford's Amit Seru. The research was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a prestigious nonprofit group known for declaring when recessions begin and end. The findings are likely to add to concern about the cultural problems at Wells Fargo exposed by the bank's fake account scandal. Former Wells Fargo employees have told CNNMoney they were retaliated against after calling the bank's ethics hotline about the illegal sales activity. Wells Fargo Advisors said in a statement it's examining the study's "assumptions and conclusions carefully" and said there are "substantial questions" about the data and analysis behind it. "As always, our focus is on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment," Wells Fargo said. SunTrust Investment Services and Allstate Financial Services also ranked high, with female workers there over 20% more likely to lose their jobs than men with misconduct. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities were also in the top 10. After examining data on roughly 1.2 million registered financial advisers in the U.S., the study found that females industrywide face "harsher punishment" than men. They are 20% more likely to be fired after missteps and 30% less likely to find new jobs. That's despite the fact that researchers found that men are three times more likely to engage in misconduct and twice as likely to be repeat offenders. Men also engage in conduct that is 20% costlier, the paper found. "Our results suggest that firms, and the industry as a whole, exhibit substantial discrimination against women when doling out punishments following misconduct," the paper said. The financial advisory industry has a history of misbehavior. Roughly one in 13 licensed employees in the industry has a record of misconduct, but that drops to 1 in 33 for females, researchers said. Julie Nugent, vice president and center leader at workplace inclusion nonprofit Catalyst, blamed the findings on gender stereotypes. "Women can be judged more harshly. I call it the Goldilocks Syndrome. Women are perceived as too soft or too tough, but never just right," Nugent told CNNMoney. It's worth noting that a Wall Street lobbying group has accused the authors of using methodology that "significantly overstates" misconduct by including all licensed securities personnel. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA, notes that "less than half" of these employees are actually client-facing financial advisers. However, SIFMA acknowledges that the other half do still hold critical roles such as traders, investment bankers or compliance and legal employees. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it's "committed to treating all employees fairly and equally" and has "extensive programs in place to build a diverse, inclusive network of financial advisers." Representatives from SunTrust, Allstate and Bank of America did not respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. The paper, titled "When Harry Fired Sally," acknowledges that the gap between terminating men and women could simply be evidence of "statistical discrimination." After all, firms could be deciding to punish women more severely because they engage in more expensive bad behavior or are less costly to replace. Yet the academics found "empirical evidence suggests the exact opposite." They compared male and female advisers at the same firm, in the same location and at the same point in time. The research shows "large and pervasive differences in the treatment of male and female advisers." For instance, female advisers experience a "disproportionate share" of misconduct complaints that are filed by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, companies with a greater percentage of male executives tend to punish women more severely and hire fewer females who have a history of misbehaving. Editor's note: A previous version of this story said women at Wells Fargo were over 25% more likely to lose their job than males. One of the authors pointed out the specific percentage is 27% and the story has been updated to reflect that. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 16, 2017 1:19pm   Comments Share: With the benefit of a database that includes 15 years of stock market data as well as daily chart updates, the machine-learning algorithm behind I Know First had some bullish calls for the financial and tech sectors on Wednesday's episode of Benzinga's PreMarket Prep morning Show. Yaron Golgher, the CEO of I Know First, which is up for a Benzinga Global Fintech Award highlighted some of the logic employed by the platform and provided several stocks and sectors the platform's artificial intelligence has on its radar. More Upside For Financials I Know First's algorithm is bullish on the financial sector, especially after Wednesday's rate hike. Golger noted JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) has increased more than 35 percent since November and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) is up more than 50 percent in that same span. According to I Know First's forecast, those gains are likely to continue for the big lenders. He also said the algorithm has a bullish focus on Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS). Tech For The Near Term The tech sector was another highlight from I Know First's algorithm, although Golgher included the caveat that the bullish forecast was not quite as long as those for the bank stocks. Nevertheless, Golgher did point to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Salesforce.com inc (NYSE: CRM) as potential long calls from I Know First. A Learning Machine I Know First uses advanced computer learning and artificial neural networks to recognize quantitative market patterns from a backlog of market data while also constantly assessing new information from daily chart updates. This process of recognition and reassessment, Golgher said, allows the algorithm to predict and highlight the likelihood and range of price movement for more than 3,000 assets including stocks, indices, ETFs, and currencies.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Female financial advisers get punished more severely than men, especially at Wells Fargo. That’s according to a new working paper that finds female employees who engage in misconduct at Wells Fargo Advisors are over 25% more likely than their male counterparts to have lost their jobs. Wells Fargo Advisors had the highest rate of female workers leaving among the 44 firms studied between 2005 and 2015. It was followed closely by A.G. Edwards, which is also a division of Wells Fargo. The researchers connected the dots and concluded the employees were often leaving because they were fired. “The financial industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance, while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry,” wrote professors Mark Egan of the University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos from the University of Chicago and Stanford’s Amit Seru. The research was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a prestigious nonprofit group known for declaring when recessions begin and end. The findings are likely to add to concern about the cultural problems at Wells Fargo exposed by the bank’s fake account scandal. Former Wells Fargo employees have told CNNMoney they were retaliated against after calling the bank’s ethics hotline about the illegal sales activity. Wells Fargo Advisors said in a statement it’s examining the study’s “assumptions and conclusions carefully” and said there are “substantial questions” about the data and analysis behind it. “As always, our focus is on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment,” Wells Fargo said. SunTrust Investment Services and Allstate Financial Services also ranked high, with female workers there over 20% more likely to lose their jobs than men with misconduct. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities were also in the top 10. After examining data on roughly 1.2 million registered financial advisers in the U.S., the study found that females industrywide face “harsher punishment” than men. They are 20% more likely to be fired after missteps and 30% less likely to find new jobs. That’s despite the fact that researchers found that men are three times more likely to engage in misconduct and twice as likely to be repeat offenders. Men also engage in conduct that is 20% costlier, the paper found. “Our results suggest that firms, and the industry as a whole, exhibit substantial discrimination against women when doling out punishments following misconduct,” the paper said. The financial advisory industry has a history of misbehavior. Roughly one in 13 licensed employees in the industry has a record of misconduct, but that drops to 1 in 33 for females, researchers said. Julie Nugent, vice president and center leader at workplace inclusion nonprofit Catalyst, blamed the findings on gender stereotypes. “Women can be judged more harshly. I call it the Goldilocks Syndrome. Women are perceived as too soft or too tough, but never just right,” Nugent told CNNMoney. It’s worth noting that a Wall Street lobbying group has accused the authors of using methodology that “significantly overstates” misconduct by including all licensed securities personnel. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA, notes that “less than half” of these employees are actually client-facing financial advisers. However, SIFMA acknowledges that the other half do still hold critical roles such as traders, investment bankers or compliance and legal employees. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it’s “committed to treating all employees fairly and equally” and has “extensive programs in place to build a diverse, inclusive network of financial advisers.” Representatives from SunTrust, Allstate and Bank of America did not respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. The paper, titled “When Harry Fired Sally,” acknowledges that the gap between terminating men and women could simply be evidence of “statistical discrimination.” After all, firms could be deciding to punish women more severely because they engage in more expensive bad behavior or are less costly to replace. Yet the academics found “empirical evidence suggests the exact opposite.” They compared male and female advisers at the same firm, in the same location and at the same point in time. The research shows “large and pervasive differences in the treatment of male and female advisers.” For instance, female advisers experience a “disproportionate share” of misconduct complaints that are filed by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, companies with a greater percentage of male executives tend to punish women more severely and hire fewer females who have a history of misbehaving.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. homebuilding jumped in February as unseasonably warm weather boosted the construction of single-family houses to near a 9-1/2-year high, suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite an apparent slowdown in the first quarter. The economy's fundamentals were further strengthened by other data on Thursday showing a drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week amid a tightening labor market. Though factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled this month, manufacturers reported growth in new orders and difficulties finding qualified workers. The data came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters that the U.S. central bank was sending a message that "we have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks." "The reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the economy," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Housing starts increased 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.29 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. Homebuilding was up 6.2 percent compared to February 2016, suggesting housing would contribute to growth this year. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.5 percent to a 872,000-unit pace, the highest level since October 2007. Single-family starts in the Midwest soared 20 percent to their highest level since October 2007. Groundbreaking activity jumped more than 16 percent in the West and Northeast, but fell 2.6 percent in the South. "Single-family homebuilding usually goes dormant throughout much of these regions during the winter months, but has held up better this year due to, up until recently, much milder winter weather," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 3.7 percent to a 416,000-unit pace. A robust labor market is supporting the housing market, helping it to buck weakness in other parts of the economy. Further gains in single-family construction are likely as building permits increased 3.1 percent last month. A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence jumped in March to its highest level since June 2005. The surge in confidence is, however, unlikely to translate into a homebuilding boom as builders continued to complain about rising material prices, higher mortgage rates, and shortages of lots and labor. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Fed's decision on Wednesday to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent. The U.S. central bank also forecast two more rate hikes this year. The dollar dropped to a one-month low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell as did stocks on Wall Street. LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended March 11. It was the 106th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with job growth averaging 209,000 per month over the past three months, and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. A third report from the Philadelphia Fed showed its manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 32.8 this month from 43.3 in February. However, the survey's new orders gauge hit its highest level since December 1987. A measure of prices paid by factories for inputs raced to its highest level since May 2011. Factories also reported increasing prices for their goods, supporting the view that inflation pressures were building. More than 60 percent of the firms in the mid-Atlantic said they were experiencing labor shortages and 68 percent reported skills mismatch between job openings and available labor. These percentages were higher compared to the last time companies were asked the same questions in May 2014. Labor market strength and improvement in manufacturing are in stark contrast with a recent softening in consumer, construction and business spending. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Wells Fargo will stop setting the sales goals that employees say led to pressure to open millions of fake customer accounts. The embattled bank says the change, announced early Tuesday, will be effective Jan. 1. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Female financial advisers get punished more severely than men, especially at Wells Fargo. That's according to a new working paper that finds female employees who engage in misconduct at Wells Fargo Advisors are 27% more likely than their male counterparts to have lost their jobs. Wells Fargo Advisors had the highest rate of female workers leaving among the 44 firms studied between 2005 and 2015. It was followed closely by A.G. Edwards, which is also a division of Wells Fargo. The researchers connected the dots and concluded the employees were often leaving because they were fired. "The financial industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance, while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry," wrote professors Mark Egan of the University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos from the University of Chicago and Stanford's Amit Seru. The research was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a prestigious nonprofit group known for declaring when recessions begin and end. The findings are likely to add to concern about the cultural problems at Wells Fargo exposed by the bank's fake account scandal. Former Wells Fargo employees have told CNNMoney they were retaliated against after calling the bank's ethics hotline about the illegal sales activity. Wells Fargo Advisors said in a statement it's examining the study's "assumptions and conclusions carefully" and said there are "substantial questions" about the data and analysis behind it. "As always, our focus is on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment," Wells Fargo said. SunTrust Investment Services and Allstate Financial Services also ranked high, with female workers there over 20% more likely to lose their jobs than men with misconduct. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Investment Services and JPMorgan Securities were also in the top 10. After examining data on roughly 1.2 million registered financial advisers in the U.S., the study found that females industrywide face "harsher punishment" than men. They are 20% more likely to be fired after missteps and 30% less likely to find new jobs. That's despite the fact that researchers found that men are three times more likely to engage in misconduct and twice as likely to be repeat offenders. Men also engage in conduct that is 20% costlier, the paper found. "Our results suggest that firms, and the industry as a whole, exhibit substantial discrimination against women when doling out punishments following misconduct," the paper said. The financial advisory industry has a history of misbehavior. Roughly one in 13 licensed employees in the industry has a record of misconduct, but that drops to 1 in 33 for females, researchers said. Julie Nugent, vice president and center leader at workplace inclusion nonprofit Catalyst, blamed the findings on gender stereotypes. "Women can be judged more harshly. I call it the Goldilocks Syndrome. Women are perceived as too soft or too tough, but never just right," Nugent told CNNMoney. It's worth noting that a Wall Street lobbying group has accused the authors of using methodology that "significantly overstates" misconduct by including all licensed securities personnel. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as SIFMA, notes that "less than half" of these employees are actually client-facing financial advisers. However, SIFMA acknowledges that the other half do still hold critical roles such as traders, investment bankers or compliance and legal employees. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it's "committed to treating all employees fairly and equally" and has "extensive programs in place to build a diverse, inclusive network of financial advisers." Representatives from SunTrust, Allstate and Bank of America did not respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. The paper, titled "When Harry Fired Sally," acknowledges that the gap between terminating men and women could simply be evidence of "statistical discrimination." After all, firms could be deciding to punish women more severely because they engage in more expensive bad behavior or are less costly to replace. Yet the academics found "empirical evidence suggests the exact opposite." They compared male and female advisers at the same firm, in the same location and at the same point in time. The research shows "large and pervasive differences in the treatment of male and female advisers." For instance, female advisers experience a "disproportionate share" of misconduct complaints that are filed by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, companies with a greater percentage of male executives tend to punish women more severely and hire fewer females who have a history of misbehaving. Editor's note: A previous version of this story said women at Wells Fargo were over 25% more likely to lose their job than males. One of the authors pointed out the specific percentage is 27% and the story has been updated to reflect that. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

A third lawsuit had just been filed against J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, all three arguing the company improperly favored its own investment options within the retirement plan offered to workers and otherwise failed to control costs and conflicts of interest. The firm, far from being the only provider finding itself in this boat, flatly denies the underlying allegations. According to Michael Barry, a PLANSPONSOR magazine columnist and president of the Plan Advisory Services Group, as new cases emerge it is important to remember that, as he puts it, “Where the 401(k) plan fee litigation has been successful is not under ERISA Section 406 but under ERISA Section 404, known as ERISA’s prudence standard.”  Many of the legal challenges emerging may appear similar on their face, but the underlying allegations can vary significantly in terms of how they actually apply and test the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's (ERISA) various standards. “My understanding is that the lawyers are fighting out in the courts—right now—what exactly is prudence when it comes to fees,” he notes.  The distinction between litigating fees and litigating prudence may seem subtle, Barry says, but it is important. The “reasonable compensation” standards so often discussed in the media coverage of new cases are established by ERISA section 406, known as ERISA's prohibited transaction standards. Questions about how these standards should be applied in practice are murkier.  “There is language in John Deere [at this point, eight years old and questioned on a number of points] that some courts and all defendants’ lawyers cite,” Barry explains. “The suggestion is that ‘nothing in ERISA requires every fiduciary to scour the market to find and offer the cheapest possible fund.’” He observes that the demand for such a truly exhaustive search in itself may lead to higher plan operating costs. “But there are also cases like ABB and Tibble, where courts seem to be saying, ‘Where there is a cheaper service provider/fund that does the same thing [and is easily obtainable], prudence requires that you buy that service provider/fund, or at least consider it.'” Barry believes that “plaintiffs' lawyers are trying to push this principle as far as they can.” “And when you think about it, what justification is there for paying, say, 35 bps for an S&P Index fund when you can get one off the rack from several providers for fees that are in the single digits?” he asks. “How could that possibly be prudent, even if it is ‘reasonable?’ And where do you draw the line—if your Vanguard S&P 500 fund charges 4 bps and Vanguard has an identical fund that you could use that only charges 2 bps, is that imprudent?” This has been claimed, in fact, for example in Oracle. “There are obviously lots of nuances that the courts haven’t even gotten to,” Barry adds. “For instance, is there securities lending in the 2bps fund and not in the 4bps fund?” Barry offers the conclusion that the industry is still having an “as-yet unresolved argument over whether fiduciaries should have to get a merely good deal or the best available deal, after discounting for search costs. Emphasis on as-yet unresolved.” Tagged: DOL, ERISA, Litigation related articles related research most e-mailed UpFront What the DOL and IRS Want to Know About Your Plan From plansponsor.com Lawsuits May Help Define How ERISA Polices Fees and Prudence Court Victories Add to Confusion Over Fate of Fiduciary Rule Former NLRB Leader Could Fill DOL Secretary Role DOL Secretary Nominee Backs Down Peering Through the Fiduciary Rule Uncertainty Trump Presidency Will Impact Providers' Fiduciary Rule Response UpFront What the DOL and IRS Want to Know About Your Plan From plansponsor.com 2016 PLANSPONSOR DC Survey: Plan Benchmarking 2016 Defined Contribution Survey 2016 Third–Party Administrator Buyer’s Guide 2016 PLANSPONSOR Stock Plan Administration Buyer's Guide 2016 PLANSPONSOR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SURVEY 2016 Recordkeeping Survey UpFront What the DOL and IRS Want to Know About Your Plan From plansponsor.com Prudential Aims to Gauge Retirement Plan ROI Empower Launches Campaign to Engage Millennials in Retirement Savings Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans Generating Less Income Court Moves Forward Insperity Excessive Fee and Self-Dealing Suit 401k Nondiscrimination Tests Explained go to news topic SPONSORED MESSAGES Get PLANSPONSOR Email * * NewsDash (i) PLANSPONSOR’s Newsdash: The industry’s leading daily source for information focused on the critical issues impacting benefits industry professionals.

U.S. homebuilding jumped in February as unseasonably warm weather boosted the construction of single-family houses to near a 9-1/2-year high, suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite an apparent slowdown in the first quarter. The economy's fundamentals were further strengthened by other data on Thursday showing a drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week amid a tightening labor market. Though factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled this month, manufacturers reported growth in new orders and difficulties finding qualified workers. The data came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told reporters that the U.S. central bank was sending a message that "we have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks." "The reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the economy," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Housing starts increased 3.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.29 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. Homebuilding was up 6.2 percent compared to February 2016, suggesting housing would contribute to growth this year. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.5 percent to a 872,000-unit pace, the highest level since October 2007. Single-family starts in the Midwest soared 20 percent to their highest level since October 2007. Groundbreaking activity jumped more than 16 percent in the West and Northeast, but fell 2.6 percent in the South. "Single-family homebuilding usually goes dormant throughout much of these regions during the winter months, but has held up better this year due to, up until recently, much milder winter weather," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 3.7 percent to a 416,000-unit pace. A robust labor market is supporting the housing market, helping it to buck weakness in other parts of the economy. Further gains in single-family construction are likely as building permits increased 3.1 percent last month. A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence jumped in March to its highest level since June 2005. The surge in confidence is, however, unlikely to translate into a homebuilding boom as builders continued to complain about rising material prices, higher mortgage rates, and shortages of lots and labor. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Fed's decision on Wednesday to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.00 percent. The U.S. central bank also forecast two more rate hikes this year. The dollar dropped to a one-month low against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell as did stocks on Wall Street. LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended March 11. It was the 106th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with job growth averaging 209,000 per month over the past three months, and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, close to the nine-year low of 4.6 percent hit last November. A third report from the Philadelphia Fed showed its manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 32.8 this month from 43.3 in February. However, the survey's new orders gauge hit its highest level since December 1987. A measure of prices paid by factories for inputs raced to its highest level since May 2011. Factories also reported increasing prices for their goods, supporting the view that inflation pressures were building. More than 60 percent of the firms in the mid-Atlantic said they were experiencing labor shortages and 68 percent reported skills mismatch between job openings and available labor. These percentages were higher compared to the last time companies were asked the same questions in May 2014. Labor market strength and improvement in manufacturing are in stark contrast with a recent softening in consumer, construction and business spending. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter.

By Sarah Anderson / AlterNet March 16, 2017 Print Comments NEW YORK CITY - JANUARY 01: The landmark Charging Bull in Lower Manhattan represents the strength and power of the American People January 01, 2009 in New York, NY Photo Credit: Tutti Frutti / Shutterstock.com Every year, the New York Comptroller releases a big number representing the combined value of the bonuses Wall Street banks have doled out to their employees. The state government keeps track of these payouts because a really big number boosts their local tax base. And this year’s number, released March 15, is indeed gigantic: $23.9 billion. But imagine if those huge sums were channeled instead into the pockets of low-wage workers. The economy would get a much bigger bang for the buck because the poor tend to spend nearly every dollar they earn, creating beneficial economic ripple effects. The wealthy, by contrast, can afford to squirrel away more of their earnings. And so while the Wall Street bonus season may coincide with an uptick in luxury goods sales, a minimum wage hike would give America’s economy a much greater boost. A new Institute for Policy Studies report includes four dramatic charts that reveal how the increase in Wall Street bonuses has far outpaced the rise in the federal minimum wage — and how this in turn has contributed to race and gender inequality. Wall Street Bonuses v. Minimum Wage Earners Wall Street banks doled out $23.9 billion in bonuses to their 177,000 New York-based employees, which amounts to 1.6 times the combined earnings of all 1,075,000 Americans who work full-time at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The average Wall Street bonus increased by just 1 percent last year. But the nominal value of the average bonus has grown by 890 percent since 1985, from $13,970 to $138,210. Meanwhile, the minimum wage has risen only 116 percent, from $3.35 per hour to $7.25. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage was nearly 3 percent lower in 2016 than in 1985, whereas the average bonus was about 343 percent higher. The Race and Gender Divide Over the past three decades, the dramatic rise in average financial industry bonuses relative to the minimum wage has contributed to racial and gender inequality. Workers at the bottom of the national wage scale are predominantly people of color and female, whereas those in Wall Street’s upper echelons are overwhelmingly white and male. At the top five U.S. investment banks (JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup), the share of executives and top managers who are white ranges from 84 to 87 percent and the share who are male ranges from 66 to 84 percent, according to the firms’ own reports (see sources section). By contrast, only 44 percent of minimum wage workers are white and an even smaller share, just 37 percent, are male. For Wall Street employees, annual bonuses come as an extra reward on top of their base salaries, which averaged $388,000 in 2015, the most recent year for which data are available. According to the New York State Comptroller, this is five times higher than the average salary for other New York City private sector employees. On top of their cash salary and bonuses, top Wall Street executives also typically receive massive stock options and grants, most of which are deemed fully deductible “performance-based” pay and thus fully tax-deductible for the firm. According to a 2016 Institute for Policy Studies report, the top 20 U.S. banks paid out more than $2 billion in fully deductible performance pay to their top five executives between 2012 and 2015. At a 35 percent corporate tax rate, this translates into a tax break of more than $725 million, or $1.7 million per executive per year. Wall Street Bonuses v. Low-Wage Service Workers While living wage campaigns have been successful in many cities, Oxfam and the Economic Policy Institute report that 44 percent of U.S. workers still earn less than $15 per hour. This is the wage level needed to cover basic living costs in most areas of the country, according to the National Employment Law Project. The Wall Street bonus pool was large enough in 2016 to have lifted all of America’s 3.2 million fast food prep and serving workers up to $15 per hour — and still have had $776 million left over. Or that bonus pool could have raised to $15 the hourly wage of all our nation’s 1.7 million home care aides or all of our 3.1 million restaurant servers and bartenders. Wall Street Bonus Reform Long Overdue Huge Wall Street bonus payouts also encourage the sorts of high-risk behaviors that led to the 2008 financial crisis. And yet financial regulators have still not implemented a Wall Street bonus reform law that has been on the books for nearly seven years. Section 956 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation prohibits financial industry pay packages that encourage “inappropriate risks.” Regulators were supposed to implement this new rule within nine months of the law’s passage. In 2011, regulators issued a proposed rule that did not go far enough to prevent the type of behavior that led to the 2008 crash. As spelled out in detail in Institute for Policy Studies comments to the SEC, the proposed rule falls short in several areas, including overly lenient bonus deferrals, weak stock-based pay restrictions, and enforcement proposals that leave too much discretion to bank managers. While regulators responded to criticism by agreeing to issue a new proposal, this work was not completed before the end of the Obama administration. And now with Republican control of both Congress and the White House, there is a strong chance it will be postponed indefinitely. House Republican leadership introduced a bill in the last session to repeal most of the Dodd-Frank reform package, including the Wall Street pay provision. President Donald Trump has also vowed to “do a big number” on the landmark financial reform legislation. In the meantime, the Wall Street bonus culture that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis continues to flourish. Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy project at the Institute for Policy Studies and is the author of the new report Off the Deep End: The Wall Street Bonus Pool and Low-Wage Workers.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

The seller was the estate of Westchester businessman Dominick DeGaetano, the former owner of Deed Real Estate Agency in Bronxville, and co-executor JP Morgan Chase. The sale price amounts to approximately $301 per square foot of commercial space. The all-cash deal was reported by Admiral Real Estate Services Corp. in Bronxville. John Barrett, Admiral’s head of investment sales, brokered the sale for the seller and identified the buyer. On a corner in the Chester Heights retail district, the 9,874-square-foot building houses six ground-floor retail tenants and six second-floor office tenants and includes a 10-unit indoor garage, Barrett said. He said the new owner, who acquired the property at a 6 percent capitalization rate on in-place income, plans to substantially invest in the building, where rents were below market rate due its condition from a lack of maintenance by a third-party asset manager. Barrett said the property, which has a Bronxville address, drew 20 “highly qualified” offers from prospective buyers in only 10 days of marketing. “We continue to see buyers execute quickly without contingencies to lock in transactions as sellers take advantage of the high level of liquidity in the market,” the broker said. The seller was represented by attorney Anne Aicher of Shamberg Marwell Hollis Andreycak & Laidlaw PC in Mount Kisco. The buyer was represented by attorney James Veneruso of Veneruso, Curto, Schwartz & Curto LLP in Yonkers.   Print Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Google+ Email About the author John Golden As managing editor of the Business Journals, John Golden directs news coverage of Westchester and Fairfield counties and the Hudson Valley region.

Bloomberg News reports that total sales from fixed-income, currency and commodity products, or FICC, will climb 34 percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier as credit-trading performance improves, JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients. That will cushion a 3 percent decline in revenue from trading stocks, while income from advising clients on underwriting and mergers and acquisitions will jump 22 percent, the analysts wrote. The rebound in bond trading for the world’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., began last year with the first gains since 2012.  Hit the link below to access the complete Bloomberg News article: Banks' Bond-Trading Income Soars in First Quarter, JPMorgan Says Steve Cohen Is Trying to Teach Computers to Think Like Top Traders And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Bank Of Japan Surprises No One, Leaves Policy & Outlook Unchanged March 16, 2017 9:11am NYSE:EWJ ShareTweet From Tyler Durden: Confirming the expectations of all 41 economists, The Bank of Japan changed absolutely nothing about its monetary policy tonight following The Fed’s 3rd rate hike in 11 years. The BOJ said in a statement that it would keep the two key rates at current levels, maintain the pace of its asset purchases, and did not change its economic outlook. The BOJ maintained its short-term policy rate on some bank reserves at -0.1 percent and… left its target for 10-year government bond yields at around 0 percent. It kept the pace of its asset purchases unchanged at about 80 trillion yen ($700 billion) annually. As Bloomberg reports, with the economy slowly improving and bond yields under control, the BOJ is in position to hold steady for now. But with the Fed rate hike putting upward pressure on yields globally, some economists are looking for signs the BOJ may have to raise its rate targets, particularly if inflation begins to take hold in Japan. “There’s no reason for the BOJ to act now,” Hiroshi Ugai, a former BOJ official and chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said before Thursday’s decision. “The bank will take the U.S. rate hike as good news. What I’m looking for now is any hint of its willingness to raise rates in the future.” For now the reaction is muted and confused (with USDJPY rising – weaker Yen – and stocks up marginally)… “The BOJ can enjoy smooth sailing for now,” said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities. But the policy divergence will make it more challenging for the BOJ to maintain its target for 10-year government bond yields, and some investors are already speculating that it will have little choice but to raise that target as global yields rise and inflation inches up at home. Kuroda’s comments on this and possible tapering of asset purchases will be scrutinized. Eleven of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg said they expected the BOJ to raise its target rate this year, while 25 predicted the BOJ would cut the pace of its debt buying or stop stating its target for annual purchases. Kuroda and Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said last month that it is too early to consider raising rates because inflation remains far from the BOJ’s 2 percent target, underscoring a determination not to repeat the mistake of prematurely tightening seen in 2000 and 2006. Some BOJ officials are considering whether to give the market further guidance on interest rates once inflation begins picking up, according to people familiar with matter. “It’s way too early for the BOJ to consider any move,” said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “They must be hoping this favorable conditions to continue but I don’t think the road to the price target will be all that smooth.” However, it is notable that there are some risks that The BoJ point out that The Fed seems happy to ignore (as Bloomberg’s Colin Simpson notes): The BOJ doesn’t seem to be buying the global reflation story. Perhaps they can see a scenario where the base effect of higher oil prices washes through and the yen starts to creep higher again. Either way, they seem subdued. Timely warning from the BOJ statement following the Fed’s rate hike: “Risks to the outlook include the following: developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary policy on global markets.” The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ) was unchanged in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, EWJ has gained 5.94%, versus a 6.97% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. EWJ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 80 ETFs in the Asia Pacific Equities Ex-China ETFs category.

Close Latest Minutes Politics Culture Magazine Climate Books Photography Podcasts Subscribe About Advertise Contact FAQ Jobs RSS Masthead Privacy Subscriber Services Menu MagazineSubscribe Getty Images Trump and Warren Are on a Collision Course Why is a so-called populist trying to dismantle America's most effective consumer watchdog? By Alexander Zaitchik March 16, 2017 In his second week in office, Donald Trump huddled at the White House with a group of leading Wall Street executives. Their goal: to unravel Dodd-Frank, the law passed in the wake of the global financial crisis to curb some of Wall Street’s most predatory practices. In front of assembled press, Trump pointed to Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, which had been forced by the Justice Department to pay a record $13 billion in 2013 for misleading investors about toxic securities. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,” Trump declared. “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” That afternoon, Trump signed a pair of executive orders that pave the way for rolling back many of Dodd-Frank’s financial reforms. It was not just a gift to “friends of mine,” as the president put it—people, he said, with “nice businesses.” It was also the opening salvo in a full-fledged war to destroy the law’s most high-profile and effective creation: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s no surprise that a Republican president with close ties to Wall Street would target the CFPB. The watchdog has been a lightning rod for Republican outrage ever since Elizabeth Warren first proposed the idea as a professor at Harvard Law School. As soon as the agency was created, Republican lawmakers began trying to curtail its power or eliminate it outright. GOP ads depict the agency as a neo-Stalinist ministry that is the natural enemy of American consumers. “The CFPB supposedly exists to protect you,” House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted after the agency levied a $100 million fine against Wells Fargo for incentivizing widespread fraud against borrowers. “But instead it tries to micromanage your everyday life.” As a self-styled defender of the little guy, Trump should actually be working to strengthen the CFPB, not dismantle it. During his campaign, Trump railed against the global financial elite who had enriched themselves at the expense of ordinary Americans. The working class was devastated by the deep-seated corruption that caused the financial crisis, and Trump’s electoral strongholds are high-density zones of home foreclosures, subprime loans, and payday lenders—exactly the sort of predatory schemes the CFPB was designed to police. “The CFPB is the first federal agency to look out for Americans on these issues,” says Lisa Gilbert, who monitors Congress for the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen. “As the part of Dodd-Frank that people engage with every day, its work has been massive and essential.” Consider the CFPB’s track record. In less than seven years, the agency has successfully prosecuted more than 100 financial institutions—often refusing settlements, taking wrongdoers to court, and placing the worst offenders under ongoing supervision. It launches many investigations by following public complaints posted on its web site, which serves as a model for government transparency. “Unlike other agencies, the CFPB’s complaint system is public and searchable,” says Alexis Goldstein, a senior analyst with Americans for Financial Reform. “It’s become a great resource for anyone getting ripped off.” Thirteen million Americans have used the CFPB’s education and training programs, and the agency routinely helps consumers force lenders to reduce or erase fees and overcharges. All told, the agency has chalked up nearly $12 billion in civil fines and consumer refunds for 29 million Americans defrauded by scams. It has returned another $8 billion to consumers by reducing predatory loans, or canceling them outright. Illustration by Martin Elfman In addition, no agency has done more than the CFPB to defend the rights of military veterans—those whom Trump extolled on the campaign trail as the archetypal “forgotten Americans,” discarded and betrayed by elites loyal to Wall Street over Main Street. According to the Consumer Federation of America, the CFPB has returned $120 million to military families cheated by illegal foreclosures, predatory lending, and crooked loan schemes. It has visited 145 military bases across the country to inform soldiers of their rights, and in January it filed a lawsuit against Navient, the country’s largest servicer of student loans, for intentionally ruining the credit ratings of combat veterans suffering from “total and permanent disability.” In 2014, the agency won a $60 million settlement against Navient for systematically charging illegal interest on the accounts of 78,000 active-duty military personnel—a practice the Justice Department described as “intentional, willful, and taken in disregard for the rights of service members.” It’s plain to see why the Wall Street interests aligned behind Trump would want to shut down or weaken the CFPB. But that may be easier said than done. As an independent agency within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB is off-limits to congressional budget cutting and White House interference. Its director, Richard Cordray, is currently serving a five-year term that runs until July 2018, and can only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” With Trump in the White House, however, Republicans are already gunning for the CFPB. “It’s time to fire King Richard,” Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska declared in January. A few weeks later, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, took to the pages of The Wall Street Journal to call for Cordray’s head. “The CFPB is arguably the most powerful, least accountable agency in U.S. history,” Hensarling wrote. A leaked memo drafted by Hensarling reveals the Republican plan in detail: The CFPB’s rulemaking authority and enforcement powers would be sharply curtailed, and its consumer education initiatives would be eliminated. The director, meanwhile, could be fired “at will” by the president—turning the agency into a lapdog rather than a watchdog. If Republicans move forward with their assault, however, Democrats may finally find themselves in a battle they have a good shot at winning. According to Americans for Financial Reform, 59 percent of Republicans—including a majority of Trump voters—want to see the CFPB expanded, not undermined. If he were true to his word, Trump would listen to the voters who placed him in office, not Jamie Dimon. “The CFPB is popular across the political spectrum because it has consistently delivered for consumers,” Elizabeth Warren tells the New Republic. “If President Trump or congressional Republicans try to gut the agency to please payday lenders, debt collectors, and big banks, Democrats will stand on the side of working families and fight back tooth and nail.” Read More Magazine, Up Front, april 2017, Politics, Elizabeth Warren, CFPB, Populism, Donald Trump, Dodd-Frank, Consumer Protection Sign up for your daily dose of politics, culture, and big ideas.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Thomas Colson, Business Insider UK Mar. 16, 2017, 2:57 AM 733 facebook linkedin twitter email print Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the VVD party waves after voting in the general election in The Hague, Netherlands, March 15, 2017. REUTERS/Michael Kooren Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Thursday. 1. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is set to win the most seats in the Dutch parliament for the third time in a row, dealing a blow to populist leader Geert Wilders. In the early hours of Thursday, with over 95% of the votes counted, Rutte's VVD is projected to win 33 seats, giving him a strong lead over Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) which is set to grab 20. 2. Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal on Wednesday launched an audacious raid to buy as much as 12% of Anglo American, the London-listed miner which is a larger rival to his Vedanta Resources, reports the FT. Working with bankers at JPMorgan, Mr Agarwal’s family trust was attempting to acquire as much as £2bn worth of Anglo shares from investors, which he plans to fund through a convertible bond. 3. The dollar nursed bitter losses in Asia on Thursday while sovereign bonds savored their biggest rally in nine months after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.25% to 1% as expected but signaled no pick up in the pace of tightening. Yields on two-year notes were down at 1.30%, having fallen 8 basis points overnight in the biggest daily rally since June last year. The Dow ended Wednesday with gains of 0.54%, while the S&P 500 added 0.84% and the Nasdaq 0.74%. 4. Gold prices, which were down as much as 0.1% to $1,197.59 a troy ounce earlier on Wednesday, popped 1.3% to $1,214.96 a troy ounce after the Federal Reserve held its rate forecast steady, reports the FT. The so-called dot plot of interest rate projections pointed to just two further rates rises this year, following Wednesday’s rise, in keeping with the December forecast. However, that disappointed some hawks that had expected the chart to signal four rate rises this year and proved bullish for gold, which offers no yield. 5. The Bank of England is set to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday as Britain prepares to trigger Article 50, reports the Press Association. In what will be the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting before Article 50 is triggered later this month, policymakers are expected to leave rates at 0.25% in the face of potential economic upset from Brexit negotiations. 6. The Queen is expected to give Royal Assent to the Brexit bill this morning, paving the way for Theresa May to trigger Article 50, reports Sky News. Officially known as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, it passed the Parliamentary process following votes in the Commons and Lords on Monday. 7. Canary Wharf Group is in discussions to sell the 50% stake that it manages and owns in the Walkie Talkie, one of the City of London’s newer landmarks, for about £600 million, reports the Times. The group has approached agents about pitching for the mandate to sell the share in the building at 20 Fenchurch Street, at a level which would value the whole tower at about £1.2 billion. 8. Tinopolis, the company behind TV shows including Question Time and Crufts and producer of BT’s Premier League and Champion’s League coverage, is up for sale with a price tag of up to £300m, reports the Guardian. The Welsh-based international media company, which also owns sports production business Sunset + Vine, is the UK’s last remaining truly independent TV producer. 9. Unemployment in the UK fell for another month in February, hitting another record low, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Headline unemployment fell from 4.8% at the last reading, to 4.7%, according to the ONS, with 31,000 fewer people unemployed from the previous period. 10. The White House will propose large spending cuts on Thursday for the state department, public broadcasting and environmental programmes as part of its preliminary budget for the 2018 fiscal year, reports the FT. Administration aides call it an “America First” budget — with greater spending on defence, law enforcement and veteran affairs, as well as new education programmes that emphasise school choice. The last are a pet project of Betsy DeVos, Mr Trump’s education secretary.

This is the term that entered the financial lexicon on May 22, 2013, when the US Federal Reserve unexpectedly announced that it planned to wind down, or taper, its four and a half-year-old programme of quantitative easing, immediately triggering a disorderly sell-off in financial markets. Fast forward nearly four years and the Fed-induced turmoil in markets feels like a distant memory. The contrast between international investors’ distinctly positive reaction to the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to step up the pace of monetary tightening - the US central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a further 25 basis points and signalled two further increases later this year - and the panic engendered by the winding down of quantitative easing could not be starker. The bullish sentiment towards developing economies is doubly striking in light of the Fed’s more hawkish stance Between the end of April and early September 2013, the yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury bonds surged nearly 130 basis points to just below 3 per cent, its highest level since mid-2011. The Vix Index, Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” which measures investor expectations of near-term volatility in US equity markets, shot up from 12.5 to 19 points – just below its long-term average - within a month after the Fed signalled its intention to start scaling back its asset purchases. The most conspicuous deterioration in sentiment was in emerging markets (EM). EM mutual bond funds suffered a staggering US$44 billion in outflows between the end of May and the end of November 2013, the highest level of sustained redemptions since EM emerged as a major asset class some 15 or so years ago, according to JPMorgan. Many EM currencies, moreover, suffered steep falls against the dollar, while the equity markets of Turkey and Indonesia – two members of the so-called “fragile five” group of vulnerable EMs which came to symbolise the dangerous over-reliance of many developing economies on large inflows of QE-driven foreign capital – lost 28 per cent and 19 per cent respectively between mid-May and late August 2013. The reaction to the Fed’s current rate-rising cycle, however, is a different story altogether. In the run-up to the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to raise rates – and particularly since the end of February when the odds of a rate increase this week suddenly shot up from 40 per cent to more than 90 per cent – equity markets were positively buoyant despite mounting speculation about a faster pace of monetary tightening. The benchmark S&P 500 Index, which hit a fresh record high on March 1, has climbed 4.7 per cent since early February while the Vix Index, having surged to 22 just before the US presidential election in early November, has remained below 13 points since the end of last year. More tellingly, the 10-year Treasury yield, while having risen 15 basis points since the end of February, is still 50 basis points below its post-taper tantrum peak of nearly 3 per cent in early January 2014. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield even fell 10 basis points to 2.5 per cent as markets took comfort in the Fed’s decision not to tighten policy more aggressively. The bullish sentiment towards developing economies is doubly striking in light of the Fed’s more hawkish stance. The MSCI EM Index, a leading gauge of equities in developing nations, has shot up 9.4 per cent since the beginning of this year – and has even advanced slightly since the end of February when the probability of a March rate increase began to rise sharply. According to JPMorgan, EM equity and bond mutual funds have attracted more than US$13 billion of inflows this year, recouping all of the outflows suffered in the weeks following Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the US election. So why are international investors taking the acceleration in the pace of monetary tightening in their stride? The most important reason is the optimism generated by the flurry of stronger economic data in both developed and developing economies. Reflationary forces in the global economy are gaining momentum amid heightened expectations of pro-growth policies, including hefty tax cuts and deregulation, under the new Trump administration. This is mitigating the adverse effects of less accommodative monetary policy and, as I argued in my column earlier this week, fuelling perceptions that the stimulus baton is switching hands from central banks to governments. Why central banks will retain their decisive grip over markets Other factors are also at play. Sentiment towards China has improved markedly, monetary policy is still ultra-loose in Japan and Europe, and commodity markets have recovered. Still, there are plenty of other potential tantrums on the horizon. Political risks in Europe are escalating while Trump’s ability to win Congressional approval for his economic policies is uncertain. The Fed may prove to be the least of investors’ concerns.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Perceptions are that Trump's policies are working By Michael Barone (@michaelbarone) • 3/16/17 12:01 AM Michael Barone Senior Political Analyst The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Barone-3.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Perceptions matter. People make decisions, even life-altering decisions, based on what they perceive as likely to happen. To the extent that public policy affects such decisions, the perception of likely policy change can affect behavior even before the change happens — even if it ends up never happening. Something like that seems to be happening in America — and around the world — in the two months since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. People are making decisions based on perceptions of how he might change the country's direction. Take the economy. The numbers in the jobs report for February, Trump's first full month in office, showing an increase of 235,000 jobs, are not wildly out of line with some monthly reports in recent years. In contrast to the years of the Obama stimulus program, when the bulk of new jobs came in the public sector, it appears that the increase here is in the private sector. Moody's Analytics says there were 298,000 new private sector jobs in February, far more than the 189,000 it expected. Construction jobs were up 58,000, private educational services jobs up 29,000, manufacturing jobs up 28,000. This suggests that lots of employers, small as well as large, are taking the plunge and creating new jobs. Can I prove that they're doing so because of perceptions that regulations and taxes will be decreased by the Trump administration? No, and I'm not sure any economist's statistical model could either. But that sure looks like what's happening. Big players in the financial markets seem to think so. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen suggested the Fed will raise interest rates twice after doing so this month. That's a significant shift from her longstanding reluctance to increase rates at all for fear of dampening the economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that Trump's program of cutting corporate taxes, building infrastructure and rolling back regulations has unleashed the "animal spirits" — economist John Maynard Keynes' phrase — of businessmen. "Even if he gets part of it done," Dimon, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton contributor, told Bloomberg News, "it'll be good for growth." Does the unusual speed with which Paul Ryan is leading the House to vote on the first of three promised initiatives to repeal and replace Obamacare suggest that he — and Trump — are trying to strengthen the perception that the private sector economy will boom? Given the significant risk of political damage and policy bollix, it certainly looks like the answer is yes. Also from the Washington Examiner Next week: Obamacare repeal, Supreme Court and spying Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for questioning Monday. By Susan Ferrechio • 03/19/17 12:01 AM People at the high end of the income spectrum — a category that obviously includes the bulk of job creators — are not the only ones making decisions in response to perceptions. So, it appears, are illegal immigrants already in the United States and prospective illegals deciding whether to cross the border. Customs and Border Protection reported that apprehensions of illegal crossings of the southern border in February were down 39 percent from January and down 36 from February 2016. They were down also from border crossings in December — traditionally by far the lowest month — in calendar years 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. That's a startling drop. And it's one that seems likely to reverberate far beyond Mexico, since most illegal border crossers in the years since the 2007-09 economic crisis have come from Central America. Under the Obama administration policy, Central American children (or 18+ adults claiming to be children) seeking asylum were mostly allowed to remain in the United States, effectively free of border enforcement. Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration law enforcement have created the perception, probably accurately, that that things are different now. That message has apparently traveled to people hundreds or even thousands of miles south of the Rio Grande and changed their decision-making process. Also from the Washington Examiner Ethics Committee finally opens for business Wednesday The committee is behind because of winter storm Stella and several other reasons. By Nicole Duran • 03/19/17 12:01 AM Of course, perceptions can change. Perceptions of an incoming president's likely policies can shape the behavior of many; perceptions of an outgoing president's policies, not so much. As a president's term goes on, perceptions of a president's policies will be superseded by the realities of actual policies, and perceptions of likely effects will be modified by conditions on the ground. The wisdom of crowds is not always spot-on. But it's sometimes superior to the wisdom of experts. Most experts predicted that Britain's vote for Brexit and America's for Trump would crater the economy. That hasn't happened yet here or there — and most people seem to perceive that it won't.

(Photo by Florian Gaertner/Photothek via Getty Images)   “Every regulation should have to pass a simple test: Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly,” President Donald Trump said as he signed an executive order establishing federal task forces to eliminate regulations. In fact, the executive order criteria say nothing about making life safer for U.S. workers and consumers. Rather they focus on rules that “eliminate jobs or inhibit job creation.” “The intent of this executive order is go to after Obama-era health and safety regulations,” said Public Citizen regulatory policy advocate Amit Narang. The Trump administration and Congressional Republicans are moving fast. And what they’re targeting for “reform” are regulations that protect public and workplace health and safety. Among the targets are rules that protect the manufacturing and construction workers the Trump administration claims to support. The rollback of other regulations will adversely impact Americans from coast-to-coast but most seriously affect low-income and minority communities. “Designed to destroy the system not improve it” Ahead of any task force formation, however, Republican lawmakers are busy introducing legislation to undo health and safety protections. Many of these bills would nullify rules currently on hold, delayed by a January 20 presidential memo freezing federal regulations not yet in effect. Much of the legislation uses the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which would prevent an agency from reintroducing similar regulations. Others, including the so-called SCRUB Act (“Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act”) that the House has passed, would essentially put into law what Trump mandated by executive order. Many of the health and safety protections now in jeopardy have been singled out by the Business Roundtable, an organization representing “exclusively” corporate CEOs. The group’s “Top Regulations of Concern” include Clean Air Act rules, the Obama administration’s expansion of overtime pay, rules requiring federal contractors to report wage and labor violations and to prevent Equal Pay Act violations, and standards for employer-sponsored wellness programs. This wish-list was sent to National Economic Council director Gary Cohn in a February 22 letter from the Business Roundtable leadership, a group that includes top executives from JP Morgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, Dow Chemical, Honeywell and Eastman Chemical.   “These are the guys whose baseball team Donald Trump wants to be picked for,” quipped University of Maryland School of Law professor Rena Steinzor, who served as legal advisor to the Federal Trade Commission and several House committees. Standing by on February 24 at the executive order signing event were executives from many of these same companies, among them Dow Chemical, Lockheed Martin, Archer Daniels Midland, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, International Paper and United Technologies. When asked for an example of a regulation they would like to see repealed, seven of the nine companies present declined to do so. The two others were not contacted. (In addition, two more companies the White House listed as at the event—Campbell’s and U.S. Steel—said they had not, in fact, been present.) International Paper expressed interest in “clarity” around regulation of carbon emissions from biomass, changes in truck and freight rail policies and a “complete overhaul” of international tax rules, but did not name any specific regulations. Dow sent a statement with a comment from its chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris saying, “there is real meat on the bones, with respect to the work this White House is doing with business leaders, such as the manufacturing group of CEOs.” Says Natural Resources Defense Council government affairs director, David Goldston, “These guys have an aggressively anti-regulatory agenda. It’s designed to destroy the system not improve it.” “Federal legislation is a safety net” Currently on hold are rules to reduce air pollution and workplace exposure to the carcinogenic metal beryllium, and to clarify the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) authority to hold employers to their obligation to maintain records of workplace injuries and illness. Another rule on hold would require industrial facilities that use or distribute hazardous chemicals to improve safety and emergency response plans. With the exception of the beryllium rule, all are also now the subject of CRA legislation to undo them. And some of these bills are moving quickly—passing on heavily party-line votes. Specifically, rules on hold would bring communities in at least 15 states into compliance with existing Clean Air Act standards, particularly for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), both of which can cause breathing problems, including lung damage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), these measures provide benefits that “vastly exceed compliance costs,” by more than 30-to-1. And, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), asthma affects 1 in 11 U.S. children and 1 in 12 U.S. adults, costing the United States an estimated $56 billion annually. On March 2, the EPA withdrew its rule requiring oil and gas companies to report methane emissions. Research led by the EPA has found that reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to ozone formation, can substantially reduce deaths from heart and lung disease. Also increasing the possibility of more lung disease is delay of the OSHA’s new beryllium exposure limits. Reduced for the first time in 40 years, the rule aims to prevent chronic, incurable beryllium disease and lung cancer among the approximately 62,000 workers in the 7,300 workplaces industrial workplaces nationwide that use beryllium. It would also protect these workers’ families from being exposed through dust on clothing and vehicles. Also now on hold and the object of CRA legislation in both the House and Senate is the EPA’s Risk Management Plan rule. Established in the wake of the 2013 West, Texas fertilizer plant disaster, it requires the country’s approximately 12,500 industrial facilities that use or distribute certain hazardous chemicals to enhance emergency management and safety plans. Industry representatives have called the rule “costly and unnecessary.” They’ve also suggested, erroneously, that the rule would endanger Americans by requiring that companies release sensitive information about chemicals at their facilities. In fact, this provision—designed to inform first responders—leaves information-sharing details to plant owners and operators. Unaware of the chemical hazards they were encountering, West, Texas firefighters lost their lives when a dangerous situation became calamitous. “It’s the manufacturing, working communities that get hurt when these things go wrong—workers, families, first responders,” says Mike Wilson, national director of the BlueGreen Alliance’s occupational and environmental health program, who spent 13 years working as a firefighter, paramedic and EMT. “The federal legislation is a safety net to make sure all companies are keeping up with standards, not just those that have moved ahead voluntarily,” says Wilson. “When you’re handling millions of pounds of hazardous materials, the laggards are genuine threats to public safety worker safety and to safety of first responders. And their errors aren’t confined to company property.” On March 13, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, siding with a petition from an industry group that includes the American Chemistry Council, American Petroleum Institute and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, announced that the rule will be reconsidered and reopened for public comment. The petition, which also asks that the rule be rescinded, was filed just seven working days after Pruitt’s confirmation by the same businesses supporting the CRA bill introduced in the House by Oklahoma Republican Markwayne Mullin and in the Senate by Oklahoma’s James Inhofe. At the same time, the House has already passed CRA legislation that would undo OSHA’s rule clarifying how employers keep records of serious workplace injury and illnesses, and both the House and Senate have negated the rule requiring federal contractors to fully disclose wage and other labor, including workplace safety, violations. Sixty-six labor advocacy groups—including the Communication Workers of America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Service Employees International Union, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America—wrote to House leadership opposing the legislation to repeal the new recordkeeping rule. “This resolution,” the groups said, “will undermine workplace health and safety in the most dangerous industries.” The same can be said of dozens of bills Republicans are now pushing through Congress with White House support.

Newport Beach-based Veritone Inc. is seeking $15 million in its IPO, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday. The startup uses artificial intelligence, or AI, to analyze audio and video data. The filing did not specify how many shares of stock would be issued. The stock will be listed under the symbol “VERI” on the Nasdaq exchange. The stock is being underwritten by Wunderlich Securities Inc. and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC. The money from the IPO will be used to fund the company’s growth, according to the SEC filing. The company, founded in 2014, signed an agreement last year with Newport Beach-based Acacia Research Corp. for up to $50 million. Acacia licenses patents. Company co-founder Chad Steelberg serves as the company’s chief executive officer and chariman of the board. Co-founder Ryan Steelberg serves as president. Alteryx Inc., a data analytics maker in Irvine, filed for its IPO last month. On Monday, the company announced in an SEC filing it would sell 9 million shares of stock for $12 to $14 a share, pricing the IPO at roughly $117 million. A date for the IPO has not yet been announced. The price could be higher if underwriters take the option to purchase more shares based on an assumed price of $13 per share. The company will be listed under AYX on the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Pacific Crest Securities, William Blair & Co., JMP Securities, Raymond James & Associates, and Cowen and Co. are the underwriters. Alteryx was founded as SRC in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding. It changed its name in 2010 to that of its core product. The company provides data analytics to more accurately predict how a company initiative would resonate with its customers or to plot new retail locations. Alteryx at the end of 2016 said it had 2,300 customers in more than 50 countries. It employs 424 people and has seven regional offices worldwide, including an office in Silicon Valley.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News The Howard Hughes Corporation® Announces Closing of an Offering of $800,000,000 Senior Notes Due 2025 and Early Settlement of Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Howard Hughes Corporation® (NYSE: HHC) (the “Company”) today announced the closing of an offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2025 (the “New Notes”) in an unregistered offering (the “Offering”) through a private placement and the early settlement of its previously announced tender offer and consent solicitation (the “Tender Offer”) for any and all of its existing 6.875% senior notes due 2021 (the “Old Notes”), which commenced on March 2, 2017 and is described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated March 2, 2017 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and a related Consent and Letter of Transmittal (together with the Offer to Purchase, the “Offer Documents”). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to pay aggregate consideration of approximately $642.2 million in respect of the Old Notes and the related consents. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to fund any additional Old Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer, redeem any Old Notes not tendered in the Tender Offer and, to the extent any net proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes. The New Notes were offered in a private placement, solely to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or outside the United States to persons other than “U.S. persons” in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 15, 2017 (the “Consent Payment Deadline”), holders of approximately $591.7 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes had validly tendered and delivered (and not validly withdrawn or revoked prior to the Withdrawal Deadline, as defined below) such Old Notes and the related consents (the “Early Tender Notes”), which represents approximately 79% of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes outstanding. The withdrawal deadline also expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 15, 2017 (the “Withdrawal Deadline”). The Company exercised its right to accept for purchase and payment, and to purchase and pay for, the Early Tender Notes. The aggregate consideration paid in respect of such Early Tender Notes is comprised of $1,053.75 (which includes a $30.00 consent payment) per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered (as all such Old Notes were tendered at or prior to the Consent Payment Deadline), plus accrued and unpaid interest from and including the most recent interest payment date, and up to, but not including the early settlement date. Settlement of the purchase of the Early Tender Notes occurred today, March 16, 2017. Having received the requisite consents from the holders of the Old Notes in the Tender Offer, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, executed a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) amending the indenture relating to the Old Notes (the “Old Indenture”). The Supplemental Indenture eliminates substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and related provisions contained in the Old Indenture and reduces the notice periods required for redemption of the Old Notes. The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 29, 2017, unless the Tender Offer is extended (the “Expiration Date”). Holders who validly tender their Old Notes after the Consent Payment Deadline, but at or prior to the Expiration Date, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase, will only be eligible to receive $1,023.75 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest from and including the most recent interest payment date, and up to, but not including the final settlement date, which is expected to be the business day following the Expiration Date. The complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set forth in the Offer Documents that previously were sent to holders of the Old Notes. The Company also issued a notice of redemption for the remaining outstanding principal amount of Old Notes. On March 30, 2017, the Company expects to redeem the remaining principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.156% of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Old Notes to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the Old Notes may still participate in the Tender Offer and tender their Old Notes at or prior to the Expiration Date even though the Company has elected to call the remaining outstanding Old Notes for redemption. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption. The redemption is being made solely pursuant to the notice of redemption delivered pursuant to the Old Indenture, and the information in this press release is qualified in its entirety by such notice. The Company has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as Dealer Managers and Solicitation Agents for the Tender Offer. Persons with questions regarding the Tender Offer should contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (212) 723-6106 (Collect) or (800) 558-3745 (Toll Free). Requests for copies of the Offer Documents or documents relating to the Tender Offer may be directed to D.F. King & Company, Inc., the Tender Agent and Information Agent, at (888) 887-1266. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, the Old Notes. The Tender Offer is made solely pursuant to the Offer Documents. The Tender Offer is not being made to holders of Old Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. Holders are urged to read the Offer Documents and related documents carefully before making any decision with respect to the Tender Offer. Holders of Old Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Old Notes and provide the related consents. None of the Company, the Dealer Managers and Solicitation Agents, the Tender Agent or the Information Agent makes any recommendations as to whether holders should tender their Old Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer, and no one has been authorized to make such a recommendation.

The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to pay aggregate consideration of approximately $642.2 million in respect of the Old Notes and the related consents. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds to fund any additional Old Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer, redeem any Old Notes not tendered in the Tender Offer and, to the extent any net proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes. The New Notes were offered in a private placement, solely to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or outside the United States to persons other than “U.S. persons” in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 15, 2017 (the “Consent Payment Deadline”), holders of approximately $591.7 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes had validly tendered and delivered (and not validly withdrawn or revoked prior to the Withdrawal Deadline, as defined below) such Old Notes and the related consents (the “Early Tender Notes”), which represents approximately 79% of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of Old Notes outstanding. The withdrawal deadline also expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 15, 2017 (the “Withdrawal Deadline”). The Company exercised its right to accept for purchase and payment, and to purchase and pay for, the Early Tender Notes. The aggregate consideration paid in respect of such Early Tender Notes is comprised of $1,053.75 (which includes a $30.00 consent payment) per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered (as all such Old Notes were tendered at or prior to the Consent Payment Deadline), plus accrued and unpaid interest from and including the most recent interest payment date, and up to, but not including the early settlement date. Settlement of the purchase of the Early Tender Notes occurred today, March 16, 2017. Having received the requisite consents from the holders of the Old Notes in the Tender Offer, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, executed a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) amending the indenture relating to the Old Notes (the “Old Indenture”). The Supplemental Indenture eliminates substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and related provisions contained in the Old Indenture and reduces the notice periods required for redemption of the Old Notes. The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 29, 2017, unless the Tender Offer is extended (the “Expiration Date”). Holders who validly tender their Old Notes after the Consent Payment Deadline, but at or prior to the Expiration Date, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase, will only be eligible to receive $1,023.75 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest from and including the most recent interest payment date, and up to, but not including the final settlement date, which is expected to be the business day following the Expiration Date. The complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set forth in the Offer Documents that previously were sent to holders of the Old Notes. The Company also issued a notice of redemption for the remaining outstanding principal amount of Old Notes. On March 30, 2017, the Company expects to redeem the remaining principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.156% of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Old Notes to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the Old Notes may still participate in the Tender Offer and tender their Old Notes at or prior to the Expiration Date even though the Company has elected to call the remaining outstanding Old Notes for redemption. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption. The redemption is being made solely pursuant to the notice of redemption delivered pursuant to the Old Indenture, and the information in this press release is qualified in its entirety by such notice. The Company has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as Dealer Managers and Solicitation Agents for the Tender Offer. Persons with questions regarding the Tender Offer should contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (212) 723-6106 (Collect) or (800) 558-3745 (Toll Free). Requests for copies of the Offer Documents or documents relating to the Tender Offer may be directed to D.F. King & Company, Inc., the Tender Agent and Information Agent, at (888) 887-1266. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, the Old Notes. The Tender Offer is made solely pursuant to the Offer Documents. The Tender Offer is not being made to holders of Old Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. Holders are urged to read the Offer Documents and related documents carefully before making any decision with respect to the Tender Offer. Holders of Old Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to tender their Old Notes and provide the related consents. None of the Company, the Dealer Managers and Solicitation Agents, the Tender Agent or the Information Agent makes any recommendations as to whether holders should tender their Old Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer, and no one has been authorized to make such a recommendation.

The Federal Reserve took center stage, although not dramatically, as it raised interest rates exactly as the financial media had predicted. In its forecast, the Fed indicated that this would be the first of three one quarter-point rate increases during 2017 to be followed by another three quarter-point raises in 2018. Wall Street had worried that the Fed might step up the pace with a fourth increase this year or that it would step up its forecasts for inflation, which it kept at 1.9% at the end of 2017 and 2.0% in 2018 and 2019. Chairwoman Yellen did leave open the possibility that the Fed would modify its policy if the Administration and Congress could manage to pass big fiscal stimulus spending programs. She also noted that the Fed would not react until any concrete proposals were evident. The Fed’s action was implicitly bolstered by the surge in stock prices that have pushed the Dow to the 20,000-21,000 bracket. The jobless rate is 4.9%, slightly below the Fed’s “full employment” and inflation is below its current 2% target. All this supports its course change from the emergency record low rates that it instituted in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crises to a new range of upward bumps. Were rates not still so low, this would be immediately worrisome, as higher rates tend to erode stock prices. The first ripple comes as financial institutions begin increases on credit cards and mortgages. This decreases consumer spending power, ultimately affecting businesses’ sales and profits. Businesses also borrow money and more expensive loans pressure expansion plans and new ventures. Viewing a company’s value through taking the sum of its future cash flows (or earnings) and discounting to the present value yields lower valuations as rates rise. These effects have spawned another Wall Street saying, “Three steps and stumble,” a rule of thumb warning that three increases by the Fed without an intervening market dip, foretells a stock market setback. This cycle, however, is starting from record low levels and, most critically, within a benign inflation environment. The newest rate hike took the federal funds rate to a 0.75%-1%-range, still comfortably below the inflation rate of 2%. The “real” (inflation-adjusted) rate is lower, thus present conditions prompt “Three steps and rumble.” Moreover, some sectors initially benefit from rising rates. Banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions often see rising earnings as their lending rates rise. That points to further gains for JP Morgan Chase (JPM-$91), Morgan Stanley (MS-$46), Primerica (PRI-$83) and Visa (V-$90). I prefer these but Bank of America (BAC-$25) should also prosper. Housing starts last month hit their highest level since 2007 as the economy continues to improve and buyers are hustling ahead of higher mortgage rates. That’s good news for Essent (ESNT-$36), which sells home mortgage insurance. It trades now at only 12 times 2017 earnings. Global accelerating economic growth is driving new buy recommendation, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE-$61). It owns and operates globally 23 exchanges and clearing houses of which the most famous is the New York Stock Exchange. (ICE is based in Atlanta, Georgia, reflecting the South’s growing financial clout as Bank of America ((with Merrill Lynch)) is based in Charlotte, North Carolina.) ICE just completed its eleventh consecutive year of record revenues and earnings. These gains have been unusually consistent and it expects $2.90-$3.00 earnings for 2017, up 8%-10%. Dividend yield is 1.3% with increases for the past three years. Stock strategies are unchanged. Stocks in large, growing companies should form the core, if not all, of most investor holdings with moderate reserves in short-term bond ETF’s or closed-end funds. Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF (BSV-$79) is a conservative reserve position with a 1.5% yield. The Federal Reserve could have sent a stiff headwind. It didn’t and investors can stay on course.

ESTIMO JR. | Published — Friday 17 March 2017 Abdullah Al-Meleihi RIYADH: A one-day Saudi-Chinese Investment Forum ended in an upbeat mood on Thursday with 45 agreements signed between China and the Kingdom. Abdullah Al-Meleihi, board member of the Council of Saudi Chambers (CSC), told Arab News from Beijing that the Saudi government also issued licenses to two big Chinese firms. He added that the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) made a presentation on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. He added that King Salman attended the closing ceremony with Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih delivering the closing address. He said that more than 500 Saudi and Chinese businessmen attended the forum held in conjunction with Salman’s visit. “The Saudi businessmen and Chinese counterparts did mega business deals during King Salman’s visit to China,” Al-Meleihi said. He noted that Saudi-Chinese trade relationship has increased gradually over the years and the Kingdom has regained its position as the largest supplier of crude oil to China, citing data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs. The data indicated that China’s imports of Saudi crude oil increased 18.9 percent in January to reach 5.03 million tons or the equivalent of 1.18 trillion barrels per day. Al-Meleihi noted that there had been a growing Chinese interest in Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) ahead of King Salman’s visit to Asia. Reuters reported earlier that Saudi Aramco had asked JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley to assist with its mammoth initial public share offer and could call on another bank with access to Chinese investors. Al-Meleihi, who is also the chairman of Al Ramez International Group, added that China remains the largest trading partner of Arab countries that include the Kingdom, Egypt and Iraq. He added that the latest figures from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce showed that the total business volume between China and Arab countries in 2016 touched $171.14 billion.

Photo / AP Wall Street and US Treasuries slipped as investors locked in profits following Wednesday's rally. In 1.25pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also slipped 0.1 per cent. In 1.10pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 0.2 per cent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of DuPont and those of Chevron, down 1.1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of IBM and those of Goldman Sachs, up 0.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. "There is certainly the element of profit taking today," Marcelle Daher, senior managing director, asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, Massachusetts, told Reuters. Fed Chair Janet Yellen quelled expectations that the central bank was looking to speed up the pace of interest rate increases, following the rate hike on Wednesday. "The simple message is the economy's doing well," Yellen told reporters on Wednesday. "We have confidence in the robustness of the economy and its resilience to shocks." Indeed, the latest economic data underlined the positive outlook. A Commerce Department report showed housing starts climbed 3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 1.29 million units in February. Meanwhile, a Labour Department report showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended March 11. "The reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the economy," Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York, told Reuters. Continued below.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Liberal Party comfortably secured the most seats in parliament. "Dutch voters rejected populism and voted for Europe," Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told Bloomberg.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady JPMorgan Chase purchases CurrentC, looks to develop technology for further use Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 13th, 2017, 05:07 Category: Apple Pay, Finance, iOS, News, retail If you were curious as to what happened to CurrentC, the intended mobile payment service that was intended to compete with Apple Pay a few years ago, there’s an answer: JPMorgan bought it out. Oddly enough, Chase Bank played both sides and was one of a few major banks to partner with Apple when Apple Pay launched back in the fall of 2014, but several retailers including CVS and Walmart blocked or denied plans to accept Apple Pay due to an upcoming CurrentC app and commitments to MCX, the company developing CurrentC. Some CurrentC backers including Rite Aid and Best Buy eventually changed their course and added Apple Pay as a payment option in stores, and last summer efforts to bring CurrentC to market finally ended. Chase currently remains an Apple Pay backer, although its in-house payment service, knows as “Chase Pay”, is based on MCX technology. Although CurrentC is dead, JPMorgan Chase says it has acquired MCX to help bring Chase Pay to more retailers. MCX’s members were already connected to MCX payments technology, which made it seamless to connect to Chase Pay. Chase executives wanted to acquire the technology to use in lieu of building separate parallel technology to serve non-MCX members. At present, only a few retailers currently accept CurrentC, especially given its QR code-based payment option. Best Buy and Starbucks, for example, accept both Apple Pay and were launch partners for Chase Pay, while JPMorgan Chase says Walmart, Shell, or other MCX members will start accepting Chase Pay in the future. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Brazil's Cemig to cut Light stake by more than half -source By Reuters Published: 13:32 EDT, 16 March 2017 | Updated: 13:32 EDT, 16 March 2017 e-mail By Guillermo Parra-Bernal SAO PAULO, March 16 (Reuters) - Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA plans to sell more than half the 52 percent stake it holds in electricity company Light Energia SA , the latest in a series of planned asset sales aimed at helping Brazil's No. 3 power utility reduce debt, a person with direct knowledge of the plan said on Thursday. The source said Cemig would sell 11 percent of the 26 percent direct participation it holds in Light's capital in the market within 60 days, leaving it with a 15 percent direct stake. Cemig will keep about a third of the 26 percent indirect stake it has in Light and put the rest up for sale, the person added. Assuming Cemig will keep about 24 percent of Light and based on a price of 25 reais per share, the deal could raise about 3.6 billion reais ($1.2 billion) for Cemig, the source said. Shares of Light were down 2.8 percent at 21.00 reais on Thursday afternoon. Brazil-based Cemig and Rio de Janeiro-based Light did not have an immediate comment. Efforts to reach representatives for Minas governor Fernando Pimentel were not immediately successful. State-controlled Cemig is quickly exiting some business segments and trying to turn around core business such as power generation, renewable energy and transmission. The group's debt has tripled since 2012, following a spree of takeovers that failed to yield the expected returns and in part because of a government-led power contract renegotiation that same year. The decision comes less than a week after Reuters reported that Cemig is also working on a plan to sell a majority stake in power generation and transmission company Cemig GT and power distribution firm Cemig D, and then list the units in São Paulo and New York this year. Cemig is controlled by Brazil's Minas Gerais state, which signed off on the plan last week. With the move on Light, Cemig would end a shareholder accord that controls that company and take a step toward making its ownership more dispersed, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are private. Light's controlling bloc includes Cemig, conglomerate Andrade Gutiérrez SA and investment vehicles Luce Participações SA and RME Rio Minas Energia. Proceeds from the sale of Light stock will be used to reduce Cemig's 13.7 billion-real debt burden, the person said. Banks including Grupo BTG Pactual SA, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Banco Santander Brasil SA and Citigroup Inc are in talks to oversee the transaction, which should be concluded by the end of June, the person said. The investment-banking units of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA, Brazil's top two banks by assets, are also participating in the talks, the person noted. The banks did not have an immediate comment. Pimentel's decision to partially exit Light and surrender control of Cemig GT and Cemig D adds to a flurry of merger and acquisition deals in Brazil's electricity industry over the past year. The largest was State Grid Corp of China's $21 billion purchase of CPFL Energia SA last year. Cemig remains active on that front, disposing of assets it considers nonessential or too problematic to run, while finding partners for some debt-laden subsidiaries like renewable power firm Renova Energia SA. Reuters reported on March 1 that a unit of Brookfield Asset Management Inc was close to buying a 30 percent stake in Renova.

It uses that money for business loans that create tens of thousands of jobs. Now the president wants it gone. Illustration: mooltfilm/iStock, iVOOK/iStock By Eillie Anzilotti03.16.17 | 12:50 pm In light of the fact that Donald Trump recently announced he intends to increase the U.S.’s military spending by $54 billion, a federal program totaling just $258 million sounds fairly inconsequential. But the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, which awards loans to institutions dedicated to promoting development and financial inclusion in disadvantaged areas, is a vital economic resource for low-income American communities. It costs each American just 79 cents per year. “These are precisely the communities President Trump seeks to help, including hollowed out inner-city neighborhoods and economically distressed rural communities.” In 2016, the $233.5 million in CDFI Fund appropriations translated into a total of $2.1 billion worth of investments and loans across the U.S.; as a result, the money resulted in the creation of 28,000 jobs. But in the Trump administration’s proposed new budget, submitted to Congress on March 16, the CDFI’s funds will be cut by $210 million, leaving it just $19 million to continue operation of its old programs, but not make any new grants. The CDFI fund was launched by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1994 specifically to direct funds to disadvantaged communities. It does so by providing grants to CDFIs, which are private financial institutions that offer affordable lending to low-income communities that often cannot access lending resources offered through mainstream financial institutions due to a lack of solid credit history or an unwillingness to sign up for a bank account, which, because of late-payment and overdraft fees, are often seen as an impossible expense. There are over 1,000 CDFIs across the U.S., and though the grants that the CDFI Fund awards to CDFIs are relatively small, CDFIs are able to leverage those dollars to bring in private investors and create substantial funding streams that go directly into city and neighborhood-level projects. While CDFIs operate in a wide range of areas across the U.S., the majority (67%) work in urban areas, and benefit low-income communities of color–ironically, the very communities that Trump claimed to want to help over the course of his campaign. Cutting the program that funds them, said CDFI Coalition President James R. Klein in a statement, would harm “precisely the communities President Trump seeks to help, including hollowed out inner-city neighborhoods and economically distressed rural communities.” The CDFI Fund offers two types of loans to CDFIs: financial assistance awards and technical assistance awards. The latter are much smaller–up to $125,000–and the CDFIs applying for them don’t have to go through a certification process. For financial assistance awards, though, CDFIs have to apply for certification through the CDFI Fund; the certification process ensures that the CDFI is dedicated to supporting community development in a particular market. Those loans can total up to $2 million, and the CDFI availing of them must match its CDFI Fund award dollar-for-dollar with loans from private lending institutions; CDFIs partner with a variety of banks and nonprofits to round out the loans that they funnel into communities. These loans have brought about a wide range of projects: A Los Angeles-based CDFI, Genesis LA, funded a transitional home for troubled youth; HOPE Enterprise Corporation, a Mississippi-based CDFI, connected people whose homes had been destroyed by Hurricane Katrina with mortgage-financing and home-recovery consulting services; Rural Community Assistance Corporation, a Sacramento CDFI, loaned a husband-and-wife tamale business $125,000 to refinance their loans and cover the cost of kitchen supplies. Ellis Carr is the president and CEO of Capital Impact Partners, a Washington, DC-based CDFI with offices in Detroit and Oakland. He tells Co.Exist that when his company received a $2 million award from the CDFI Fund in 2014, it used that loan as a base to bring on board private and philanthropic partners, including JPMorgan Chase, and create a $30 million fund “that invested in Detroit at a time when everybody was taking a huge step back and no one was really providing long-term, fixed-rate financing in the midtown area,” Carr says. The unique financing structure that Capital Impact used in Detroit increased housing density in the midtown corridor and helped establish a new school and health facility. “The dollars from the CDFI Fund allow us to do these innovative structures that bring in private investment and philanthropy,” Carr says. “But the Fund also allows us to be sustainable financially, because as a nonprofit lender, you need to consistently have equity to so that you can borrow more money from these institutions and continue to lend it to communities. The CDFI Fund gives us equity, which we leverage to bring in more private investment. If that federal CDFI Fund were to go away or be dramatically reduced, it would have a direct impact on the work that CDFIs are able to do across the country.” “With the current administration, some of the sound bites you hear are around the forgotten man or the forgotten people. CDFIs have been doing this work for 30 years–we’ve been working with that forgotten population all along.” The CDFI Fund also administers the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, which was established in 2000 to spur revitalization in low-income communities through offering private lenders a tax credit if they invest in Community Development Entities, which have a stated mission of supporting low-income communities and people. The NMTC, along with the program that administers it, is likely to face the chopping block under Trump’s budget and tax plans. “With the current administration, some of the sound bites you hear are around the forgotten man or the forgotten people,” Carr says. “CDFIs have been doing this work for 30 years–we’ve been working with that forgotten population all along. So at a time when this country is really hurting, and can see the hurt in terms of people who are in need, we shouldn’t be talking about reducing the amount that goes to the CDFI Fund, that then goes to CDFIs and is invested in communities. We should be talking about how we should double it.” But the problem is that CDFIs themselves tend to fly under the radar, says Lina Page, the executive vice president of strategic communications for the Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), a national association of CDFIs. “We know for a fact that CDFIs are among the best-kept secrets in America,” she says. “Not many people know what they are or what they do.” Because CDFIs are embedded in communities, responding to local needs and bringing in a variety of partners to deliver funds, they tend to blend seamlessly into the investment and development landscape. For people like Carr, that’s just part and parcel of CDFI’s mission: Companies like Capital Impact Partners don’t do the work they do for recognition or glory–they do it to get money to the people and communities that need it most. “If people understood the impact of CDFIs, and how many amazing businesses, homes, jobs, health centers, and charter schools were funded by them, they would be celebrated.” But the lack of exposure, Page says, may be what’s driving the disregard with which the Trump administration is treating these organizations and the federal fund that supports them. “If people understood the impact of CDFIs, and how many amazing businesses, homes, jobs, health centers, and charter schools were funded by them, they would be celebrated,” she says. To that end, OFN has begun to campaign for more recognition of CDFIs on a national scale, both through a social media advocacy campaign, called #CDFIsInvest in America, and through spreading the word about CDFIs in Washington in advance of Trump’s budget finalization. To do so, Liz Lopez, executive vice president for public policy at OFN, says they’re telling the story of CDFIs from the perspective of people who benefit from them. On a recent trip to the Hill, Lopez was speaking to a staffer, and asked if he’d heard of a local D.C. food truck called Arepa Zone. The staffer said yes; he’d eaten there plenty of times. Lopez asked if he knew they were able to purchase their truck only through the help of a CDFI loan; he said, no, what’s a CDFI? “I was able to explain to him that were it not for that first CDFI loan, they wouldn’t have been able to grow their business and create new jobs for eight people,” Lopez says. When it comes down to it, Lopez says, the CDFI Fund is .0000068 percent of the total U.S. budget. To gut such a small yet effective program, that costs the average American half the price of a candy bar, is not only nonsensical; it will deprive those communities that Trump claims to want to help of yet another critical lifeline.

Pollsters had been chastised for not capturing an anti-establishment upsurge before 2016's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's U.S. election, even though both results were within a reasonable margin of error. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's victory, after fending off a challenge from far-right rival Geert Wilders, appears to have silenced some of those critics in what could be an important factor for maintaining financial stability ahead of French, German, and possibly Italian elections, later this year. The biggest of those political tests is seen as the French presidential run-off in May which is likely to pit eurosceptic Marine Le Pen against centrist Emmanuel Macron. Polls suggest she has little chance of winning, trailing by around 20 points. "For the first time in a long time we have had polls that have actually worked," said Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager in Janus Capital, adding that the push back against populism meant markets could "breathe a bit easier about the French outcome." Polls conducted ahead of election day accurately reflected trends and the order of the parties, although they did not forecast the full extent of the lead of Rutte's VVD party. "All in all we did pretty well," said an employee at research group Ipsos, declared by newspaper De Volkskrant as the most accurate pollster. Dutch polling agencies pride themselves on their near exclusive use of anonymous online questioning - more reflective of a society with some 95 percent of the population active on the web - and weighting of responses according to likelihood to vote. They argue it limits under-reporting of the anti-establishment vote. In France, pollsters used to inflate the score attributed to Le Pen's National Front to compensate for what they saw as a reluctance by some voters to acknowledge voting for it. In recent years they have removed that weighting, saying that voters are no longer reluctant to say who they vote for. In notes to clients on Thursday, banks Barclays and JPMorgan said one of the main conclusions from the election was that populist parties are not systematically underestimated by pollsters, and that polls remain important bellwethers. Relief spread across European markets after the Dutch result with shares climbing to a 15-month high and the euro marking its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in nine months. Leaders across Europe also applauded the outcome. PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE Even if the opinion polls in France seem emphatic, investors may not want to bank on that outcome just yet. Polls swung behind Rutte in the Netherlands in the final weeks, but had previously shown Wilders out in front. The impact of late-gamechangers, such as Rutte's firm stance against Turkey in a dispute which dominated the last few days ahead of the vote, could have implications for the French and German votes later this year. Many Dutch voters were still undecided just days before the election. "We had some 14 percent of voters deciding on election day itself, some even only making up their minds in the voting booth," said Marianne Bank, research director at Ipsos. Pollster Maurice de Hond said that showed the need to intensify polling efforts in the final week. "Voters making up their minds at the end has such a big effect," he said. With nearly two months to go until the final vote in France, there could be similar shifts in voter intention in a campaign that has already seen scandals swirl around all three main candidates. "The decent predictive performance of opinion polls in the Dutch vote is likely to restore confidence in French surveys, which have consistently ascribed a low probability to Marine Le Pen winning," said Adrian Hilton, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. "It's probably a little too soon to sound the all-clear, however." UNDERESTIMATED The Dutch result could also help further undermine a body of investor opinion that believes betting markets are a clearer gauge of sentiment than polls - a theory that prevailed ahead of the Brexit and U.S. votes. On both occasions, bookmakers were further off the mark than largely equivocal opinion polls. "It gives you some firmer belief in polls but I think disappointment from last year around Brexit and Trump was overdone," said Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said a perceived large polling error for both Brexit and the U.S. election was actually only around 2-4 percent. Even assuming a bigger margin of error in France, the bank sees around a 15 percent chance of a Le Pen win, versus some bookmakers odds showing around 30 percent.

Pollsters had been chastised for not capturing an anti-establishment upsurge before 2016's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's U.S. election, even though both results were within a reasonable margin of error. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's victory, after fending off a challenge from far-right rival Geert Wilders, appears to have silenced some of those critics in what could be an important factor for maintaining financial stability ahead of French, German, and possibly Italian elections, later this year. The biggest of those political tests is seen as the French presidential run-off in May which is likely to pit eurosceptic Marine Le Pen against centrist Emmanuel Macron. Polls suggest she has little chance of winning, trailing by around 20 points. "For the first time in a long time we have had polls that have actually worked," said Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager in Janus Capital, adding that the push back against populism meant markets could "breathe a bit easier about the French outcome." Polls conducted ahead of election day accurately reflected trends and the order of the parties, although they did not forecast the full extent of the lead of Rutte's VVD party. "All in all we did pretty well," said an employee at research group Ipsos, declared by newspaper De Volkskrant as the most accurate pollster. Dutch polling agencies pride themselves on their near exclusive use of anonymous online questioning - more reflective of a society with some 95 percent of the population active on the web - and weighting of responses according to likelihood to vote. They argue it limits under-reporting of the anti-establishment vote. In France, pollsters used to inflate the score attributed to Le Pen's National Front to compensate for what they saw as a reluctance by some voters to acknowledge voting for it. In recent years they have removed that weighting, saying that voters are no longer reluctant to say who they vote for. In notes to clients on Thursday, banks Barclays and JPMorgan said one of the main conclusions from the election was that populist parties are not systematically underestimated by pollsters, and that polls remain important bellwethers. Relief spread across European markets after the Dutch result with shares climbing to a 15-month high and the euro marking its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in nine months. Leaders across Europe also applauded the outcome. PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE Even if the opinion polls in France seem emphatic, investors may not want to bank on that outcome just yet. Polls swung behind Rutte in the Netherlands in the final weeks, but had previously shown Wilders out in front. The impact of late-gamechangers, such as Rutte's firm stance against Turkey in a dispute which dominated the last few days ahead of the vote, could have implications for the French and German votes later this year. Many Dutch voters were still undecided just days before the election. "We had some 14 percent of voters deciding on election day itself, some even only making up their minds in the voting booth," said Marianne Bank, research director at Ipsos. Pollster Maurice de Hond said that showed the need to intensify polling efforts in the final week. "Voters making up their minds at the end has such a big effect," he said. With nearly two months to go until the final vote in France, there could be similar shifts in voter intention in a campaign that has already seen scandals swirl around all three main candidates. "The decent predictive performance of opinion polls in the Dutch vote is likely to restore confidence in French surveys, which have consistently ascribed a low probability to Marine Le Pen winning," said Adrian Hilton, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Pollsters had been chastised for not capturing an anti-establishment upsurge before 2016's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's U.S. election, even though both results were within a reasonable margin of error. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's victory, after fending off a challenge from far-right rival Geert Wilders, appears to have silenced some of those critics in what could be an important factor for maintaining financial stability ahead of French, German, and possibly Italian elections, later this year. The biggest of those political tests is seen as the French presidential run-off in May which is likely to pit eurosceptic Marine Le Pen against centrist Emmanuel Macron. Polls suggest she has little chance of winning, trailing by around 20 points. "For the first time in a long time we have had polls that have actually worked," said Ryan Myerberg, a portfolio manager in Janus Capital, adding that the push back against populism meant markets could "breathe a bit easier about the French outcome." Polls conducted ahead of election day accurately reflected trends and the order of the parties, although they did not forecast the full extent of the lead of Rutte's VVD party. "All in all we did pretty well," said an employee at research group Ipsos, declared by newspaper De Volkskrant as the most accurate pollster. Dutch polling agencies pride themselves on their near exclusive use of anonymous online questioning - more reflective of a society with some 95 percent of the population active on the web - and weighting of responses according to likelihood to vote. They argue it limits under-reporting of the anti-establishment vote. In France, pollsters used to inflate the score attributed to Le Pen's National Front to compensate for what they saw as a reluctance by some voters to acknowledge voting for it. In recent years they have removed that weighting, saying that voters are no longer reluctant to say who they vote for. In notes to clients on Thursday, banks Barclays and JPMorgan said one of the main conclusions from the election was that populist parties are not systematically underestimated by pollsters, and that polls remain important bellwethers. Relief spread across European markets after the Dutch result with shares climbing to a 15-month high and the euro marking its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in nine months. Leaders across Europe also applauded the outcome. PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE Even if the opinion polls in France seem emphatic, investors may not want to bank on that outcome just yet. Polls swung behind Rutte in the Netherlands in the final weeks, but had previously shown Wilders out in front. The impact of late-gamechangers, such as Rutte's firm stance against Turkey in a dispute which dominated the last few days ahead of the vote, could have implications for the French and German votes later this year. Many Dutch voters were still undecided just days before the election. "We had some 14 percent of voters deciding on election day itself, some even only making up their minds in the voting booth," said Marianne Bank, research director at Ipsos. Pollster Maurice de Hond said that showed the need to intensify polling efforts in the final week. "Voters making up their minds at the end has such a big effect," he said. With nearly two months to go until the final vote in France, there could be similar shifts in voter intention in a campaign that has already seen scandals swirl around all three main candidates. "The decent predictive performance of opinion polls in the Dutch vote is likely to restore confidence in French surveys, which have consistently ascribed a low probability to Marine Le Pen winning," said Adrian Hilton, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. "It's probably a little too soon to sound the all-clear, however." UNDERESTIMATED The Dutch result could also help further undermine a body of investor opinion that believes betting markets are a clearer gauge of sentiment than polls - a theory that prevailed ahead of the Brexit and U.S. votes. On both occasions, bookmakers were further off the mark than largely equivocal opinion polls. "It gives you some firmer belief in polls but I think disappointment from last year around Brexit and Trump was overdone," said Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said a perceived large polling error for both Brexit and the U.S. election was actually only around 2-4 percent. Even assuming a bigger margin of error in France, the bank sees around a 15 percent chance of a Le Pen win, versus some bookmakers odds showing around 30 percent.

More than 90% of producers in the global seaborne market can generate profits at a benchmark price of $60 a metric ton, Adrian Doyle, a Sydney-based senior consultant at researcher CRU Group, said by phone. That compares with about 65% of suppliers able to avoid losses at the same price point three years ago, he said. “There have been fantastic cost reductions in a lot of instances,” while producers have also been boosted by lower oil prices, Doyle said. “If we were thinking of a pressure point where we’d start to see a bit of stretching in the industry, previously it would’ve been around $60/t, now it’s closer to $50/t-to-$45/t to stress test everyone but the majors.” Benchmark iron ore dropped under $90 a metric ton last week for the first time since Feb. 10 amid rising supply in the 1.4 billion ton seaborne market and surging stockpiles in China. Ore with 62% content in Qingdao was at $86.72 a dry ton Friday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. Prices rallied to $94.86/t on Feb. 21, the highest since August 2014. Futures in Dalian surged 4.3% to 684.5 yuan/t on Monday, the highest at close since March 3. Producers including BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group have warned prices are poised to retreat after they reported a surge in profits last month fueled by the price rally and their cost cuts. Perth-based Fortescue has more than halved cash costs in the past two years to about $12.54/t in the last quarter, while BHP lowered them by more than 25% to $15.05/t in the final six months of last year, according to filings. Prices are likely to move closer to $60/t by the end of this year, Sally Auld, chief economist and head of fixed-income and currency strategy for Australia at JPMorgan Chase & Co., told Bloomberg TV in an interview. They will drop to $56.89/t in the final quarter of 2017, according to the median estimate among 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. About 14% of global producers lose cash at $60/t, according to Deutsche Bank analysts including Paul Young and Anna Mulholland. At $40, around 31% of the sector are loss-making, they wrote in a March 8 note. With prices at $90/t, only 1% of miners fail to generate profits. “The fundamentals all point in the direction of a softening of that iron ore price,” BHP’s CFO Peter Beaven said Thursday at a Sydney conference. “Supply continues to increase, particularly from Brazil,” and there’s a waning impact on demand from China’s fiscal stimulus. The third-largest exporter is prepared for a “much lower iron ore price.” Brazil’s Vale SA, the biggest exporter, is delivering its first cargoes to China from its $14-billion S11D mine and has cash costs that are likely to fall below $10/t, according to Australia’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. Rival producers including Rio Tinto Group, BHP, Fortescue and Roy Hill Holdings would all remain profitable at prices below $50/t, the department said in a report published in January.
