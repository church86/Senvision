Cronkleton The Kansas City Star Police are still searching for one of two attackers who struck Sunday afternoon in a parking lot near the Wal-Mart store at 65th Street and Maurer Road in Shawnee. Joe Ledford jledford@kcstar.com 1 of 2 i By Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A man arrested Sunday in an attack at a Shawnee Wal-Mart was released after police questioned him and determined he was not involved. Several teams of police officers were back on the case Monday working leads in the search for a second suspect in an incident that left one attacker dead, a woman injured and a Good Samaritan shot. The dead attacker, who was shot by a separate Good Samaritan, was identified as 28-year-old John W. Simmons III of Kansas City. The woman who was attacked Sunday in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Shawnee was a 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., resident. Police said Monday she had been released from the hospital. The Good Samaritan who was shot when he intervened to help her was a 33-year-old Kansas City man. He had surgery Sunday night and remained in the hospital in serious condition Monday, said Shawnee police spokesman Maj. Dan Tennis. Police said the woman was attacked about 1:30 p.m. Sunday as she was putting her infant in a car seat after shopping at the store near Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road. Two people approached and the woman was struck on the head, police said. A Good Samaritan who tried to help her was shot and critically wounded by one of the attackers. At that point the second Good Samaritan, a 36-year-old De Soto man, came forward and shot one of the attackers. Police said Monday the woman who was assaulted did not know her attackers. Police also said the first Good Samaritan was not armed. The second Good Samaritan was interviewed and released. According to Missouri court records, a person whom Simmons had a child in common with filed a protective order against him in December 2013. Simmons was ordered to stay away from and refrain from communicating with the petitioner. According to online federal court records, a man named John W. Simmons III, of the same age as the man killed, was under indictment in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, with having a firearm while trafficking drugs and with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Soon after the attack, officers with a K9 unit located and arrested a man east of the store and said he was suspected of being the second attacker. Tennis said he fit the description from witnesses and he was located in the area. But on Monday police said they did not believe he was involved in the attack. He was released later Sunday. “The man who was arrested yesterday shortly after this incident has been determined not to be involved in the crime,” according to a police statement. “Currently several teams of police officers are working on leads.” Anyone with information is asked to call the Tips TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477 or Shawnee police at 913-631-2150.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it The company wants to expand the Capital Plaza Walmart. Neighbors are divided over whether that’s a good idea. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) By Arelis Hernández September 12 Nearly 10 years ago, Walmart representatives stood with Prince George’s County residents to announce an unusual agreement that would create the retail behemoth’s first inside-the-Beltway store. The Walmart in Landover Hills would not sell firearms or alcohol or stay open 24 hours. It would hire locally and, among other things, encourage the kind of economic development residents wanted along this stretch of Annapolis Road, such as nice restaurants and higher-end retail. Now Walmart is seeking county legislative approval for a 35,200-square-foot expansion at what has become one of its most heavily shopped locations. And those same neighbors are standing against it, saying the discount retailer has only lived up to part of the bargain. The Walmart at Capital Plaza does not sell guns or booze, and it is closed from midnight to 6 a.m. About one-third of its employees are hired from within the county. But the relationship with residents has broken down, activists say, as conditions inside and outside the store deteriorated. Shopping carts from Walmart have been found strewn across neighborhood streets. Cars have been stolen from the parking lot. And worst of all, residents say, businesses closed instead of opened. The primary grocer, Safeway, shut its doors a few years after Walmart arrived. [Wonkblog: The ‘Wal-Mart’ effect — how it squeezes workers] “Walmart has been a huge disappointment to the community,” said activist Denise Hamler, who leads the Community Standards Coalition organization that devised the nine-point agreement in 2006 and was among the activists who attended a hearing Monday before the Prince George’s County Council. “We were promised that once built, they could attract other retailers,” Hamler said. “That failed to happen.” Council member Dannielle Glaros (D-Riverdale Park), whose district includes the Walmart, requested that the full council examine the county planning board’s tentative approval of the store expansion, which opponents say is large enough to have warranted a more thorough review process. The council has scheduled a vote for next Monday on whether to reverse or uphold the expansion plan. Glaros said she will make her position known at or before that meeting; usually in land-use cases, the council supports the recommendation of the lawmaker who represents the area. Walmart spokesman Phillip Keene said the company has kept its promises to the community and can address the loss of Safeway through the expansion. “For years, our Capital Plaza customers have been asking that we offer them a full assortment of groceries,” Keene said in a statement. “The proposed expansion of our store is designed to do just that.” [When Walmart moves in, local businesses suffer. Right?] Randall Levitt, president of the Nellis Corp., which manages the property, said the 2008 recession slowed efforts to fill storefronts in the complex. He said interest from retailers has increased, in part because of Walmart’s proposed expansion. Plans to bring Pollo Campero, a rotisserie chicken fast-food restaurant, and Royal Farms, a gas station and convenience store, are underway. “There have not been any promises broken,” Levitt said. “But the outcomes have not been as quick as I might’ve hoped.” Cheverly Mayor Mike Callahan testified that his residents are not opposed to the expansion because they think it might yield the economic development results they have long desired. “If you want to see development at this site, and every one does, the question then becomes, ‘Does the expansion help accomplish that or does it hurt that development?’ ” Callahan said in an interview. “This Walmart exists, it’s in our community. It is not going away and it’s important that it be improved.” But other Prince George’s residents said they were so frustrated by conditions inside and outside the store that they no longer could trust the retailer. “I feel like I’m being victimized by a slumlord,” resident Richard Bailey said. “There is absolutely no reason why that site can’t look better.” Another resident, Delvin Champagne, said he would support expansion “if it was tied to a broader plan for development for that shopping center.” Council members and attorneys on Monday debated whether the project should have gone through a more extensive approval process because of its potential adverse impact on surrounding neighborhoods. Typically, projects of this size would undergo a special exception — a deeper review that invites more community input before approval. local md-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - Walmart told 41 Action News it plans to add private security to patrol the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter where a shooting occurred Sunday by end of the month. According to a company spokesperson, it's been in the works for months. Sunday's shooting was a gruesome sight that Wendy Macrorie said she's never seen. A good Samaritan shot and killed a man after the man allegedly attacked a woman with a child. Walmart employees alerted customers. "One of the workers over the intercom said you have to wait here for five more minutes...cause they were just barricading the doors," Macrorie said. The particular store on Maurer Road is no stranger to Shawnee police. 41 Action News obtained the Shawnee Police Department's list of addresses where officers respond the most. As for businesses in Shawnee, this Walmart ranks first on the list for three years in a row. In 2014, officers were called to the Supercenter 215 times. The following year police responded 277 times. And as of last month, cops have shown up 152 times so far this year. "When people need help they call the police and we feel like we should respond," Major Dan Tennis, a spokesperson with the Shawnee Police Department, said. During a recent Walmart grand re-opening in Kansas City, the company touted its security. "I think in any retail situation you see representation of our great police forces," Josh Williams, the Walmart store director, said. “We certainly want to make sure we always create and do everything we do to create a safe shopping experience for all of our customers." Major Tennis said the retail giant and his department keep an open dialogue about the high number of calls. "When you have an area that draws in a lot of folks from a lot of different areas you're going to have police calls and that's why we're here," Major Tennis said. Walmart spokesperson Brian Nick sent 41 Action News the following statement: “In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer’s and associate’s expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience. The importance of this issue is recognized at the highest levels of the company and we are investing in people and technology to support our stores. We are clear that no level of violence is acceptable in our stores and will continue to make this a key priority.” ------   Andres Gutierrez can be reached at andres.gutierrez@kshb.com Follow him on Twitter:  Follow @AFGutierrez Connect on Facebook:   Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

CDT September 12, 2016 Isaac Rousso (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Treats) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PLANO -- A well-known face from the Big Tex Choice Award at the State Fair of Texas is making a move to bring his fried foods to customers all year long. Isaac Rousso plants to open State Fair Treats inside the Walmart located at Coit Road and Highway 190 later this September. The restaurant will feature a 45-item menu “celebrating the treats families enjoy every year when they make an annual pilgrimage to the fair,” according to a news release. It’s just the first of a big rollout for State Fair Treats. More North Texas locations are planned to open in Walmart locations in the coming year, and there are plans on the horizon to open locations nationwide, though no sites were specified. A photo of Isaac Rousso from an appearance on WFAA's Good Morning Texas.   (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Foods) Rousso’s Cookie Fries were named the Most Creative treat in this year’s Big Tex Choice Award, and he’s also won in the past with his Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart. Russo also plans for seasonal menu items to be available throughout the year. Russo, a Dallas native, says Walmart reached out to him during the 2015 State Fair of Texas with the idea for the restaurant. “Walmart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high profile locations,” Rousso said. “During the State Fair of Texas, we have the opportunity to serve more than 2 million people during the fair’s 24-day run. At our first Walmart location alone, we’ll have the chance to see 1.5-2 million people per year.” A look at the interior of the first location of State Fair Treats.   (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Treats) Rousso’s family is well-known among fair concessionaires. They began operating a single booth, Taste of Cuba, but now also manage the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and the Craft Beer Terrace. “Isaac and his family embody what the State Fair is all about — families working hard to help other families have a good time during their visit,” said Carey Risinger, senior vice president of food, beverage and retail for the State Fair of Texas. State Fair Treats will begin offering its breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus on Sept. 20 at its first Plano location.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival.

Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Monday raised his rating on Wal-Mart to "outperform" from "market perform," saying it's only one-third of the way through the upgrades to its store experience. Improvements so far have included better training and pay for its workers, resulting in stores being cleaner and more convenient to shop. They also helped the retailer log a 1.6 percent increase in domestic comparable sales in the recently ended quarter. As Wal-Mart invests more of its own dollars so it can lower prices for customers, the retailer should continue grabbing share from dollar stores, grocers and fellow mass merchant Target (TGT). Price cuts are already showing up on Wal-Mart's shelves. A new study by Jefferies found that between June and August, Wal-Mart widened the pricing gap versus Dollar General (DG), Family Dollar (DLTR) and most grocers. Target has responded by lowering its prices on non-grocery items. But Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder, who reiterated his "buy" rating on Wal-Mart, said he expects Wal-Mart to step up its investments in non-grocery pricing during the fall and holiday seasons. "We are seeing Wal-Mart's strategic initiatives beginning to pay off as traffic and basket grew in [the second quarter]," Binder said. Whereas Wal-Mart's traffic rose for the seventh straight quarter, Target welcomed fewer shoppers into its stores for the first time in a year and a half. Traffic also slipped at Dollar General during the quarter. In tandem with its upgrade of Wal-Mart, Cowen's Chen downgraded shares of Target to "market perform" from "outperform." "We believe Target has solid market share in the bigger 'stock-up' trips for customers, but the increasing price competition from Wal-Mart and the convenience of Amazon (AMZN) Prime will make the recent 'fill-in' trip weakness for Target persist," Chen said. He noted that Amazon has been seeing "explosive" growth in several categories, most notably grocery and other consumables. Those account for roughly half of Target's sales. While Target is in the process of reworking its food assortment, including bringing in more organic and local products, Chen expressed concern the retailer is not moving fast enough to roll out changes. Meanwhile, he expects more speed bumps from the rebranding of Target's pharmacies into CVS (CVS) banners. "In our view, Wal-Mart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share versus Amazon ... but Target cannot compete as easily," Chen said.

(NYSE: WMT) continues to invest in its pricing, which is triggering headaches for many of its traditional and non-traditional peers. Daniel Binder, a consumer and retailer analyst at Jefferies, commented in a research note on Monday that his August pricing work shows Wal-Mart has widened the gap with most competitors. Specifically, data gathered in the Charlotte, Houston and Phoenix markets show Wal-Mart's price advantage "widened" against dollar store chains including Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) and Family Dollar. "Given the regional nature of price investment, we may not capture the full impact of what WMT is doing, but recent data shows it continues," Binder wrote. "DG had some price cuts during the observed periods too, but not as significant. Family Dollar has been less aggressive." Related Link: Kroger's Guidance Cut Looks Modest Relative To Peers' Outlooks Binder acknowledged that Wal-Mart benefited in the second quarter from better terms with its vendors, lower transportation costs, lower shrink and lower markdowns. In addition, the analyst "would not be surprised" if the retailing giant details to investors additional cost out initiatives in October during its analyst day to fund additional price investment activities. Binder also noted that within the grocery space, Wal-Mart introduced price cuts in all three of the markets that compare favorably to Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which was flattish. Traditional grocers were mostly flat to slightly up. Finally, within the non-grocery space, Target narrowed the gap to Wal-Mart but Wal-Mart could "step up" with its seasonal business in the fall and holiday season. Shares of Wal-Mart remain Buy rated with an unchanged $86 price target. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Isaac Rousso, who found deep-fried fame through the State Fair of Texas, will open a year-round restaurant next week inside a Plano Wal-mart. Called State Fair Treats, the Plano outpost is expected to open Sept. 20, as the first in a region-wide, then potentially nationwide expansion. The move shows Wal-mart's continued willingness to offer restaurant food beyond McDonald's and Subway, even though some past experiments, such as a deal with Dallas-based Pollo Campero, provided less-than-stellar results. And it gives the Dallas-born entrepreneur a chance to raise his profile beyond the reach of Big Tex. Rousso, who has six full-time, year-round workers, would like to see his restaurant concepts (he has more than one) expand into Wal-marts across the country. That means ramping up the kind of back office bulwark not typically used by the festival set. And while he's not planning a Jed Clampett-style move to Beverly Hills, Rousso knows that his life is about to change. "At the end of the day it's incredible that you have someone like Wal-mart believing in a small entrepreneurial guy and seeing the potential of what we can bring" to the table, he said, as curious shoppers snapped photos of the not-yet-open restaurant in Plano, which takes the place of a McDonald's. "The State Fair of Texas for me has been the greatest blessing that's ever come to my family. And the opportunities that were coming to us because of the State Fair, words can't describe it." Rousso's retro-themed diner, at 425 Coit Rd., Plano, near the President George Bush Turnpike, will feature a 45-item menu "celebrating the treats families enjoy every year when they make an annual pilgrimage to the fair," according to a news release about the project.

The annual event, held ahead of the State Fair of Texas, recognizes the best fried foods entered into consideration for sale at the fair. Rousso and his team won "Most Creative" for their entry.(G.J. McCarthy/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer Rousso, 50, is known to many fair fare aficionados as a regular finalist and winner at the Big Tex Choice Award at the State Fair. This year, Rousso's Cookie Fries were named Most Creative. Past wins include his Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart. He launched a food truck selling the Cuban sandwiches about three years after the item's debut at the fair. He sees that as an item that might do well in a potential Miami Wal-mart location The Plano restaurant will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. serving many fair foods like the cookie fries and funnel cake fries along with corn dogs, deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese and some new creations. He estimates his stores can bring in upwards of $1 million a year. By the end of next year he expects to have up to 15 restaurants open, including a location in Ennis. So far, the expansion is self-funded. Wal-mart is the landlord but not an investor, he said. Rousso serves as the chief executive of the newly formed Nationwide Restaurant Concessions Enterprises, based in Addison. The Plano Wal-mart will be the company's first brick-and-mortar location. Each store will have about a dozen workers. In the corporate office, there's a new head of operations, industry veteran Jacob Hunter. While a plumbing contractor labored mightily to get a sink ready for next week's opening, Rousso sat beneath a wall length mural showing the different iterations of Big Tex over the years. The serial experimenter, who's spent nearly a decade selling a variety of foods, describes the State Fair of Texas as "the heartbeat of everything I do." The 2015 State Fair provided the backdrop for Rousso's first date with Wal-mart executives. The nation's largest retailer had hired a consulting firm to look for new and innovative concepts. Members of that team approached Rousso during the annual food-athon and said Wal-mart wanted to talk. "Wal-mart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high-profile locations," Rousso said. "They loved the idea of finding someone who was able to take an idea and constantly create something fresh and innovative. "They know that every fall, there's going to be something new on that menu," he said. "We're able to change and reinvent ourselves." "During the State Fair of Texas, we have the opportunity to serve more than 2 million people during the fair's 24-day run," he added. He estimates up to 2 million shoppers visit the Plano Wal-mart in a year. And that's one location. Wal-mart was not available to answer detailed questions about the Rousso deal. A spokeswoman said the "vast majority" of the more than 4,600 Wal-mart stores in the U.S. have leased space available. "Often, those spaces are leased to restaurants such as McDonald's, Subway, and other regional franchises," she said. She said most of the leased locations are occupied by national players. Rousso said Wal-mart knows his aim is to take his brand national, within Wal-mart, even if that means some of the big boys go away.  "There are many, many McDonald's that are going to be transitioning out" of Wal-mart stores, he said. "We're going to be looking at every opportunity as they transition out, to jump in." McDonald's could not be reached for comment. Rousso knows that just opening the door at Wal-mart does not guarantee success. Dallas-based Pollo Campero launched a highly publicized campaign to open in Wal-mart stores several years ago. Today most, if not all, of those locations have been replaced by other brands. Rousso thinks the "fun" factor will help his concept flourish. "It's a fun food experience," he said. "We're not just selling another cheeseburger." Also, he noted, up until now, his food has been available largely at festivals. Meaning there's more potential for diners to seek out his stores after the fair ends its run. He also knows that national expansion costs money. He's been in talks with some venture capital firms but has yet to find a love connection. Born in Dallas of Cuban immigrants, Rousso and his family have gone from operating a single booth, Taste of Cuba, at the State Fair to adding the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and most recently the Craft Beer Terrace. (His Magnolia operation is not related to the Magnolia-themed empire of Waco-based Chip and Joanna Gaines.) From the fair, Rousso fielded requests from multiple outdoor festivals in North Texas including Richard's Cottonwood and Taste Addison. "Isaac and his family embody what the State Fair is all about," Carey Risinger, Senior Vice President of Food, Beverage and Retail for the State Fair, said in a statement. "Families working hard to help other families have a good time during their visit." Related article:  Best food at this year's State Fair of Texas?

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.68 -0.51 -0.74% FedEx Corp FDX ▲ 185.78 +0.70 +0.38% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 765.70 +9.30 +1.23% JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▼ 9.34 -0.09 -0.95% He was taping up a package a few months ago to one of the town’s 3,000 residents and noticed it contained a bottle of bleach. “It wasn’t lavender [scented] or anything,” he recalls. “It was just a bottle of plain Clorox.” Until five years ago, Mr. Bledsoe was the bearer of special orders, tractor parts and business deliveries to this area. Now, he delivers dog food, fruit snacks and Kleenex, among other things. His business has increased 30% during the past couple of years, he estimates. “It is getting out of hand,” he said, recently while driving his truck along a highway bordered by cotton fields. “They can find anything online. Literally anything.” E-commerce hasn’t just reached rural America, it is transforming it by providing small-town residents with big-city conveniences and the latest products. Contemporary fashion, such as Victoria Secret bathing suits or Tori Burch ballet flats—items that can’t be found at Dollar General—are easily shipped. Consumers increasingly are shopping online instead of driving, often long distances, to stores. Online shopping also brings with it deals and new entrepreneurial opportunities. These consumers, however, are the most expensive to serve for both retailers and delivery companies. According to Kantar Retail, about 73% of rural consumers—defined as those who drive at least 10 miles for everyday shopping—are now buying online versus 68% two years ago. Last year, 30% were members of Amazon Prime, up from 22% in 2014. Flowers Unlimited and Bratton Drug are about all that is left of a red-brick town square that just a couple of decades ago buzzed with three florists, restaurants and a furniture store. A Wal-Mart built in 1982 in Altus, Okla., about 20 miles away, brought residents choice, convenience and low prices. Now, online shopping is creating another retail revolution here that doesn’t require a half-hour drive to Wal-Mart or roughly 2½-hour drive to Oklahoma City. April Geralds, a security-firm support manager, recently bought her two teenage daughters designer Miss Me jeans for half price on Macys.com. Her family now has access to things “I didn’t ever think we would have,” said the Mangum resident. Residents here are even starting to buy groceries online because frequently it is cheaper than at the town’s United Supermarkets. A can of Bush’s Best Bold and Spicy Baked Beans cost $2.07 on Walmart.com recently, 22% less than at the United in Magnum, where it’s more expensive to transport goods. E-commerce has provided new opportunities for area residents to earn money. In Willow, Okla., Anneliese Rogers, a mother of three, raised $1,500 in one sitting by selling items from her closet on Facebook. Nearby, Kassandra Bruton mails up to 100 packages a week from her clothing store Trailer Trash. While e-commerce is great for rural America, it is expensive for retailers and delivery companies. The longest mail route in the country—a 187.6-mile daily loop for carrier Jim Ed Bull—runs from Mangum. The longer the drive and the fewer the packages per stop—known as delivery density—the lower the profit for the U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx. UPS says one mile a day across its U.S. delivery fleet costs up to $50 million a year. UPS’s Mr. Bledsoe drives 56 miles nearly every day to deliver medicine to one customer—a veterinarian—on his route. To offset the cost, UPS and FedEx charge an extra $4 per package for remote residential deliveries. The prevalence of free shipping to consumers and the need to price items the same online and in stores, typically leaves retailers bearing this additional cost. For retailers, that adds to already steep costs. Shipping a container of Tide Pods laundry detergent from Atlanta to urban Oklahoma City is estimated to cost a retailer $11.44—already more than the approximately $11 price of the item itself, according to an analysis by Spend Management Experts. Shipping the pods to Mangum costs $15.65. It is a double-whammy for retailers, which also are losing in-store customers to e-commerce. Wal-Mart built its business by combining muscular buying power and a vast transportation network to provide a wide variety of items and low prices to small towns like Mangum. About a dozen consumers in Mangum said they shop online to reduce the need for trips to the Wal-Mart in Altus. Angela Monroe, a dental assistant and mother of two, now goes once a week instead of two or three times, and does the rest of her shopping online. Customers also tend to spend more when they shop in stores. The Wal-Mart store in Altus is near an Air Force base and Western Oklahoma State College and gets strong foot traffic, said a Wal-Mart Stores spokesman, though he wouldn’t provide numbers. On a recent weekday, 80 miles away in Lawton, Okla., Central Mall’s food court is busy, but shoppers are scarce. A handful of vacant storefronts promise that shops are “coming soon,” and a J.C. Penney is “closed for renovations.” Greg Maloney, retail CEO at Jones Lang LaSalle, which manages Central Mall, says retailers are opening fewer and smaller stores in rural areas in an effort to find the right balance with online shopping. E-commerce has changed life for Flowers Unlimited, the last remaining Mangum florist and gift shop on the town’s square. While it has lost much of its bridal and baby registry business to online retailers, it has one big advantage: There is still a need for last-minute gifts, says owner Darla Heatly. “They can’t do e-commerce if they don’t plan ahead,” she adds.

 Walmart under fire for 'disgusting' 9/11 tribute Hayley Peterson Sep. 8, 2016, 11:15 AM 53,505 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is under fire for using packages of soda cans as a tribute to 9/11 ahead of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the US.    A Florida Walmart arranged the packages to look like the twin towers, according to a photo tweeted by shopper Shawn Richard on Monday.  "We stopped and stared at it like, oh my god," Richard told BuzzFeed News, which first reported on the display. "Nobody seemed to be noticing it, it wasn’t very crowded, and I got the feeling that it had just been assembled. So we took some pics and went on our way." Florida c'mon man pic.twitter.com/HU4y2rxgFG — Shawn (@online_shawn) September 6, 2016 A printed sign hung above the display advertising Walmart's rollback prices for the soft drinks. Another sign hanging above the display read "We will never forget" with a photo of the twin towers and the logos for Walmart and Coca-Cola.  All of the sodas that were part of the display were Coca-Cola products. Walmart told Business Insider that the display was removed Wednesday afternoon. Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The display was criticized on Twitter as insensitive and exploitive.  @online_shawn @Walmart Walmart, this is disgusting and unacceptable.

The attack started as a flash-in-the-pan road rage incident about 5:45 p.m. Saturday in the West Lafayette Wal-Mart parking lot in Indiana and ended in the his driveway, where a man punched and kicked the professor while the woman yelled from the driver's seat, “Kill him! Kill him!" “They chased me until my driveway,” said the victim, who asked that his identity be kept private, “and they attempted to kill me on my driveway.” On Saturday, police arrested 21-year-old Austin Bradley Gregory on preliminary charges of misdemeanor battery. He was released Sunday morning after posting a $250 bond. The woman, who the Journal & Courier will not identify unless she is charged with a crime, went free, according to court documents. The professor, however, compares her culpability to that of a person who drives the getaway car for a bank robbery. In a brief interview with the Journal & Courier on Wednesday, Gregory said the professor walked up to the car he was in and reached inside. Gregory said he was protecting his family and that's when the fight started. But two witnesses cited in the probable cause affidavit said the professor never made it to the car before Gregory punched him. A third witness said the professor reached inside the car but did not know if that was before or after Gregory punched him, according to court documents. The attacks have caused the victim to reconsider his employment in the United States. He fears for the safety of his wife, his children and himself. Whether he remains here after the school year will depend on whether Gregory and the woman are formally charged. “I will not stay here if I don’t see justice,” he said. “This country is not safe. There is no justice now.” The victim shared his experience with a Muslim friend, who reported it to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization for Muslims. That organization on Wednesday called for the woman’s arrest. The council also called for Indiana to adopt hate laws that enhance sentences for crimes that target victims based on their religion, race or sexual orientation. The victim, who did not want the council contacted, does not want hate laws pushed here. “I don’t want to take it to the political side,” the professor said (Votes: 0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

More recently, Walmart acquired e-commerce innovator Jet.com in a deal valued at $3.3 billion that also gives it the ability to reach more customers in new ways. Prior to these deals, Walmart had acquired more than a dozen smaller companies in Silicon Valley to gain talent and technology.   Acquisitions in the digital world garner lots of attention, but the story of how Walmart positioned its U.S. business for renewed growth in sales and customer traffic is not easily condensed to a headline. It begins with a simple philosophy.   "We want to be the very first place customers think of when they want to save money and time," says Walmart U.S. President and CEO Greg Foran. "We've got a plan to win and it is pretty simple: win with stores, makes sure that we deliver value, make sure we are great merchants and make sure we provide convenience."   If that sounds like a simplistic plan, it's because Foran is a believer in simplicity and an adherent to Walmart's long-standing approach to retail and putting employees in stores in a position to win.   "The plan is built on a pretty simple principle I refer to internally as the Walmart wheel. We drive sales, we buy better, we take those savings and we lower our prices, we leverage our costs and we sell more units," Foran said recently during a rare public speaking appearance at the Grocery Manufacturers Association's Executive Forum To read the full story click here.

(Photo: Lou Whitmire/News Journal)Buy Photo 27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE MANSFIELD -  Ginger Antrican of the Mansfield Police Athletic League is always glad to lend a hand at the annual Kops N Kids event held at Walmart on O'Possum Run Road. Sunday she helped Hester Lacy select clothing for two of her grandchildren, Kayelynn Sapp, 3, and Raven Sapp, 10. The 54-year-old Shelby grandmother thanked Antrican for her help as she is battling colon cancer and raising the two youngsters. Smiling at her busy granddaughter, Lacy said, "She's the only thing that keeps me going." Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 32 raised money through phone solicitations and teamed with Richland County Children's Auxiliary to select disadvantaged kids. The auxiliary also operates The New Store. Mike Bammann, the president of the FOP, said Sunday morning's 20th annual Kops N Kids event was in partnership with the auxiliary and Walmart on Possum Run Road, which hosted the event. A long line formed outside the garden center prior to the start of the event. Children served were part of the Kinship program where grandparents or other relatives are raising their relatives' children. "Police really do care about their community and the people they serve," said Bammann, a retired Mansfield police sergeant. "It's a way for us to give back to the community." Bammann said the FOP would also be donating money later to The New Store to help them purchase clothing for children. On Sunday, the kids got vouchers depending on their age and they were able to select what they wanted. Walmart allowed the items to be tax-exempt. Volunteers from area law enforcement, high schools and churches went shopping with each child. Exactly 108 children were served Sunday, Bammann said. Mansfield Explorers Post 4751 members including area high school seniors Wanda Searles, 17, and Crystal Phelps, 17, were also helping teens with their shopping needs. Both young women plan to make their careers in law enforcement.

Williams is a big OSU and Steelers fan.  (Photo: Lou Whitmire/News Journal) They were busy helping their kids shop and helping them maneuver through the packed clothes department. Mansfielder Luvenia Reed, a grandmother of four, was bustling about with her grandkids, assisted by Mansfield St. Peter's first-grade teacher Sue Scheurer and her husband, Mansfield police Detective Dave Scheurer. Raising the grandchildren since 2006, Reed said she just turned 63 Saturday. But you couldn't tell her age as she buzzed in and out of the aisles checking on the grandkids who went their separate ways, being old enough to shop on their own. "This helps me a lot," she said. "You have no idea." The youngest, Amarion Williams, 10, was happy to have found an Ohio State shirt. He is a big fan and also is a Steelers fan, as Dave Scheurer joked with him that he should get a Cleveland Browns shirt. "No way," Amarion said, laughing. His sisters, NyKeia Williams, 12, Alexis Douglas, 16, and Tnaya Douglas, 14, were keeping their grandmother busy as she made sure they purchased the right sizes. Elsewhere, Mansfield police Officer Orlando Chatman made sure Eli Massey was finding what he needed. "I've been shopping with the kids now eight or nine years," the calm officer said, pushing the cart and talking with Massey. Retired Mansfield police Capt. Tobie Smith said retired or not, she loves the event and the kids so she plans to keep volunteering each year. She and Darian Curry, 12, of Shelby, were searching for a gray OSU shirt and finally found the right size. They headed to the shoe department to find his younger siblings, brother Marcus Curry and sister Danel Curry, with their grandmother. "We're all finished," said Smith, who shops at the store and knew the layout of the childrens' clothing aisles by memory. The event was joyful for so many children as local heroes came together to help others on a day in history marred by tragedy, the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the nation. lwhitmir@nncogannett.com 419-521-7223 Twitter: @LWhitmir 27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2cQXJX1 TOP VIDEOS 'Script' Ohio 0:45 OSU cornerback Marshon Lattimore 0:27 Saturday is "payday" for Buckeyes 0:33 OSU offensive coordinator Ed Warinner 0:33 What changed for OSU? 0:20 Lexington at Clyde football 3:11 Lexington wins 0:14 Sleep-Out for the Homeless fundraiser 1:24 Big catch for Buckeyes 0:31 Every week's a dogfight 0:21 Is Samuel being used right? 0:20 Defending his offense 1:10 Halloween parade 0:42 Road to Wrestling: The Tryout 3:35 MANCI Cattle Auction 2:52 Road to Wrestling: Day 40 0:47 Mansfield police mentoring kids at Friendly House 2:25 Make A Difference Day Food Drive 2:49 Butler Apple Festival 2:12 Lillith recovering from being shot 1:52 OSU's Raekwon McMillan 0:38 OSU's Parris Campbell 0:19 Ohio State DB Marshon Lattimore 0:17 Big Guns 20: William vs. Odom 0:53 Big Guns 20: White vs. Johnson 0:30 Big Guns 20: Cody Stevens vs. John De Jesus Highlights 2:59 Road to Wrestling: Day 27 3:25 So much depth at OSU 0:19 Buckeyes act like underdogs 0:23 OSU: competition at WR 0:31 Final Horn Week 6 6:49 Lt.

Shoppers can use a mobile app to place their orders. Kroger ClickList selector Debra Cross, from left, and e-commerce manager Corey Thurmond deliver an online grocery order to Evans resident Jennifer Speer and her son Brayden at the new Grovetown Kroger store Thursday morning. Kroger e-commerce manager Corey Thurmond hands 8-year-old Brayden Speer a ballon while he and ClickList selector Debra Cross deliver his mother Jennifer's groceries Thursday morning at the new Grovetown Kroger store. Kroger e-commerce division field specialist Shelia Brick, left, and Grovetown e-commerce manager, Corey Thurmond, check on refrigerated items awaiting delivery to ClickList online grocery customers Thursday. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart's regional e-commerce market coach, shows the area of the parking lot designated for online order pickup at the Evans Wal-Mart Supercenter.   Pushing around a grocery cart with her 8-year-old son in tow was not something Jennifer Speer wanted to do Thursday morning. Thanks to Kroger’s new online grocery ordering service, ClickList, she didn’t have to. Employees at the new Kroger Mar­ket­place in Grovetown had Speer’s shopping list checked off and loaded into her SUV without her or son Brayden ever leaving their seats. “This really made my day because I’ve been sick all week,” said Speer, who heard about ClickList from mothers in her home-schooling network. “I’m just now starting to recover, so it was nice to just pull up and have everything ready.” The Cincinnati-based chain isn’t the only supermarket offering online ordering in the Augusta market. This past week, Wal-Mart brought its online grocery service to two of its area stores: the Evans Supercenter on Washington Road and the Hephzibah Neigh­bor­hood Market on Windsor Spring Road. Robbie Hendry, Wal-Mart’s regional e-commerce market coach, said local customer feedback has so far been in the 90 percent positive range. “Obviously, we want to be 100 percent every single time,” Hendry said. Though e-commerce is in its second decade, using computers or smartphones to buy groceries is a fairly recent phenomenon outside America’s largest cities, where internet giants such as Amazon and Google have been busy expanding their AmazonFresh and Google Express grocery delivery services. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s curbside pickup services are more closely aligned with what analysts call the “click-and-collect” model – also called “BOPUS” for buy-online-pick-up-in-store. Non-grocery brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Best Buy and The Home Depot, have been doing it for years as more shoppers embrace e-commerce. More than one third of shoppers made click-and-collect purchases during the 2015 holiday season, according to an International Coun­cil of Shopping Centers’ consumer purchasing trends survey. Market research firm IBISWorld projects online grocery shopping sales will increase 9.5 percent to $9.4 billion in 2017. Kroger and Wal-Mart’s online grocery programs were launched in select markets starting in 2014, and the two operate in a similar manner. Shoppers fill their virtual carts by choosing from tens of thousands of items – including fresh meats, dairy and produce – found on the stores’ websites and smartphone apps. Shoppers then select a store location and pickup time, along with any special requests. “They can tell us whether they want ripe avocados or green bananas,” said Sheila Brick, Kroger’s e-commerce field specialist for the Atlanta division. “They can tell us how thick they want their steaks cut.” Specially trained employees handpick the items and store them in a special staging area with refrigerators and freezers until the customer arrives, pulling into one of the specially marked pick-up lanes and signaling their arrival via cellphone. Items are then brought to the customer’s car and the order is completed when the customer signs off on the charges on a handheld device. All items ordered online are priced the same as they are in the store. Kroger, however, charges a $4.95 convenience fee that is waived for the first three orders. Wal-Mart has no fee but requires a $30 minimum on online orders. Hendry points out that Geor­gia state law prohibits “curbside” alcohol delivery, and that Wal-Mart doesn’t allow apparel purchases through the online grocery. “Everything else – dog food, health and beauty supplies, electronics – all the good stuff in here can be delivered right to your car,” he said. The target online grocery shoppers are convenience-seeking moms with toddlers and young children. But the store employees say the service also appeals to dads who aren’t adept at grocery shopping, along with the elderly, the infirm and people who simply don’t like going shopping. Parents are finding out it is also a good way to purchase grocery items for their college-age children, Hendry said. “This is better than just handing them a twenty,” he said. “This way you know they’ll actually get groceries instead of just beer.” Wal-Mart and Kroger, the No. 1 and 2 grocers in the Augusta market according to Chain Store Guide, are so far the only traditional grocery chains to offer local online ordering. Warehouse membership stores, such as Sam’s Club and Costco, have online ordering options but no pure “click-and-collect” service. Whole Foods Market has a partnership with grocery delivery company Instacart, but there is no timeline for when the service will be available in Augusta, Whole Foods’ Atlanta spokeswoman Lauren Bernath said. Food Lion spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said the company is “currently exploring a number of options for both in-store grocery pick-up and home delivery” but has no timetable for service in Augusta. The Salisbury, N.C.-based retailer offers Instacart service in select ZIP codes in Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C. Discount grocer Aldi has an online presence and mobile apps, but no plans to take online orders at any of its locations. Southeastern Grocers, owner of the Bi-Lo chain, said in a statement that it is always looking for ways to improve customer service. “We’re always listening to our customers and looking into new ways to offer both convenience and value for an enjoyable shopping experience,” said Joe Caldwell, the corporate communications manager for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based chain. “As new technology and services constantly develop, we carefully evaluate each opportunity for our network of stores. We will certainly update our customers if we unveil any new services.” Lakeland, Fla.-based Publix Super Markets Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.

According to Bloomberg, it was roughly a month ago that Target announced they would be pulling Welspun’s line of premium Egyptian cotton bed sheets from their shelves and giving customers who purchased the sheets a refund. Walmart has recently made the decision to join Target in both pulling the product and offering the refunds. A spokesperson from Walmart claims the customers of the retailer trust the company to provide products as promised by the labels printed on them. When Welspun, the manufacturer of the bed sheets, was unable to assure Walmart – or Target – that the sheets were actually 100 percent Egyptian content, as described by the label, both companies made the decision to pull the products and offer the refund. “Welspun has not been able to assure us the products are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, which is unacceptable. While the sheets are excellent quality, we are offering our customers a full refund.” Any Walmart customer who would like a refund can bring their bed sheets back to any Walmart location and receive a refund. Walmart has also pulled all of the unsold Welspun products from the shelves with the intention of giving them to Good360. Good360 is an organization that donates all companies’ extra merchandise to a number of different charities. [Image via ShutterStock] Business Insider reports that Bed Bath & Beyond and J.C. Penny are also looking into how credible the Welspun Egyptian cotton products on their shelves currently are. Business Insider goes on to speculate that the latest Welspun scandal involving Egyptian cotton bed sheets only supports the theory that a very large percentage of the 100 percent Egyptian cotton products sold in the United States are actually cheap knock offs. While, technically, high-quality cotton can be grown in just about any part of the world – the cotton has to be grown in Egypt in order for it to be considered 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Cotton grown anywhere else in the world is not authentic, regardless of how great the quality may or may not be. [Image via ShutterStock] “When you think about it, 1 percent of the world’s crops are Egyptian cotton. You walk into any store, or look at any one of these websites and see they’re all selling Egyptian cotton — it just doesn’t add up,” Scott Tannen, founder of luxury bedding startup Boll and Branch said. He went on to say he believes the case Target and Walmart have against Welspun for not selling authentic products is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the bed sheet industry. While there is certainly no question that Tannen is interested in exposing all of the fake Egyptian cotton manufacturers, he is certainly not the only one who is suspicious of this particular industry. In fact, the Cotton Egypt Association conducted a study on Egyptian cotton sold by retailers in the United States. Using a DNA-based authentication program, the study determined 90 percent of the products did not contain any cotton produced in Egypt at all. At the time, this was an association that had supported Welspun as a symbol of success in the Egypt cotton industry. Naturally, this is something that has been called into question given the current situation with Target, Walmart, and a number of other industries. #EgyptianCotton Are we to believe that someone at $TGT $JCP $WMT wasn't aware all along? #Wellspun https://t.co/FThh8bbu9f — Maglan Capital (@MaglanCapital) August 25, 2016 Do you think it is fair that – right now – the only stipulation is that the retailers are giving refunds and pulling the products off the shelves? Should Welspun be held responsible in some way for attempting to trick customers into purchasing sheets that were not really 100 percent Egyptian cotton?

Whether shopping online or in your local brick and mortar store, you’ll find plenty of sales and deals to help save money. Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy are just a few retailers kicking off the new season by slashing prices. You’ll find savings for upcoming holidays such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, fall decor and home interiors, clothes, and accessories as well as end-of-summer clearance deals. Additionally, Best Buy will sell the new iPhone 7 beginning Sept. 16, and it’s now available for pre-order. Here’s a roundup of the best fall sales to get you started. Fall means back-to-school and Amazon has sales running to help children and adults of all levels have a smooth transition this school year. The main back-to-school sale is geared towards parents and their elementary age children. The sale features deals on grocery items, uniforms, school supplies, and much more. The back-to-school sale runs until Sept. 26. In addition to the main back-to-school event, Amazon is running deals for college students. This sale also expires on Sept. 26. Amazon has stocked their Halloween store with costumes, supplies, candy, and decorations. Some of the top Halloween costumes for 2016 include Avengers, characters from Finding Dory, Joker and Harley Quinn, Star Wars characters, LEGO, and comic book heroes. Many are shopping early for Halloween costumes to ensure they get a great deal before they sell out. Amazon holds sales every day including daily deals, goldbox deals, and lightning sales. These sales are often time sensitive and run out quickly. Many lightning deals will continue to sell at a lower price after the end of the deal. If you miss a lightning deal, don’t give up. Typically, you can still save on the item price. The best daily deals are those that are marked down 70 percent and more. #GrandparentsDay is 9/11 Save 15% on #Flowers & #Gifts Use code GRNDPRNT15 #sales #deals https://t.co/lIjySgHkt6 pic.twitter.com/F0PyyFlU6j — Holiday Helper (@HolidayHelperUS) September 10, 2016 Wal-Mart was recently under fire for a Florida store’s promotion of a sale using the Twin Towers and 9/11 as a marketing ploy. Some found the display so despicable, they’ve vowed to boycott Wal-mart. Others consider it a tasteless mistake. Wal-Mart has a number of fall sales going on that have nothing to do with the September 11 terrorist attacks. Are you protesting Wal-Mart for their display? Wow @Walmart with them 9/11 sales pic.twitter.com/6awuNPyexn — KEEM ???? (@KEEMSTAR) September 9, 2016 Wal-Mart’s fall sales include deals on the Pioneer Woman line, Halloween, home improvement tools and supplies, and baby deals.

Wal-Mart’s shipping options provide advantages for busy shoppers. Check on site to see what type of shipping deals are offered. Best Buy is another store currently running a huge fall sale. While many look forward to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus release, there are additional sales right now. It’s NFL season and everyone will be watching the game on big-screen TVs. Best Buy has a sale on televisions under 50 inches. There’s also an appliance sale with up to 35 percent off major appliances Target is also running several fall sales. Now that Labor Day is over, Target has a clearance sale where they’ve marked down many items to discount prices.

(Amanda Yeager / BSMG) Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh talks about a $200,000 grant awarded to the Anne Arundel Workforce Development Corporation that is aimed at attracting and retaining retail workers. (Amanda Yeager / BSMG) Amanda YeagerContact Reporterayeager@capgaznews.com New grant aims to convince Anne Arundel County workers that retail jobs aren't "dead end" jobs Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation has been awarded $200,000 as part of a nationwide initiative focused on attracting and retaining retail industry employees. County Executive Steve Schuh and AAWDC President and CEO Kirkland Murray announced the two-year grant Monday at Arundel Mills mall in Hanover. The corporation — a nonprofit that provides job training services to county residents and hiring advice to local businesses — was one of 10 organizations across the country to receive the money, which is part of a $10.9 million grant funded by the Walmart Foundation. Murray said the corporation will use grant money to educate people about job opportunities in retail, to ensure prospective workers have the skills employers are looking for and to give current retail employees the training they need to move up the career ladder. AAWDC will soon launch a marketing campaign highlighting retail opportunities. "The ultimate goal here is to see people stay in retail and help people look at retail as a viable career path," Murray said. Anne Arundel's retail sector encompasses 34,172 employees working for 1,969 businesses, according to statistics from AAWDC. The industry is expected to grow by about 1,000 jobs between now and 2020. Grant recipient By Amanda Yeager, Staff Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation is the recipient of a $200,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation is the recipient of a $200,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. (By Amanda Yeager, Staff) Nationally, retail supports one in four American jobs and has a $2.6 trillion impact on the gross domestic product, per the National Retail Federation, an industry group. While possibilities for career advancement are available, retailers say they can't always find employees with the skills to take on higher-level positions, according to a presentation from the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, the organization managing the retail grant initiative for Walmart. A number of factors can make retail appear undesirable to prospective employees, according to the presentation, including low starting wages, a lack of clear opportunities for growth, jobs that hire only seasonal or temporary workers and the perception that retail jobs are "dead end" positions.

The grant is aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. (By Amanda Yeager, Staff) "A lot of people start in retail but do not finish in it — it's a high school job, it's a right-out-of-college job," Murray said. "Employers are saying the main thing that they want are people that have customer service skills, people that have an outgoing personality and people that can do math. So we want to make sure we're giving people those skills." Results from the initiative will contribute to a collection of "best practices" that other workforce development organizations can replicate, said Walmart market manager Charita Mariner. She said the retail and grocery mega-chain and its charitable arm, the Walmart Foundation, have committed to investing $100 million in economic mobility over the course of five years. Schuh called the grant a "great example of the public sector working in partnership with the private sector to solve a problem and to advance our economy, and to help people." "The work that we're conducting here as part of this program is going to be a national model for the entire country about how to help people get the skills they need and to integrate back into the workforce," he said.

Walmart Will Add A State Fair-Themed Restaurant To Texas Store Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Will Add A State Fair-Themed Restaurant To Texas Store Image courtesy of Robert Hensley September 12, 2016 5:16 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup food terrible food food glorious food FOOD FRIED FOOD fried food STATE FAIR OF TEXAS STATE FAIR TREATS Do you like state fair food? You know, the deep-fried creations made from food that should never have been fried, like deep-fried butter, spaghetti ice cream, or a deep-fried burger with grilled cheese sandwiches for buns? Soon you’ll only have your conscience to keep you from eating that stuff year-round, as Walmart tests a possible nationwide concept with the State Fair Cafe at its store in Plano, TX. Yes, you might even be able to get deep-fried Twinkies in the off-season somewhere other than the freezer aisle at Walmart. The restaurant concept comes from Isaac Rousso, an award-winning food experimenter at the state fair in Texas. He and his family run multiple food stands at the fair, and this year he won a prize for his booth’s cookie fries, which are apparently a thing. The restaurant where it will be the state fair year-round will open in a Walmart store in Plano, TX next week. Walmart has ambitions to take the idea regional and maybe even national: is there anywhere in the country where people don’t like fair food? Part of the appeal of eating ridiculous food at a fair is the fair itself: you know that you can’t eat the ridiculous food items every day because you don’t have access to them. What happens if the chain’s plans to take this idea nationwide really happen, and you do have access to them daily?

(Photo: Mike Mozart/flickr/cc) Corporations are running the world, according to new figures released Monday from the U.K.-based Global Justice Now. "As multinationals increasingly dominate areas traditionally considered the primary domain of the state, we should be afraid." —Aisha Dodwell, Global Justice Now The economic and social justice advocacy group discovered (spreadsheet) that the ten largest corporations are wealthier than most countries in the world combined. "Today, of the 100 wealthiest economic entities in the world, 69 are now corporations and only 31 countries," wrote Global Justice Now campaigns and policy officer Aisha Dodwell. "This is up from 63 to 37 a year ago. At this rate, within a generation we will be living in a world entirely dominated by giant corporations." Indeed, multinational behemoths Shell, Apple, and Walmart each rake in more revenue than the world's 180 "poorest" countries—a list that includes Ireland, Greece, Israel, South Africa, Vietnam, and Colombia—combined. And the top ten largest companies have a whopping combined value of $2.9 trillion, which is larger than China's economy. "The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet." —Nick Dearden, Global Justice Now Walmart, the biggest corporate entity in the world, is valued at over $482 billion, which makes it wealthier than Spain, Australia, and the Netherlands, individually. "The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world's problems—like inequality and climate change," said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. "The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse." "As multinationals increasingly dominate areas traditionally considered the primary domain of the state, we should be afraid," Dodwell continued: While they privatize everything from education and health to border controls and prisons, they stash their profits away in secret offshore accounts. And while they have unrivaled access to decision makers they avoid democratic processes by setting up secret courts enabling them to bypass all judicial systems applicable to people. Meanwhile their raison d'etre of perpetual growth in a finite world is causing environmental destruction and driving climate change. From Sports Direct's slave-like working conditions to BP's oil spill devastating people’s homes, stories of corporations violating rights are all too often seen in our daily papers.     Global Justice Now noted that it "released the figures in order to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, established to draw up a binding treaty to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities. Campaigners are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level." "Britain doesn’t support the process, and has repeatedly vetoed and opposed such proposal in the past," the group added. "The U.K. government has facilitated this rise in corporate power," Dearden said, "through tax structures, trade deals, and even aid programs that help big business. Their wholehearted support for the U.S.-EU trade deal TTIP is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN." "We must fight back." —Aisha DodwellAlongside the latest figures demonstrating the extent to which corporations dominate the world, Global Justice Now released a petition calling on the British government to support a binding UN treaty that would force corporations to respect human rights around the world. The treaty will be delivered to U.K. and European Union leaders in Geneva on October 12, the group says. "Of course, the battle against corporate power has many fronts and the UN treaty is only one part of it," Dodwell observed. "At the same time, we need to continue to develop alternative ways to produce and distribute the goods and services we need. We need to undermine the notion that only massive corporations can make the economy and society 'work.'" "The alternative is that we continue to rush towards the dystopian vision of unchallenged corporate power," Dodwell wrote. "We cannot allow this to happen. We must fight back."

It found 73 percent of marketers use inbound marketing as their primary strategy. HubSpot surveyed 4,500 global marketers and salespeople from 132 countries. While it didn't specifically ask its customers to identify themselves, a HubSpot spokesperson said it's “safe to assume some that a portion of the respondents are HubSpot customers.” HubSpot is, as you might expect from the products it offers, pretty enthusiastic about inbound marketing. Some call the company's founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, the pioneers of inbound marketing. And HubSpot's Inbound conference is massive, drawing 14,000 to Boston last year with more expected at next conference this November.   Inbound All the Way? But is inbound all the rage like the HubSpot report says it is? The key to understanding this statistic is in the size of the organizations that responded to HubSpot’s survey, according to Jake DiMare, director of marketing for New York City-based advisory firm Digital Clarity Group and a CMSWire Reader Advisory Board member.  About 45 percent of the respondents have 10 or less employees. Only 8 percent were larger than 1,000 employees and only 3 percent are billion-dollar-plus earners.  “If you asked senior marketers at consumer brands in the Fortune 500 their response would be, 'Sure, inbound has a role, but it’s obvious where our marketing spend is going,'" DiMare said. Walmart, currently No. 1 on the Fortune 500, spent $2.09 billion on advertising alone in 2015. "On the other hand," DiMare said, "if Walmart has an inbound strategy, it’s invisible." DiMare said larger enterprises spend more on things like advertising, channel partnerships and product placement. Smart, Creative Marketers Win HubSpot CMO Kipp Bodnar maintains inbound marketing can work for any organization, although he conceded "it is especially attractive to smaller companies, with smaller budgets, that are looking to make and impact and compete against larger competitors with more money.”  “One of the beautiful things about inbound is that it isn't about how much money you spend on marketing, it's about how smart and creative you are in the content that you create and how effectively you provide value to your customers,” he added. Bodnar defined inbound marketing as the “full process of taking potential customers, turning them into visitors to your site, then leads, prospects and ultimately happy customers.” Cold calls, email batch-and-blasts banner ads and pop-up ads represent the outbound side of the marketing aisle. “Content marketing is a piece of the larger inbound marketing puzzle,” he told CMSWire. “but it's not the whole thing. "Content is a key part of the process but it works along side social media, search engine optimization, email marketing and other inbound channels. Sure content is a part of each of these but so is the campaign and distribution elements to make sure that the content is seen by your target audience.” HubSpot report authors go on to boast about particular findings in today's report, citing the 81 percent of inbound organizations feel that their marketing strategy is effective, making inbound organizations four times as likely to rate their marketing strategy highly, compared to outbound organizations. [Updated for 2016] How to: Land a Speaking Gig at the Event of Your Dreams https://t.co/FFthgvOzYV #INBOUND16 pic.twitter.com/ATlBgvpoNs — INBOUND (@INBOUND) April 26, 2016 HubSpot Uses Broad Definition of Inbound The large number of marketers classifying inbound as their primary strategy in this year’s HubSpot report may have to do with the term itself being “very broad,” according to Benjamin Smidt, founder of Focused Excellence and a digital marketing specialist. “Inbound, as defined by HubSpot, is very broad,” Smidt told CMSWire. “This could in part be why 73 percent are claiming to be leveraging inbound marketing. The definition of inbound has evolved over time and as a result the value placed on that term, in my opinion, has degraded. According to HubSpot, inbound now appears to focus most strongly on brand loyalty, which can be difficult to convert into sales and as a result may be why we see some mixed data responses in the report.”  Claiming nearly three out of four marketers are leveraging inbound marketing illustrates potential market saturation and that inbound has become a global trend, Smidt said. “I don’t disagree with this conclusion,” he said, “however I believe inbound needs to be defined more granular to truly understand what is working for these surveyed marketers who claim to be utilizing these techniques within the report.” Leads, Conversions Still Rule Call it inbound or outbound, marketing is still marketing, and marketers want quality leads that convert into customers who buy things from their organizations. Marketers reported in this year’s survey they still see quality leads that convert to customers as the top priority as they did in the last three reports. “Converting contacts/leads to customers” ranked No. 1 this year, ahead of “grow traffic to website," “increasing revenue derived from existing customers” and “proving the ROI of our marketing activities.” Increasing and converting leads ranked in the top two in the last three HubSpot reports, outside of 2013, when “reaching relevant audience” snuck in as the No. 1 priority. Asked what he sees in terms of marketers priorities, DiMare called growth, conversion and revenue “table stakes.”  “I spent three days with senior marketers from some of the largest, most recognized brands in the world at CMO Digital US in San Diego last week,” DiMare told CMSWire. “Most of the conversations we had were about mobile, proximity marketing, experiential and wrestling with big data.” What’s Behind Priorities? It’s not always true that converting leads should be a marketers’ top priority. Ann Breckenkamp, vice president of marketing and operations at San Francisco-based Giftly and a CMSWire Reader Advisory Board member, said the survey respondents seem to hail from businesses at different stages of maturity with different types of products or services.   “It's hard for me to say that ‘converting contacts/leads into customers’ or ‘growing traffic to website’ is where priorities should or shouldn't be without knowing more about a specific organization's operation,” Breckenkamp said. “For example, these are not things you would want to prioritize just yet if you have a retention problem or if you aren't able to measure the impact of your sales/marketing activities.” Inbound, she added, can be a “very effective strategy.”  “But,” she added, “unless you're able to quantitatively measure conversion associated with each of your inbound marketing activities, you could be wasting a lot of resources without realizing it.” Marketers’ priorities have shifted as a consequence of the effectiveness of previous years’ strategies, according to Courtney Beasley, director of marketing at Chicago-based public relations firm Walker Sands. “Instead of focusing on filling the funnel, marketers are now trying to figure out how to work with the leads they have,” Beasley told CMSWire. “This tells me two things: One, marketers now have to learn how to create more mid- to lower-funnel content to continue the conversation they started and two, budgets will be spent in different ways that the last two to three years.”  Title image "DSC_0069" (CC BY-SA 2.0) by jameskm03 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing Digital Customer Experience Is a Business Priority, CMSWire Survey Says Hacking Marketing: Out With the Old, In With the New Marketing Management Evergage Guardian Uses Machine Learning, AI to Pull Deeper Insight From Data 1 in 4 Micro Businesses Are Missing Big Marketing Opportunities This Small Business Saturday, It's All About Location Adobe to Acquire TubeMogul for $540M Useful Article?

Published Sep 12th, 2016 11:02 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas It is no secret that Wal-Mart’s pending acquisition of Jet.com in the U.S. and recent partnership with JD.com in China are strategic plays the retail giant hopes will help its own e-commerce brand in the future. Wal-Mart Stores Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs recently told analysts that the moves are part of the retailer’s growth plans in the changing retail dynamic. Biggs was one of the featured speakers at the Goldman Sachs Global Retail Conference held in New York. “Jet on its own is an exciting brand, it’s grown very quickly and what they do with their smart cart technology is really interesting and unique in the way they have a customer build a basket. So having that unique brand like Jet is great for us,” Biggs said. He added that Wal-Mart is excited about the differences in the two brands and how leveraging one against the other is likely to improve Walmart.com and Jet.com. “I had a chance to meet with the Jet team yesterday … Marc Lore and his team have astute knowledge in this industry which is a big benefit,” Biggs said. Biggs said Walmart.com has build at good foundation under Neil Ashe’s leadership, but now Lore can bring his team and their unique insight sharing information back and forth between the two brands. Wal-Mart Stores Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs After investing heavily in e-commerce infrastructure over the past two years, Biggs said investors began to see some of the fruits in the recent quarter reported Aug. 18. There was an acceleration in Gross Market Value growth by 13%, in part because of the retailer’s push to add marketplace or third party suppliers. With respect to the marketplace push, Biggs said Wal-Mart wants to be there for the customer with first party, third party or any other way they want to shop. When asked if the two brands – Jet and Walmart.com – would co-exist long term or if one would be folded into the other, Biggs said Wal-Mart has experience running multiple brands. In the U.S. there is Neighborhood Market and Supercenters and globally there are many multiple brands that allow Walmart to reach customers in different ways. “Having two brands in e-commerce will allow us to try new things, lever each brand and take strengths from both. Jet also serves a more urban customer which is a benefit,” Biggs added. When asked about the $3.3 billion paid for Jet.com, Biggs said the capital allocation is a way Wal-Mart can reinvest back into the business to enhance shareholder return. Wal-Mart has to ensure it has a healthy business long term, while understanding that shorter and mid-term results are also watched closely by investors, he said. Somewhat overshadowed in recent weeks is the JD.Com partnership which analysts say is a big deal for Walmart’s growth in China. Biggs said the JD.com deal made a lot of sense when considering that Yihoadian’s reach in China was limited. He said the Yihaodian business was good but China’s landscape is huge and partnering with the No. 2 player in that country looked to be the best way to grow internet sales in China. Analysts applaud the recent moves by Wal-Mart to try grow its ecommerce business. Veteran retail analyst Walter Loeb of Loeb & Associates noted in a recent blog post that the Jet.com and JD partnership provide Wal-Mart with opportunities to become more competitive with giants like Amazon and Alibaba. Loeb said Walmart will be in a more competitive position with opportunities to take market share which is what management is aiming to do. In so doing, Loeb said, it’s the customer who will be the biggest winner, but likely not so great for the retail sector overall. “Many will be hurt, when elephants fight, the ants get stomped on,” Loeb said.

The so-called dark-store strategy was coined for the industry term that describes a store that’s been vacated. Retailers who use the argument to protest their property values say if the business leaves, the empty building would be hard to fill. So far, North Texas counties haven’t seen  the strategy used by big boxes, but they worry it could be spreading.  And they say if large stores are granted big reductions, the tax burden will fall increasingly on homeowners. Plano-based At Home has converted several big box stores across the U.S. as it expands into new cities. Earlier this year it opened stores in a vacated Kohl's in Plano and an empty Wal-Mart in Farmers Branch. (Brian Carlson) Highest and best use Texas counties have always valued stores based on their “highest and best use” at the beginning of each year. But the dark-store strategy seeks to change that. A lawsuit pending in Harris County District Court in Houston filed by North Carolina-based Lowe’s Cos. against the Harris County Appraisal District is being closely watched by the rest of the state’s county appraisal districts. The lawsuit lists five stores that Lowe’s is attempting to have property values reduced. Lowe’s has a separate action pending in San Antonio using the dark-store argument, but it’s not as far along. It’s still in arbitration, said Bexar County deputy chief appraiser Mary Kieki. Lowe’s is challenging assigned property values of 10 open stores in the county for each of the last three years.  The stores are currently valued at $82 a square foot. Lowe’s asked to reduce the valuation to $20 a square foot, she said. “This could be enormous,” Kieki said. “It wouldn’t stop with the big boxes like Sam’s, Lowe’s and Home Depot. You could see it continue with Kohl’s and CVS. Where does it stop?”   Heated topic Texas is Lowe’s largest state with 141 stores. It’s also the largest state for Wal-Mart which has 600 stores here. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had nothing to share on the topic. Big box retailers say a store’s market value should be set at the sale price of a similar size building that’s vacant. Retailers argue the large buildings, often well over 100,000 square feet, would be difficult to sell if empty, plus deed restrictions limit future uses.    Appraisers say that’s an argument to make if a store is closed and the building stays empty without hopes of a new tenant coming in, but even then appraisers say that’s not a solid argument. “A closed store would be a case-by-case property issue,” said Collin County chief appraiser Bo Daffin. “It’s not a way to look at a category of all big box stores.” No retailer has presented Collin County with the dark-store strategy yet, Daffin said, but it’s making its way through Texas.   “It’s a very heated topic,” Daffin said. “We’re not immune to this. It could come to Collin County if it’s in Bexar and Harris counties.” If an appraisal is wrong there’s a system to protest it, he said, but changing the way appraisals are calculated using a dark-store strategy is not the way Texas does it.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) Limited litigation funds  The Dallas County Appraisal District doesn’t have any dark-store issues, said Cheryl Jordan, a spokeswoman for the district.   Nearby Hunt County settled with Lowe’s over the 2014 valuation of a Lowe’s store in Greenville. “They used the dark-store strategy, but we didn’t go to trial,” said Brent South, Hunt County’s chief appraiser. The legal costs associated with taking the case to court would have been too high for a county with an annual litigation budget of $50,000, he said. “We didn’t have the resources to go to trial.” Hunt County settled for a valuation that reduced Lowe’s property taxes by about $23,000 a year. South, who is a past president of the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts, said he believes in Texas the deck is stacked against the counties because if it loses in court, the county must pay the retailer’s attorney fees and 9.5 percent interest on the refunded taxes. “In the end, it’s very costly to the homeowners because we have to shift the tax burden to them,” South said.   Wal-Mart has 600 stores in Texas. It declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. (File Photo/Andy Jacobsohn)  Routinely protest  “Just like homeowners, we want to be taxed fairly on the value of our buildings and land,” said Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb. Lowe’s said its stores generate jobs, pay state and local income tax, sales tax and property tax, and every year it routinely reviews property values assigned by county tax assessors to all 1,725 Lowe’s stores across the nation, she said. Cobb didn’t directly address the dark-store strategy. “Determining market value can be a complicated process, but in general, we look at information about comparable property in the area to help determine an appropriate value,” Cobb said. “In many cases, independent appraisers help us determine an appropriate market value for our buildings and land.” Disputing a taxable value, said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes, is a common practice for any business that has physical taxable property when it believes its assessment is too high. Home Depot didn't use the dark-store strategy in Bexar County, which lowered the company's valuation of its stores from $82 a square foot to $65. Other states  While Lowe’s seems to be leading the use of the dark-store strategy in Texas, according to appraisal districts, other big box retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have used the strategy elsewhere. Michigan has been among the states hit hard by the practice as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target and other big box stores have been able to get property appraisals cut by as much as 50 percent. Counties stand to lose millions of dollars if the dark-store method of assessing big-box stores continues to spread, according to the National Association of Counties. The county group cited a report that said in Michigan alone, store assessments have been reduced by $75 million. The dark-store strategy has also been used in Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Alabama. In West Texas, Taylor County chief appraiser Gary Earnest heard Lowe’s dark-store argument last year on two locations in Abilene. The district settled instead of going to court. “We’re watching Bexar and Harris counties,” Earnest said. “If other big box retailers adopt this, it will create a waterfall of events.” Twitter: @MariaHalkias More on this topic:  Dallas property taxes squeeze middle class while wealthy, businesses reap advantages 'Dark store' lawsuits hit county appraiser Big-Box Stores Battle Local Governments Over Property Taxes Tax law leads to towering savings for big-building owners Plano-based At Home is recycling old spaces into new stores Why prime D-FW retail sites vacated by Sports Authority aren't going fast View Comments Tags Retail Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Published September 12th On Sunday afternoon, a parking lot shooting at a Wal-Mart in Shawnee, Kansas, resulted in the injuring of two people and the death on an alleged suspect. The incident occurred when an unidentified woman stood at her car in the lot and began placing her infant child in the car seat. While she put her infant in the car, two attackers came up behind her and struck her in the back of the head.  When she was first hit, she screamed, alerting two Good Samaritans who came to her aid. As one of the Samaritans tried to help her, one of the attackers shot him multiple times. The other Good Samaritan then retrieved a gun and shot one of the alleged attackers dead, police said.  Both the injured Good Samaritan and the woman were taken to a local hospital for treatment.  The other attacker took off running east and police used video surveillance and a K-9 team to track him down.  When police arrived at an apartment complex to arrest the second suspect, his mother Janet Lewis told police that her son was home during the shooting. However, police still took Lewis’s son into custody and are considering him a possible suspect because he matched the description of the attacker on surveillance.  As police taped off the area of the attack, a shopper named Wendy Russell Macrorie captured a video of the aftermath from her car.  “Apparently right in front of my car two men have been shot,” Macrorie said in her video. “I was inside buying some light bulbs and stuff — an inner tube for my son for his bike and everybody was telling everybody not to go outside.”  The video she posted to her Facebook page captured what appeared to be the alleged dead suspect lying on the ground, just feet away from her car. However, although the situation surrounding Macrorie was extremely upsetting, the general tone and demeanor of her video seemed odd. She started off the video by saying, “So this is interesting. I am at Wal-Mart, which I hate going to, and this is happening in front of my car.” After giving her synopsis of the situation, she concluded by giving a warning for people to “be careful” when going to Wal-Mart.  The video she first posted to her Facebook has seemingly been removed, along with all other posts from her page.  As for the two injured victims, the woman’s condition was upgraded to good and her baby was unharmed in the incident. The wounded Good Samaritan was taken into surgery for his injuries and was awake and alert, officials said.  Watch Wendy Russell Macrorie’s video below. What do you think of the tone of her comments?

Christian Farr reports. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016) After decades of tireless work, a Chicago street vendor received some much-needed financial help all because of a picture posted by a driver passing by. Fidencio Sanchez, 89, was presented with a check from GoFundMe Wednesday after more than 17,000 people donated to help raise more than $380,000 for the man and his family. Judge Orders Brendan Dassey Released by Friday Speaking in Spanish, Sanchez expressed profound gratitude for the support of not only his community, but people across the world.  "He said he’s ecstatic and he wants to give thanks to the community and the whole world everyone who has contributed to this fund," said Joel Cervantes, who started the GoFundMe campaign. "He’s very grateful, him and his wife are overwhelmed with all the outpouring of support everyone has given. He said he’ll never forget this and he thanks everyone, but most of all he thanks God." Sanchez's story garnered national attention when Cervantes spotted the elderly man hunched over and struggling to push his cart selling paletas, or popsicles, down the side of the road in the city's Little Village neighborhood. “It broke my heart seeing this man that should be enjoying retirement still working at this age,” Cervantes wrote on GoFundMe. Women Donate to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's Name Cervantes pulled over to snap a photo before stopping to buy 20 paletas, giving Sanchez $50, and continuing on his way. The street vendor typically only makes about $50 during an average day selling his paletas. When Cervantes got home, the image of the hardworking man couldn’t seem to leave his mind. He posted the photo on his Facebook page, with the caption, “I respect this man to the fullest, but had no idea the image would get such an overwhelming response. It was quickly shared more than 400 times. That was when his friend Jose Loera came up with the idea to start a GoFundMe campaign in hopes those inspired by Sanchez’s story could band together to make even the smallest of a difference in his family’s life. Thrill Seeker Bungee Dunks Cookie 240 Feet, Breaks Record Simon Berry just wanted a cookie, his tea and a little thrill. The 24-year-old combines the three in a record-breaking bungee dunk for 240 feet with a perfect aim for Guinness World Records Day. (Published 4 hours ago) The originally fundraising goal was set for $3,000. It turned out, Sanchez and his wife are still grieving the recent loss of their only daughter.

Anything helps. Let's all pitch in and help make life a little easier and brighten both of their day.” In less than a day, the page received more than $100,000 in donations.

(Published Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016) A week later more than 17,000 people had donated funds to his family, gathering a total of more than $380,000. "It’s gonna help him security-wise, financial security," said Cervantes. "We’re pretty sure he’s not going to rent anymore." Top News Photos: Dakota Access Pipeline Protests and More Getty Images "He loves working 'cause it keeps him young, so I keep telling him just get a treadmill," he joked. "I think he’s going to get a hearing aid first."

President-elect Donald Trump's close aide is now reportedly his pick for National Security Advisor. The retired three-star general is controversial, appearing in the past on Russian T.V. and with Vladimir Putin. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, under consideration for Secretary of State, also paid a visit, and a source reports Trump will talk this weekend to Mitt Romney about that same job.

A study by the anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now found that the number of businesses in the top 100 economic entities jumped to 69 in 2015 from 63 in the previous year. While many emerging market economies have struggled to grow in the last couple of years, mainly as a result of China’s slowdown, many of the world’s largest corporations have increased in size. The London-based campaign group said the 10 biggest corporations – including Walmart, Apple and Shell – make more money than most countries in the world combined. The charity blamed governments for bowing to pressure from multinational firms to promote business-friendly tax regimes above the needs of their citizens. An assessment of the top 200 entities found that many smaller countries were squeezed out, leaving 153 corporations above many nations from Africa, Asia and South America. The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK make up the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. Walmart ranks as the 10th largest, followed by China’s electricity monopoly State Grid at number 14, China National Petroleum at 15 and Chinese oil firm Sinopec Group at 16. Apple ranked 26th behind the 18th-placed Royal Dutch Shell, with Exxon Mobil at 21, Volkswagen at 22 and Toyota at 23. The value of the top 10 corporations was $285tn (£215tn), beating the $280tn worth of the bottom 180 countries, which include Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam. Nick Dearden, the charity’s director, said: “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.” Global Justice Now said it released the figures to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, that aims to draw up a binding treaty “to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. Campaigners said they are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The charity has criticised Britain for refusing to support the process. Dearden said: “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. “Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully, it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.” More news Topics Global economy Economics Apple Exxon Mobil Walmart More… Charities Royal Dutch Shell TTIP Chinese economy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

ETCNBC.com SHARES Rick Wilking | Reuters A family shops at the Walmart Supercenter in Springdale, Arkansas. Cowen raised its rating for Wal-Mart shares to outperform from market perform, citing the retailer's market strength and growth prospects in coming years. "A combo of price investments, creative integration of physical + digital & the Jet acquisition position WMT to regain retail dominance," analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note to clients Monday. "We're confident WMT's positive US traffic (7 straight quarters) should continue over the next 2 years as WMT makes more aggressive price investments and makes further improvements in the customer experience." In another move, Chen lowered his rating for Target to market perform from outperform due to increased price competition. "We move to the sidelines as we lack conviction TGT can reignite comps growth, recent changes in food/pharmacy not resonating with guests & lack of upside drivers. ... In our view, WMT can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. AMZN (as evidenced by WMT's y/y growth in the month of July below), but TGT cannot compete as easily," he wrote.

Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com A proposed branch of Booker Dairy Road would run behind the Walmart shopping center before connecting with Ava Gardner Boulevard. Town of Smithfield 1 of 2 i By Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The N.C. Department of Transportation is ready to move forward with widening Booker Dairy Road and connecting it to Ava Gardner Avenue. But the news is making Smithfield anxious. The project would make the road four lanes in front of Smithfield-Selma High School and Neuse Charter School. And in connecting Booker Dairy to Avenue Gardner Avenue, the project would open to development land behind Wal-Mart and Belk. Smithfield leaders, both on the council and in the business community, have long embraced the project, just like they embraced the extension of Booker Dairy from Buffalo Road to U.S. 70 Business in West Smithfield. But a presentation this past week made council members uneasy. It was the first time they had seen what they called complicated plans, and the presentation left them wondering how much money Smithfield would have to spend on water, sewer and sidewalks. “This is the first time this council’s been given this plan,” Councilman Travis Scott said. Councilman Perry Harris was equally concerned. “We’ve certainly been told this was going to happen, and we really haven’t been extremely well informed about exactly what this road entails,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ve really been involved in the process of some of this.” Mayor Andy Moore spoke for the council when he said he was unhappy with the project maps. “Let’s see if we can’t get some better drawings of this,” he told town planner Paul Embler. Harris said the project could come at a considerable cost to Smithfield if it runs water and sewer lines along the new road behind Belk and Wal-Mart. And if the town wants sidewalks along the road, that will mean even more money. “We need to be involved in this process,” Harris said. “We’ve had virtually no conversations whatsoever about where we’re going to get (the money).” The council asked Councilman Scott to be its liaison with town staff and the DOT. Last year, Gov. Pat McCrory placed the Booker Dairy Road work on a short list of transportation projects he wants done in rural North Carolina. It’s now slated for construction in 2018. That could be too soon if Smithfield’s not prepared. “Now all of a sudden, it’s moving fast,” Mayor Andy Moore said. “We’ve got to deal with the money situation,” Harris added. “We’ve got a lot to do in a very short period of time.” Harris noted that the DOT plans don’t include sidewalks. “There’s a lot of children that walk this area,” he said. “ It’s something we’ve got to consider.” Harris wanted to know why the DOT plans showed the road going through homes when vacant land was available. Embler said much in the area had changed since the DOT first drafted plans for the project nearly 20 years ago. “A long time ago,” he said, shrugging. But the DOT has started contacting affected property owners, Embler added. What the town needs is more information, Moore said. “We need to understand this road,” he said, “how it’s going to be designed, what it will mean for development in that area. “We are going to have to invest a large amount of money, and I would like for us to be able to capitalize off a new road ... from a development standpoint so we can increase our tax base, so we can hopefully recoup some of the money we’re going to have to put in.” Abbie Bennett: 910-849-2827; @AbbieRBennett Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Smithfield Herald Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:21 Does race play a part in the challenge to Durham vote count?

The so-called dark-store strategy was coined for the industry term that describes a store that’s been vacated. Retailers who use the argument to protest their property values say if the business leaves, the empty building would be hard to fill. So far, North Texas counties haven’t seen  the strategy used by big boxes, but they worry it could be spreading.  And they say if large stores are granted big reductions, the tax burden will fall increasingly on homeowners. Plano-based At Home has converted several big box stores across the U.S. as it expands into new cities. Earlier this year it opened stores in a vacated Kohl's in Plano and an empty Wal-Mart in Farmers Branch. (Brian Carlson) Highest and best use Texas counties have always valued stores based on their “highest and best use” at the beginning of each year. But the dark-store strategy seeks to change that. A lawsuit pending in Harris County District Court in Houston filed by North Carolina-based Lowe’s Cos. against the Harris County Appraisal District is being closely watched by the rest of the state’s county appraisal districts. The lawsuit lists five stores that Lowe’s is attempting to have property values reduced. Lowe’s has a separate action pending in San Antonio using the dark-store argument, but it’s not as far along. It’s still in arbitration, said Bexar County deputy chief appraiser Mary Kieki. Lowe’s is challenging assigned property values of 10 open stores in the county for each of the last three years.  The stores are currently valued at $82 a square foot. Lowe’s asked to reduce the valuation to $20 a square foot, she said. “This could be enormous,” Kieki said. “It wouldn’t stop with the big boxes like Sam’s, Lowe’s and Home Depot. You could see it continue with Kohl’s and CVS. Where does it stop?”   Heated topic Texas is Lowe’s largest state with 141 stores. It’s also the largest state for Wal-Mart which has 600 stores here. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had nothing to share on the topic. Big box retailers say a store’s market value should be set at the sale price of a similar size building that’s vacant. Retailers argue the large buildings, often well over 100,000 square feet, would be difficult to sell if empty, plus deed restrictions limit future uses.    Appraisers say that’s an argument to make if a store is closed and the building stays empty without hopes of a new tenant coming in, but even then appraisers say that’s not a solid argument. “A closed store would be a case-by-case property issue,” said Collin County chief appraiser Bo Daffin. “It’s not a way to look at a category of all big box stores.” No retailer has presented Collin County with the dark-store strategy yet, Daffin said, but it’s making its way through Texas.   “It’s a very heated topic,” Daffin said. “We’re not immune to this. It could come to Collin County if it’s in Bexar and Harris counties.” If an appraisal is wrong there’s a system to protest it, he said, but changing the way appraisals are calculated using a dark-store strategy is not the way Texas does it.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) Limited litigation funds  The Dallas County Appraisal District doesn’t have any dark-store issues, said Cheryl Jordan, a spokeswoman for the district.   Nearby Hunt County settled with Lowe’s over the 2014 valuation of a Lowe’s store in Greenville. “They used the dark-store strategy, but we didn’t go to trial,” said Brent South, Hunt County’s chief appraiser. The legal costs associated with taking the case to court would have been too high for a county with an annual litigation budget of $50,000, he said. “We didn’t have the resources to go to trial.” Hunt County settled for a valuation that reduced Lowe’s property taxes by about $23,000 a year. South, who is a past president of the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts, said he believes in Texas the deck is stacked against the counties because if it loses in court, the county must pay the retailer’s attorney fees and 9.5 percent interest on the refunded taxes. “In the end, it’s very costly to the homeowners because we have to shift the tax burden to them,” South said.   Wal-Mart has 600 stores in Texas. It declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. (File Photo/Andy Jacobsohn)  Routinely protest  “Just like homeowners, we want to be taxed fairly on the value of our buildings and land,” said Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb. Lowe’s said its stores generate jobs, pay state and local income tax, sales tax and property tax, and every year it routinely reviews property values assigned by county tax assessors to all 1,725 Lowe’s stores across the nation, she said. Cobb didn’t directly address the dark-store strategy. “Determining market value can be a complicated process, but in general, we look at information about comparable property in the area to help determine an appropriate value,” Cobb said. “In many cases, independent appraisers help us determine an appropriate market value for our buildings and land.” Disputing a taxable value, said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes, is a common practice for any business that has physical taxable property when it believes its assessment is too high. Home Depot didn't use the dark-store strategy in Bexar County, which lowered the company's valuation of its stores from $82 a square foot to $65. Other states  While Lowe’s seems to be leading the use of the dark-store strategy in Texas, according to appraisal districts, other big box retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have used the strategy elsewhere. Michigan has been among the states hit hard by the practice as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target and other big box stores have been able to get property appraisals cut by as much as 50 percent. Counties stand to lose millions of dollars if the dark-store method of assessing big-box stores continues to spread, according to the National Association of Counties. The county group cited a report that said in Michigan alone, store assessments have been reduced by $75 million. The dark-store strategy has also been used in Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Alabama. In West Texas, Taylor County chief appraiser Gary Earnest heard Lowe’s dark-store argument last year on two locations in Abilene. The district settled instead of going to court. “We’re watching Bexar and Harris counties,” Earnest said. “If other big box retailers adopt this, it will create a waterfall of events.” Twitter: @MariaHalkias More on this topic:  Dallas property taxes squeeze middle class while wealthy, businesses reap advantages 'Dark store' lawsuits hit county appraiser Big-Box Stores Battle Local Governments Over Property Taxes Tax law leads to towering savings for big-building owners Plano-based At Home is recycling old spaces into new stores Why prime D-FW retail sites vacated by Sports Authority aren't going fast View Comments Tags Retail Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

By Nick Sambides Jr., BDN Staff Follow on Twitter Find on Facebook Posted Sept. 12, 2016, at 6:23 a.m. Poll Question Take Our Poll PATTEN, Maine — Brothers Adam and Matthew Fronczak sit astride three industries dear to Patten — forestry, farming and milling — and it can make for some scattershot workdays. On any given day, 48-year-old Matthew might find himself welding a patch onto a conveyer belt in Patten, doing soil tests in Old Town and picking up auto parts in Bangor while 51-year-old Adam calls customers and surveys abandoned farmland off Route 11. “There are so many projects and directions to go in that there’s just not enough hours in the day,” Adam Fronczak said recently. The very versatile brothers, who are former lobstermen, are general managers of Haymart, a farming and milling operation that town officials hope will be a great boost to the upper Katahdin region economy. Story continues below advertisement. A dual-purpose mill The 175-year-old empty mill site on Mill Street was acquired in 2013 by an investor who wishes to remain anonymous, the brothers said. The two managers began working on it immediately. Since opening the facility in January 2016, the brothers have expanded their payroll from three to 13 full-time workers and begun round-the-clock manufacturing of softwood pellets five days per week. Their goal is to produce 5,000 tons of home-heating pellets this year and double that amount next year. They also are growing barley, oats, soybeans and wheat to make feed pellets for hogs, cows and other livestock or for sale as organic produce. Haymart owns or contracts with 14 formerly abandoned farms totaling more than 4,200 acres in Maine, Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska, according to the company website, Haymart.com. The Maine farmlands include a 1,200-acre plot in Old Town off Route 116, 900 acres in West Enfield off Route 2 and a total of 150 acres over several plots off Clark Road and Route 11 in Patten. “Our mill is set up for dual purposes,” Adam Fronczak said. Their Haymart Hotties wood pellets are sold through 16 outlets, including 10 Wal-Mart stores stretching from Waterville into northern Maine and smaller retailers such as Nicatou Stoves of Medway, Brownlee Builders of Patten and Aroostook Milling of Houlton. They also are contracted to supply pellets to heat several Katahdin Valley health centers in northern Maine as the centers convert to pellet heating systems, the brothers said. The Wal-Mart contract could occupy their one $750,000 pellet manufacturing system full time, but the brothers said they will be maintaining their other contracts and will continue experimenting with feed-pellet production. They’ve produced a few thousand pounds of feed pellets to date. They hope to add another manufacturing system to ramp up wood- and feed-pellet production by mid-2017, increasing their staff to as many as 30 workers, the Fronczaks said. The perils of pellet making Haymart’s production methodology is comprehensive and thrifty. The brothers buy abandoned and often heavily overgrown farmland and clear it of trees and other growth. Not just any farm will do. “It all starts with the correct soils,” Matthew Fronczak said. The biomass culled from the land is turned into pellets, used to fuel their mill’s biomass heating system or sold to other biomass energy boilers. Then they seed the farmland for certified-organic crops. This, their first year of crop growth, has gone well, Matthew Fronczak said. “Everything is going good. Our crops shot right out of the ground this year,” he said. “All of our barley has come up good.” Yet, production itself has been challenging. Pellet manufacturing is almost an art: Wet weather, moisture levels in the chosen wood products and the manufacturing system’s temperature settings can have a wildly dramatic impact on pellet quality. Experimentation and the company’s addition of moisture measuring equipment to its manufacturing system two or three weeks ago has greatly improved pellet production consistency, according to Jamie Kaelin, 38, of Crystal, who works as a laborer at Haymart. “There are a lot of moving parts to this,” Kaelin said. “Now production is doing really good. We’ve stepped it up a lot in the last week or so.” A ‘psychological lift’ The company’s relatively swift growth and ambitious plans have been a tonic to a Patten area that suffered a heavy blow when Shaw Industries Group Inc. of Dalton, Georgia, laid off 18 workers and closed the wood veneering mill it owned at the Haymart mill in 2010. “We have been sort of adrift since then, and the fact that we can point to them being there, even if there’s not a great deal of economic significance to what they’re doing so far, still gives us a psychological lift,” Patten Town Manager Raymond Foss said. “You feel better about the town knowing that it [the mill site] is active because for three or four years it wasn’t.” The company’s impact on the local economy is likely greater than its 13 positions, but it is difficult to say how much greater. Economists place manufacturing as among the most valuable employment sectors. Economic estimates indicate that manufacturing typically creates at least four jobs indirectly for every single job directly created. Haymart’s impact, however, might be dulled because it seeks very versatile workers who, like the Fronczaks, can handle a variety of assignments. Finding good help is a chronic problem for many northern Maine businesses, but filling a job that requires farming, mechanical and forest products skills at $10 to $15 per hour with one person instead of two or three is even more difficult. “It remains our biggest challenge,” Adam Fronczak said. “Finding a farmer is fine, but putting him into a feller buncher” — a machine that cuts trees and strips branches from tree logs — “or in the shop here — that’s difficult,” Matthew Fronczak said. A ‘good all-around sense’ Finding the time to train and oversee workers is also taxing, and some of the job candidates themselves have come with heavy luggage. Two potential drivers never got hired because they failed drug tests. Haymart has contracted with local farms and members of the local Amish community for workers and supplies when needed. The Amish, Matthew Fronczak said, are excellent workers, and the brothers are considering working closely with the local vocational high school to groom workers. The Fronczaks’ versatility and equilibrium at coping with the rigors of a startup business have impressed Kristen Wittine, the company’s office manager. Besides running the company, they installed the manufacturing system, electrical supply and plumbing to the mill, which includes a large heated warehouse floor where the company’s finished pellets are stored. The indoor storage keeps the pellets dry — a critical advantage to keeping them sellable, Matthew Fronczak said. “They truly were pulled from one industry into a totally new setting, and they had the good all-around sense to do it,” Wittine said of the brothers. “To me, this is something that a person with an engineering degree could have done.” The brothers, who both have high school educations, however, are good mentors — even-tempered and analytical, Wittine said. Their skills mesh well. Adam is good with the finances and customer service while Matthew is probably more adept with mechanical things. “They can read each other very well, and one is always available [to handle problems] if the other has to step out,” she said. Now that the brothers have their business running, they face a startup businesses’ next challenge: Doing what they can to make their pellets and organic produce sell well. “We seem to be finding a market for our products,” Adam Fronczak said. “It’s fun,” Matthew Fronczak said. “We like to work.”   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Wayfair cuts ribbon on Bangor call center, continues Maine hiring effort Next story:Free speech law doesn’t always protect social media bashing of bad service » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Hollis woman shot five times by man trying to save her It’s unclear whether Trump could abolish the North Woods monument Maine man charged after allegedly threatening to kill Obama, Pingree Man charged with manslaughter in Bath parking lot shooting to plead to lesser charge Official: Pending inmate release prompts security precautions at MDI school With few wins to celebrate in Maine’s addiction fight, here’s one worth acknowledging Friday, Nov. 18, 2016: Accept election results, fix health care, Trump’s hateful rhetoric Trump won the presidency, but can he unite a divided nation?

Here’s a Viewing Guide to All 43 of His Movies By Will Leitch and Tim Grierson Plus a rank of every Hanks live-action film. 1.3k Shares Share 1.3k Tweet 0 Share 2 Share Email Print Share You might say there’s a unified theory of Hanks: The actor contains multitudes, but is always Tom Hanks. As a result, he’s often accused of playing one character: the fundamentally decent, good-hearted, noble but humble all-American everyman. There’s some truth to this, of course — Hanks wouldn’t work as Travis Bickle, no matter how hard he tried. But it’s not fair to paint Hanks as playing the same character over and over, and it certainly wouldn’t be fair to say that he doesn’t challenge himself or take chances. Hanks has transformed himself from the party-dude of Bachelor Party to the romantic lead of Sleepless in Seattle to the war hero of Saving Private Ryan to the six different characters he plays, amusingly, in Cloud Atlas. The guy might only play a certain number of notes, but he always manages to make them sound unique. All of his movies can be grouped into seven different categories, though, and if you’re in the mood for the sort of entertainment only a Hanks movie can provide, this guide is a good jumping-off point. We’ve arranged his filmography into buckets based on the sort of Hanks performance you can expect, ranked the movies within each grouping, and indicated where you can find them on streaming. (To see Inferno and Sully, you’ll have to head to a theater.) We’ve also indicated in parentheses where each title falls in our overall rank of Tom Hanks movies, in case you’re simply looking for the best of the best. A note: We limited our guide to live-action movies only, meaning Hanks’s superb turns in the three Toy Story films aren’t on the list. It goes without saying that there’s never a bad time to watch a Toy Story movie. HANKS AS WACKY BOSOM BUDDIES GUY Hanks broke out as a comedic leading man straight from the sitcom world, and it’s worth noting that the Tom Hanks Character, in the '80s, was much more elastic and clownish than the one we see today. But even during that period, you could see him evolving. Big (1988) (Rank: 6) This was the one that made everybody realize: Oh, Hanks isn’t just a comedy guy, he could maybe be the biggest movie star in the world. As the boy who gets his wish to be big, Hanks gives a glorious, hilarious, and sweet performance as a 12-year-old in a grown-up’s body. He’s limber and wild and untethered — it’s one of his best physical comedy performances — but he never lets you forget there’s a scared little kid in there. Hanks didn't win Best Actor* for this performance, even though the movie was a huge hit, which was seen by many at the time as a sign that comedy was never going to be given a break by the Academy. Nevertheless, this performance is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Splash (1984) (Rank: 11) A massive hit that essentially launched the film careers of Hanks, Daryl Hannah, and Ron Howard, Splash is funny and sharp, particularly when it takes its fish-out-of-water premise literally and lets Hannah’s mermaid try to interact with mid-’80s New York City. There are some parts that might be called “problematic” today — and there’s always been an argument that Hanks and sidekick John Candy should have switched roles — but this, as much anything else, was what initially sold everyone on Hanks. Even when he’s being a jerk (and he’s a jerk a lot in the movie), you can’t help but be on his side. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Punchline (1988) (Rank: 22) Punchline confused audiences and critics when it came out because it was a movie about stand-up comedy that was not all that funny. That was by design, though, and the film has aged better than you might think. Hanks plays a struggling stand-up comedian who comes across a housewife (Sally Field) trying out on open-mic nights who turns out to be pretty good. Hanks resents her success but also cares for her — and, as the movie hints, he has some emotional instability issues of his own. Hanks isn’t much of a stand-up comic — you never buy that he’s any good — but he gets at the desperation at the heart of showbiz. It’s a better performance, and movie, than people appreciated at the time. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Bachelor Party (1984) (Rank: 26) Your mileage is going to vary on a lot of the Tom Hanks, Disposable Lead of Dopey ’80s Comedies, entries, but this one is definitely one of the silliest, dumbest and, amusingly, most eternal: There are movies from this time period that Hanks can hide from now, but this is definitely not one of them. After all, this is a movie in which a donkey does cocaine. Don’t see that every day. Available to rent on: Amazon Dragnet (1987) (Rank: 27) The closest Hanks will ever come to playing Poochie, the skateboarding dog from The Simpsons. Hanks is the young, “cool” cop contrasting with Dan Aykroyd’s Joe Friday impression, and he has as much fun as you can in a silly movie in which Aykroyd considers himself the star. The major takeaway is a deeply disturbing “rap” video Aykroyd and Hanks made to promote the film. Watch at your own peril. “I’m here tonight, to rap about your rights.” Yikes. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes Turner & Hooch (1989) (Rank: 32) The buddy cop-with-a-dog movie that, despite being a hit, famously inspired Hanks to start reevaluating his career — making the pivot that would win him multiple Oscars — Turner & Hooch isn’t that terrible. (Well, it’s not any worse than Tango & Cash, how about that?) However, proceed with caution: If you get sad when a dog dies in a movie, you will cry a lot. (Er, spoiler alert?) Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Volunteers (1985) (Rank: 33) It’s tough for Hanks to play a jerk, but he’s definitely a snobby jerk in this Nicholas Meyer comedy about a rich kid who has to escape angry creditors pursuing a gambling debt by joining the Peace Corps. There’s not much here — it was the end of an aborted Hanks-and-Candy comedy team — but it is where Hanks met his wife Rita Wilson, so there’s that. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on Amazon Nothing in Common (1986) (Rank: 34) Hanks plays an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down — this is the exact description of many Hanks roles at this time — when his parents (Jackie Gleason and Eva Marie Saint) get divorced and he has to take care of both of them. This is high-concept and tiresome, and Gleason, in particular, hams it up every time he’s onscreen, but this was the start of Hanks’s pivot toward a more “serious” screen persona. He’s not particularly funny in the film; he’s trying to play this one straight. Nothing in Common wasn’t the appropriate vehicle for that, but the instinct was right. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes The ’Burbs (1989) (Rank: 35) A theoretically “dark” comedy about a bored suburban dad who begins to think his neighbors are murderers. There’s a lot to be mined here, but Hanks and his director, Joe Dante — who would go on to till this field far better in other movies — go way too broad way too often. The movie dissolves into nonsense by the end. In 1989, Hanks made this and that dog movie … and then wisely moved in a whole new direction. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on iTunes The Money Pit (1986) (Rank: 38) There were times, early on, when Hanks’s white-bread geniality would be forced to do too much of the heavy lifting, and this strained comedy with Shelley Long is a great example. The one-joke premise is that the dream house Hanks and Long have bought is falling apart, and the movie keeps trying to find new ways to make that exact point, with diminishing results. Hanks doesn’t look bored with this lane yet, but he is starting to seem a little exhausted. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Man With One Red Shoe (1985) (Rank: 41) An instantly forgettable “comedy thriller” in which Hanks plays a doofus concert pianist thrust clumsily into a murder mystery. He’s clearly dialed up a little too high in order to carry a thin, empty premise, but still, check out the supporting cast: Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Jim Belushi, Edward Herrmann, and a finally-done-playing-Leia (for another 30 years, anyway) Carrie Fisher. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes He Knows You’re Alone (1981) (Rank: 42) Hanks’s movie debut was a slasher film that’s an obvious Halloween knockoff, right down to the mask and music. It’s cheapo schlock, but it’ll live forever because of Hanks’s appearance as a student who’s skeptical that the protagonist is really being stalked. His dialogue clearly sets him up to be murdered, but the filmmakers liked him so much that they decided to let his character live. Even in his first movie, Hanks was charming everybody. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes HANKS AS ROMANTIC LEAD The Hanks your mom loves. The Hanks that will line the shelves of Walmart well past a nuclear holocaust. Sleepless in Seattle (1993) (Rank: 10) If movies like Sleepless in Seattle were all Hanks ever made, we wouldn’t hold the actor in such high esteem. And yet, c’mon, it’s so hard to resist him as Sam, the puppy-dog widower who will fall for a newspaper reporter (Meg Ryan) with a fondness for An Affair to Remember. Sprinkled with fairy dust and charm by late director Nora Ephron, Sleepless in Seattle is the epitome of feel-good, wish-fulfillment Hollywood love stories, and Hanks gives it a grounding that it very much needs. He’s sensitive and appealing — as unthreatening as the nice guy next door with a decency and cuteness that made him crush-worthy. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) (Rank: 16) John Patrick Shanley’s funky, off-kilter romantic comedy was a little too weird for audiences at the time, but it has aged well: This story of a man (Hanks) who decides to kill himself by throwing himself into a volcano before being interrupted by a series of increasingly odd events has its own goofy rhythm that Hanks steadies and smooths out, though maybe a little too much. The fact that Hanks toplined the movie may have given the impression of its being more conventional that it is, causing people to reject it outright. It’s worth a revisit. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes You’ve Got Mail (1998) (Rank: 18) Sleepless co-stars Hanks and Ryan went back to the rom-com well in 1998, with lesser results. Hanks gets to play the romantic hero with a little bit more of an edge this time — he’s a big-time bookstore-conglomerate CEO trying to shut down cute Meg Ryan’s little independent bookstore — but he’s still gooey in the middle and easily palatable to the older white audience that ate this up. Suffice it to say, the AOL-centric narrative hasn’t aged well, but hey … is that Dave Chappelle? Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Larry Crowne (2011) (Rank: 28) Hanks’s second film as director was a bust: a well-intentioned look at working-class Americans who were rocked by the 2008 financial collapse that was patronizing and glib. He plays Larry, a normal joe who gets fired from his Walmart-like job and has to reinvent himself, falling in love with Julia Roberts’s college professor in the process. Larry Crowne is the sort of movie that makes you understand why conservatives go off on tirades about out-of-touch, liberal Hollywood stars. There isn’t a whiff of reality to this story, and Hanks is like an alien trying to play an everyman — he’s rarely seemed so uncomfortable and unconvincing. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Every Time We Say Goodbye (1986) (Rank: 37) This was Hanks’s first attempt at “stretching” in a saccharine love story set during World War II in which he plays a soldier who loses his true love. Hanks hadn’t quite figured out how to calibrate Comedy vs. Serious yet, so he responds to this “serious” challenge by basically shutting down his charisma altogether. He would get much better at finding the balance. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu EXPERIMENTAL HANKS Hanks is a more ambitious actor than he might appear: He’s aware you think he’s playing the same character every time out, and knows sometimes he has to surprise us. Forrest Gump (1994) (Rank: 3) This Best Picture winner’s litany of famous lines — “Run, Forrest, Run,” “Life is like a box of chocolates,” “Jenny” — risks reducing the movie to a series of quotables as simple as the man Hanks played to earn his second Oscar. But the beauty of his performance is in how it both satirizes a divisive period in American history while also underlining the sincerity and optimism that’s always been part of our national character. Sure, that’s a corny notion, but it took an actor who could transform that sentimentality into something stirring and true, and nobody on the planet was better suited for the role than Hanks. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Cast Away (2000) (Rank: 4) The closest Hanks has gotten to a Robert De Niro–like physical transformation, Cast Away found the star playing a FedEx executive who goes through a personal metamorphosis after he’s the lone survivor of a plane crash. Taking time off from shooting so that he could lose a massive amount of weight for the island sequences, Hanks exudes the sense of spiritual isolation that first maroons the character but then gives him a new reason to go on living. This might be his most intimate and elemental performance, his primary scene partner being a volleyball, and Hanks finds a raw, slightly terrifying urgency within his good-guy persona that suggests that even the best of us have a breaking point. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Philadelphia (1993) (Rank: 13) No matter the good intentions of everyone involved in this activist drama — to say nothing of its social importance — there’s no denying that Philadelphia isn’t exactly scintillating cinema. The same goes for Hanks’s performance as a lawyer diagnosed with AIDS. To be sure, it’s lovely and full of feeling, but he risks making Andrew Beckett almost too saintly, which made some sense in an era when homosexuality was viewed as a scary “other.” Hanks’s natural likability attacked that bigotry directly, and for that the performance remains incredibly meaningful. But Andrew is more symbol than great character — a significant time-capsule relic slightly diminished by the fortunate evolution of human thinking about sexuality and AIDS. Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Road to Perdition (2002) (Rank: 21) A hit man with soul, Michael Sullivan must protect his son (future Everybody Wants Some!! star Tyler Hoechlin) after the mob wants to rub them both out. Road to Perdition got a lot of press at the time for the fact that, hey, look, Hanks is playing a bad guy. Of course, the character isn’t really bad: He’s a gruff but concerned parent who lives by a strict moral code. Director Sam Mendes’s period crime film is suffocated by its finely manicured production design and gorgeous Conrad Hall cinematography, which gives the actors very little room to breathe. As a result, we get an intriguing curveball of a performance from Hanks, but not a great or even a particularly revealing one. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu A Hologram for the King (2016) (Rank: 23) Hanks provides some pathos to his role as a washed-up American businessman trying to close a deal in Saudi Arabia, but A Hologram for the King can’t escape the fact that it’s approximately the 1,428,721st drama about a depressed, middle-aged white guy at a spiritual crossroads. The star brings his all, but the whole enterprise is hamstrung from the start — although Hanks gets to show off his romantic leading-man side for the first time in a while opposite a very appealing Sarita Choudhury. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS AS PLUG-IN STUDIO LEAD When you’re the biggest movie star in the world, as Hanks was for a few years, you just get cast as the lead in movies just because you’re the biggest movie star in the world. Sometimes it’s a fit. Sometimes, less so. The Green Mile (1999) (Rank: 15) The Green Mile is the sort of bloated awards-bait that doesn’t work at all unless you’ve got somebody like Tom Hanks piloting the ship. Even then, he can only do so much with the role of Paul Edgecomb, a predictably good-hearted prison guard who befriends Michael Clarke Duncan’s death-row prisoner with strange powers. The syrup is pretty thick in this three-hour-plus (!) Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King inspirational drama, and thankfully Hanks steered away from this kind of mawkishness in subsequent years. Soon, he’d be traveling into weirder and darker terrain. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Da Vinci Code (2006) (Rank: 30) Hanks and Ron Howard’s adaptation of Dan Brown’s blockbuster novel is by-the-numbers and uninspired, but it’s professionally done in a way that’s mostly inoffensive. Still, these are two ambitious and creative people, and it feels like a waste to have them going through the paces of this sort of hackery. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Polar Express (2004) (Rank: 31) Amazingly, this is one of two movies in which Hanks plays six characters. The technologically groundbreaking but narratively uneven Polar Express animates Chris Van Allsburg’s children’s book through what was a fancy new innovation at the time: motion-capture. The dead-eyed look of the film’s characters still haunts our dreams, but we also object to Hanks’s overly cutesy performances as the conductor, Santa Claus, and others. It’s a fine line when acting in a movie that’s meant to be magical: You get the balance wrong, and the whole thing ends up feeling aggressively adorable and self-satisfied. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Inferno (2106) (Rank: 39) The Robert Langdon movies are generally Hanks at his worst — not bad, necessarily, but his most complacent and going through the motions — and while this one isn’t the worst of the bunch, he doesn’t give it much extra oomph. As our colleague Jackson McHenry noted, Inferno provides a slight twist on "the young woman following Robert Langdon through historical landmarks" formula, but not in any way that justifies its existence. Please, let Hanks be done with these now. In theaters now The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) (Rank: 40) “I did everything I could to make it work,” Hanks said in 1992 about this Brian De Palma debacle. “And the fallout from it was that it makes you reflect for a while. You question yourself. But what can you do? You take your shots and you swing away.” Yes, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s Zeitgeist-y novel was a failure, but it’s an interesting failure in lots of ways, not least of which is watching Hanks trying to play the story’s Master-of-the-Universe Wall Street operative. He has the character’s All-American features but not the toxic spirit, which fatally wounds the entire film. It’s but one problem with a high-profile bust that at least inspired a pretty good behind-the-scenes tell-all. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Angels and Demons (2009) (Rank: 43) Hanks always looks a little ridiculous in these movies — and they’ve always felt like his one way to assure himself a studio hit; outside the Toy Story movies, they’re the only sequels he has ever done — but this one is preposterous and flimsy. Hanks gives low-key performances all the time, but this is the only time he has looked actively bored. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS FAMILY PLAYTIME Sometimes, Hanks just wants to hang out with his kids and friends. Hey, guys, let’s put on a movie! That Thing You Do! (1996) (Rank: 25) Hanks’s directorial debut — which includes his Bosom Buddies co-star Peter Scolari, plus Rita Wilson, Colin Hanks, and Elizabeth Hanks — is modest and pleasant, like you would expect it to be, even if it doesn’t add up to much. Hanks plays the world’s most benevolent music promoter, and it’s the sort of movie you dance along to; nice little background music while you do something else. If they were all like this, the world would be a much friendlier place. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Great Buck Howard (2008) (Rank: 36) In this mostly dull bauble about a kid (Colin Hanks) who works for a possibly fraudulent huckster magician (John Malkovich), Hanks shows up briefly as a skeptical dad. This is the first and only time Hanks plays the father of his real-life son Colin, and he’s amiable enough to show up and then get out of his kid’s way. Available to rent on: iTunes, Vudu HANKS AS AMERICAN AVATAR Hanks is often clothed as a sort of stand-in for the American character, a suit that’s so impossible to fill out that it’s pretty amazing how well it fits him. Saving Private Ryan (1998) (Rank: 1) When we first see Captain Miller, his hands are shaking as he puts his canteen to his lips before beginning the D-day assault on Normandy. He’s scared, as would anyone be in that situation. The greatness of Saving Private Ryan can be measured in many ways — the harrowing brilliance of its opening battle sequence, the stunning desaturated images of war rendered by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński — but it’s ultimately a very human story, which is why Steven Spielberg cast Hollywood’s most reliable and relatable everyman star in the role. As the film pounds along and the body count builds, we learn that Miller was the kind of American hero World War II probably produced a lot of: an ordinary guy back home who turned himself into a leader of men because the fate of the planet hung in the balance. Hanks is as stripped-down as the landscape, hoping that rescuing Ryan will be enough to get him home and forget all this terrible killing. His death in the final moments haunts you long after the film’s over, with Hanks paying tribute to a lot of good soldiers who went off to safeguard freedom and never saw America again. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Captain Phillips (2013) (Rank: 2) Hanks's terrified, vulnerable turn as the eponymous Captain Phillips is another prime example of his ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances.* Hanks’s Phillips is a good captain but also a flawed one, and one who is constantly adjusting to events that are entirely out of his control. He does his best just to stay alive, but when the ordeal is finally over and he is able to take stock, he breaks down in the most raw, wrenching scene of Hanks’s whole career. It’s a measured, calculated performance that builds to a moment of almost overwhelming power. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Apollo 13 (1995) (Rank: 5) There is a chance that, if you haven’t seen this Best Picture nominee in a while, all you remember of it is Hanks’s Jim Lovell saying, “Houston, we have a problem.” Go back and watch Apollo 13 and you’ll see Hanks eschewing the flash of his then-recent Oscar-winning portrayals for a no-nonsense turn as a mission commander who is bound and determined to keep his crew (Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon) focused as they and Mission Control figure out how to get their crippled vessel home. This is a performance that’s easy to shortchange, but Hanks imbues it with endlessly stirring, stripped-down authority. He makes not losing your shit in the midst of a crisis feel heroic. Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Bridge of Spies (2015) (Rank: 8) Hanks’s innate decency plays a part in several films, but it’s delivered in a different way in this underrated Cold War drama. Hanks is Donovan, an insurance lawyer asked to defend a Russian spy (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), in the process learning that he alone wants to be sure the accused gets a fair trial. Bridge of Spies is a movie about negotiation and compromise — about what principles we’re willing to sacrifice and which ones we can’t — and Donovan is heroic not because he’s the guy with the halo but because he’s shrewder and more determined than everyone he comes across. This is Hanks as World-Weary Veteran Movie Star, and he gives it an effortless swagger. Available to rent on: Vudu Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) (Rank: 9) Charlie Wilson was a hard-partying, womanizing Texas congressman who helped arm the mujahideen against the invading Russians during the 1980s. It’s a too-good-to-be-true real-life tale, and Hanks (who also produced) has a ball playing a sonuvabitch who’s been wasting his life until he finds a cause worthy of his talents. Charlie Wilson’s War is deeply flawed — director Mike Nichols and writer Aaron Sorkin oversell the movie’s “colorful” world of vulgar CIA operatives and sassy Texas socialites — but Hanks gives the cartoonish story a moral center without sacrificing the tale’s more unbelievable moments and its dark punch line: Wilson’s seemingly patriotic actions will sow the seeds for Middle Eastern terrorism against the West. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Catch Me If You Can (2002) (Rank: 12) You could argue that Hanks’s character is only the third-most interesting in this Steven Spielberg biopic about professional con man Frank Abagnale. (Rising star Leonardo DiCaprio has the showier role as Abagnale, and Christopher Walken, playing his hard-luck father, got the Oscar nomination.) But Hanks does commendable supporting work as a nerdy FBI agent on Abagnale’s trail — essentially playing the sort of conventional square whose mediocre life frightens the restless, rootless Abagnale. What’s funniest about Catch Me If You Can is how it represented a permanent shift in Hanks’s persona: The bratty upstart from Dragnet was now old enough (and established enough) to be the just-the-facts-ma’am law-and-order type. Still, there’s a twinkle in Hanks’s eye. Even as a square, he’s so damn likable. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Sully (2016) (Rank: 14) Playing Sully Sullenberger, Hanks gives a calmly assured performance that’s easy to underrate — he does a whole lot by doing not much of anything. In Clint Eastwood’s spare drama, Sullenberger has just piloted his crippled US Airways flight into the Hudson, avoiding tragedy, but now he must answer to federal investigators who question his strategy. Sully never questions the man’s heroism, but Sully himself does, and Hanks’s portrayal is one in which self-doubt eats away at the character — which, coupled with having just survived a horrifying ordeal, leaves him feeling discombobulated and adrift. Sullenberger comes across as haunted, shaken, trying to put himself back together, and Hanks makes that healing feel quietly inspiring. In theaters now Saving Mr. Banks (2013) (Rank: 24) Tom Hanks playing Walt Disney in the story of how Mary Poppins got turned into a beloved film feels like money in the bank. So, what happened? Saving Mr. Banks isn’t bad so much as it’s uninspired and safe — probably an inevitable result considering that the Disney studio was behind the biopic and wanted to make sure it stayed on-brand. Still, the disappointment extends to Hanks’s portrayal. He’s a more-than-credible Walt, amplifying the man’s megawatt showmanship and gregariousness, but it doesn’t zig or zag in any interesting directions. The movie wants us to think that Disney was a super-swell genius, which pretty much guarantees that nuance, curiosity, or wit aren’t going to be part of the equation. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) (Rank: 29) There are many, many reasons people hate this 9/11 drama, but it’s hard to put the blame on Hanks. That’s largely because he’s barely in it, playing the dead father of the film’s autistic young hero (Thomas Horn) who goes on a quest across the city to solve a riddle his dad left for him. In flashbacks, Hanks is more than credible as a man who fears for his sensitive son, but the overt preciousness of this Oscar-nominated enterprise makes it hard to see that sincerity through the aggressive pretension. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS STRIKING ONE WEIRD NOTE Hanks has a prankster quality that’s a little underrated: Sometimes, he’ll just decide, “I’m doing one gag for a whole movie.” And generally he pulls it off. A League of Their Own (1992) (Rank: 7) Beefing up for his role as Jimmy Dugan, the alcoholic manager of a women-only baseball team, Hanks gets to play the lovable crank, the kind of part he didn’t do much after becoming a major movie star. A League of Their Own catches the actor in an interesting in-between spot in his career — he was rebounding from the failure of Bonfire of the Vanities, but not yet at the stage where he’d win back-to-back Oscars — and as such, it’s kind of a hoot to see him just bark at characters and be downright ornery. Of course, Dugan’s got a good heart underneath, and it’s the sort of one-note character that could have easily drifted into caricature, but Hanks elevates him through sheer force of his charisma and sweetness. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Terminal (2004) (Rank: 17) Steven Spielberg’s doodle about an optimistic, good-hearted Eastern European tourist who gets stuck in bureaucratic limbo and thus lives at New York’s JFK Airport for nearly a year is maybe a little too cute by half, but Hanks still makes you root for the guy, even when Spielberg is drowning in whimsy. That said, this has to be the most forgettable movie these two ever made together. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Ladykillers (2004) (Rank: 19) Hanks’s one Coen Brothers film is perhaps their most divisive and disliked one — it’s pretty broad, even for the Coens, and it really just has one joke — but it’s not Hanks’s fault. His Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr — the character is as subtle as the name — is cartoonish and silly and way way way over the top, but Hanks is clearly having a blast playing him. Hanks’s sincerity was never going to be a good fit with the Coens, but he does his best to get on their wavelength in a goofy, game-for-anything performance. The real problem here is that Hanks brings his A-game to a period of transition for the Coens, when they weren’t quite sure what their next step was going to be. (They figured it out.) Available with subscription on Showtime; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Cloud Atlas (2012) (Rank: 20) Pitched to him by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer as a combination of Moby-Dick and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Cloud Atlas is easily the most audacious film Hanks has ever made: a gonzo sci-fi epic that spans eras and languages, casting him in multiple roles. It’s also probably his most divisive, its strengths and weaknesses hopelessly linked and at war with one another. That’s just as true of Hanks’s performances, which are a warning that bad wigs and weird makeup do not good characters make. Hanks has never let loose quite the way he does in Cloud Atlas, and consequently there’s something oddly riveting about the risks he takes. But he falls flat on his face a whole lot here — and he should never, ever play a cockney again.

     Surprise gain in Japan core machinery orders points to capex pickup

    LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK
    (As reported by NewsRise)
     The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 8,759.50, trading down 1.67 pct from
its previous close.
     The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, tracking most
of its Asian peers, as hawkish comments from a U.S. Federal Reserve official
reignited speculation of a rate increase this month.
     Indian government bonds will likely open lower amid caution ahead of key
macroeconomic data releases later today. Bonds may also come under pressure
tracking gains in U.S. Treasury yields, amid speculation that the Federal
Reserve may consider hiking key interest rates at a meeting next week. The yield
on the benchmark 7.59 pct bond maturing in 2026 is likely to trade in a 7.03
pct-7.09 pct band.
   
    GLOBAL MARKETS
     U.S. stocks dropped on Friday, giving the S&P 500 its worst day since June
as investor nervousness increased following a nuclear test by North Korea and
Federal Reserve officials' comments lifted rate hike bets. 
     Asian shares skidded with investors rattled by rising bond yields and talk
the Federal Reserve might be serious about lifting U.S. interest rates as early
as next week. 
     The dollar began the week on the back foot as a bout of risk aversion
underpinned the yen, though the U.S. currency garnered some support on renewed
talk of a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve as early as this month.
 
     U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with long-dated maturities reaching
more than two-month highs, in line with Japanese government bonds, after reports
suggested the Bank of Japan is considering measures to cut short- to medium-term
yields, while lifting those of long-term debt. 
     Crude prices fell after U.S. oil drillers added rigs to look for new
production as producers adapt to cheaper crude, with speculators cutting
positions betting on further price rises. 
     Gold fell slightly early as hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve
officials late last week raised bets on a rate hike as early as September.

Joe Ledford jledford@kcstar.com 1 of 7 i By Laura Bauer lbauer@kcstar.com and Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When two people attacked a woman in a Shawnee Wal-Mart parking lot Sunday, two Good Samaritans came to her aid, authorities said. When it was over, one attacker was dead and one Good Samaritan was in critical condition at a hospital. Police later said he was awake and alert and scheduled for surgery later Sunday. The woman, who initially was hospitalized in critical condition with a head injury, was upgraded to good Sunday evening, and police said she might soon be released. Police Maj. Dan Tennis said the woman was attacked as she put her infant in a car seat about 1:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the store near Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road. The woman was struck in the back of the head. As she screamed, a Good Samaritan came to her aid. One of the attackers shot him multiple times. A second Good Samaritan then shot one of the attackers, killing that person, police said. The second attacker ran east from Wal-Mart, and a suspect was arrested by a K-9 team between Maurer and Lackman roads. Sunday evening, police said the wounded Good Samaritan was awake and alert. He was scheduled for surgery later in the day. The infant was not injured. The attack occurred on the east side of the store near the lawn and garden department. A section of the parking lot remained taped off at 4 p.m. A blue tarp, surrounded by orange cones, covered what apparently was the attacker’s body. About a dozen vehicles were inside the taped perimeter. Officers were trying to peer into the windows of one: a maroon SUV with temporary tags. People who were inside the store when the shooting occurred said there was no acknowledgment over the public address system. Jeanne Gardner of Merriam, who was shopping at the time, was unaware of events outside, but said she noticed the store had emptied out. “I’ve never been to Wal-Mart when it was this empty,” she said. She later decided that other customers must have learned about the attack from cellphones and left the store. One store greeter said that as soon as the shooting started, some people ran into the store to get out of the parking lot. The store remained open through the afternoon, but the lawn and garden area was closed. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Pause 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

These are the women that call the shots, and are currently building billion-dollar brands, as well as much more. The Most Powerful Women in Business list is compiled by Fortune editors, who consider four criteria: the size and importance of the woman's business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman's career and social and cultural influence. There are 22 CEOs on this year's list who together control $1.1 trillion in market capitalization. Beyoncé (No. 51) is the youngest person on the list at 35, followed by Amy Hood (No. 31), CFO of Microsoft, at 44. Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, EVP of CVS Health, CVS Health, landed on the list at No. 12, making her the first woman in retail to make the cut.   Here are the 8 Most Powerful Women in Retail:   1.Helena Foulkes, President of CVS/pharmacy, EVP of CVS Health, CVS Health Helena Foulkes, led CVS Health’s retail business to new revenue heights—up 6.2%, to $72 billion in 2015. Foulkes is also hoping to lift sales of general merchandise with initiatives like CVS’s new mobile payment app and upgraded beauty sections, scheduled to be in 4,000 CVS/pharmacy stores by the end of the year. 2.Angela Ahrendts, SVP, Retail and Online Stores, Apple Angela Ahrendts is responsible for some 12% of the company’s $233.7 billion in sales. Her first big retail project was the Apple Watch, even though it had mixed reviews. Now she is introducing a new store look, which includes a new landscaped help desk called the Genius Grove, movie-theater-size video screens, and a boardroom where app developers can share advice with small businesses. 3.Rosalind Brewer, CEO and President, Sam's Club, Walmart   Rosalind Brewer is investing in food offerings (more organics), remodeling stores, and locating new ones in higher-income areas. She’s looking for an edge through e-commerce, implementing in-store pickup for online orders and launching an app that lets customers pay without going through checkout.   4.Ann-Marie Campbell, EVP, U.S. store, Home Depot In January, Campbell was promoted from her role as head of the southern division of the home-improvement retailer to run all of Home ­Depot’s U.S. stores, which makes her responsible for some 90% of the company’s $88.5 billion in 2015 revenues and 350,000 employees. 5.Judith McKenna, EVP and COO, Walmart U.S., Walmart McKenna has been key in the company’s decision to invest $2.7 billion in training programs and raises for some 1.2 million U.S. store employees. She’s also pushing tech. Now all store and department managers get mobile devices so that they can spend more time on the floor rather than in the back room. 6.Barbara Rentler, CEO, Ross Stores Barbra Rentler opened 84 new stores in the company’s fiscal 2015 and has 90 in the pipeline this year. In the most recent quarter, the company beat expectations and upped its guidance. Ross Stores thrived in a competitive retail environment last year, with sales up 8%, to nearly $12 billion, and profits that passed the $1 billion threshold for the first time. 7.Crystal Hanlon, President, Northern Division, Home Depot Crystal Hanlon continues as president of the northern division of Home Depot, the company’s single largest unit, with $29.5 billion in revenues, some 800 stores, and 110,000 employees. Home Depot’s stock is up 16% in the past year, outpacing the surging S&P 500.   8.Shari Ballard, Senior EVP and President, U.S. Retail, Best Buy In May Shari Ballard was named senior executive vice president, shedding her HR role but adding the Mexico business as well as real estate to her purview. Ballard, who started as an assistant store manager, now oversees some 1,400 Best Buy stores, accounting for over 80% of the company’s overall revenues.   Click here to view the full Fortune's "Most Powerful Women 2016" list.

MintTwist Menu Skip to content Home Archive Guest post Thursday 3rd December 2009 by Elliott King Virtual Gets Real with Augmented Reality Augmented reality (AR) has become a hot topic among marketers, particularly in light of the release of Yelp’s Monocle app that allows users to see location-based reviews hovering on their iPhone screens. The technology has provoked repeat interest from Mashable, Wired, Fast Company, and ReadWriteWeb, while companies like IBM, GE, Best Buy, P&G, and Wal-Mart are moving beyond pure gimmick to truly connect with consumers via AR. The seminal promise of AR is as the touchstone technology allowing social networks, geo-based tracking, and the semantic web to converge. Put less geekily, think of AR as your personalized digital butler, who will get to know your behavior so specifically that it can prethink your choices based on your friends, location, and how you search online. The cyberpunk fictions have come to reality with AR, and the cultural ramifications are as powerful as the marketing opportunities. In this article, we’ll take a look at the fundamental ways in which augmented reality will reshape consumer behavior and interactive marketing, as well as a few companies and applications that are leading the way. From map to mindset What’s your relationship to the GPS unit in your car? Do you lament the loss of serendipity that resulted from depending on the tinny voice on your dash? More likely, you’ve learned to lean on your satellite siren and have blissfully embraced paperless travel. This adjustment to technology represents a step toward artificial intelligence, in which machines can learn our behavior and improve the way we live. Adopting GPS not only saves us time in our travels, it lets us clear our mental palette to make space for other thoughts, a “prethinking” process mirrored in augmented reality. Still in its nascent form until the majority of the public owns enabled smartphones, AR’s ability to layer 3-D images on a phone’s screen in the context of a person’s actual location makes it the touchstone technology galvanizing artificial intelligence and the promise of social marketing. The tech you shouldn’t see The trailer for Microsoft’s Xbox Project Natal announcement provides a key insight into the future of augmented reality, human behavior, and commerce. Noting from the outset that “no controller is required,” a typical family runs through a set of game scenarios based on their varying interests. A teenage boy karate-kicks an avatar, his older sister video chats with a friend who recommends a virtual dress to wear, and so on. Although facial and voice recognition enhance the game, we’re reminded that to enjoy the Xbox, “the only experience you need is life experience.” This idea is key — like your GPS, you forget about the tech and focus on the benefits. You augment your reality in the context of what you’re presented. Skewing social Augmented reality assigns relevance for users of the “outernet” via AR applications like Yelp’s Monocle that allow you to see location-specific user reviews on the screen of your iPhone by simply pointing your camera and clicking on links. The process is faster than looking online, especially once users search via multiple AR services that aggregate relevant data for their location. The result is crowd-sourced commerce and a prethinking reliance of users to make purchasing decisions once they’re nearing their destination rather than at home. Social networks take on a new and more immediate relevance when posts are seen in the context of physical space. Tagging taxonomies Geo-tagging lets you create text, audio, or video you can assign a physical location to via AR-enabled smartphones. When others come to that spot in the future, they’ll be able to experience the content you’ve left behind. This communal prethinking in relation to location will become commonplace, as will the virtual offers pushed our way when we’re in the vicinity of local stores. Prethinking via dating services like Match.com combined with geo-enabled tweets will alter cultural behavior as well. The sublime search Prethinking also applies to how we tag ourselves, an act that has direct repercussions on semantic search. Instead of relying on keywords that have multiple meanings depending on context and native language, search powered by augmented reality assigned to specific geo-locations will have the relevance of our physical actions. Taxonomies relating to our actual locations will transform reliance on clumsy search algorithms in lieu of actual behavior. This aggregated data will provide a wealth of information to marketers in terms of when to deliver key messaging and relevance to geography. And as identity standards like Open ID continue to evolve, consumers can set their geo-privacy preferences to avoid unwanted airvertising to create standards for outernet etiquette as well. Augmented reality becomes a transformative technology when campaigns move beyond Flash to demonstrate utility. Gimmicks can be useful to attract user attention, but AR needs to lead to relevant social or commercial connections. Georgia Tech’s zombie game provides an example of flash and function that can move the needle for commercial adoption of AR. We all enjoy slaughtering the undead, and moving around a placemat-like game board to see 3-D action via our smartphone screens is sweet. But when an actual Skittles candy is placed on the game board and game characters react to its presence, the applications for marketing become readily apparent. Virtual aisles in retail environments can be festooned with interactive characters or videos. Beer goggles take on a literal angle, and placemats will provide games that respond to various bottles or cans maximized for AR. Other services like Zugara’s Webcam Social Shopper let people virtually try on clothes, and users can take pictures of themselves to send to their friends on Facebook. Combining the AR app with crowd-sourced opinions from social networks provides utility along with the benefit of collaborative shopping. USAA has also proven that non-sexy AR applications can gain more traction than gimmicky campaigns. Its iPhone app allows people to take a picture of their checks for instant deposits, a simple yet profound action inasmuch as it engenders ease of financial transaction. As reported by eWeek in an article about the application, “USAA’s customers have conducted more than 13.3 million mobile transactions in 2009.” Prethinking leads to profits via AR-enabled utility. Jamais Cascio, the popular ethical futurist that regularly writes for Fast Company and other publications, dovetails the notions of prethinking combined with AR in his notion of “focus assistants,” or filtering tools that screen content you don’t want to receive. In his article for the Atlantic, “Get Smarter,” he notes that, “as our capacity to provide that filter gets faster and richer, it increasingly becomes something akin to collaborative intuition — in which everyone is effectively augmenting everyone else. This process of collective intuition is amplified by AR applications like Pelago’s visual storytelling tool, Whrrl. The service, according to CEO Jeff Holden, is a “real-time storytelling product for people’s daily lives,” which aggregates multiple tweets, posts, and updates to form a kind of visual Twitter. These communal events are also shared to the larger community, which can comment while stories take place. This process creates a form of public prethinking known as group awareness. And it’s the data culled from these multiple communal stories that will form the basis of future interactions in commerce and culture at large. More stories at Pike Place Fish MarketPowered by Whrrl Conclusion Augmented reality offers multiple touchpoints to interact with consumers in an intimate and impactful virtual landscape. When commercial experiences in the outernet honor consumer privacy, are relevant to location, and embrace communal group experience, marketers will benefit. But like GPS and our Xbox family demonstrated, AR is just a few steps away from being invisible. No experience is required and prethinking will become a habit without our realizing its taken place. Just remember that, like the mom at the end of the video, you can always turn the AR technology off. And unless marketers collaborate with consumers on their virtual sojourns, they’re likely to do the same to us.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - A woman has been released from the hospital and a good Samaritan who came to her aid is recovering after a suburban Kansas City Wal-Mart parking lot attack in which a suspect was killed. Police said the Kansas City, Kansas, woman was putting her baby in her car Sunday afternoon in the parking lot of a Walmart in Shawnee when two suspects hit her in the head from behind. Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis said a Kansas City, Missouri, man in the parking lot who tried to help was shot several times and is recovering after undergoing surgery. "They didn't know one another. He saw her and tried to help," said Tennis. Another good Samaritan from De Soto, Kansas, has been interviewed and released after fatally shooting 28-year-old John Simmons III, of Kansas City, Missouri. On Tuesday, Shawnee police said Arthur Fred Wyatt III, 27, of Overland Park, Kansas, was arrested. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping, and attempted aggravated robbery in connection to the incident at the Shawnee Walmart.  Shoppers at the Johnson County super center were disappointed by the violence, but said it could happen anywhere. "It makes me wonder about coming here at night though, but it happened in broad daylight on a Sunday.

A new study finds on average counties with Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. Azzam Study: Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation benefits counties NICHOLAS BERGIN Lincoln Journal Star Sep 11, 2016 (…) Kristin Streff, Lincoln Journal Star file Cattle graze at a feed yard outside Seward, Neb. in an undated file photo. A new study finds on average counties with Nebraska's livestock-friendly designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. Azzam "That is all we have here," said Jeff Metz, a rancher and county commissioner. "We're never going to get a large Wal-Mart or a Kawasaki. We're ag. And we want to tell everybody in this state or anybody that passes through, livestock is very important to us." That's why in 2005 Metz asked county leaders to have Morrill designated as Nebraska's first livestock friendly county through a program created by the Legislature two years earlier. Metz said he likes to think the designation has helped influence people to work and do business in the county, but he can't point to a direct link. It's a point that researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Oklahoma State University attempted to address in a recently published that found on average counties with the designation have gained more cattle farms and lost fewer hog farms than counties without it. The 37 counties that have earned the voluntary designation include northeast Nebraska's Dakota and Wayne. The study doesn't prove the designation leads to livestock expansion, said UNL agricultural economics professor Azzeddine Azzam, one of four authors, but it does show counties with the designation are doing better than their counterparts. "We're not studying cause and effect," Azzam said. Rather "it seems like those that have the designation have experienced in the case of cattle larger farm numbers and in the case of hogs it slowed down the exit of farms." Nebraska Farmers Union President John Hansen criticized both the program and the study saying it proved nothing. Hansen said there are no tangible benefits to the designation and counties that have sought it already were livestock-centric. "We have some serious concerns and issues with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture relative to how they have been administering the livestock friendly counties programs," Hansen said. He went on to say the department has shown a bias toward massive, corporate-owned facilities over local control. Mat Habrock, assistant director of the state Ag Department, responded that the designation is entirely voluntary. "Local control is still very much tied into this, because it is the county's decision to go through the review process," Habrock said. The state Ag Department reviewed the professor's study before it was recently published in the . The major benefit of the designation is bragging rights. The designation is used on signage and marketing sites within the livestock industry. "It's a willingness from the county to show that they're open for business, and they recognize the important role animal agriculture can play," Habrock said. Habrock added that many factors account for livestock expansion and that there are counties friendly to agriculture that have not sought the designation. The study based its findings on the number of cattle and hog farms reported in each of Nebraska's 93 counties in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's census in 2002, 2007 and 2012. The study did not look at the number of animals or the size of the farms. For cattle, before 2007 nearly all counties lost farms. But from 2007 to 2012 16 of the 21 counties with livestock friendly designations reported more farms. Counties with the designation increased their overall cattle farm numbers by 12 percent, while those not designated saw increases of 8 percent. One surprising finding was a negative effect on cattle farms in counties in the program the longest. Morrill County, for example, lost 11 cattle farms from 2007 to 2012. "One possible explanation for this would be that those counties that joined early have other unexplained factors leading to the decrease in cattle numbers. These factors may have been one reason that led to the county joining the program," the paper says. For hog farms from 2007 to 2012, counties with the designation saw a 16 percent drop, meanwhile counties without it lost 38 percent of farms, the study shows. To earn a livestock friendly designation, a county must hold a public hearing and adopt a declaration acknowledging the importance of livestock to the well-being of the county and provide the state copies of its livestock zoning requirements, among other things. To date, 37 counties have received the designation. The designation doesn't guarantee livestock expansion will happen without controversy. In Gage County, designated livestock friendly in 2012, the board of supervisors this summer rejected a special use permit for a poultry farm that would have housed 150,000 birds east of Cortland. Board members said too many variables came with the project related to manure storage and disposal of dead chickens. Habrock said the state Ag Department is watching the situation but has not yet taken a position on whether it will affect the county's livestock friendly designation. Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said the study demonstrates the value of embracing livestock as an economic development tool. "Nebraska Farm Bureau was very supportive of the legislation that created the Livestock Friendly County program and we've had numerous County Farm Bureaus that have worked with their local elected leaders to secure the Livestock Friendly designation for their county," Nelson said. "It's our hope the study will encourage additional counties to give consideration to the program."

The store put up a display that used Coke and Sprite boxes to create an American flag backdrop. In front of it, Coke Zero packages were stacked to resemble the towers. A banner above read, “We will never forget.” A photo of the display was posted on Twitter earlier this week and it quickly drew condemnation from social media users. Wal-Mart said in a statement the display was removed Wednesday. “We hold this moment in our country’s history in the highest regard, and there was nothing disrespectful intended by the display,” it said. The company said the design for the display for the store came from the supplier and was approved by its store management. The Coca-Cola bottler for the region said the display was meant to honor local firefighters and support an upcoming event for their organization. “We sincerely apologize that anyone was offended or misunderstood its intent, and we have replaced the display,” the bottler said.

McIntyre September 11, 2016 9:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) have jockeyed for the lead as America’s most valuable company, each with a market cap of about $550 billion. One tech giant vs. another. A look at the top 20 American public corporations reveals several other close comparisons One note is that the top five positions on the market cap table are tech companies, and have left large energy companies behind. After Apple and Alphabet are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) at $435 billion, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) at $364 billion, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) at $360 billion. All five companies are trying to play in at least one of the others’ backyards. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are among the cloud computing leaders. Amazon and Apple continue to fight each other for dominance in the streaming media market. Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the mobile OS market. The only company on the list without a significant challenger is Facebook, one of the reasons its market cap is so high. Exxon Mobile (NYSE: XOM) is tied with Amazon in market cap, at $360 billion. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is also on the list at $191 billion. Big oil has not been entirely kicked off the list Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is on the list at $217 billion. Investors in rival Amazon and Walmart cannot help noting how far bricks and mortars have fallen behind e-commerce. Walmart is trying to catch up, piecemeal, most recently with its $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Two major banks are on the list, with market caps fairly close to one another. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) at $240 billion and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) at $245 billion. And, finally the two largest phone companies and wireless providers in the U.S. AT&T (NYSE: T) at $244 billion, and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) at $211 billion (Notably, no car companies are on the list, a departure from decades ago Top 20 market cap companies, courtesy of The Online Investor Large Cap Company                       Ticker    Market Cap ($in billions) Apple Inc                                          AAPL      555.71 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOGL     541.90 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOG      522.09 Microsoft Corporation                   MSFT      438.02 Facebook Inc                                   FB        364.99 Amazon.com Inc.                          AMZN      360.36 Exxon Mobil Corp.                       XOM       360.10 Johnson & Johnson                     JNJ       323.46 General Electric Co                      GE        269.82 Wells Fargo & Co.                        WFC       245.82 AT&T Inc                                       T         244.30 JPMorgan Chase & Co                  JPM       240.74 Procter & Gamble Co.                   PG        230.21 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.                   WMT       217.46 Verizon Communications Inc             VZ        211.23 Pfizer Inc                                         PFE       206.84 Visa Inc                                            V         191.94 Chevron Corporation                     CVX       191.05 Berkshire Hathaway Inc                 BRK.B     188.03 Coca-Cola Co (The)                        KO        182.44 By Douglas A.

Russell Berman 4:50 AM ET Derek Thompson October 2016 Issue Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Botanists define a rheophyte as an aquatic plant that thrives in swift-moving water. Coming from the Greek word rhéos, meaning a flow or stream, the term describes plants with wide roots and flexible stalks, well adapted to strong currents rather than a pond’s or pasture’s stillness. For most of the 20th century, U.S. lawmakers worked to maintain just these sorts of conditions for the U.S. economy—a dynamic system, briskly flowing, that forced firms to adapt to the unpredictable currents of the free market or be washed away. In the past few decades, however, the economy has come to resemble something more like a stagnant pool. Entrepreneurship, as measured by the rate of new-business formation, has declined in each decade since the 1970s, and adults under 35 (a k a Millennials) are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation on record. This decline in dynamism has coincided with the rise of extraordinarily large and profitable firms that look discomfortingly like the monopolies and oligopolies of the 19th century. American strip malls and yellow pages used to brim with new small businesses. But today, in a lot where several mom-and-pop shops might once have opened, Walmart spawns another superstore. In almost every sector of the economy—including manufacturing, construction, retail, and the entire service sector—the big companies are getting bigger. The share of all businesses that are new firms, meanwhile, has fallen by 50 percent since 1978. According to the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank dedicated to advancing the ideals of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, “markets are now more concentrated and less competitive than at any point since the Gilded Age.” From Our October 2016 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe To comprehend the scope of corporate consolidation, imagine a day in the life of a typical American and ask: How long does it take for her to interact with a market that isn’t nearly monopolized? She wakes up to browse the internet, access to which is sold through a local monopoly. She stocks up on food at a superstore such as Walmart, which owns a quarter of the grocery market. If she gets indigestion, she might go to a pharmacy, likely owned by one of three companies controlling 99 percent of that market. If she’s stressed and wants to relax outside the shadow of an oligopoly, she’ll have to stay away from ebooks, music, and beer; two companies control more than half of all sales in each of these markets. There is no escape—literally. She can try boarding an airplane, but four corporations control 80 percent of the seats on domestic flights. Politicians from both parties publicly worship the solemn dignity of entrepreneurship and small businesses. But by the numbers, America has become the land of the big and the home of the consolidated. This is a problem. But it is not an accident. The bigness of business is a result of federal policy, which, in the past three decades, has deliberately made it easier for large companies to dominate their markets, provided that they keep prices down. After years of sluggish wage growth and low levels of entrepreneurship, some people are starting to worry that America’s biggest companies are growing at the expense of the economy, even if they offer consumers good deals. In the late 19th century, when the U.S. was beginning to develop into an industrial powerhouse, it was America’s first small-business owners—farmers—who initially pushed the government to intervene against trusts. They protested discriminatory shipping rates along rail lines, which were dominated by a handful of railroad magnates. Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 to break up the trusts and protect competitive markets, but it took decades for the law to serve this purpose. (In fact, in the 1890s, the railroads used the act’s language against their own workers, arguing that a labor-union strike amounted to an illegal “conspiracy to restrict trade.”) Several Supreme Court decisions ultimately stiffened U.S. antitrust law. Perhaps the most important decision came in 1911, when the Court ruled that Standard Oil Company of New Jersey’s ownership of nearly 90 percent of U.S. oil production violated the law. The early antitrust reformers warned that even beyond its effect on prices, economic power could buy influence in Congress. Monopolies don’t just dominate their own industries, Justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933; they monopolize political power as well, which allows them to protect their incumbency and stifle competition in myriad ways. The trust-busting ethos gathered momentum; President Roosevelt transformed the antitrust division of the Justice Department from a tiny office of just over a dozen lawyers to a muscular force of nearly 500. But in the late 1970s and early 1980s, several prominent conservatives succeeded in persuading Washington—especially the Justice Department—to abandon its old dogmas about big business. In a book that galvanized a movement, The Antitrust Paradox, Robert Bork argued that the government fetishized competition and often leveled the playing field for the benefit of poorly run companies. The book argued that by protecting bad companies for the sake of competition, the government was keeping prices higher than they would be if the most-efficient companies were allowed to dominate. The Justice Department’s rules on vertical and horizontal mergers were rewritten to make it easier for large companies to merge, as long as the new, larger business could deliver lower prices. So antitrust law shifted over the course of the 20th century from principally protecting competition to principally protecting consumers. Today many reformers are calling for the pendulum to swing back. In a speech at the nonpartisan think tank New America in June, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that rule changes inspired by Bork have, well, borked America’s competitive spirit. Corporations that grew through mergers weren’t the only targets of her criticism. She also called out technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (the parent company of Google) for abusing their economic power. She accused Apple, for example, of using the iPhone to punish the music-streaming service Spotify and help its own equivalent product. “While Apple Music is readily accessible on everyone’s iPhone, Apple has placed conditions on its rivals that make it difficult for them to offer competing streaming services,” she said. Warren’s main argument was that allowing companies to grow without fear of interference from the Justice Department has stilled the waters of American dynamism. “Left unchecked, concentration will destroy innovation,” she said, before listing other casualties: start-ups, small companies, the economic security of the middle class. “Left unchecked,” she concluded, “concentration will pervert our democracy into one more rigged game.” By the numbers, America has become the land of the big and the home of the consolidated. Her clarion call has resonated with allies in Washington, not only for economic reasons, but also because, in an age of divided government, progressives are looking for an agenda that they can enact without groveling before a do-nothing Congress. The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers has published a lengthy report on the benefits of competition, and the Roosevelt Institute has called on the government to buff up its antitrust policy, in part by increasing scrutiny of how a potential merger would affect long-term competition and dynamism in the sector. Warren would like to see a renewed focus on companies that have grown large organically as well—for example, by getting the Federal Trade Commission to more fiercely fight anticompetitive behavior, such as Apple’s stonewalling of Spotify. All told, this would mean the most aggressive attempt to curb the growth of big business since the New Deal. But how big can a company get before it’s inherently bad for the economy? The technology sector presents a thorny problem for antitrust reformers. Between too-big-to-fail banks and seemingly incompetent cable companies, there may be popular support for action against consolidated market power. But many of the companies in Warren’s crosshairs are beloved. The three most admired American companies are Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon, according to Fortune; Facebook is in the top 15 and rising fast. Our attention seems to be ever more focused on our phones, and Apple owns 40 percent of the U.S. smartphone market; between them, Google and Facebook collect more than half of all mobile-display advertising revenues. If mobile phones, software, and social networks eat the world, who decides how big the portions can be? “I think this is the big policy question for this moment,” says Sabeel Rahman, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “Where do we draw the line between ‘good’ bigness and ‘bad’ bigness?” The debate is more than a century old. In the 1930s, Brandeis argued that large companies would inevitably exploit their workers, convert their profits into political influence, and corrode both the market and the machinations of government. But the Reagan administration and subsequent lawmakers have allowed vertical and horizontal integration on the theory that economies of scale often benefit both employees and consumers. The new antitrust crusaders are manning an old trench with fresh ammo. Brandeis was right, they argue, and the evidence of his rightness abounds: Citizens United has empowered business at the same time corporate profits have been hitting an all-time high; wages are stagnating at the same time stock buybacks and dividends soar; corporate mergers are spiking as entrepreneurship languishes; mom-and-pop stores are shuttering as corporate franchises fill the empty spaces. For decades, Bork and his acolytes had the U.S. government convinced that competition was overrated. But perhaps capitalism needs churn like some aquatic plants need a current. The free market is rheophytic. Bigger is not always bad, but if we’ve learned anything in the past three decades, it’s that a little froth is always good.

Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) whom Donald Trump has reportedly picked to be his national security adviser, is known for his long and distinguished military career, his unceremonious exit from the DIA, and for his controversial views on Islam, torture, and Russia. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was an early and ardent supporter of Trump’s improbable presidential run, giving the Republican presidential hopeful a much-needed endorsement from the national-security establishment. He led crowds at Trump’s rallies to chant “Lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent. “Donald Trump is about the future of this country and making sure that we take a direction … that puts us back on a track that we can continue to be the global leader around the world,” he told Fox Business Network in July. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Jacky Naegelen / Reuters The Problem With Abandoning the Paris Agreement Robinson Meyer Bill O’Reilly and Barack Obama agree: President-Elect Trump shouldn’t walk away from the first international climate treaty. If the Trump administration withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement, the country would face a massive global diplomatic backlash and permanently cede worldwide leadership on climate and renewable-energy issues to China, experts warn. Withdrawing from the treaty “would be a huge mistake, even forgetting about climate change,” said Todd Stern, the former U.S. special envoy on climate change. He added that it would have “radiating bad impacts with respect to U.S. standing” on all other international issues. We know very little for sure about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. So far, he has seemed to choose Russia-friendly advisors like General Michael Flynn, and he has not backed down from previous threats of a trade war with China. If the U.S. were to renege on its NATO commitments or enter a battle of tariffs with China, this could so remake global order that climate would slide off the international agenda. Continue Reading Adult Swim The Battle Over Adult Swim’s Alt-Right TV Show David Sims The future of the sketch series Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace has become a political flashpoint for the subversive network. At a glance, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim, the alternative, late-night comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 p.m. One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel, the show lurches from one surreal, sometimes violent, sketch to the next, and describes itself as being set in an “almost present-day, post-apocalyptic nightmare world.” But Million Dollar Extreme, which premiered in August, is also from the mind of Sam Hyde, an unapologetic member of the alt-right. Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young, liberal, Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to like-minded members of a white-nationalist movement that generally supports Donald Trump. Continue Reading Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Will Trump Be Ready to Govern? Russell Berman The early days of his transition have looked like chaos, but veterans of the process say the president-elect has time to catch up. This was not exactly how the 2016 presidential transition was supposed to go. For years, legislators, civil servants, good-government advocates, and veterans of the last several administrations had been preparing for this very moment. Congress had passed two new laws allowing the two major-party nominees to begin planning earlier than ever, and the Obama administration was committed to handing off the baton of government in full stride. The singular goal was to make this transfer of presidential power the smoothest, most effective transition in U.S. history. Then came the unexpected victory of Donald Trump to blow it all to bits. The Trump transition has looked, from the outside, like a mess. Days after winning the presidency, the new president-elect abruptly replaced the man who for months had been running his transition efforts, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with the soon-to-be vice president, Mike Pence. Other departures quickly followed in what was described as “a purge” of people close to Christie. The leadership swap caused an important paperwork snafu, delaying by several days the point when Trump’s “landing teams” of potential appointees could begin on-the-job training at federal departments and agencies. A former national-security official in Republican administrations, Eliot Cohen, emerged from a single conversation with the transition team only to warn others to stay away. One of Trump’s first appointments, chief strategist Steve Bannon, prompted a firestorm of criticism over his website’s links to white nationalism. Leaks flowed out of Trump Tower faster than transition staff could plug them, while the president-elect himself sneaked away from his press corps for an evening out at the 21 Club in Manhattan.

Alana Semuels So-called activist investors are increasingly gaining control of legacy corporations, forcing them to trim payrolls and downsize research operations—and, quite possibly, damaging the entire economy. WILMINGTON, Del.—Ron Ozer was thrilled to get a job with DuPont, the two-centuries-old chemical company, when he finished his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1990. It was the place to go for young, ambitious chemists; it offered salary and benefits so generous that some people called it “Uncle Dupey.” For 26 years, he invented things for DuPont, filing patent after patent, working on renewable plastic bottles and polymers from the company’s Experimental Station, a research lab where Kevlar, Neoprene, and nylon were all invented. Then, in January of this year, he was abruptly fired, along with hundreds of other employees at the Experimental Station, part of a company-wide wave of 1,700 layoffs, one-third of DuPont’s Delaware workforce. Globally, DuPont cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 5,000 people in early 2016.

What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Sep 12, 2016 at 4:45PM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) sales have been essentially flat year to date. For the 52-week fiscal year which closed Aug. 28, the warehouse club reported net sales of $116.1 billion, a 2% increase from the $113.7 billion reported last year. Those numbers aren't awful, but they hint at weakness. When it comes to comparable sales, the numbers weren't great either, though they look better after adjusting for falling gas prices and foreign currency exchange. After the adjustment, the increase in the United States jumps from 2% to 3% and the Canada numbers go from a 3% decline to an 8% gain. International numbers were similar, moving from a 3% dip before adjustment to a 4% positive move after. Still, overall, before the adjustment, 52-week growth was 0%, and after it was only a 4% gain. Those are mediocre results, which point to three things that could hurt Costco's stock price going forward. Costco's business model has been to drive people to its stores. Image source: author. Competitors are getting better As a warehouse club, the Costco model is built on offering great prices but limited selection. In the past, that made other warehouse clubs such as Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club its only real competition. Now, however, the chain increasingly has to deal with traditional stores offering aggressive pricing. Wal-Mart specifically has committed to spending billions to lower prices. That's a big problem for Costco, because the traditional retailer's deals don't require buying food in specific large quantities. If a regular grocery store will sell a box of cereal at a price close to what Costco charges, but the warehouse club requires buying two extra-large boxes, it's easy to see why consumers may shy away from bulk purchases. That's not a big problem if it simply costs Costco some sales, but it becomes a much bigger issue if consumers stop believing Costco consistently has the best deal. If that happens, people will drop their memberships -- and fees from people paying their annual dues accounts for 75% of the chain's profits. Essentially it's OK if consumers go to the warehouse club less, as long as they still see the value of remaining members. It's possible that more aggressive traditional stores will tip the balance in favor of people who drop their membership. Amazon makes everything easy Costco has mostly ignored the Internet because it's built its business around driving people to its stores. That makes sense because once people hit a warehouse, they can be enticed into buying things they'd not planned on. In addition, part of the Costco mystique revolves around bargain hunting in its stores. That's generally been a strong formula. People join Costco partly because it's fun to shop in the stores even when you don't buy anything. Add that to the fact that prices are generally below other options (albeit with the hassle of having to buy in bulk), and you can see why the chain has thrived. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already taken away one of those advantages. It has comparable, and in some cases lower, prices than the warehouse club chain. It also has improved delivery to the point that it can get pretty much anything to consumers in two days or less. What Amazon hasn't equaled is the experience of exploring a Costco store. It's still fun to walk into one of the chain's locations and discover that you really need a kayak or a palette of K-Cups. Online retail has struggled to equal that experience, but Amazon has gotten better at it with its flash sales and Prime Day, which had a bit of the unknown that Costco does so well turning into sales. Should Costco shareholders worry? The big concern is that these two problems have been evident for a long time and management hasn't done much to address them. Price competition has been a reality since Amazon became a major player, and it's doing a better job getting consumers to buy more than they intended to or purchase items just because the price is right. Costco has a long runway. It's not a retailer being obliterated by discounters or the internet, but there are signs of weakness. These are two areas to watch -- and concerns management needs to do more to address. Neither presents a reason to panic, but growth has slowed, and this might explain why.

Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed should not raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged on Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem "noncommittal" and aren't sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of 1%? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3%, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5%, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7%, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose 1.64 dollars, or 2.3%, to 71.94 dollars and Procter & Gamble gained 2.01 dollars, or 2.3%, to 88.25 dollars. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained one dollar, or 2.5%, to 40.71 dollars. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses on Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for 1.05 billion dollars, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9%, to 14.49 dollars. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose 2.31 dollars, or 2.2%, to 105.44 dollars and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up 3.70 dollars, or 2.3%, to 164.48 dollars. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at 36 billion dollars, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2%, to 16.76 dollars and Agrium dipped 2.57 dollars, or 2.7%, to 92.64 dollars. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's Dax fell 1.3% while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2%. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7% and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3%. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4%. US stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there was a case to be made the US central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Mr Rosengren and Mr Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added 6.52 dollars, or 7.3%, to 95.23 dollars after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6% stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock has not done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. US crude rose 41 cents to 46.29 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to 48.32 dollars a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 1.19 dollars, or 3%, to 37.95 dollars. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol gained three cents to 1.39 dollars a gallon. Heating oil added one cent to 1.44 dollars a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2%, to 2.92 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 8.90 dollars to 1,325.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9%, to 19 dollars an ounce. Copper gained one cent to 2.10 dollars a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.68%. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to 1.1241 from 1.1228 dollars. KEYWORDS: stocks, federal reserve, interest rates, ftse   send us stuff PreviousNext Want us to email you the top news stories each lunchtime?

Germany's Dax fell 1.3% while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2%. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7% and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3%. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4%. US stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there was a case to be made the US central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Mr Rosengren and Mr Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added 6.52 dollars, or 7.3%, to 95.23 dollars after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6% stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock has not done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. US crude rose 41 cents to 46.29 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to 48.32 dollars a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 1.19 dollars, or 3%, to 37.95 dollars. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol gained three cents to 1.39 dollars a gallon. Heating oil added one cent to 1.44 dollars a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2%, to 2.92 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 8.90 dollars to 1,325.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9%, to 19 dollars an ounce. Copper gained one cent to 2.10 dollars a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.68%. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to 1.1241 from 1.1228 dollars.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks surged Monday after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank shouldn't raise interest rates too soon, which came as a big relief to investors. After a market nosedive on Friday, investors bought safe investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem "noncommittal" and aren't sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of one percent? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $14.49. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $105.44 and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up $3.70, or 2.3 percent, to $164.48. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.76 and Agrium dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent.

Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell $1.19, or 3 percent, to $37.95. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it.

Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1241 from $1.1228. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

By Annie Sciacca | asciacca@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: September 12, 2016 at 12:20 pm | UPDATED: September 14, 2016 at 8:06 am As the Bay Area’s population continues to boom, new grocery stores are pouring in to serve them. Three new Safeway stores are slated to open around the Bay Area this week. On Wednesday, Safeway stores will open in The Orchards shopping center in Walnut Creek, The Ridge center in Oakland and The Fairmont shopping center in Pacifica. “We are excited to open three new stores to meet the needs of our customers and create new jobs in the Bay Area,”  said Tom Schwilke, president of Safeway Northern California, in a company statement. “These new stores will give customers new local, fresh and organic options.” In line with the popularity of the local food movement, the new Safeway stores will highlight a collection of local products that will be marked with “local” tags throughout the store. The grocer has partnered with produce growers and Cal-Organic Farms to carry popular local brands like Clover Stornetta Dairy Farms and Three Twins Ice Cream from Petaluma and Rocky Chicken from Sonoma County. Like other Safeway stores, the new locations will have a deli section and a full-service floral department. The Oakland and Walnut Creek stores will include a Starbucks counter, a pharmacy and a selection of bulk foods. The stores will also offer grocery delivery, a program the grocer is expanding across its network, joining Walmart, Amazon and startups like Instacart in the food-delivery fray. The store opening in The Orchards shopping center, on Ygnacio Valley Road in Walnut Creek, is the anchor tenant among a slew of others slated to open in the new center soon. Florida-based discount retailer Stein Mart will open on Friday, and a 10,030-square-foot Petco opens Sept. 28. Other tenants include Starbucks, Wells Fargo, Safe America Credit Union, Elements Massage, MOD Pizza, Burger Lounge, Crunch gym and Pancheros Mexican Grill, among others. In addition to retail and restaurant tenants, the 25-acre development includes open space, trails and senior housing built by Northern California Presbyterian Homes and Services and Walnut Creek-based Episcopal Senior Communities. Oakland’s Safeway will anchor new shopping center The Ridge, a 300,000-square-foot development that replaced the former Rockridge Shopping Center on Broadway. Pet Food Express and Boston Market are some of the other tenants there. In Pacifica, the new Safeway replaces a Lucky’s that closed in the Fairmont Center last year. The new store openings by Safeway follow its merger with Albertsons early last year. It isn’t the only grocery chain expanding in the region, however. A 37,500-square-foot Whole Foods is scheduled to open in November in the Encina Grande shopping center, just across the street from Safeway-anchored The Orchards. A Sprouts Farmers Market grocery store opened on Broadway earlier this year, in Oakland’s Auto Row district. And a new 365 — Whole Foods Market’s “affordable” concept —  is coming to the shopping center that will be built on the former Chevron campus on Diamond Boulevard in Concord. The new grocery options follow the Bay Area’s dramatic population growth in recent years. The Bay Area accounted for five of the state’s seven fastest-growing counties so far this decade, according to a 2015 census report. Alameda County was the fastest-growing county in the state, having added more than 100,000 residents from April 2010 to June 2014. Contra Costa ranked fifth in growth statewide, with more than 60,000 new residents, and third in the Bay Area.

Photo / AP Wall Street climbed after comments by US Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard bolstered bets the central bank won't raise interest rates next week. "In today's new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness," Brainard said in prepared remarks for a speech in Chicago. "This asymmetry in risk management in today's new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation." The Federal Open Market Committee, of which Brainard is a permanent voting member, begins its next two-day meeting on September 20. Traders reduced their expectations for a September rate hike to 15 per cent from 24 per cent on Friday and for a December hike to 54.5 per cent from 59.2 per cent, Reuters reported, citing the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief. In 3.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.3 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.6 per cent. In 2.53pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 1.5 per cent. Gains in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, last up 2.3 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, led the Dow higher. US Treasures briefly rose on Brainard's comments, then fell, pushing yields on the benchmark 10-year note one basis point higher to 1.68 per cent at 1.45pm New York time. "She didn't change the tone of what she had been saying much, and I think the snap rally was only because the market may have been preparing for a hawkish surprise," Aaron Kohli at BMO Capital Markets Corp, a fixed-income strategist in New York at BMO, one of the Fed's 23 primary dealers, told Bloomberg.

Following the close of the transaction, expected during mid-2017, Potash Corp shareholders will own about 52 per cent of the new company, and Agrium shareholders will own the remainder. Agrium shares traded 2.6 per cent lower as of 2.12pm in Toronto, while Potash Corp shares last traded 1 percent weaker as of 2.06pm in Toronto.

The Myrtle Beach store will be located at 2625 Beaver Run Blvd. near the Surfside Beach Wal-Mart off of S.C. 544, according to Krysta Cearley, vice president of the ALDI Salisbury Division. The new North Myrtle Beach location will be at 244 U.S. 17 North in the Surfwood Shopping Center off of Second Avenue North. “We look at a lot of factors before choosing an ALDI location, like population density, proximity to competition, cost of the property and traffic patterns,” Cearley said. “We want to be conveniently located for our shoppers.” A job fair to staff the two new stores was held Monday at the Hilton Garden Inn near Coastal Grand Mall. Representatives of the grocery store chain are looking to hire store associates and managers with starting salaries ranging from $11.35 an hour for associates to $53,352 a year for managers in training.

Is a Supermodel the Fix? Can a partnership with Gigi Hadid and a carnival on a pier help restore the aging brand's 90s-era luster? Kim Bhasin @KimBhasin More stories by Kim Bhasin September 12, 2016 — 3:26 PM EDT Model Gigi Hadid and designer Tommy Hilfiger walk the runway at #TOMMYNOW Women's Fashion Show at Pier 16 on Sept. 9 in New York City. Photographer: Randy Brooke/Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger The moment the superfamous began filing onto Pier 16 at New York's South Street Seaport on Friday, it was obvious Tommy Hilfiger's fall fashion show was about so much more than the clothes—if it were even about the clothes at all. Bulbs flashed early as Taylor Swift and her supermodel squad member Martha Hunt glided to their seats, perching next to Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner followed. The producers cranked up the lights and music, and Gigi Hadid came out blazing in a navy-and-white jacket and leather pants. Spectators jostled, craning for a good Instagram angle. If the idea was to attract attention, it worked. The extravaganza was part of a hype train meant to woo younger shoppers and imbue the Hilfiger name with the coolness it once enjoyed. Much of the brand's luster from the 1990s has faded, pushed aside by indie brands, internet upstarts, and fast-fashion stores as shoppers demanded individuality over mass-market normality. Tommy Hilfiger has done well abroad in recent years by exporting classic American style to Europe and Asia, where its retail shops are thriving. Not so at home. Its North American business hasn't posted positive comparative store sales for eight straight quarters. At one point, Hilfiger even considered selling its clothes at Wal-Mart.  For Friday's show, the label, owned by Calvin Klein and Izod parent PVH Corp., had built a carnival on the pier. The Tommy Pier, as the brand dubbed it, marked a new era of fashion show, a commercial event staged for both industry insiders and the public. Fashion VIPs packed half the catwalk; general-admission attendees filed into the other after waiting in line to score a spot. Food stands churned out lobster rolls, hot dogs, and fries. Guests got their nails done, pasted on temporary tattoos, played carnival games, or hopped on rides.  How to live the good life. (Even if it’s vicariously.) Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.

Red, white, blue, and nautical styles ruled the runway as the models walked the lengthy wooden aisle, with Rihanna and Skrillex songs belted into the night sky. The clothes, though mostly casual, managed to bridge levels of formality, from cherry red tracksuits to long, sheer cocktail dresses. They were safe, wearable, and available to buy immediately—not six months later, as the traditional fashion calendar demands. Still, amid the overwhelming spectacle, it was hard to concentrate on the clothes, as the women strode past the Ferris wheel under dangling lights. From left, Yolanda Hadid, Anwar Hadid, Taylor Swift, Martha Hunt, and Lewis Hamilton attend the Tommy Hilfiger Women's Fashion Show. Photographer: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger This was no mere launch party for a new line. Hadid is signed as Tommy Hilfiger's global ambassador, and PVH plans to build its women's business around her. That business now accounts for just 25 percent of Hilfiger's sales; executives want to pull that ratio closer to 50 percent. "It's also a part of an overall marketing strategy to build up our women's business globally," Emanuel Chirico, chief executive officer of PVH, said of the Hadid event at a conference last month. "We think it's a huge opportunity." Fashion shows were once insider affairs, a place for magazine editors to critique clothes for future issues and for retail buyers to decide which designs they'd put on store shelves. All these things still happen, but at shows like Tommy Hilfiger's, everything—including the clothes—seems secondary to celebrity. In a social media era marked by instant access and shareability, labels are now finding ways to include the public, whether by letting people attend shows in person or by streaming them online. Guests attend the Tommy Hilfiger Women's Fashion Show at Pier 16. Photographer: Grant Lamos IV/Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger Hadid is the centerpiece of this U.S. revival effort, using the Tommy x Gigi collection to get young people aboard in a hurry. Compare the Hilfiger fashion show with her usual appearances: A day before, Tom Ford snuck her into the middle of his presentation. And when Victoria's Secret last year picked her to show off its casual Pink line geared at young women, it slotted her like any other model. But the Hilfiger show was a full-on collaboration, with ballyhoo from both parties for more than nine months. It was about her as much as Hilfiger—perhaps because the label needs her more than she needs it. Hadid gives it instant credibility and exposure among her legions of young fans. "She has an amazing sense of style, but at the same time as being a supermodel, she's probably the most important social media star in the world," Hilfiger, the designer, said on ABC's Good Morning America the morning before the show. On Friday night, once the last models were off the pier and the congregation had been herded to the exits, gawkers and paparazzi awaited the celebrities outside. A mob of teens—and adults, for that matter—squealed and rushed to get a glimpse of Swift as she squeezed into a black SUV. As she was whisked away, they turned their gaze to Hadid, now scrambling across the street as a logjam of drivers honked at the holdup. Two frantic parents yelled for their child, who'd scurried off for a closer look in the chaos. And the crowd, weaving through cars, chased Hadid onto the seaport cobblestones until she ducked into a building. They all wanted a piece of Gigi Hadid. Hilfiger hopes they'll want a piece of Tommy, too. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

After a market nosedive on Friday, investors are putting money into safe-play investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies are also higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,285 as of 12:08 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 26 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,154. The Nasdaq composite surged 73 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,198. VIDEOS TOP JOBS BRAINARD POWER: Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard said Monday that the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates too soon because higher rates could hurt the economy. U.S. stocks plunged about 2.5 percent Friday, their biggest loss in two months, after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there's a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Rosengren and Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly, and if both of them had a change of heart, that would have meant it was much more likely the Fed will raise interest rates soon. The Fed's leaders will meet next week. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. SANCTUARY: Investors bought investments that they see as low-risk, including household goods companies. Retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.35, or 1.9 percent, to $71.65 and toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive gained $1.37, or 1.9 percent, to $72.23. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained 80 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.51. FERTILE SOIL: Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskachewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and they expect the deal to close in the middle of next year. Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 23 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.74 and Agrium dipped $2.81, or 3 percent, to $92.40. CTRL+ALT+P: HP stock edged higher after the company agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion. That division has more than 6,500 printing patents. HP rose 42 cents, or 4 percent, to $14.37. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $1.71, or 1.7 percent, to $104.84 and Broadcom picked up $2.70, or 1.7 percent, to $163.48. PERRI-GOING UP: Irish drug and ingredient maker Perrigo added $6.27, or 7.1 percent, to $94.98 after the activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6-percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to make changes to its business, including boosting profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. OIL: U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 85 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $38.29. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline that is intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop the project and several agencies said they will reconsider some of their decisions. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of the pipeline, which comes within a mile of a reservation in southern North Dakota. RAPTOR ROARS: Rare disease drugmaker Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. climbed $1.51, or 20.3 percent, to $8.96 after Horizon Pharma said it will buy the company $9 per share, or about $768 million. Horizon added $1.41, or 8.2 percent, to $18.67. TEXT ME BACK: Software company Open Text climbed $5.23, or 8.8 percent, to $65 after it said it will buy a unit of Dell EMC for $1.62 billion. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX was down 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also fell 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. BONDS, CURRENCIES: Bond prices rose and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.80 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro edged up to $1.1239 from $1.1228.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

NBC 5’s Regina Waldroup reports. (Published 3 hours ago) After decades of tireless work, an elderly Chicago street vendor will be getting some much-needed financial help all because of a picture posted by a driver passing by. Joel Cervantes Macias said he was driving in the city’s Little Village neighborhood Thursday when he spotted 89-year-old Fidencio Sanchez hunched over and struggling to push his cart selling paletas, or popsicles, down the side of the road. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayor Bill de Blasio, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pay their respects during the 9/11 anniversary service at Ground Zero. (Published Sunday, Sept. 11, 2016) “It broke my heart seeing this man that should be enjoying retirement still working at this age,” Macias wrote on GoFundMe. Macias said that was when he pulled over to snap a photo before stopping to buy 20 paletas, giving Sanchez $50, and continuing on his way. A Florida Wal-Mart removes a controversial 9/11 “tribute” crafted out of Coca Cola products. WJHG’s Carly Hildyard reports. (Published Sunday, Sept. 11, 2016) The street vendor typically only makes about $50 during an average day selling his paletas. After Macias got home, the image of the hardworking man couldn’t seem to leave his mind. Firefighters found and rescued a cat on Sept. 9, 2016, found in the ruins of Accumoli, one of the Italian towns worst hit by the devastating 6.2 magnitude earthquake. It was not clear if the cat had been trapped under the rubble since the quake struck central Italy on August 24, or was buried under the rubble following an aftershock. The quake leveled three towns, killed nearly 300 people and left some 4,000 people homeless. (Published Friday, Sept. 9, 2016) He posted the photo on his Facebook page, with the caption, “I respect this man to the fullest, but had no idea the image would get such an overwhelming response. It was quickly shared more than 400 times. That was when Macias’s friend, Joe Loera, came up with the idea to start a GoFundMe campaign in hopes those inspired by Sanchez’s story could band together to make even the smallest of a difference in his family’s life. This law-man walked into work and found a bear going through the trash but he didn’t run; instead he started scolding the intruder like a child. Apparently, at the Placer County Sheriff’s office in Lake Tahoe, California, it’s a common occurrence. (Published Friday, Sept. 9, 2016) The originally fundraising goal was set for $3,000. It turned out, Sanchez and his wife are still grieving the recent loss of their only daughter. “His elderly wife was selling paletas also to help pay bills, but she fell ill and can’t work anymore,” Macias wrote on GoFundMe. “We’re trying to raise money to help him with whatever we can. Anything helps. Let’s all pitch in and help make life a little easier and brighten both of their day.” In less than a day, the page received more than $100,000 in donations. Cherise Bonanno, with Miracle Mattress in San Antonio, says an ad promoting the store’s “Twin Towers sale” was not meant to be offensive. (Published Friday, Sept. 9, 2016) By Monday afternoon, more than 7,000 people had donated funds to his family, gathering a total of more than $150,000. Sanchez is expected to be presented with the check this week. Published 48 minutes ago News breaks at inconvenient times.  Download one of the NBCChicago mobile apps and have the news come to you.

Police said Bennett inflated the air mattress and used a wooden board to paddle across the St. Croix River in southeastern Maine, but was stopped by officials. Bennett said he was trying to cross the border in order to reach his pregnant girlfriend in Canada, who he said had an ex-boyfriend that was allegedly making threats against her, police added. "I sense that there's this element of a Romeo-Juliet type of thing. I think that's part of it," Peter Thorn, a lawyer representing the public prosecution service of Canada, told The Guardian. Bennett was arrested and pleaded guilty to failing to appear at a border crossing. In court, the judge took the idea of floating across the river on a mattress a lightly. "Pardon the pun, but it seems to me you wanted to get there, come hell or high water," he said, according to The Guardian. Read more at CBC News.

According to police, the woman suggested to the undercover officer that her ex-husband could be killed in a drowning or fire that could be made to look like an accident. “The [detective] explained to Rachael that she could let him know if she changed her mind or wanted to go with someone else, but Rachael described that she was there because she had made up her mind to do this,” the undercover officer wrote in his arrest report. According to Manatee County Sherriff’s office arrest records, the woman was arrested Sept. 8 after making the first in a series of payments to the “hitman.” She has been formally charged with solicitation of murder and is being held on a US $100,000 bond.

After a market nosedive on Friday, investors are putting money into safe-play investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies are also higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,285 as of 12:08 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 26 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,154. The Nasdaq composite surged 73 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,198. VIDEOS TOP JOBS BRAINARD POWER: Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard said Monday that the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates too soon because higher rates could hurt the economy. U.S. stocks plunged about 2.5 percent Friday, their biggest loss in two months, after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there's a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Rosengren and Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly, and if both of them had a change of heart, that would have meant it was much more likely the Fed will raise interest rates soon. The Fed's leaders will meet next week. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. SANCTUARY: Investors bought investments that they see as low-risk, including household goods companies. Retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.35, or 1.9 percent, to $71.65 and toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive gained $1.37, or 1.9 percent, to $72.23. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained 80 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.51. FERTILE SOIL: Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskachewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and they expect the deal to close in the middle of next year. Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 23 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.74 and Agrium dipped $2.81, or 3 percent, to $92.40. CTRL+ALT+P: HP stock edged higher after the company agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion. That division has more than 6,500 printing patents. HP rose 42 cents, or 4 percent, to $14.37. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $1.71, or 1.7 percent, to $104.84 and Broadcom picked up $2.70, or 1.7 percent, to $163.48. PERRI-GOING UP: Irish drug and ingredient maker Perrigo added $6.27, or 7.1 percent, to $94.98 after the activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6-percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to make changes to its business, including boosting profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. OIL: U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 85 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $38.29. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline that is intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop the project and several agencies said they will reconsider some of their decisions. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of the pipeline, which comes within a mile of a reservation in southern North Dakota. RAPTOR ROARS: Rare disease drugmaker Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. climbed $1.51, or 20.3 percent, to $8.96 after Horizon Pharma said it will buy the company $9 per share, or about $768 million. Horizon added $1.41, or 8.2 percent, to $18.67. TEXT ME BACK: Software company Open Text climbed $5.23, or 8.8 percent, to $65 after it said it will buy a unit of Dell EMC for $1.62 billion. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX was down 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also fell 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. BONDS, CURRENCIES: Bond prices rose and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.80 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro edged up to $1.1239 from $1.1228.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

I don’t believe that raising corporate tax rates on businesses grossing more that $25 million annually in Oregon will cause said businesses to leave. Would Walmart, McDonald’s, Nike, etc., actually stop doing business in Oregon? Have they done that in other states, whose tax rates are higher? I agree with Hadd that Oregon education is underfunded; that is exactly what Measure 97 would remedy. The additional revenue would increase funding to schools. That’s why I am supporting Measure 97.

Most businesses at least have the sense to not joke about it, but even attempting a tribute has the potential to rub people the wrong way. If you're planning on referencing a national tragedy to promote your brand, just remember that even 72 years later is still too soon.

Could you please contact the dev team through Farkback about it? Hey, thanks for the TF.  There goes my productivity for a month.  And just when we started the Fark Fit threads, too! ; ) If I have a second, I'll write to Farkback... unfortunately, it's not consistent enough that I can give a clear set of "this broke, this way, when I did exactly this," so it won't really be any help, and probably not worth their time to pester them. It seems, usually, that a few might work, then one or two don't, and I hit the "Aw, fark it" big X in the upper right.  Might be the difference between read threads and unread ones?  Or posted-to vs. unposted?  Or just a flukey execution?  If I had concrete details I thought could help, I'd pass them along... I'll start paying more attention, and if it keeps up, and I can ID a pattern, I'll certainly send in a note. I'd love to see the posts color-coded in a color (or pattern?  Or even a gold star or something?) unavailable to favorite-ing or other uses -- hope it's nearer the top of the To Do list than the bottom! While I'm blathering at ya', I'd also love to see a user-configurable option to platform-detect clicking an email link from the mail client on a phone.  I *hate* browser-jacking, but I hate the non-mobile site while on mobile even more, I think.  It'd be awfully nice of the new-comments notification links could determine if the browser is mobile or not, then check a user attribute, and present it in the style preferred... Thanks for the work on these:  Only giving some feedback in hopes of making your time even more productive/successful!   mikaloyd 2016-09-12 05:32:04 PM   DisseminationMonkey: SFSailor: Any chance that smartest/funniest "winners" could get highlighted in a distinct color, a la what happens after farky-ing someone?

After a market nosedive on Friday, investors are putting money into safe-play investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies are also higher. Stock indexes overseas are slipping as investors worry about the possibility of an imminent U.S. interest rate hike. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,150 as of 12:25 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite jumped 39 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,164. SANCTUARY: Investors bought investments that they see as low-risk, including household goods companies. Retail giant Wal-Mart rose 84 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $71.14 and toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive gained 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $71.75. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained 53 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $40.24. FED FEARS: U.S. stocks plunged about 2.5 percent Friday, their biggest loss in two months, after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there’s a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. The Fed could raise interest rates next week, but investors aren’t sure the economy is healthy enough to handle it. The losses Friday wiped out two months of gradual gains on the market. Rosengren’s comments drew so much attention because he is considered a “dove” who has been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Another dove, Fed board member Lael Brainard, is scheduled to give a speech Monday, raising speculation that she, too, “will use this appearance to signal a September rate hike,” economists Kevin Cummins and Michelle Girard of the Royal Bank of Scotland, wrote in a research note Monday. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies’ borrowing costs. FERTILE SOIL: Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskachewan agreed to combine into the world’s largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and they expect the deal to close in the middle of next year. Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 22 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $16.75 and Agruim dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. CTRL+ALT+P: HP stock edged higher after the company agreed to buy Samsung’s printer business for $1.05 billion. That division has more than 6,500 printing patents. HP rose 30 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $14.25. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $1.34, or 1.3 percent, to $104.47 and Broadcom picked up $3.18, or 2 percent, to $163.93. PERRI-GOING UP: Irish drug and ingredient maker Perrigo added $4.87, or 5.5 percent, to $93.58 after the activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6-percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to make changes to its business, including boosting profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company’s stock hasn’t done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard’s comments. OIL: U.S. crude rose 17 cents to $46.05 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 11 cents to $48.12 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell $1.63, or 4.2 percent, to $37.51. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline that is intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. But the federal government temporarily stopped the project and several agencies said they will reconsider some of their decisions. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of the pipeline, which comes within a mile of a reservation in southern North Dakota. RAPTOR ROARS: Rare disease drugmaker Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. climbed $1.50, or 20.1 percent, to $8.95 after Horizon Pharma said it will buy the company $9 per share, or about $768 million. Horizon added $1.20, or 7 percent, to $18.46. TEXT ME BACK: Software company Open Text climbed $5.07, or 8.5 percent, to $64.84 after it said it will buy a unit of Dell EMC for $1.62 billion. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX was down 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also fell 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea’s Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. BONDS, CURRENCIES: Bond prices didn’t move much, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.98 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro edged up to $1.1231 from $1.1228.

Global stock markets tumbled Monday, Sept. 12, 2016, as investors fretted over the possibility of an imminent U.S. interest rate hike and reacted to the weekend health problems of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) LONDON - An easing in U.S. rate hike expectations following a speech by one of the Federal Reserve's policymakers helped shore up stock markets around the world on Tuesday. Oil prices took a pounding after a leading industry group reduced its global oil demand forecasts. ___ KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.5 per cent to 10,480 while France's CAC-40 rose 0.1 per cent to 4,444. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.2 per cent at 6,712. Expectations that Wall Street was poised to pare some of Monday's gains weighed on European markets though. Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures are expected to open 0.6 per cent lower. ___ US RATE FOCUS: The main point of interest in markets at the moment centres on the Fed and when it will raise interest rates again. Comments last Friday from Fed rate-setter Eric Rosengren had stoked expectations of a rate hike as soon as next week, prompting big losses in global stock markets. On Monday, his peer Lael Brainard failed to echo the more hawkish tone, helping Wall Street to recover strongly. She argued that the "new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation." Low rates over many years have boosted stock prices as investors put their money in assets given the low returns available in bonds. ___ ANALYST'S COMMENT: "The continuous debate surrounding the prospect of a U.S. rate rise continues to dominate market sentiment as U.S. policymakers continue to gear up the markets for a further rate rise later this year," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. "Last night's comments from Brainard acted as a neat counterweight to recent hawkish rhetoric." ___ ASIA'S DAY: Earlier, Asian stocks mostly rallied. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.3 per cent to 16,729.04 and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.4 per cent to 1,999.36 as Samsung Electronics, in the midst of a recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, gained 4.2 per cent, recovering more than half of Monday's loss. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.3 per cent to 23,215.76, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.2 per cent to 5,207.80. The Shanghai Composite index inched back into positive territory, gaining 0.1 per cent to 3,023.51. ___ OIL: Oil prices took a pounding Tuesday after a leading industry group said global oil demand growth is slowing by more than previously thought, largely because of a more pronounced economic slowdown during the third quarter of the year. In its September oil market report, the Paris-based International Energy Agency reduced its forecast for global demand growth to 1.3 million barrels a day in 2016 — 100,000 below the previous forecast. All in all, the alteration in the demand-supply balance anticipated by the IEA has weighed on oil prices. A barrel of benchmark crude was down $1.10, or 2.4 per cent at $45.20 while Brent crude, the international standard, fell 93 cents, or 1.9 per cent, to $47.42 a barrel. ___ CURRENCIES: The euro was flat at $1.1233 while the dollar rose 0.4 per cent to 102.27 yen.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *   Previous Next     FILE - In this Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, a man walks to work on Wall Street, near the New York Stock Exchange, in New York.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.2 percent to 16,704.94 and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6 percent to 2,002.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.8 percent to 23,482.47 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.1 percent to 5,222.00. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2 percent and markets in Southeast Asia were mostly lower. US RATE WATCH: On Tuesday, Lael Brainard, an influential Fed policymaker, suggested in a speech that the risk that higher rates might derail growth was greater than the risk that lower rates might ignite inflation. That was seen as a sign the Fed will refrain from raising rates at a policy-setting meeting next week. Low rates have fueled a steady rise in stock prices as investors put their money in high-risks stocks instead of low-interest savings accounts or bonds. ANALYST'S COMMENT: "She highlighted global challenges such as muted inflation and global uncertainties and particular concerns for the U.S. economy," said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. "It's safe to assume that investors believe that September is not going to be the month where the Fed pulls the trigger." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks surged Monday after Brainard's speech. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89 OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 45 cents to $45.85 per barrel in New York. The contract added 41 cents on Monday. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, lost 40 cents to $47.92 a barrel in London.

These tips will help. By Chris Davis The world is a big place, and despite what you, as an IT leader, think you know about the international digital heavy weights’ control of the market, there is still a lot of runway for your company to make its mark. The first encouraging point that your digital future is not yet written comes from Dr. Peter Diamandis’ book Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think, in which he estimates that by 2020, 3-5 billion new consumers will come online, adding tens of trillions of dollars to the global economy. The second point can be found in the awe-inspiring data that Internetworldstats.com publishes on the 20 major world economies. For example, 50% of the world's internet users are in Asia, but the 2.3 billion people in Asia that don't yet have internet access constitute 31% of the total world population. This constitutes a huge future opportunity for businesses  you should be planning for it now. Whether your company currently has an international presence or not, this is where your company’s growth will come from over the next 20 years, and you will want to lay the groundwork before your competitors establish a foothold. But let's not oversimplify. The Asia market is multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and comes with digital (double-byte characters), political (Google being blocked) and competitive (Uber selling to Didi) challenges. A "one size fits all" approach didn't work for Walmart the first go-around, and it is taking a new look at how it re-establishes its presence in China. To compete in the modern marketplace—where digital is or will be the medium of choice for commerce—all companies need to invest heavily in designing their global-local digital strategy. Dipping your toe in the water won't be enough. How to Approach Digital Global Expansion In Metis Strategy’s work with clients across multiple geographic and industry profiles, we have determined that there are five keys to developing a thoughtful approach to digital global expansion. The overarching theme is that you have to transcend the mindset of a U.S. company operating globally to be a global company that happens to be headquartered in the U.S. Here are the five keys: 1. Be Native. It might sound counterintuitive to suggest that a company based in Europe or the U.S. "be native" to a country like Indonesia, but it's not. Figuring out the needs of a culture where the language and daily habits of consumers vary so vastly from your own is difficult, if not impossible. You should make the investment in local staff, and partner with local agencies to tailor your approach to tastes, cultural norms, customs, device types and partnerships. Matrix and integrate the local staff into your corporate strategy, but don't control the entire budget. If the local team doesn't have the resources to succeed, but are held accountable to growth targets, they will pursue the paths of least resistance, which may not be in your best long-term interest (e.g., bad partnership deals). Also, empower local talent with the tools to be nimble, localized, and relevant. For example, ensure your campaign, e-commerce and content management systems enable the team to speak, design and engage in natural ways. Simply translating English to Mandarin through a translation company, on a streamlined version of your website, simply won't cut it. Local content generation or co-creation requires careful governance and design standards but in our experience the rewards usually justify the investment. 2. Grow With Them. Much of the world is still in the earlier part of a digital revolution, and a successful digital approach should not be focused on year-one profitability only. Instead, commit to testing, learning, brand building and positioning yourself to eventually own the direct relationship with the customer across the entire customer lifecycle, whether you are a B2B or B2C company. Again, leverage local agencies and expertise that can help tap into local markets and be on the ground when doing consumer research. The beauty is that you have little to lose, but so much to gain, so shake off corporate conservatism and experiment relentlessly. 3. Mobile First. Asia and Africa are leapfrogging PCs with mobile devices and connectivity. Design your digital capabilities with either a mobile app, mobile-responsive web, or even SMS as the engagement medium. This will help you ruthlessly prioritize the core "must-have" features that will differentiate you in each market, rather than replicating decades of long-tail enhancements. WeChat, in China, is a powerful example of when mobile wins and expedites the ability to create adjacent service offerings that lend themselves to viral adoption. If you don't know WeChat, read this: It's Time for Facebook to Copy WeChat. 4. Invest in Marketing and Branding Early. Familiarity and credibility matter. As a company entering a new market, you must either first establish credibility or tap into familiarity. Credibility can be built by hard work and service delivery, but that takes a long time. It is paramount to build awareness early on, so you will need to invest in digital marketing, a native digital experience, and avoid copy and pasting your website from brand.com into brand.cn. Please don't redirect to an English-only page for transactions, or assume that data entry forms, such as address fields, follow the same logic everywhere! You should also explore partnerships with brands that decision makers know and trust, but with an eye on developing ways to add unique value and engagement in a locally appropriate way. You may consider partnering with local brands on co-sponsored advertising campaigns, marketing a “suite of services” where your offering fills an important gap, or in the form of sales distribution and acquisition. No matter what the form of the partnership is though, you’ll want to create unique value that creates stickiness with the consumer. It is great to acquire a net-new customer through a partnership, but if the consumer receives a benefit and never comes back, you did not really accomplish your objective of growing your market share. For example, you can add unique value and create stickiness through locally modified loyalty programs, digital services that layer onto physical experience, or special benefits for consumers that establish a direct relationship with you. Another way to tailor your approach to local customs is to completely re-brand in a locally appropriate way. Unless you have the brand awareness of a Louis Vuitton, where the foreign brand is the value proposition, you may be better off with a fresh approach. Think of this branding fail as food for thought: when KFC first entered China in the 1980s, its "Finger-Lickin' Good" campaign translated to a not-so-appetizing phrase: "Eat your fingers off." Try this thought experiment: you are a "digital immigrant" trying to learn your new land, rather than a tourist with no investment in the culture. 5. Partner to Enter, But Have an End Game. Partnering with regionally recognized brands is an efficient way to enter a new market and navigate political complexities—especially for companies that don't have brand awareness. However, you'll want to enter the relationship carefully with an end game in mind regarding how you will eventually shed yourself of a profit-eating partnership. For example, when many travel companies enter China, the first stop is the travel site C-Trip. That is logical, if not necessary, but if you train the consumer that your offering is a commodity on the shelf, you'll spend 10X trying to un-train them through marketing. This all may sound like a lot of effort with limited payoff, but I challenge you to think about the long game. When corporate budgets are set in 12-month increments, it's easy to water the big tree and neglect the seedlings.

Advanced, effective and affordable, Pete’s Pest Control has garnered the endorsement of Dave Ramsey for quality service at an affordable price. Advanced, Effective, Affordable 11944 W 95th Street, Suite 321 Lenexa, KS 66215-3801 913-378-8979 Pete 816-810-6544 Cat 913-232-8016 Office Facebook Website Killing bugs is interesting… but where did Pete’s Pest Control come from? Pete Weikel started the company late 2008. A recent transplant from Seattle, WA, Weikel moved to Overland Park the summer of 2008 to reinvent himself. Like many Americans, Weikel was a casualty of the 2007 economic downturn. Weikel and his ex-wife, Cat Heisler, successfully operated pest control companies in the Seattle/Tacoma area 1999 through 2006. They sold these companies and invested everything in a fine dining restaurant. Stadium Bistro opened November 2006 to great reviews, but terrible timing! As the economy tanked, so did the restaurant, and hence, the need to reinvent. With the motto, “I will not live under a bridge,” Weikel stocked shelves at night at WalMart, slept on his son’s couch and went back to what he knew: pest control. One of the benefits of starting a pest control company when you’ve successfully operated them in the past is you know what not to do. Weikel used this knowledge to create the Unlimited Annual Pest Control program. This is an affordable prepaid service for homeowners. For $219 per year, customers’ homes are treated in the spring, summer and fall. If additional visits are needed, they are provided at no charge. Because the service is prepaid, Pete’s Pest Control saves the expense of monthly/quarterly billing and the need to chase receivables. “Who wants to think about pest control services? No one! So, we make it as easy as possible for our customers and pass the savings on to them,” says Weikel. This program caught on like wildfire and Pete’s Pest Control was off and running. In the meantime, Cat Heisler had moved to Kansas City to be near her daughter. In 2011, Heisler was waiting tables at Nick & Jake’s in Parkville when Weikel contacted her with an offer of employment. Having buried the hatchet and lacking better prospects, Heisler agreed. It was a good decision. “I never thought I’d be killing bugs with Pete again!” says Heisler. “It’s crazy how the world turns! Ten years ago we were opening a restaurant. And now, here we are in Kansas City building one of the fastest growing pest control companies in the metro!” In less than eight years, Pete’s Pest Control has grown from “Pete in a truck” to six Certified Commercial Applicators, two Registered Technicians, three office staff and seven bug trucks. Weikel and Heisler credit their success to their customers and to the communities that have given them a fresh start, particularly Johnson County. “It’s rough to start all over in your fifties!” says Heisler. “The chambers of commerce in Johnson County gave us a friendly encouraging place to root our business and grow.” Pete’s Pest Control actively networks in multiple chambers of commerce, BNI (Business Networking International) groups and community events. “It’s all about building relationships,” says Weikel. Customer testimonials: “Pete addressed an ant problem in our kitchen and quickly solved it. I highly recommend Pete!” ~ Ed O., Overland Park “I have used Pete’s Pest Control for the last year. Their knowledge of the industry helped us to make some important decisions in the use of pesticides around our home. We have had a better result from what Pete’s Pest Control has helped us with.” ~Scott F., Shawnee “’Find the bug, kill the bug’, Pete’s deceptively simple motto belies their depth of knowledge in pest control. Their common sense approach to controlling pests is different than the “cookie cutter” approach of other companies. Pete’s Pest Control successfully treated our home for silverfish and spiders.” ~Jerry B., KCMO “I have been very happy with Pete’s Pest Control’s work and expertise on my home and would greatly encourage others to call on them for their pest control needs at home or at work!” ~Carrie S., Overland Park “The folks at Pete’s Pest Control explain “why” to do (or not do) certain things related to your needs. I’d recommend them to anyone.” ~Grant H., Olathe Chamber Updates Second Tuesday After Hours Come by for networking and happy hour specials!

The Tennessee Valley Authority has set a minimum bid of $36.4 million for its Bellefonte Nuclear Plant. (Published Monday, Sept. 12, 2016) After spending more than 40 years and $5 billion on an unfinished nuclear power plant in northeastern Alabama, the nation's largest federal utility is preparing to sell the property at a fraction of its cost. The Tennessee Valley Authority has set a minimum bid of $36.4 million for its Bellefonte Nuclear Plant and the 1,600 surrounding acres of waterfront property on the Tennessee River. The buyer gets two unfinished nuclear reactors, transmission lines, office and warehouse buildings, eight miles of roads, a 1,000-space parking lot and more. 6-Year-Old NY Boy Who Offered Refugee a Home Meets Obama Initial bids are due Monday, and at least one company has publicly expressed interest in the site with plans to use it for alternative energy production. But TVA says it isn't particular about what the purchaser does — using the site for power production, industrial manufacturing, recreation or even residences would all be fine with the agency, said spokesman Scott Fiedler. "It's all about jobs and investment, and that's our primary goal for selling this property," said Fielder. TVA hopes to close the deal in October.

The 24-year-old combines the three in a record-breaking bungee dunk for 240 feet with a perfect aim for Guinness World Records Day. (Published 4 hours ago) The sale is bittersweet for site manager Jim Chardos, who went to work at Bellefonte in 1994 expecting it to be finished as a nuclear power plant. All these years later, he commutes 90 minutes each way to work to oversee a plant that has never been stocked with radioactive fuel or used either of its reactors to generate a single watt of electricity. Work began at Bellefonte in the mid-'70s on the backside of the nuclear energy boom in the United States, Chardos said. The utility initially planned to construct four reactors at the site, but demand for power in the region never met those early expectations and work halted in 1988. A series of starts and stops preceded TVA's decision earlier this year to sell Bellefonte. Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs to Cut Costs After Scandal "If you're going to make 1,200 megawatts you need to sell it to somebody, and if there's no need for it you're not going to finish," he said. "And that's really what's happened." Sales of U.S. nuclear plants aren't all that unusual; the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, says at least 30 units have been sold in part or whole since 1999. The potential sale of Bellefonte is creating hope in a region where residents gave up long ago on the promise of thousands of good-paying, permanent jobs that were once expected at the plant. Seen at Trump Tower: Sessions, Flynn Picked For Cabinet Drew Angerer/Getty Images "It was a great thing but then they just pulled the plug and left out, you know," said Hollywood Mayor Frank "Buster" Duke, who worked at Bellefonte about a decade before moving on. Today, he said, the 1,000 or so residents of his town need a place to work whether TVA or some other entity owns the property. Kanye West at Concert: 'I Would Have Voted for Trump' "It would help the area as far as land values go. Population would improve, businesses would come in," he said. The Nevada-based Phoenix Energy has said it will offer $38 million for Bellefonte in hopes of using it for a new, non-nuclear technology to generate power. The company says its system uses electromagnetic induction energy fields to heat water indirectly and produce steam that would turn turbines and generate electricity at Bellefonte.

(Published Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016) Chardos said he would still like to see the site used to generate electricity by nuclear power, but he can't be too picky. "It's all about the jobs," he said.

Police describe what took place during the attempted robbery that ended with one attacker dead and the woman and one Good Samaritan in the hospital. Laura Bauer, Joe Ledford and Robert A. Cronkleton The Kansas City Star Police are still searching for one of two attackers who struck Sunday afternoon in a parking lot near the Wal-Mart store at 65th Street and Maurer Road in Shawnee. Joe Ledford jledford@kcstar.com 1 of 2 i By Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A man arrested Sunday in an attack at a Shawnee Wal-Mart was released after police questioned him and determined he was not involved. Several teams of police officers were back on the case Monday working leads in the search for a second suspect in an incident that left one attacker dead, a woman injured and a Good Samaritan shot. The dead attacker, who was shot by a separate Good Samaritan, was identified as 28-year-old John W. Simmons III of Kansas City. The woman who was attacked Sunday in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Shawnee was a 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., resident. Police said Monday she had been released from the hospital. The Good Samaritan who was shot when he intervened to help her was a 33-year-old Kansas City man. He had surgery Sunday night and remained in the hospital in serious condition Monday, said Shawnee police spokesman Maj. Dan Tennis. Police said the woman was attacked about 1:30 p.m. Sunday as she was putting her infant in a car seat after shopping at the store near Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road. Two people approached and the woman was struck on the head, police said. A Good Samaritan who tried to help her was shot and critically wounded by one of the attackers. At that point the second Good Samaritan, a 36-year-old De Soto man, came forward and shot one of the attackers. Police said Monday the woman who was assaulted did not know her attackers. Police also said the first Good Samaritan was not armed. The second Good Samaritan was interviewed and released. According to Missouri court records, a person whom Simmons had a child in common with filed a protective order against him in December 2013. Simmons was ordered to stay away from and refrain from communicating with the petitioner. According to online federal court records, a man named John W. Simmons III, of the same age as the man killed, was under indictment in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, with having a firearm while trafficking drugs and with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Soon after the attack, officers with a K9 unit located and arrested a man east of the store and said he was suspected of being the second attacker. Tennis said he fit the description from witnesses and he was located in the area. But on Monday police said they did not believe he was involved in the attack. He was released later Sunday. “The man who was arrested yesterday shortly after this incident has been determined not to be involved in the crime,” according to a police statement. “Currently several teams of police officers are working on leads.” Anyone with information is asked to call the Tips TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477 or Shawnee police at 913-631-2150.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.2 percent to 16,704.94 and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6 percent to 2,002.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.8 percent to 23,482.47 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.1 percent to 5,222.00. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2 percent and markets in Southeast Asia were mostly lower. US RATE WATCH: On Tuesday, Lael Brainard, an influential Fed policymaker, suggested in a speech that the risk that higher rates might derail growth was greater than the risk that lower rates might ignite inflation. That was seen as a sign the Fed will refrain from raising rates at a policy-setting meeting next week. Low rates have fueled a steady rise in stock prices as investors put their money in high-risks stocks instead of low-interest savings accounts or bonds.

Global stock markets tumbled Monday, Sept. 12, 2016, as investors fretted over the possibility of an imminent U.S. interest rate hike and reacted to the weekend health problems of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) ANALYST'S COMMENT: "She highlighted global challenges such as muted inflation and global uncertainties and particular concerns for the U.S. economy," said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. "It's safe to assume that investors believe that September is not going to be the month where the Fed pulls the trigger." WALL STREET: U.S. stocks surged Monday after Brainard's speech. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89 OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 45 cents to $45.85 per barrel in New York. The contract added 41 cents on Monday. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, lost 40 cents to $47.92 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.98 yen from 101.89 yen while the euro slipped to $1.1233 from $1.1238.

Asian stocks tumbled Monday, as investors reacted to comments last week from a Fed official, who caught markets off guard by saying that interest rates could rise soon. Questions over the health of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also cast a shadow after she was diagnosed with pneumonia during the weekend.

Pittsfield's PEDA is bringing a Walmart superstore to Woodlawn Crossing in the William Stanley Business Park, much to the disappointment of the Berkshire Central Labor Council and others. Meanwhile, CannaTech Medicinals is currently building a multi-million dollar facility in the Fall River Business Park. The company will grow and process cannabis for medical use and is betting on the federal government finally catching on and removing cannabis from its list of Schedule 1 drugs. It certainly makes more sense to allow the FDA to oversee medical research rather than the DEA continuing to squash it. Of course, once that happens, the potential for economic development and job growth will be very real. CannaTech believes that will allow it to expand its facility in Fall River to potentially create 100 jobs. Besides job creation, Fall River is joining the cutting edge by formulating its own rules for the business. Fall River's mayor, Jasiel Correia II, has the right idea when he says, "It wouldn't be prudent for the administration to be obstructionist." Massachusetts will join five other states in asking voters to legalize recreational cannabis. It certainly doesn't look like our current Berkshire delegation or that of the entire state of Massachusetts has the moxie or the willingness to be the first state in the nation to legalize cannabis by legislation, so the voters will do what they are afraid and too close-minded to do. Wouldn't it be great if Pittsfield's leaders could be as forward-thinking and progressive as those in Fall River and begin developing plan for and actually recruiting businesses like CannaTech Medicinals and related industries to the William Stanley Business Park? Business that can really make a difference for those seeking employment as well as for municipalities trying to generate revenue for years to come. It is working in other cities and states and it can work here, too. Why support a plan that will only benefit a mega-corporation like Walmart? Rather than closing the Walmart in the Berkshire Crossing shopping center on Hubbard Avenue, how about keeping it where it is and using the William Stanley Business Park to bring in businesses like CannaTech that will sustain our community for years to come? Or we can simply move to a city such as Fall River that is looking towards the future? I don't know about you but I'd much rather see people have a reason to stay here.

(AP) — Two people were critically injured and a good Samaritan killed a suspect during a confrontation in the parking lot of a suburban Kansas City Wal-Mart. Police said the incident Sunday afternoon in Shawnee began when two suspects hit a woman in the head from behind as she was putting her child in her car. Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis says a person in the parking lot who tried to help was shot several times. Another good Samaritan then shot one of the suspects, who died at the scene. The second suspect fled but was caught near the store. The female victim and the other person who was shot were both hospitalized in critical condition. Tennis said a motive for the initial attack on the woman is not yet clear.   Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rams Owner Stan Kroenke The Hollywood ReporterSeptember 12, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share With the Rams' return to L.A., Team Owner Stan Kroenke received a warm industry welcome: Among the celebrations was an April dinner hosted by CAA agent Michael Kives, with Ron Meyer, Katy Perry, Jerry Bruckheimer, Elon Musk, Kate Hudson, Scooter Braun and Steve Wynn in attendance. But the low-profile Kroenke (whose media reticence has earned him the nickname "Silent Stan") was no stranger to Hollywood: Daughter Whitney Kroenke Burditt is a film producer (The Power of Few) and philanthropist who lives on the Bird Streets above the Sunset Strip. And Kroenke himself is a longtime Malibu homeowner, having paid $9 million in 1998 for the estate of Princess Diana's lover Dodi Fayed. Kroenke was born for sports moguldom: His father, who owned a lumberyard in the rural Missouri town of Mora and was a die-hard St. Louis Cardinals fan, named him Enos Stanley Kroenke - Enos for Enos Slaughter, hero of the team's 1946 World Series victory, and Stanley for its greatest player, Stan Musial. Now the 69-year-old is one of the most powerful owners in sports. In addition to the Rams, he owns London's storied Arsenal soccer club, the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and, through his Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer and the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League.

Rams Game to Emmys on Same Day (Guest Column) Already a successful real estate developer when he met Ann Walton (daughter of Walmart co-founder Bud) while skiing in Vail, Kroenke expanded his business into shopping centers, many anchored by Walmarts. He also diversified into ranching (with about 1.38 million acres, he's one of the five largest private landowners in the U.S.) and media (Denver-area Altitude regional sports network and outdoor-sports-oriented KSE Media). Forbes estimates his personal wealth at $8 billion (which doesn't include his wife's $5 billion). Along the way, he has ruffled some feathers: He left an angry St. Louis with $36 million remaining on a loan the city took out in 1995 to fund the Rams' stadium there, and Arsenal fans are in revolt over paying some of the highest ticket prices in the Premier League. And after buying the 535,000-acre Waggoner Ranch in Texas in February, he caused a ruckus by moving to evict dozens of families from one corner of the property, some of whom have lived there for more than 50 years. View photos Fayed, who in June 1997 bought the Malibu estate now owned by Kroenke, reportedly was going to ask Diana to live there with him before both were killed two months later in a car crash.

The campaign group found that 69 of the world’s top economic entities are corporations rather than countries in 2015. They also discovered that the world’s top 10 corporations – a list that includes Walmart, Shell and Apple – have a combined revenue of more than the 180 ‘poorest’ countries combined in the list, which include Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam.       The figures are worse than last year, when 63 of the top economic entities were corporations. When looking at the top 200 economic entities, the figures are even more extreme, with 153 being corporations.   Global Justice Now released the figures in order to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, established to draw up a binding treaty to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities. Campaigners are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. Britain doesn’t support the process, and has repeatedly vetoed and opposed such proposal in the past.       Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change. The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.   “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN. That’s why today we’re joining campaigns from across the world to tell the British government to stop blocking this international demand for justice.” ### Global Justice Now is a democratic social justice organisation working as part of a global movement to challenge the powerful and create a more just and equal world. We mobilise people in the UK for change, and act in solidarity with those fighting injustice, particularly in the global south.

(AP) — A woman has been released from the hospital and a good Samaritan who came to her aid is recovering after a suburban Kansas City Wal-Mart parking lot attack in which a suspect was killed. Police said the Kansas City, Kansas, woman was putting her baby in her car Sunday afternoon in Shawnee when two suspects hit her in the head from behind. Shawnee police Maj. Dan Tennis says a Kansas City, Missouri, man in the parking lot who tried to help was shot several times and is recovering after undergoing surgery. Another good Samaritan from De Soto, Kansas, has been interviewed and released after fatally shooting 28-year-old John Simmons III, of Kansas City, Missouri. Authorities continue looking for the second suspect after determining that a man arrested afterward wasn’t involved. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Updated: 11/17/2016 at 8:30 PM Felicia Dionisio About | Email | Archive After years toiling in various local television newsrooms as a producer, writer, anchor, and reporter, Felicia Dionisio decided to put an end to a career spent covering important stories about waterskiing squirrels and the effects of exploding fireworks on a mannequin. She hasn't looked back and considers her tenure as a news editor at WND a life-changing experience. The truth has a way of doing that. Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Wendy Russell Macrorie was shopping at a Shawnee, Kansas, Walmart when two men were shot in the parking lot. (Photo: Facebook/Wendy Russell Macrorie) Two Good Samaritans are being credited with saving a woman’s life after she was attacked by two suspected carjackers who hit her over the head while she was putting her child into a car seat after leaving Walmart in Shawnee, Kansas, on Sunday. An unarmed bystander, who rushed to the aid of the woman after hearing her screams, was shot multiple times by one of the suspects, according to police. Another Good Samaritan saw what happened, got out of his car and shot one of the attackers dead. A shopper who had just exited the store recorded the aftermath of the shootings and posted the video to Facebook. Wendy Russell Macrorie said she was shopping for light bulbs and a tire for her son’s bicycle when people in the store began saying someone had been shot outside. “So this is interesting. I am at Walmart, which I hate going to, and this is happening in front of my car,” Macrorie says in the video. John W. Simmons, III Paramedics can be seen tending to the injured Good Samaritan as the body of a man wearing a beige shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers lies motionless in the foreground. The dead attacker was identified as John W. Simmons, III, 28, of Kansas City. Simmons reportedly had a protective order filed against him in 2013 by the mother of his child, according to Missouri court records. Police said the second attacker ran off and is still at large. A man arrested near the scene was released after police questioned him and determined he was not involved, reported the Kansas City Star. The Good Samaritan remained hospitalized in serious condition on Monday. The victim was released from the hospital and the child was not injured. “You know our hearts and prayers go out to both of them for a speedy recovery. I know we have many people out right now, many teams of officers and detectives. We had to make contact with the family of Good Samaritan No. 1 to get them to the hospital to be with him, but apparently Good Samaritan No. 1 is able to talk,” said Maj. Dan Tennis of the Shawnee Police Department.

Global Justice Now press release 12 September 2016 Shell Image by John Gateley 69 of top 100 economic entities are corporations not countries Walmart, Apple, Shell richer than Russia, Belgium, Sweden British government told: stop supporting your corporations, support your people   Corporations have increased their wealth vis-à-vis countries according to new figures released byGlobal Justice Now. The campaign group found that 69 of the world’s top economic entities are corporations rather than countries in 2015. They also discovered that the world’s top 10 corporations – a list that includes Walmart, Shell and Apple – have a combined revenue of more than the 180 ‘poorest’ countries combined in the list, which include Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam.       The figures are worse than last year, when 63 of the top economic entities were corporations. When looking at the top 200 economic entities, the figures are even more extreme, with 153 being corporations.   Global Justice Now released the figures in order to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, established to draw up a binding treaty to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities. Campaigners are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. Britain doesn’t support the process, and has repeatedly vetoed and opposed such proposal in the past.       Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change. The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.   “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN. That’s why today we’re joining campaigns from across the world to tell the British government to stop blocking this international demand for justice.”   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Land Management is Crisis Management in Africa Ethiopia’s conflict is driven partly by ethnic tensions and resentment against a small elite’s hold on wealth and [...] 16th November 2016, from Project Syndicate Inequality drive can help investors, says Namibian President Namibia’s ambitious agenda to attack inequality can reward investors as well as transform the country, says [...] 9th November 2016, from allAfrica.com Remove OneWorld UK   •   CAN Mezzanine, 32-36 Loman Street, London SE1 0EH, UK Email hello@oneworld.org   •   Telephone +44 (0)20 7922 7844 With thanks to TEN-HUT for brand & design consultancy© 2013 OneWorld UK   •   T's & C's

Chesterton BRF Cerner CPL Online Duke Energy GE Healthcare Halton Regional Police Service Jet Propulsion Laboratory Show More Organizational growth can sometimes lead to IT slowdowns. That's what happened when two leading Brazilian food companies merged in 2012. The newly formed company, BRF (formerly Brasil Foods), was the seventh-largest food company in the world and Brazil's market leader, and partly because of its size it now faced a costly problem. BRF serves global superstore chains such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour, as well as supermarkets, wholesalers, food-service operations and family-owned bodegas, and its SAP system was being hit with 20,000 to 25,000 pricing requests daily. However, it took 17 days to make price changes, which isn't ideal for a business that sells perishable commodities. [ Download this story and lots more in Computerworld's September digital magazine! ] Pricing manager Fabio Freitas had to find new ways to improve response times. Following a rigorous review, he decided to try PROS revenue and profit optimization software. Freitas says the new system's data-science-driven analytics and guidance has enabled BRF to improve its revenue and profitability by lowering operating expenses and increasing margins. Other benefits include increased agility and enhanced forecast accuracy. The company has also established a single source for planning and reporting, and it can now compare retail and consumer price plans to weekly, monthly and annual actual prices. "It has substantially changed the way we manage our daily routines in pricing," says Rodrygo Sanches, a pricing specialist at BRF. "From the technical side, it enabled us to flip the table, because now we use 90% of our time to analyze data and [make] decisions. All the manual spreadsheet creation was eliminated."

Tracy Morgan is "just happy to be alive" after his terrifying car crash two years ago. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The 46-year-old 30 Rock star was left seriously injured in June, 2014, after a Wal-mart truck crashed into the comedian's limousine van in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. He was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series at the Creative Arts Emmys on Saturday (10Sep16) for his appearance on Saturday Night Live in October last year (15) - his first TV gig since the fatal crash. Despite losing out to Girls star Peter Scolari at the ceremony, which was held at the Microsoft Theatre L.A. LIVE in Los Angeles, Tracy said he was honoured to even be considered. "I came back from a place that nobody thought I was going to come back from, you know? This is for all the survivors and my boy, Jimmy Mack (James McNair) and it means a lot to me," he told Entertainment Tonight at the ceremony. "It really means a lot to me just to be alive. So I've transcended showbusiness in that sense," he added. Morgan took his wife Megan Wollover as his date to the awards, and said it was her unwavering support that got him through his tough recovery following the crash: "She's my strength, she's my wisdom. That's my lady, that's my wife, and all of that is self-explanatory," he said. And, after the trauma of the last few years, Tracy is just happy to be taking things day by day. "What's next at this point? I'm just going to say one word, it's self-explanatory: tomorrow," he shared. © Cover Media Online Editors Your Comments COMMENT RULES: Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.

This particular day I legally passed a truck at a busy intersection on the right. However, the driver may have been in a little bit of a hurry or distracted because he quickly veered into my path on his right. Mercifully, he did not hit me. I simply gave him a quick glance and kept on moving down the street. In the next block, I could hear him slowing down next to me to address this event. I was ready to give him chapter and verse of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code about rules of the road. It was then that he disarmed my response and a bit of anger in the process. He uttered, Sorry about that. I was at a full loss of words. All I could say was, "Thank you." We all make mistakes on the road. Anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves. Please try and eliminate any and all distractions and take a dose of patience with every trip. Also, be aware that pedestrians and people on bicycles are extremely vulnerable compared with a person driving a car.  Eric Brozell, Erie   Glenwood YMCA thanked for boosting charity drive Thank you to the Glenwood Park YMCA for hosting the stuffed toy and animal drive again this year to benefit the Sunshine Group of Erie. We appreciate the generous support of your patrons and friends. The toys are cleaned and packed in special gift packages for needy children to be distributed at Christmastime in Erie County. Michelle Schroeck, director of community affairs, is due tons of thanks for organizing this collection project.  Sandy Goldsmith, Erie   Parents ignore signs,  block traffic at school If a parent can't or won't follow the rules and laws, then it's no wonder kids grow up to be disrespectful. There are clearly marked no parking signs in front of most schools, especially Edison Elementary School on East Lake Road. There's a huge parking lot in the rear of the building, but the parents don't feel like driving to the parking lot. However, they don't seem to care that they are blocking one lane of traffic and creating huge safety issues. I can't believe that the school officials condone this. A simple solution: Lock the door and make them use the entrance where the parking lot is located. The parents should know better. What really fries me is that people are trying to get to work on time, but the parents don't care just because it's convenient for them to block traffic. Just wait until a student bolts out between one of those illegally parked cars and gets hit. Is that what it takes to get these parents to follow the law?  Kirk Rudzinski, Harborcreek   Organizers thank community for backing charity game The All Star Baseball Committee and Erie County Umpires Inc. would like to thank the Erie community, our major sponsors and baseball fans for their support of and attendance at the Walmart City/County All Star Baseball Game, which was played on June 13 at Jerry Uht Park. This was a very special year with the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Children's Miracle Network at Saint Vincent Hospital. A special thank-you to our naming rights sponsor, Walmart; to Country Fair for having a Country Fair Help Local Kids Day on June 10; and Penn State Behrend, where the banquet was held at Dobbins Dining Hall on June 12. Along with community support, we had five local schools that directly contributed to Saint Vincent's Children's Miracle Network through schoolwide Dress Down Days. In the past four years, the umpires chapter, with the support and work of the All Star Baseball Committee, has raised more than $83,000 for the Children's Miracle Network. Support came from all areas of the city and county: businesses, organizations, clubs, families, schools, boosters groups and individuals. This year we will present a check for more than $23,000 to the Children's Miracle Network. This money will provide Sleep Sacks and other medical equipment to benefit babies in Erie. Thank you for your generosity in helping make miracles happen. Jerry and John Deluca, co-chairmen, All Star Baseball Committee   Pa. lawmakers applauded for raising cigarette tax Thank you to the Pennsylvania lawmakers who approved an increase in the cigarette tax of $1 per pack, which took effect Aug. 1. With this and the first-time tax on e-cigarettes and smokeless and roll-your-own tobacco products coming soon, thousands of lives in our community will be saved. Why is this such great news? Because this $1 cigarette price increase will help more than 65,600 Pennsylvania adults quit smoking and prevent nearly 48,100 Pennsylvania youth from starting a lifetime of tobacco addiction. Pennsylvania has made great strides in the past decade to reduce tobaccos harms through education, cessation services and public policy efforts that protect some people from secondhand smoke. Tobacco kills more than 22,000 Pennsylvanians each year. This price increase will help bring that number down. I firmly stand behind the Legislatures decision to improve Pennsylvanias health and keep tobacco out of our kids reach.  Cynthia M. Lillis, chairwoman, Northwest Pa. Volunteer Leadership Council, American Cancer Society   Gospelfest organizers grateful to community We, the committee and producers of the 16th annual Community Family Event and Gospelfest, thank you for your attendance, prayers, support and participation. We believe that we are achieving our goal, which is making Christ known, and bringing the community closer together. It was a great day because of your presence. Thanks be to God. We are thankful for our major sponsors: Bethesda Children's Home and Trinity Center, Village at Luther Square, Country Fair stores, and Burton Funeral Homes and Crematory. Thanks also to Ron King, Erie Homes for Children and Adults, and Lamb of God Lutheran Church for helping us continue to celebrate family, children and diversity in our community with this annual event. Special thanks to the community ministers, pastors, churches, bands, dance theater groups, musical groups, praise teams and youth ministries that were in attendance and performed, and also to the Burton Funeral Homes staff for an amazing and inspirational memorial service leading up to our special guest and national recording group, Pastor Green and the Visionaries, of Rochester, New York. And also to the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority for working with us these 16 years to showcase and celebrate the diversity in our community. You and your prayers, support and contributions are the heart of this ministry and your support is invaluable. If at any time we can be of service to you, please dont hesitate to ask. Rev. W.

The U.N. Security Council strongly condemned the nuclear test — the North's fifth and its second of the year — and promised new measures against Pyongyang. South Korea's president said the detonation, which Seoul estimated was the North's biggest-ever in explosive yield, was an act of "fanatic recklessness" and a sign that leader Kim Jong Un "is spiraling out of control." President Barack Obama said the U.S. would never accept North Korea as a nuclear power. In other images from the Asia-Pacific region last week, Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the leaders of Britain, Japan, Russia and other Group of 20 nations pledged to boost sluggish global growth by promoting innovation as they met in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. Obama became the first U.S. president to make an official visit to Laos, paying tribute to survivors maimed by some 80 million unexploded bombs America dropped on the Southeast Asian country decades ago and pledging U.S. help to finally clean them up. In this Friday, Sept. 9, 2016, file photo, South Korean and U.S. Marines stand in smoke during the 66th Incheon Landing Operations Commemoration ceremony in Incheon, South Korea. Incheon is the coastal city where the United Nations Forces led by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur landed in September, 1950 just months after North Korea invaded the South. North Korea said Friday it conducted a "higher level" nuclear warhead test explosion, which it trumpeted as finally allowing it to build "at will" an array of stronger, smaller and lighter nuclear weapons. It is Pyongyang's fifth atomic test and the second in eight months. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File) A boiler exploded and triggered a fire at a packaging factory near Bangladesh's capital, killing at least 31 workers and injuring dozens.

Every day is different for Leah, so an afternoon with giggles and smiles is uplifting for her parents and nurse.

Eleven-year-old Leah Williams, of Kylertown, will not perspire. Not ever. You could wrap her in a thick wool sweater and leave her out on the back porch in the middle of July and she would still return dry as a bone. It has nothing to do with an enviable ability to remain stoic in the face of the small stuff and everything to do with an extremely rare genetic disorder called ALG13 mutation. Her mother, Krista, was the first to notice the symptoms, which presented themselves innocently enough in the rolling eye of her infant daughter. Doctors could not explain that symptom or others, or why Leah would continue to experience seizures almost daily for the next several years of her life. They weren’t able to find anything different or wrong with her. They kind of just called it ‘Leah Syndrome.’ Krista Williams “They weren’t able to find anything different or wrong with her. They kind of just called it ‘Leah Syndrome,’ ” Krista said. The family adapted. Krista left her job at a pediatrician’s office so that she could stay home with Leah. Her husband, Brandon, works as many overtime shifts as he can at the Wal-Mart distribution center in Woodland to bridge the deficit. Definitive answers regarding their daughter’s condition remained scarce until just a few years ago, when at age 9, Leah was recommended for a gene study at Geisinger Medical Center. The results of the test took almost two years to come into fruition, and in that time, Krista and Brandon were greeted by a surprise pregnancy and the birth of their youngest daughter, Eden. Since the waters surrounding Leah’s diagnosis were still so murky, the expectant parents had no idea if their next child would arrive in the world carrying the same medical baggage. “I always wondered for my other kids if they had a chance of having a child like Leah or not,” Krista said. Today, Eden is a 2-year-old in good health. The ALG13 mutation that Leah’s testing revealed isn’t hereditary. 8 other people in the world have been identified with Leah’s condition What this means in terms of her future, though, remains relatively unclear. She is thought to be the oldest of only eight other people in the world who have been identified with her condition. There is no example to look toward, no diagnostic flowchart available for what her life may eventually become. The realities of Leah’s present are bracing, but more concrete. Developmentally, she is at the level of an 18-24 month old, and while she was attending school up until last spring, she left as her stamina and energy continued to decline. “She used to love going outside and playing, and now she’s done after 15 minutes max,” Krista said. Her nourishment is delivered entirely via a feeding tube, and her body no longer regulates its own temperature — hence the distinct lack of sweat, even on a hot summer’s day drive to the doctor’s office. This is complicated by the state of the family minivan. The vehicle — which is a charitable description at this point — has more than 261,000 miles on it, and the engine has long outlasted the air conditioning system. Krista’s mother, Cherie Buck, started a fundraising campaign for the family on gofundme.com. The goal is to not only raise enough funds to cover the cost of a new family car, but to help offset expenses incurred while Leah takes part in a study at The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. “We were told it’s the most comprehensive testing she could ever have,” Krista said. Cardiologists, pulmonologists and endocrinologists are just a small sampling of the diverse pool of medical talent that Leah will be exposed to in Bethesda. Nobody is expecting any miracles, though. If a cure for the mutation remains out of reach, her family would settle for improving her quality of life. “I know Leah is probably going to be more help to science than science is to Leah,” Krista said. Even if science falls short, odds are the Williams clan at large won’t. Brandon said that Leah’s two brothers, 17-year-old Noah and 13-year-old Elijah, have been helping to care for her since they were little boys. They have learned to administer medicine and food with equal dexterity. They never resented Leah. They loved Leah more than you can ever ask two little boys to love their little sister. Brandon Williams “They never resented Leah. They loved Leah more than you can ever ask two little boys to love their little sister,” Brandon said. Donations can be made to “We Love You Leah” at gofundme.com or brought to any County National Bank location to the “Leah Williams Benefit” account.

Posted By: Todd Betzoldon: September 11, 2016In: Featured, TelevisionNo Comments We have now had three complete seasons of 90 Day Fiance and because of that, TLC is giving us an update on some of the most memorable couples, as 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? premiered tonight! To be honest, it was a little bit boring for the premiere, but the teaser for what is to come on 90 Day Fiance Happily Ever After looks amazingly full of drama! Check out the details from the couples tonight in our 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? Recap below! For this spinoff of 90 Day Fiance, TLC is brining back six couples from the first three seasons. Those couples are Russ & Paola from Season 1, Danielle & Mohammed and Brett & Daya from Season 2 and Kyle & Noon, Melanie & Devar and Loren & Alexei from Season 3. For tonight, we only started with four of the couples, so here is what we learned tonight: Danielle & Mohammed – Oh these two! I think they are the reason why this whole show was created, as they will probably be the focal point all season long. We found out that Mohammed has pretty much not been around most of their marriage. There was a lady posting on social media that she was pregnant by Mohammed! Well, he just got his green card and shockingly, he left and Danielle has not seen him since! Her and her friend go looking for him and they don’t even know where he works! How can you be married and not know that??? We see Mohammed talking with a friend he met at Walmart, which seems very fitting! He was never attracted to Danielle and he is definitely tapped out of the marriage. Danielle talks to her daughter and she discovered that Mohammed now has a dating profile on the same site he met Danielle and it says he is single! The show ends with Mohammed calling some blonde lady and she tells him to move to Miami and he seems to agree! (Just a side note, but the previews for the season show Danielle yelling at Mohammed in Miami and she is holding nothing back. Finally she seems to be growing a pair and I am going to love that scene)! Russ & Paola – He has lost his job, so she is out doing some modeling and acting gigs to help bring in some money. She does not seem happy to be living in the small town that they live in. She misses her family big time! It was her birthday, so he took her out to dinner with a couple of her friends and it was a good night until he gave her a Nerf gun for a present and she did not like it or understand the joke of it. He was pissed and these two have some issues to work on! Melanie & Devar – I think we are going to have some family drama from these two, which is why they were brought back. Things seems to be going well for them, but he is not happy in the small town they live in either and he said he has seen like three other black people since he moved to the United States! They are planning a trip to Jamaica to visit his family, so that is the big news from them. Loren & Alexei – These two are always drama, so they are back for more. The big news for them is that they are going back to his country to renew their vows in front of his family. She is worried that he is going to be glad to be home and not want to come back. Also, she wants her best friend to come with them, but this is the best friend that got strippers for her bachelorette party, even though Alexei said no strippers and he is not a fan of her! He said no Sarah, so it turned into a huge fight. She ended all depressed in bed and said that most people don’t know something about her and it has been bad lately, so she is going to be telling us whatever that something is this season! What could it be? Join us next week on Gossip & Gab for our 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? Recap.

Two passersby came to her aid and shot dead one of the alleged attackers, but one of them was wounded in the process.  Wendy Russell Macrorie said she was shopping for light bulbs and a tire for her son's bicycle when people in the store began saying someone had been shot outside While Macrorie was inside the story. the injured Good Samaritan was shot while trying to save the woman with an infant in a Walmart parking lot (pictured) from the two attackers Another good Samaritan shot one attacker dead as another fled.

This 9/11-Themed Mattress Ad Might Be The Most Offensive Commercial Ever Josh Kurp 09.09.16 2 months ago • 35 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Subscribe to UPROXX Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL This Sunday marks the 15th anniversary since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, which Donald Trump would have totally prevented if he was president, with Mark Wahlberg as his veep. A common rallying cry in the days and months following two planes being flown into the World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon, and a fourth that crashed into a Pennsylvania field was “never forget.” Walmart soda displays and tasteless ads probably aren’t how the 2,996 people who died that day want to be remembered. A mattress company in San Antonio, Texas, is being criticized for making what’s arguably the most offensive commercial of all-time. The Miracle Mattress ad opens with three people standing in front of a stack of mattresses that look like the Twin Towers. When the woman in the middle raises her hands, the two men standing behind her pretend to fall into the “towers” while she screams in horror. She then adds, “We will never forget.” Neither will the internet, which is horrified by the curious commercial. uh, that miracle mattress commercial making fun of 9/11 is horrifying and highly offensive. sick fucks. — gigi bella (@mgcsgianna) September 9, 2016 Share This Facebook Twitter EMAIL TAGS9/11COMMERCIALS Around The Web Join The Discussion: Log In With Sign In With Facebook Sign In With Twitter Sign In With Email Profile By: Josh Kurp 09.09.2016 @ 7:42 AM "This 9/11-Themed Mattress Ad Might Be The Most Offensive Commercial Ever" Profile By: Oedipus Rex 09.09.2016 @ 8:06 AM I don’t get offended by much and think “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” and all that mumble jumble are the dumbest things in the world. But holy shit, this is horrifically offensive. Forget the poor production and acting — this is just . . . wow. Profile By: FreeRon 09.09.2016 @ 10:09 AM That’s the crux of it all – this affected you on a visceral level, and yet, you would be quick to dismiss someone else’s similar feelings. I’m not even judging you, cuz we are all hypocrites in that way, just pointing it out. Profile By: FunkyWarmMedina 09.09.2016 @ 8:21 AM I won’t lie, I laughed. Still in poor taste. Profile By: OhMyBalls 09.09.2016 @ 9:00 AM I laughed at that woman’s interview. I can’t believe someone so bright would have such a bad idea. Profile By: iDrewApony 09.09.2016 @ 9:28 AM Is having a sale to “celebrate” 9/11 offensive? Yes. Do these people need to be taken out to the woodshed? No. As a born and raised NY’er, still living in Brooklyn, I just find the commercial dumb and in poor taste. I’m not shocked or “angered”. Furthermore; I bet a lot of people who are flooding their FB page, with their canned outrage, are probably not even from NY. This didn’t happen to the US, this happened to NY. Sorry kids. Profile By: FMurderSlaybraham 09.09.2016 @ 10:26 AM It also happened to DC and Pennsylvania. Thanks for teaching me the true meaning of why people say “never forget.” Profile By: iDrewApony 09.09.2016 @ 10:58 AM Sorry I didn’t know the twin towers were in DC and Pennsylvania. You’re right. Profile By: General Bluth 09.09.2016 @ 11:16 AM But when nearly 3,000 people die, people across the country and world are affect, dude. I knew multiple people here in Alabama who lost loved ones in the attacks. You think they shouldn’t mourn because they don’t live in New York? This affected us all. New York doesn’t have a monopoly on 9/11 grief. Profile By: Staubachlvr 09.09.2016 @ 11:17 AM So Flight 93 and the Pentagon don’t matter eh? Profile By: Nilf 09.09.2016 @ 1:50 PM What is the name of the towers you fucking idiot? Clueless moron doesn’t even know what they are but claim that they are only his because he lives in BROOKLYN A FUCKING BOROUGH. My sister was in Manhattan when that shit went down. You are the one that needs to be taken to the woodshed. Profile By: iDrewApony 09.09.2016 @ 4:25 PM Lotta flyover peeps mad right here. Profile By: FMurderSlaybraham 09.09.2016 @ 6:15 PM You said “9/11” in your original post, genius, not “Twin Tower” or “World Trade Center.” Specifically “this didn’t happen to the US, this happened to NY.” Nice try. Profile By: FMurderSlaybraham 09.09.2016 @ 6:16 PM For some reason that was posted under iDrewApony’s comment – iDrewApony, that was not directed towards you. Profile By: Oedipus Rex 09.09.2016 @ 9:28 AM Mike Bonanno … that’s HIS FUCKING DAUGHTER in the video. Bullshit that he didn’t know what was going on. Oh, and his daughter can go ahead and die. Profile By: El Superbeasto 09.09.2016 @ 2:04 PM Her heart’s probably the size of a canned ham, so just wait. Profile By: ak3647 09.09.2016 @ 9:54 AM Still though, King-size mattress at a twin price is a pretty good deal. Profile By: poonTASTIC 09.09.2016 @ 10:06 AM Excuse me, ma’am, I felt your commercial was very offensive, however your prices are too good to pass up. Profile By: poonTASTIC 09.09.2016 @ 10:05 AM Not going to lie, both the ad and the interview made me laugh in a ‘holy shit I can’t believe anyone is that dumb’ kind of way. best part: “We’re Miracle Mattress, we make miracles happen” Profile By: Dear Diarrhea, 09.09.2016 @ 10:29 AM This would have been really bad a few years ago but Trump has raised the bar on anything offensive. I give this 5 out of 10 comb-overs on the Trump scale. Profile By: Woody Bombay 09.09.2016 @ 11:04 AM Dear Diarrhea gets it. Profile By: Jgal1530 09.09.2016 @ 10:37 AM I can’t even. 30%? Try 300% for starters. Sick. Sick Sick Sick. Profile By: ElDiabloBlanco 09.09.2016 @ 11:16 AM people still say “I can’t even” ? Profile By: Bawk 09.09.2016 @ 1:49 PM @ElDiabloBlanco [www.youtube.com] Profile By: Woody Bombay 09.09.2016 @ 11:08 AM But what about the controlled demolition of Building 7, Miracle Mattress? Mattresses — er, buildings — don’t just collapse like that on their own. Bush, Cheney and the Saudis planned this sale from way back! Profile By: ElDiabloBlanco 09.09.2016 @ 11:17 AM Box springs can’t melt steel beams. Profile By: B-MO 09.09.2016 @ 11:59 AM Wake up sheeple ! Profile By: Jek Porkins 09.09.2016 @ 12:16 PM Can it beat their Auschwitz 50% OFF Anniversary sale from last year? I highly doubt it. Profile By: colourblindsith 09.09.2016 @ 12:51 PM Oh my days, thats wasnt good. yet coke orf wamart will do the same soon. Profile By: B-MO 09.09.2016 @ 12:56 PM ♫ Where were you when were had that twin towers sale ♫ ♫ That September day ♫ Profile By: The Amazing Dougie 09.09.2016 @ 1:04 PM Are those two guys Muslims? Profile By: IOvUF 09.09.2016 @ 1:15 PM that’s a low bar for being offensive these days…9/11 was awful, but this cheap, stupid commercial IS awful – there’s a difference. bad taste is bad taste, but the outrage here is being amplified unnecessarily. Profile By: Brute Farce 09.09.2016 @ 3:24 PM It’s hard to believe anyone thought this kind of ad would be acceptable. It’s also hard to believe that within her apology, she’s still in sales promotion mode. Yep… you’re “making miracles,” that makes everything alright. Profile By: rsnation 09.09.2016 @ 5:25 PM Does anyone have first hand knowledge of the store or the employees? I know, I’m nuts, but because I thought the ad was beyond outrageous I started digging. Mike Bonanno is the owner of Miracle Mattress. When I google the name I get Igor Vamos , who under the name Mike Bonanno is a member of The Yes Men, who, according to their YouTube account is “an activist group known for satirical interventions”. Now, obviously there are plenty of other Mike Bonannos out there, but this is an interesting coincidence. Profile By: Brute Farce 09.09.2016 @ 6:53 PM On second thought, it seems that no one could possibly be as oblivious as Miracle Mattress crew. If it is The Yes Men, they must be laughing their asses off at most of us commenting today. Profile By: Venkman007 09.10.2016 @ 7:29 AM Her only ‘miracle’ is making bags of chips disappear in a sitting. And yeah- one of the most offensive commercials ever.
