Rick Scott's desk. Miami Herald If a single House member voted differently, the "liquor wall" bill would not be on Gov. Rick Scott's desk. Miami Herald State Politics May 23, 2017 10:26 AM Will Rick Scott sign or veto 'liquor wall' bill? Two big clues here By Steve Bosuquet Herald/Times Tallahassee Bureau LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Tallahassee Gov. Rick Scott has until Wednesday to decide the fate of one of the most heavily-lobbied bills in years, the removal of the so-called "liquor wall" so that Walmart, Target and other big box stores can sell liquor. Publix and local chain liquor stores tried mightily to kill the bill but it squeaked through the Senate, 21-17, and the House, 58-57, after years of intense lobbying on both sides. The lobbying is now aimed at Scott -- and the clock is ticking. If Scott wants to use "the wall" to thank a friend and punish an enemy at the same time, it's not even a close call. Scott's ally on economic development issues, Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, is a leading critic of the liquor wall bill who voted no, and Scott's No. 1 nemesis, House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes, is a supporter who voted yes and whose brother, Michael, is a lobbyist for Walmart. Walmart has made three separate contributions to Scott's Let's Get to Work PAC totaling $110,000, including a $50,000 check on March 31, a week after the Senate sent the bill to the House. If the pro-business Republican governor signs this bill, he'll see headlines connecting the two. The bill (SB 106) passed the House amid controversy and allegations, reported here by the Florida Times-Union, that several lawmakers "took a walk" and skipped a close vote to avoid antagonizing special interests and lobbyists on either side. Two absent House members cast no votes after the roll call vote and a third changed his vote from yes to no. Those late votes are in the record but they don't change the outcome of a "board" vote. Still, that alone provides another rationalization for Scott to issue his first veto of the 2017 session. If Scott is looking for five more reasons to veto the bill, at least that many House Republicans who voted to abolish Enterprise Florida also voted to tear down the liquor wall in the spirit of free enterprise. They are Reps. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast; Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford; Mike LaRosa, R-St. Cloud; Clay Ingram, R-Pensacola; and Frank White, R-Pensacola. They're listed here because Scott called out all five by name and on TV at recent events where he criticized the Legislature for turning its back on Florida's economy.

Photographer: Sergio Flores/Bloomberg AutoZone Inc. reported profit and sales that missed analyst estimates as the seller of car replacement parts joined a chorus of retailers saying U.S. tax refund delays squelched demand early this year. Net income excluding some items was $11.44 per share during the third quarter ended May 6, trailing the low end of 25 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales for stores open at least one year declined 0.8 percent, also missing projections. AutoZone joins retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Foot Locker Inc. in saying customers curbed spending while waiting on tax refunds. Legislation passed in 2015 aimed at preventing fraud may have postponed funds being remitted to 25 million to 30 million U.S. households this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists wrote in February. “For whatever reason, we don’t quite understand, those refund dollars never seemed to show up,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Rhodes said on a call with analysts. “It has been such a big driver of industry sales, and it just went away.” Capital expenditures at AutoZone’s “mega hub” stores and wage increases fueled by low unemployment also pushed up costs, while a second consecutive mild winter hurt demand for some products, Rhodes said. “What we have experienced over a two-year period of time in the Northeast, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic is alarming,” he said. “It has to do with what’s going on with the weather pattern; we can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice and potholes.” Shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based AutoZone plunged as much as 9.4 percent to $597.45 as of 2:10 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday drop since November 2008. The stock fell 16 percent this year through the close Monday, trailing the 6.9 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. Other auto parts and repair chains also declined, including Advance Auto Parts Inc., O’Reilly Automotive Inc. and Monro Muffler Brake Inc. “While the sales slowdown in the industry in February and March was well publicized, it seems the company was in a bigger hole than we had anticipated,” Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, wrote in a report Tuesday. “Sales did pick up in April and early May, but not enough to make up for the early quarter shortfall.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

The company on Tuesday announced a new pay policy for all full-time and part-time workers who leave for voluntary or involuntary military assignments. Walmart's pledge is to cover the difference in pay any time an employee's military salary is less than what he or she makes working at the store. So even when a worker is on a military assignment, they're now guaranteed to earn at least as much as they would working as a civilian at Walmart. The policy covers any military assignment from three days up to five years. The company already offers differential pay to some active service members. But this policy change vastly expands the existing program, and it now covers employees who want to do "voluntary services," which includes basic training. Walmart says it will become "one of the first major retailers" to offer such comprehensive coverage. Related: Walmart adding 10,000 U.S. jobs Walmart said the policy will now allow employees who are thinking about enlisting in the military "to do so without fear of losing wages during training." Gary Profit, a former Brigadier General in the armed forces who is now director of military programs at Walmart (WMT), said the "lion's share" of Walmart workers who leave for military duty would take a pay cut without the program. Soldiers don't typically draw a large salary, especially those who are newly enlisted. On its website, the U.S. Army says that soldiers with less than two years of experience make about $19,200 per year, or about $9.23 per hour. And the Army says that pay is slightly lower for the first four months of service. Walmart, meanwhile, has increased its pay in recent years after it was targeted by Fight for $15, a grassroots movement that lobbies for higher minimum wages. In February 2016, the company boosted its minimum wage to $10 per hour from $9. Walmart said this week that its full-time workers now make an average of $13.60 per hour. The company's maximum hourly wage is $24.70. Related: Robots could wipe out another 6 million retail jobs Walmart is also in the middle of a massive push to hire veterans. The company has promised to hire 250,000 veterans who have been honorably discharged from service by the end of 2020. Profit, Walmart's director of military programs, said the company has already hired 170,000 veterans since 2013.

The store, located at 2972 Iris Avenue in Boulder, was the subject of several protests when it opened in 2013. “After a careful and thoughtful review process, we have made the difficult decision to close our Walmart Neighborhood Market in Boulder,” Walmart spokesperson Anne Hatfield said in a statement. “Similar to what every retailer does, these closures are part of the standard review process of our store portfolio to make sure we are achieving our long-term strategy.” “We are grateful to the customers who have given us the privilege of serving them and look forward to serve them at our nearby Walmart stores and on walmart.com,” Hatfield said in the statement. Walmart told the Boulder Daily Camera that the store’s 70 employees will be given the option to transfer to nearby Walmart Supercenters in Lafayette, Broomfield, and Longmont. The 53,000 square foot store was the center of controversy when it opened in October 2013. Several residents and members from a group self-proclaimed as the Coalition for Social and Environmental Responsibility held protests and an “unwelcome party” to voice their opinion about the mega-retailer moving into Boulder. In January, Walmart closed Neighborhood Market stores in Denver and Littleton. The store will close June 16. 40.035207 -105.255028 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Email Print More Reddit Tumblr Google Pocket Send us your photos Do you see breaking news?

(Source: CNN) (WJLA/CNN) - Walmart announced a new pay policy Tuesday aimed at making sure employees do not take pay cuts for serving in the military. The retailer says it will cover any gap in pay for employees whose military salary is lower than what they earn working for Walmart. The differential pay program is open to all employees and covers military service ranging from three days up to five years. It also includes voluntary military training. U.S. Army soldiers earn an average of $9.23 per hour during their first two years of service. Walmart's minimum wage is $10 an hour, but the average rate for full-time employees is more than $13 an hour. The company also pledged to hire a quarter million veterans by the end of 2020.

REX Shutterstock. A proposed 20 percent import tax — dubbed the border adjustment tax — continued to be a source of contention among retail executives and lawmakers at a hearing on Capitol Hill today. Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell and former Walmart U.S. president and CEO William Simon shared opposing views on the new tax, which has been widely opposed by the retail industry, including the National Retail Federation and trade organizations the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA) and the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA). Related Target Will Shell Out $18.5 Million for a Data Breach That Impacted 40 Million Customers At today’s hearing before the Ways and Means Committee, Target’s chief prefaced his testimony by noting that he believes the current tax code is “broken” and that “the status quo is unacceptable.” However, he went on to say the BAT would take a significant toll on American families. “Under the new border adjustment tax, American families — your constituents —would pay more so that many multinational corporations would pay even less,” he said. “85 percent of Americans shop at Target every year. We believe this new tax would hit families hard, raising prices on everyday essentials by 20 percent.” He added, “I can’t sign up for a plan that would stick American families with that bill or double their tax rates — a plan that would stifle our investment in America.” Conversely, Walmart’s former U.S. chief saw potential upside to the BAT, if “properly implemented.” “I have weighed the considerable challenges this proposal presents to retail with the significant benefits it will deliver to the economy as a whole, and have concluded that properly implemented, it is in the best interest of our country for this to be considered,” Simon said. (Walmart, now helmed by CEO Doug McMillon, has publicly spoken out against the BAT.) Simon suggested that he believed the tax could meet its intent of boosting domestic manufacturing jobs. “Manufacturing jobs in the country — and around the world — have always represented a pathway to the middle class,” he explained. “There’s a reason the middle class has struggled in this country recently, and it’s the same reason we’ve seen middle classes emerge in global markets. And that is because the manufacturing base has moved, and with it the jobs have fallen.” Simon’s views, however, are generally at odds with those of the retail industry. In comments submitted to the Ways and Means Committee ahead of today’s meeting, the AAFA reinforced its opposition to the BAT provision included in the House Republicans’ “A Better Way” tax blueprint. Most notably, the organization said the tax would have a “massive inflationary impact” on the fashion industry and “trigger devastating job losses.” “With approximately 98 percent of all clothes and shoes imported, a border adjustment that eliminates the ability to deduct the cost of imported goods sold from income tax calculations would translate to an additional 20 percent (or 25 percent in the case of pass-through corporations) tax on clothing and shoes,” the AAFA wrote in the comments. “With an industry that faces low margins, especially on lower-priced products, this tax would pass through to the consumer – raising prices by as much as 20-25 percent.” Following the hearing, FDRA president and CEO Matt Priest expressed similar concerns about the controversial tax, referring to the BAT as a potential measure that is “based on academic theory, not real world experience.” “We are deeply concerned that House leaders continue to advance the controversial BAT that would hit consumers with a $1.2 trillion tax hike and drive up shoe prices for working-class individuals and families,” Priest said. “As Target CEO Brian Cornell made clear to the committee in his testimony today, the BAT will harm American consumers and create uncertainty for American businesses that we rely on for job creation … FDRA stands ready to work with Congress on tax reform that will grow our economy, but we reject the idea that Congress should lower corporate rates by imposing a new BAT tax on everyone who buys and sells shoes.” — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Retail, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, AAFA, FDRA, Target, Walmart Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Post navigation ← These are the Top Selling Sneakers of April Melania Trump Chooses Longtime Favorite Designer for Arrival in Italy → Featured Gallery Celebrity Statement Shoes: May 2017 ALERTS & NEWSLETTERS SIGN UP PRIVACY POLICY Around The Web Latest Publication Footwear News 05/22/2017 Read Now Cannes Facetime: Helmer Sergei Loznitsa, 'A Gentle Creature' The Voice Finale: And the Winner Is… Cannes 70th: "Cinema Is With Manchester" Says Fest Boss; del… Security Expert Reveals Safety Tips For Summer Concerts After… All of 8Bitdo's awesome retro controllers now support Nintendo… Contact Us About Us Advertise Terms of Use Privacy Policy Your Privacy Rights Newsletters The Power of Content Variety india.com Hollywoodlife Deadline TV Line GOLDDERBY WWD © 2017 Fairchild Publishing, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC.

Walmart will offer to make up the difference in pay for employees who are on military assignments, if their military pay is less than they make at Walmart. It applies to military assignments longer than three days. The differential pay policy will take effect starting June 24. The company will also be streamlining the process it takes to apply for differential pay, according to the company statement. In 2016 employees went on more than 4,400 military assignments. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch," said Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart. "The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” The company revealed they will also be giving a $100,000 grant to Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, which helps family members who have experienced the death of a loved one while serving in the Armed Forces.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Costco Wholesale Corporation Shareholders Have Something to Worry About The warehouse retailer has been an undeniable success story, but the road ahead looks more challenging. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 23, 2017 at 11:20AM Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has been one of the strongest retail stocks in recent years. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500 at a time when most of its competitors have suffered. While its brick-and-mortar peers struggle to overcome e-commerce competition and falling mall traffic, Costco benefits from a membership model that has given it a sticky customer base. Members are happy to scour the big box's aisles for bulk goods and surprises, a privilege that a $60 annual membership fee grants them. Image source: Costco. However, while Costco's business has remained stronger than most, with comparable sales consistently climbing, there are some concerns investors should be aware of. Here are a few reasons why Costco shareholders have something to worry about. 1. The valuation is pricey While Costco shares have more doubled over the last five years, that appreciation isn't entirely due to profit growth. Its earnings multiple has also expanded alongside the market, and the stock now trades at a P/E of 32. WMT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. That is significantly more expensive than its peers as it exceeds Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) P/E of 18, Kroger's at 14, and Target's at 11. In other words, the market is expecting the warehouse retailer to deliver about twice the level of profit growth of its peers. No other large brick-and-mortar retailer carries such a high valuation, and it may be difficult for Costco to beat those expectations. After the wholesaler raised its membership fee by $5 this year, to $60, analysts expect profits to increase 13% next year, to $6.39, but they will likely slow after that. The stock has proven resilient thus far, but a sustained slowdown in profit growth would slash its valuation. 2. E-commerce is a weakness In a way, Costco's ability to thrive without a strong e-commerce operation in this era is a testament to the strength of its core business. While many brick-and-mortar chains have had to adapt their business models to fend off Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco's stores are a shopping destination with the power to draw customers through savings and the "treasure hunt" effect. However, rivals like Amazon and Wal-Mart are working to leverage the power of e-commerce. Wal-Mart, for example, now offers grocery pickup for online orders at close to a thousand stores. Amazon is experimenting with such a model, and has expanded its Fresh grocery-delivery service to more than a dozen metro areas. Costco's online sales make up less than 3% of overall revenue, and the company has resisted conventional upgrades like buy online, pick up in-store. It could, for instance, build out grocery pickup kiosks to match Wal-Mart, but the company sees the strength of its model as bringing customers into the store to make impulse purchases. The high expense associated with shipping bulk goods to customers' homes generally rules out that option. As Amazon and Wal-Mart continue to invest in e-commerce, Costco could fall behind for good. 3. Stores are getting less efficient Costco's comparable sales are still positive, and the company continues to open new stores, but according to one popular metric, the company is becoming less efficient. Sales per square foot measures how efficiently retailers use their real estate, and is an important metric in determining customer demand. In each of Costco's last two fiscal years, sales per square foot has declined, as the chart below shows, following a trend in decelerating same-store sales growth. Data source: Costco 10-K filings. At $1,150 in revenue per square foot, Costco still generates much more revenue than comparable stores, but the company's model produces lower profit margins than competitors like Wal-Mart or Target, so it needs to have higher sales volumes. While many retailers have scaled back on new-store openings, Costco has continued to expand, but if this number keeps falling, management may have to question that strategy. Unlike some other retailers, Costco isn't about to crumble, but the industry and consumer expectations are quickly shifting around it. The next 10 years for the company will likely not be as easy as the last 10. Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Kroger. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon and Costco Wholesale.

Transportation analyst Brad Delco of Stephens is encouraged by the inventory levels of large retailers with planned reduction in inventory expected to continue. Delco recently reviewed the earnings reports and conference calls of the retailers to gauge their demand and inventory levels. He also incorporated data on inventory and sales nationwide into his analysis on retail inventory trends and trucking. “While we continue to see signs of an inventory correction occurring, we believe the continued growth of e-commerce is having impacts on the traditional truckload supply chains as retailers update their distribution networks,” according to Delco’s analysis. He noted Amazon “continues to take market share and retains sizeable inventory levels in the domestic retail market albeit still 25% of the inventory levels of (Wal-Mart Stores) in terms of (U.S. dollars).” Other companies Stephens included in its analysis included Kohl’s, Macy’s, Target, T.J. Maxx and Wal-Mart. The group of companies reduced inventory by an average of 3% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, according to Stephens. Wal-Mart same-store inventory in the United States fell 7.3%. Some of the companies in the group have more inventory reductions planned. However, Amazon inventories rose about 11% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2016. “We continue to believe the draw-down in inventories and subsequent re-stocking provides a positive setup for the (trucking companies) in combination with the ELD mandate looking out,” Delco said. E-COMMERCE RISING The number of consumers who prefer to make purchases online continues to rise, leading traditional brick-and-mortar stores to close. Over the next two years, Macy’s will close 100 stores, or 15% of its total store base. J.C. Penney, Sears, K-Mart are a few other large retailers closing stores. Meanwhile, Amazon’s revenue rose 23% in the first quarter. Delco noted Target announced a pilot program, Target Restock, “aimed at providing next-day delivery of essential items,” including “toiletries and non-perishable goods for a low flat fee to online customers.” Also, Wal-Mart expanded its e-commerce offering when it acquired Jet.com, “which helped drive a 63% increase in U.S. e-commerce sales” in the first quarter and “helped bolster overall top-line growth.” U.S. inventory-to-sales ratios have fallen from peak levels in the first quarter of 2016. In December, the ratio improved to 1.35, “marking the lowest ratio since 2014, driven by stronger sales in the fourth quarter of 2016,” according to Delco. But in the past quarter inventory levels have risen almost 1%, compared to the previous quarter. TRUCK TONNAGE FALLS IN APRIL In April, an index measuring the amount of freight trucks haul fell 1.8%, from the same month in 2016, according to trade organization American Trucking Associations. ATA’s seasonally adjusted For-Hire Truck Tonnage Index declined 2.5% in April, from March. The index also was down 1.1% in March, from the previous month. The index reached a peak in February 2016, and for the year, the index rose 2.5%. “I have to admit that April’s contraction is a bit surprising, especially considering the anecdotal reports I’ve been hearing from fleets regarding freight levels,” said Bob Costello, ATA chief economist. “It’s not necessarily that tonnage levels fell in April that is surprising, but the size of the decrease. One explanation is that housing starts fell substantially in April as well, and residential construction generates heavier truck freight.” Over the past three months tonnage has fallen 3.6%. “I still expect moderate growth going forward as key sectors of the economy continue to improve slowly,” he said.

Investigator A.J. Gambino, with the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department, said deputies first thought they were looking for two women. After interviewing witnesses, it appears the suspects are men dressed in women’s clothing. Investigators have been able to identify one suspect they are looking for. Gambino said investigators are working to find 25-year-old Mykiea Miller, of Mobile, AL. The second suspect has not yet been identified. Gambino said the investigation started last Wednesday, May 17, after a Kiln woman reported her credit card and a gun was stolen from her vehicle overnight, and she received emails from her credit card company warning of possible fraudulent activity at two area Walmart stores. The woman’s card was used at stores in Waveland and Picayune. Gambino said, what appeared to be a black woman was caught on camera at the Waveland Walmart using the stolen card to purchase gift cards at a self-checkout register. While investigating the incident at the Waveland Walmart, Gambino said a second auto burglary was reported in Waveland. Like the first burglary, the victim received emails from their credit card company warning of possible fraudulent activity at the Waveland Walmart. The same suspect was caught on surveillance video purchasing gift cards with the credit card stolen from the second burglary. Gambino said later that morning, two suspects returned to the Waveland Walmart, placed jewelry in a layaway account, and then used the fraudulently purchased gift cards to purchase the jewelry out of layaway. The Walmart associate present when the suspects purchased the jewelry described them as black men “dressed in drag,” Gambino said. According to Gambino, the suspects tried to return the jewelry for cash at Walmart stores in Pass Christian and Lafayette, LA. Gambino said the suspects searched the area looking for easy targets, such as unlocked cars, and used the stolen credit cards to load gift cards immediately after stealing them. Investigators believe the suspects are traveling in a silver car, make and model unknown. The suspects are wanted on charges of burglary and credit card fraud. If you have any information that could help investigators solve this case, please call the sheriff’s department at 228-466-6900 or dispatch at 228-255-9191. The Waveland Police Department is working with the sheriff’s department on the case. Copyright 2017 WLOX. All rights reserved.

Walmart store in Carson, California, on January 27, 2015. Area 52 Advertising Inc Moment Editorial/Getty Images Walmart Walmart Says It Has ‘No Tolerance’ for Racial Slurs Used by Customer in Video Mahita Gajanan May 23, 2017 Walmart condemned a woman who was caught on video of a customer yelling slurs at a Latina woman in one of its stores, saying it has "no tolerance" for such behavior. Eva Hicks, the woman who posted the video, said she was trying to get medicine from the pharmacy aisle at a Walmart located in Centerton, Ark., when the woman she was attempting to pass started yelling at her. The video, posted to Hicks' Facebook on Monday, had more than 2 million views by Tuesday afternoon. "Go back wherever you're from," the woman in the video said. When a bystander interjected to tell the woman to "stop being ignorant," the woman called her the N-word. The conflict between the customers went on for about 3 minutes, with Hicks expressing shock throughout at the way the woman was speaking to her. Eventually, an assistant manager at the store, who said his name was Wes, intervened, telling the woman, "She has every right to be here as you do." "I never in my life thought this would happen to me," Hicks wrote on Facebook. "Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country." The video gained further traction after New York Daily News writer Shaun King shared it on Twitter, calling for Walmart to ban the woman from the store. Walmart responded on Tuesday afternoon, saying it has "value and respect" for all of its customers and it is "continuing to look into the matter." @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter. Below is our official statement: pic.twitter.com/BkKKVDrjE6- Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) May 23, 2017 "We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store," Walmart said in a statement.

Eva Hicks, who appears to live in Pennsylvania and identified herself as Mexican on social media, stopped to do her grocery shopping on Monday night after a long day at work. However, while trying to reach an item in the pharmacy aisle, she confronted an angry, abusive elderly woman. 'Go back to Mexico,' the white woman is heard saying at the start of the video. Scroll down for video  A woman shopping at a Walmart - believed to be in Pennsylvania - has been filmed going on a racist rant 'Listen, I said excuse me, don't be rude,' Hicks replied, before the woman starts up her abuse again. 'Go back, wherever you're from. You're the one that's rude. 'You're in America, you are in America.' A third woman, who is off-screen, is then heard saying: 'Are you serious right now?'

Share this article Share 636 shares Eva Hicks (left and right) was a victim of the abuse after she stopped in at a Walmart on the way home from work on Monday The angry white shopper quickly switches her attention to the black woman off-camera, saying: 'That's none of your business right now, stay out of it.' The third woman replies: 'I don't need to stay out of it. You are yelling loud enough for everyone to hear, stop being ignorant.' That remark prompts the elderly woman to fire off an incredibly offensive attack. 'A n*****'s calling me ignorant?' Hicks, who is clearly shocked by the comment towards the third woman, is heard saying: 'Oh my goodness, you are very rude.' The racist woman then waves her arm in the direction of Hicks, adding: 'Just go away, just get your stuff and get out of here. Then go back to Mexico.' The racist woman was seen in the video abusing Hicks (left). She also waved her arm at her (right) - seemingly in an attempt to shoo her away The woman continued in her rant for about three minutes. She repeatedly told Hicks to leave the country and 'go back where she came from' 'No, I will not get out of here, no,' Hicks replies. 'No I'm not, because this is my country, yes it is.' The elderly woman again cuts her off, saying: 'It's not your country, oh no, we don't want you here.' At that point, a store manager can be heard off camera saying: 'That's not true, we want you here.' The manager then begins speaking to the white woman, telling her: 'This is inappropriate.' Thinking she had a defender, the woman pointed at Hicks and said for the manager to 'tell her'. 'No ma'am, it's inappropriate speak for the store,' he replied. Confused, the racist woman is then heard saying: 'I'm not here for the store, I'm spending money in the store.' When a manger arrived the woman tried to point the finger at Hicks (left). However, the employee, asked the woman to leave the store instead Hicks, who sounds in the video as though she is holding back tears, then said, 'so am I', before the white woman turned to her again and tried to wave her away while rudely saying: 'please go, go.' Mocking Hicks for being emotional about the situation, the woman then said, 'wah, wah, wah,' and pretending to cry. The black woman who was abused earlier in the clip is then heard asking the manager, identified only as Wes, if the woman 'still had a right to be in the store'. Wes said no, and then asked the racist woman to leave the store. 'It's not my fault… you going to make her leave too?' she asked. 'Well, you're the one causing a scene in the store… I heard you, I heard you from the office,' Wes said. 'I'm just trying to resolve a conflict here.' The racist woman then shot back: 'No you're not, the conflict is her.' But a few seconds later, the woman surrenders and stormed out of the store. Writing about the incident on Facebook, Hicks said: 'I love this country and I will stay in this country.' She was also flooded with positive comments from friends and others who saw the video, which has been shared almost 40,000 times.

Varun Sood In the year ended 31 March 2017, TCS, Infosys and Wipro saw at least a 20% reduction in the outsourcing business they got from US retailers Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target Corp. and Sears Holdings. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: One morning in October 2015, a senior executive at Wipro Ltd, was leaving home when he heard news that was disturbing enough for him, a veteran road-warrior, to leave his laptop charger behind. He had just been told by his team in the US that Best Buy, the American electronics retailer, was shutting down 30 stores. Wipro handled several technology processes for the retailer, including testing software and rolling out enterprise application planning software and store inventory management applications. The decision to close stores meant less business for India’s third largest software company. Wipro got business of around $70 million from Best Buy. “The retail industry is fighting its own battle for survival because of e-commerce companies such as Amazon,” the executive said in an informal conversation in October 2015. Now, after a year and a half, this’s even more true. In the year ended 31 March 2017, TCS, Infosys and Wipro saw at least a 20% reduction in the business they got from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy Co. Inc., Target Corp., Sears Holdings Corp., and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, according to executives familiar with the development. In May, while announcing results for the three months ended on 31 March, TCS chief executive officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka and Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala, spoke about weak demand from retail clients on account of “structural changes” witnessed by the retail industry. Retail companies typically spend 2-3% of their total sales on technology, including outsourcing. Over the last few years, large retail firms have been cutting back on their spending on application development or managing back-end infrastructure, focusing on new-age solutions, such as data analytics platforms. Indian IT firms are rarely the beneficiaries. TCS, Wipro, and Infosys do not disclose business from retail clients but estimates suggest that this is around $1.3 billion, $500 million, and $700 million a year, respectively. That’s a bit: for TCS, which counts seven of the largest 10 US-based retail companies as its clients, retail and packaged consumer product companies account for the second biggest chunk of business, after banks and insurers. While the CEOs of the three companies didn’t dwell on the “structural changes” in retail, four executives at the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity laid them out. First, more people, globally, are switching to e-commerce , forcing big box retailers to shut down stores. Best Buy, which saw its stores peak at 1,503 in 2013, ended December 2016 with 1,026 stores. Expectedly, the electronics retailer outsourced less than $50 million in business to Wipro in the year ended March 2017. Two, more retail companies such as Wal-Mart and Target are cutting their dependence on outsourcing companies and looking to do more work themselves, through their captive centres. “Retail companies are realising that they have become technology companies,” said one of the four, a TCS executive. “Smaller teams operating out of captives; automation tools; and ability to connect with start-ups focused on newer technologies is making most of them reconsider why they need IT services companies” Target said that the decision to “in-source” more engineering and technology was not on account of economic challenges but because the retail giant saw more benefit in doing the work itself. “For close to two years now, Target has been sharpening priorities within technology and transforming how our tech team works—moving to a product model from a project model. As part of this, we have shifted the majority of our engineering workforce to internal team members while relying on fewer contractors,” said a spokesperson for Target. “We have hired more than 1,000 engineers in the US and India within the last two years, and our technology performance and results have improved as we’ve made this shift”. “Like any major technology player, we take a holistic look at our projects and the mix of teams who work on them—this includes full-time employees, contractors, consultants, and any hybrid there-of,” said a spokesperson for Wal-Mart. Emails sent to Best Buy, Sears Holdings, and Wm Morrison Supermarkets seeking comment went unanswered. TCS and Infosys declined to offer a comment for this piece, saying that the companies as a policy do not comment on client specific details. An email sent to Wipro seeking comment did not elicit any response. Insourcing is a clear trend, said an expert. “We see many clients (across industries) revisiting their sourcing arrangements. This is driven by the fundamental operating model shift from technologies such as artificial intelligence or machine learning or robotics to work more “agile” which in the optimal scenario requires co-located, cross functional teams,” said Ralf Dreischmeier, London-based head of technology practice at The Boston Consulting Group. “Clients across industries recognize that in order to become a digital leader you need to build world class in-house engineering capabilities and work closely with the broader digital ecosystem which includes tech start-ups as well as the large tech players,” he added. The worry is that other sectors could take a leaf out of retail’s playbook. The banking and financial services business, which accounts for roughly 40% of the revenue of largest Indian IT firms, is already in the throes of change, with start-up fintech companies disrupting incumbents.

Here's how. By Ben Levisohn May 23, 2017 11:52 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are thought to be somewhat immune to the perils of internet competition, partially due to the fact that you can't ship paint through the mail. But what about other businesses like, say, appliances? Illustration: Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg There the outlook may not be so rosy, write BMO's Wayne Hood and team. They explain why: Over the last several months, we have seen Amazon.com (AMZN) and [Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT)] Jet.com expanding their appliance offering, which could create a growing risk to Home Depot, Lowe’s, and others as they build out their product offering, improve the end-to-end delivery solution, and strengthen their financing options. We see emerging lower prices on certain appliances by Amazon and Jet.com, and believe Lowe’s, Home Depot, and others will have to keep their pencils sharpened to Amazon and Jet.com’s pricing and call out points of difference. We would become increasingly concerned if Amazon and Jet.com widened their assortment, offered free delivery and installation services, bundled offers and special buys, and developed strong financing options. Shares of Home Depot have declined 0.4% to $155.31, while Lowe's has fallen 0.8% to $83.37, Wal-Mart Stores has risen 0.4% to $78.88, and Amazon.com has advanced 0.2% to $972.91.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Beaten-Up Dividend Aristocrats: Are They Bargains? Shares of Target Corporation, ExxonMobil, and W.W. Grainger are well off of their highs lately. Perhaps it's time to take a closer look. Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) May 23, 2017 at 12:19PM For a company to achieve the rarified status of Dividend Aristocrat -- which means it has raised its dividend annually for 25 consecutive years -- indicates it has overcome market challenges and multiple market cycles to produce extraordinarily consistent results. For the most part, the stocks of these stalwarts of consistency don't sell for a discount that often. However, some do experience difficult periods and can lose that Dividend Aristocrat status if the business fundamentals start to unravel. Let's take a look at three Dividend Aristocrats whose stocks have fallen on hard times -- big-box retailer Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and equipment supplier W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) -- and see if these are buying opportunities. Image source: Getty Images. Caught on its back foot Retail has always been a tough business, but the past couple quarters have been especially challenging. Even retail giants like Target haven't been immune, as the company's stock is down 19% over the previous year.  While it would be easy to chalk it up to the general malaise among retailers, that would ignore some of the lingering issues for Target.  Last quarter, the company announced better-than-expected earnings, but those expectations were terribly low, as it produced a same-store sales decline of 1.5% -- and that includes growth from its online sales. Same-store sales for its brick-and-mortar stores were down 2.2%. While Target did show some growth in online sales that should give investors hope, they are doing so at a much slower pace than its largest rival, Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales grew 63% this past quarter and were a significant factor in boosting overall revenue. Target is hoping that its Restock program -- free next-day delivery for select "essential" products" -- will be a viable alternative to Wal-Mart's free shipping options or Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) free delivery options for Prime members. It's still in the development phase and only available near its Minneapolis headquarters, though, so the company is still well behind the competition. Some people on Wall Street think that this better-than-expected sales decline is the first signs of a turnaround, but Target will need to prove that it can deliver on an e-commerce platform that can be more than just a replacement of its brick-and-mortar stores. Until we see some material progress toward this, it's hard to justify buying shares of Target just to take advantage of the low stock price and its 4.3% dividend yield.  If this downturn won't break the streak, it's hard to see what will When it comes to investing in oil and gas these days, the only question that investors seem to care about is how much exposure a company has to shale drilling. Those independent producers in places like the Permian Basin are growing like gangbusters lately even with oil hovering at $50 a barrel, and those companies that aren't putting up big growth numbers are getting left behind.  ExxonMobil is one of those industry stragglers. As of the last quarter, production declined 1% when you adjust for turnaround and maintenance work. Much of that fall has to do with the large drops in capital expenditures over the past few years. The only reason that earnings results have improved is higher price realizations of oil and gas. As a result, its shares have yet to recover from the oil price crash and are down 19% over the past three years.    The trouble with comparing ExxonMobil to those independent producers is that they are completely different businesses. ExxonMobil's 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day of production means that it has to bring a lot of new production on stream to move the needle, and that typically involves investing in major projects or substantial investments. It appears that, based on some recent purchases, it's ready to do just that. On top of a $5 billion acquisition of acreage in the sought-after Permian Basin, it has also made two multibillion-dollar purchases to acquire major natural gas fields in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique. These two places that hold immense promise as hubs for LNG export.  What's more, the company has been able to maintain its Dividend Aristocrat status throughout the recent crash. For investors looking for the stability of a long-term dividend stock, these past two years were the perfect test of ExxonMobil's resilience.  Another company threatened by Amazon For decades, W.W. Grainger supplied businesses with maintenance, repair, and operating equipment. It was a high-margin business that generated fantastic rates of return, and management rewarded investors by growing its dividend and buying back stock at a steady clip.  Over the past few quarters, though, it has faced the one challenge that scares just about every retailer or supplier: Amazon entering its specific space. One thing that e-commerce platforms have done to this niche industry is create more price competition for what was a protected market for Grainger, and that has been slowly eating away at its total sales on both a volume and revenue basis. This past quarter, management made the decision to implement some major price cuts to remain price competitive with its e-commerce competition. As a result, revenue increased only 1% and its lofty margins took a hit, but total sales volumes grew at the fastest pace in years. Management decided that it will continue with some price cuts for both Grainger's contract and non-contract sales. That will hit sales and margins but should help maintain relationships with its large clients. This is the one thing that it has going for it over other consumer-based retailers like Target: Large clients where it has developed customer relations and procurement contracts that help to protect sales.  The other good thing is that Grainger has a lot of wiggle room. Earnings are on the decline lately, but it's still generating a 24% return on invested capital and generating plenty of free cash flow to support its shareholder-friendly initiatives. It may be in for a tough fight to win over the hearts of customers with the threat of Amazon out there, but Grainger's financials are healthy enough to give it time to figure things out and keep its payout in place.

In case you missed it: Five cities, five one-way tickets - one handgun. Has anything changed since the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting? News Politics The Power Lunch: Florida Politics It's decision time for the booze bill By Dan SweeneyContact Reporter Russia Theft Donald Trump Rick Scott Bill Nelson Publix Super Markets Inc. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program The countdown is on for whiskey and Wheaties. Vodka and vidalias. Tequila and tomatoes. Gin and ... well, juice. The deadline for Gov. Rick Scott to sign the liquor wall bill is at hand.  Liquor lobbying: The Florida Legislature passed a bill that allows liquor sales in grocery aisles, rather than having to go to a separate store attached to your local Publix. Seems like a pretty insignificant matter on its surface, but the bill passed the House by one vote and is among the most heavily lobbyed pieces of legislation to come out of the session. Publix doesn't want it -- the company has already invested too much money in the current scheme. Independent liquor stores don't want it -- they believe liquor sales in grocery aisles would be the death knell of their industry. Big box stores like Target and Walmart want it very much. The News Service of Florida's Jim Turner reports on the heavy lobbying now directed at Gov. Rick Scott to sign or veto the bill. He faces a deadline of Wednesday to do so.  And the lobbying is at its highest today. Scott's schedule includes a 3 p.m. call with Greg Foran, the U.S. president and CEO of Walmart, and a 4 p.m. meeting with Charles Bailes III, CEO of ABC Fine Wine and Spirits.  Scott has three choices. He can sign the bill, veto it or do nothing. If he chooses that last option, the bill becomes law without his signature. It's not like at the federal level, where the president has a pocket veto (i.e. if he doesn't sign a bill, it dies).  What will Scott do? Your guess is as good as mine. Scott being the jobs governor and all, his tendency is to go with whichever side means the most jobs created or at least prevented from being lost. But with big job creators on both sides of the issue, it's hard to say where Scott falls.  Speaking of potential Scott vetoes: Members of the Broward Teachers Union are adding their voices to the chorus asking Gov. Rick Scott to veto a charter school-friendly education bill, the Sun Sentinel's Caitlin McGlade reports.  Have we gotten too big? That's the question that is central to this must-read piece by the Miami Herald's Mary Ellen Klas for anyone who is interested in the Florida Legislature, the controversial end to this year's session, and why it seems as if "controversial end to this year's session" is something that people like me are able to write just about every year. Fresh from Florida fraud: The Department of Agriculture has lost almost 500 Social Security numbers to a data breech, along with the names of more than 16,000 Floridians who have a concealed weapons permit, the News Service of Florida reports. There's no risk of identity theft for the few firearm permit holders whose names were taken (and it is just a few -- more than 1.7 million Floridians have a concealed carry permit). But the 469 people whose Social Security numbers were stolen will be given a free year of credit protection service. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. Speaking of Putnam and the need for more investigating: Fresh off a statewide bus tour that was largely considered a big success, Agriculture Commissioner and Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam has canned both his campaign manager and his political director, Politico Florida's Marc Caputo reports. Caputo hints that the firings could be over personality differences within the campaign staff, but man, it sure seems a little early in the cycle for staff to be knifing each other -- that's, like, January behavior.  Drill, NIMBY, drill! President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that could allow for more drilling in the Gulf off Florida's shores. Sen. Bill Nelson has vowed to fight against oil rigs along our beaches, and the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board is asking Gov. Rick Scott to join in the fight. Although it would mean going against a president with whom Scott has heretofore had an excellent relationship, it also positions him as having an independent streak ahead of his potential run against Nelson in 2018. General election voters love that whole "independent streak" thing.  You've got six months to clear out your things: There was initially a sense of relief in South Florida's Haitian community when the Trump administration announced a six-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for some 58,000 Haitians who are legally in the United States based on that status, which was established under the Obama administration following the devastating 2010 Haitian earthquake. But the Sun Sentinel's Anthony Man reports that many now wonder whether the reprieve is simply putting off the refugees' forced relocation back to their homeland.  Not just losers -- "evil losers": That's what President Donald Trump is calling the suicide bomber behind the terrorist attack in Manchester, U.K., last night, the Associated Press' Jonathan Lemire and Julie Pace report. Trump issued the statement during meetings with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.  The evil losers in question are apparently affiliated with the Islamic State -- or at least, ISIS is taking responsibility for the attack, the Associated Press' Jill Lawless and Gregory Katz report. The bombing killed at least 22 people, with victims as young as 8 years old. British authorities have said the bomber was a man named Salman Abedi, a 23-year-old Libyan-British man, per the Associated Press. This Middle Eastern trip just means Trump's that much closer to Russia! The Associated Press' Jonathan Lemire and Julie Pace report that questions about President Donald Trump's relationship with Russia have dogged him throughout his trip to the Middle East, even as he has begun laying the groundwork for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, what Trump referred to during his presidential campaign as "the ultimate deal."  Meanwhile, new revelations in the Trump+Russia investigation are waiting for the president at home, with the Washington Post's Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima reporting that Trump urged his director of national intelligence and director of the National Security Agency to publicly repudiate the FBI's investigation, something that both men refused to do.  Hey, screw the poor -- they're used to belt-tightening: The Trump administration is out with its budget request today. The Washington Post's Damian Paletta and Robert Costa report the Trump budget would cut $3.6 trillion over the next decade, with more than $1 trillion of that amount coming from safety-net programs such as Medicaid, food stamps and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. The plan is titled "A New Foundation for American Greatness." "If you are on food stamps and you are able-bodied, we need you to go to work. If you are on disability insurance and you are not supposed to be, you are not truly disabled, we need you to go back to work. We need everybody pulling in the same direction," said Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Seeking sanctuary: When the Trump administration first announced that it would withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials, reaction ranged from immediate and total capitulation (see: Miami-Dade County) to the governmental equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and saying "La la la la la! I can't hear you!" Broward County was largely in the latter camp, arguing that it couldn't be punished for being a sanctuary city because it's not as sanctuary city and what's a sanctuary city anyway? In fact, there is no legal definition of the term, and a judge blocked President Donald Trump from withholding federal funding as he promised, so the point was moot anyway. Now, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has provided some legal guidance, arguing that a sanctuary cities are ones that "willfully refuse to comply" with a federal law that requires local governments to share information about someone’s immigration status, the Los Angeles Times' Joseph Tanfani reports.  That's a far cry from what most people think of as sanctuary cities -- ones that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities demands to detain suspected illegal immigrants.  Not guilty: The Sun Sentinel's Larry Barszewski reports that Broward County property appraiser Ron Cacciatore is free and clear after a jury acquitted him in a car-keying incident that stemmed from the worst kind of feud known to South Florida -- a homeowners association dispute.  MEANWHILE, IN THE TWITTERVERSE ... Dr. Jason Westin @DrWestinForTX07 .@realDonaldTrump: Your budget cuts $1 Billion from cancer research. My patients & I don't want to #MakeCancerGreatAgain. Research = cures ≥140 CHARACTER HOT TAKE: Hey, curing cancer's one of those big things the private sector should be doing. Next you'll be saying the government should put a man on the moon.   Richard Corcoran @richardcorcoran Thanks to @FLGovScott, this year's budget includes 46 new FDLE counter-terrorism officers to stay ahead of threats & keep FL safe. ≥140 CHARACTER HOT TAKE: Little late to be kissing up to the governor now, Speaker.    Gary Fineout  @fineout .@adamputnam - leading GOP contender for governor - says #HB7069 passed by #FLLeg is not just an "education train, but a train wreck." Gwen Graham  @GwenGraham We should not accept mediocrity.

Kline 16 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Investors doubt Ford's new CEO can revive stock price Bigger than bitcoin? Enterprise Ethereum Alliance grows in size The robots are coming. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 78.49 -0.06 -0.08% That's a reality for the American workforce and in some fields, like high-end factory production, they are already here. It's easy to see how robots will help with manufacturing, order-taking, and even running back-end operations for retailers, restaurants, and many other businesses. However, robots have not yet, and likely won't in the near-term future, replace human workers in customer service or in many public-facing retail jobs. Yes, a mechanized worker can make sure you get your Big Mac with no onions and extra pickles more reliably than a human can, but robots lack certain attributes their human counterparts have. Wal-Mart has taken note of that and has not only increased compensation for its workers, it has also dramatically scaled up training. The company has not forsaken technology or even decided to not use robots, but it's spending heavily to prepare its human workforce for the changing environment they work in. CEO Doug McMillion talked about those efforts in the company's Q1 2018 earnings call on May 17. In his remarks, he detailed his experience at the grand opening of the chain's 100th training academy, in Edmond, Okla. "I met associates there who were new to Wal-Mart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools," he said. "We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year." What is a Wal-Mart Academy? About 75% of Wal-Mart management in the United States started as hourly employees, according to McMillion. The chain promotes over 150,000 workers to jobs with higher pay and more responsibilities each year. That flow of entry-level workers into increasingly higher-level jobs makes training a benefit not only to employees, but also the company. All entry-level employees take a basic training course called Pathways. As people work their way up at the company, they have the opportunity to learn new skills at the chain's academies, dedicated teaching facilities where employees take 2- to 6-week classes in advanced retail skills. The academies have dedicated teaching staff and Wal-Mart expects to double their number to over 200 by the end of 2017. The academies teach front-line hourly supervisors, department managers, and assistant managers, helping them gain new skills they bring back to their stores. This has become especially important as Wal-Mart has been making major shifts in how it operates in order to better integrate its physical and digital operations. Load Error "It's exciting to see our people feeling confident and even more empowered to take charge of their careers," wrote the CEO in a post on the company's website. "Our customers are seeing a benefit, too. As these graduates are going back to their stores and implementing their new skills, they're helping transform our shopping experience to be a consistently positive one." It's a new Wal-Mart Wal-Mart, under new digital boss Marc Lore, has been working to align its stores to a reality where consumers may order online and pickup in the store or buy something at a store for delivery at home. It's a fluid environment that requires a changed supply line system and employees better-versed in inventory management than simply looking in the stockroom for an item. Robots will have a part in that future helping with order picking, packing, and shipping at the chain's distribution centers. In addition, robot drones will take inventory and technology will be used in countless ways to enhance what human workers can do. While technology will help Wal-Mart reach its goals, the chain is acknowledging that front-line employees, store management, department leaders, and others will remain people. By investing in training those employees, Wal-mart not only builds better workers, it lowers turnover by showing people a path to advancement. Well-trained employees will not only be happier, they will do their jobs better, which is ultimately needed to get the most out of cost-saving technology advancements.

X Irish companies take a shine to rooftop solar Commercial property owners can save money and add value by installing solar energy on top about 14 hours ago Justin Comiskey Kingspan Insulation in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan installed the then largest rooftop solar pv system in Ireland, of 300kW, in 2015 Joe O’Carroll and Mark Lowen of Gaelectric Energy Solutions, with their solar roof installation on the roof of the Butlers Chocolate factory at Coolock, Dublin. Photograph: Eric Luke Previous Image Next Image         Could rooftop solar electricity generation catch on in Ireland and give commercial property owners a chance to add value to their assets while slashing energy costs? Big-box retailers Walmart and Target, for example, are leading the solar charge stateside: the latter plans to add rooftop solar panels to 500 stores by 2020; the former had 142 megawatts of installed solar capacity as of 2015 and is chasing a 100 per cent renewable power goal. Stanford professor and entrepreneur Tony Seba even estimates that if Walmart matched Ikea’s solar installation rate in the US, it would possess the generation capacity of four nuclear stations. Interestingly, Walmart is now deepening its strategy for solar energy through trialling the use of batteries to store excess power generated during the day. This is then used at night or to meet peak demand – and in the process shave its energy bills still further. Far cheaper Solar energy is no longer a “coming” technology: it already accounts for 7 per cent of power generated in Germany, a country at a similar latitude to Ireland. In many parts of the world it is now far cheaper to generate electricity from solar than fossil fuels. It is essentially a digital technology and, just as the power of computers is increasing exponentially, so is the output of solar panels. At the same time, the cost of manufacturing them is typically falling by 5-10 per cent per annum. The disruptive cost and technological momentum behind solar is now posing an existential threat to traditional power utilities and oil companies. Mr Seba, for example, believes it will all be over for fossil fuels by 2030. Bord Gáis says solar is becoming “more and more cost-effective”, and Kingspan ESB, a joint venture between the ESB and solar panel manufacturer Kingspan, now offers “Funded Solar”. This allows businesses to install a state-of-the-art solar photovoltaic (pv) system to generate electricity, which is then sold back to the property owners at discounted rates. Funded Solar’s no-money-down model means property owners can make productive use of otherwise idle roof space at no upfront cost to themselves. Largest rooftop And Irish companies are moving into this space. Kingspan Insulation in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan installed the then largest rooftop solar pv system in Ireland, at 300kW, in 2015. Gaelectric has commissioned an even larger 420kW system at Clonshaugh in Dublin. This latter project, at the Butlers Chocolates HQ, involved installing 1,585 solar panels over eight weeks, and these will provide 19 per cent of the company’s daytime electric load. It is essentially an exemplar project by Butlers and Gaelectric to demonstrate the possibilities of solar in the Irish market. An installation of this scale would typically cost about €500,000 and, without a generation tariff to sell electricity back to the grid, the payback period would be about 10 years. Butlers is part of the Origen Green programme, which is all about increasing the green agenda in the food industry. The solar installation meets many of its long-term goals in the area. Solar array According to Gaelectric’s Daire Friel, the Butlers factory could easily have accommodated a solar array of more than 1MW but, as there is no agreed system for selling electricity from such systems back to the grid, its output had to be limited in size to the factory’s lowest power load. “The Butlers solar project will still generate 19 per cent of Butlers’ daytime electricity over the year and will be particularly useful during the summer to cool the factory which must be kept at a constant low temperature,” says Mr Friel. “Rooftop solar is very easy to put in place and, realistically, buildings could generate more power than they need at times and could provide this energy back to the grid.” He says that if building owners were rewarded for selling solar electricity back to the grid (the so-called REFIT tariff, due to be set early next year), “we could quickly install 500MW of solar projects. This tariff is justified as the more renewable energy that is generated in Ireland, the lower the fines will be for missing the State’s EU emissions targets. Supply contracts “A tariff of 7-8c/kWhr would allow Gaelectric and others companies to offer customers with large commercial rooftops energy supply contracts. Under such a contract, the installation and operation of the system would be managed by Gaelectric at no capital cost to the customer. Gaelectric would offer the electricity to the customers at up to 20 per cent reduction over their current day rate.” Fergus Sharkey, general manager at Kingspan ESB, believes commercial rooftops are an ideal market for solar pv. “This is due to the fact that there is significant daytime on-site energy demand, large roof areas allow for economies of scale, and many commercial entities have a demand for decarbonisation,” he says. “Rooftop solar pv has minimal visual impact, no noise impact, and no transmission and distribution infrastructure required. It can be installed quickly with zero interruption to the business and utilises otherwise vacant roof space.” Commercially attractive Since forming in 2015, Kingspan ESB has focused on Northern Ireland, where rooftop solar pv is supported through the Renewable Obligation scheme, which makes these systems commercially attractive. Kingspan is now increasingly turning its eyes south of the Border. “In the immediate term, rooftop solar pv in the South will require some support through the forthcoming renewable electricity support scheme,” says Mr Sharkey. “But, in the medium term, as installation costs fall and electricity prices increase, rooftop pv will be attractive without any types of support. Some early-mover projects are already happening, albeit with longer-term paybacks.” Cormac Mannion, energy services manager at Energia, says the cost of installing renewable energy sources has “plummeted” in the last few years and that “we are now seeking a scenario where a solar pv installation will pay for itself within six to seven years. “While this may seem like a long time for many businesses, the key advantage is that it can act as a hedge against a scenario where energy prices rise. That in itself makes the proposition far more attractive.”       Topics: Cormac Mannion Daire Friel Mr Sharkey Tony Seba Bord Gáis ESB Energia Ikea Kingspan Target WalMart Clonshaugh Dublin(IE) Germany Ireland Northern Ireland United States Read More D2’s Dolmen House office block on market for €11m Student beds in Dublin only cater for 13% of students Terenure site with planning permission for 66 homes Planned €100m office complex to overlook Galway Docks Commercial property transactions exceed €470m so far in 2017 Housing site in Malahide for €2.5m Dublin’s construction crane count rises to 70 in April Over €3.5m expected for prime Carrickmines development site Cork city centre infill office site for €1.2m by private treaty Informatica leases offices in central Dublin for €2.1m  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Retail & Services Clothing sales drive M&S profits down 10% Technology Buddhify: Instant karma in a handy meditation app Soccer Ken Early: Manchester needs football in times like these Construction Wild Geese: the Tipperary man drawing the map of Sydney Sponsored The Story of Home: a potter’s life Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes Latest Business Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire Malaysia’s Proton 07:54 Clothing sales drive M&S profits down 10% 07:38 Moody’s downgrades China, warns of fading financial strength 07:03 Saoirse Ronan’s firm posts fifteenfold leap in retained profits 06:57 Dublin Airport may charge airlines more, CEO says 06:50 Most Read in Business 1 Gayle Killilea tells court she is legally separated from bankrupt Seán Dunne 2 Two Dublin developments show the impact of new rent rules 3 Concern over scale of unregulated finance for new cars 4 Carney neither shaken nor stirred by martinis email hoax 5 Moody’s downgrades China, warns of fading financial strength 6 Dublin councils accused of preventing housing development 7 Third party cannot fund Esat Digifone case, court rules 8 Saoirse Ronan’s firm posts fifteenfold leap in retained profits 9 Woman rejects Grant Thornton confidential information claim 10 Dublin Airport may charge airlines more, CEO says Never miss a story.

Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory A video of an angry Walmart shopper hurling racial slurs at black and Latino customers is going viral after being posted on Facebook this week. The video, which was posted by Facebook user Eva Hicks and promoted by Shaun King, shows a white woman pushing a shopping cart in Walmart yelling at Hicks to “go back to where you came from” and to “leave America.” Hicks said the woman’s angry rant was triggered after Hicks said “excuse me” and asked her to move her cart so she could access medicine on the shelves. As the woman kept shouting at Hicks, a black woman walked over and tried to intervene, at which point the white woman told her to “stay out of it.” The black woman then said she wanted the white woman to “stop being ignorant.” “A n*gger’s calling me ignorant?” the white woman asked indignantly. The white woman then told her to leave the store, to which Hicks replied, “This is my country!” “We don’t want you here,” the white woman replied. At this point, a store manager came over and informed the white woman that she was behaving inappropriately — and she replied by pointing at Hicks and telling him that she was the real problem.

The plan will expand the company’s more than 375 facility footprint in Florida and build on the continued positive momentum in U.S. sales, customer traffic and customer feedback noted in the company’s most recent earnings report. 2017-2018 Florida Investments The positive business climate in Florida has enabled Walmart to create thousands of local jobs, invest millions in infrastructure and test innovative ways to serve its customers. In an effort to continue its growth and investment in the Sunshine State, Walmart has finalized, or is planning, the following investments across Florida this fiscal year. (Feb. 1, 2017 through Jan. 31, 2018): Open nine new stores across the state, creating more than 800 jobs statewide. Execute a multi-million-dollar capital investment plan by remodeling more than 40 locations across the state.

The company is planning an investment of more than $145 million on the 640,000 sq. ft. facility. “This year has been an exciting one for Walmart in Florida, and we’ll build on that momentum as we continue to focus on how to better serve our customers through innovation and investments so they can save both time and money,” said Elise Vasquez-Warner, Walmart’s Vice President and Regional General Manager in North Florida. “We’ve had a sharp focus on making our store experience second to none and our customers are telling us that our plan is working. Our team is energized and we’re looking forward to exceeding our customer’s expectations for what a great Walmart shopping experience can be like.” Walmart’s 2017-2018 investment plans build on Walmart’s growth last year in Florida, which included: Hiring more than 3,225 Floridians by opening more than 20 stores/clubs across the state.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Walmart Expands Military Leave of Absence Policy for its Associates, Removing Barriers to Service Company announces more than 170,000 veteran hires since 2013 and grants $100,000 to Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) SOURCE: Walmart DESCRIPTION: BENTONVILLE, Ark., May 23, 2017 /3BL Media/ – Today, Walmart announced expansions to its military leave of absence policy, offering differential pay to all eligible military associates taking on assignments lasting more than three days and through the duration of leave – including basic training. Walmart has offered differential pay since 2008. The enhancements, which go into effect June 24, mean that if an associate’s military salary is less than what they were making at their job at Walmart, the company will pay them the difference while they are on a military leave of absence. In 2016, Walmart associates took more than 4,400 military leave of absences. Walmart is one of the first major retailers to apply differential pay to include basic training, so associates who are considering enlisting in the armed forces can make that decision without fear of losing wages. In addition, Walmart is taking steps to streamline and simplify the internal process required to obtain differential pay with the goal of making it easier on associates and their families, so they can spend less time on paperwork and more time on their service. “At Walmart, we’re turning jobs into fulfilling careers for veterans, active service members and their families, and we’re making it easier for them to work, live and serve,” said Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch. The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” The changes build upon Walmart’s already-robust support for veterans, military members and their families. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, in 2016, more than 200,000 men and women serving in the military transitioned to civilian life, and many find it difficult to navigate multiple agencies offering job placement and other services. To date, Walmart hired more than 170,000 veterans since it announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013*. Of those veteran hires, more than 22,000 have been promoted to jobs with higher pay and greater responsibility. On Memorial Day 2013, Walmart introduced the Veterans Welcome Home Commitment, which guaranteed a job offer to any eligible, honorably discharged U.S. veteran who was within 12 months of active duty. The initial goal was to hire 100,000 veterans by the end of 2018. In May of 2015, Walmart announced the expansion of that original projection, with the goal of hiring 250,000 veterans by the end of 2020. Walmart has also changed the eligibility from within 12 months of active duty, to any veteran who has been honorably discharged since the announcement of the commitment in May 2013. In addition to its commitment to hiring veterans, Walmart also ensures their family members can build long-lasting careers. Walmart’s Military Family Promise guarantees a job at a nearby store or Sam’s Club for all military personnel and military spouses employed by Walmart and Sam’s Club who move to a different part of the country because they or their spouse have been transferred by the United States military. Walmart also participates in the U.S Chamber of Commerce’s Hiring Our Heroes Program, recruiting tens of thousands of veterans through career fairs. To recognize families who have made the ultimate sacrifice, Walmart is also announcing a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), the national organization that offers help, hope and healing to all those grieving the death of a loved one serving in the Armed Forces. The grant will enable TAPS to reach more survivors through their Casework and Emergency Assistance Programs. “As a military widow, I know how isolating it can be to lose a loved one,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS president and founder and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient. “The critically needed support provided by Walmart will enable TAPS to offer assistance to military families when they need it most, after the loss of their hero. We are grateful for our partnership with Walmart, which engages their employees across the nation and brings the strength of their brand to positively impact the lives of the families of America’s fallen heroes. On behalf of over 70,000 surviving military families who receive support from TAPS, we thank Walmart for leading the way in caring for those who have sacrificed for our nation’s freedoms.” Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have a long history of supporting veterans, service members and their families. In 2011, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed $20 million by 2015 to support veterans and their families with assistance for programs that provide job training, transition help and education. With the early completion of the commitment in May 2014, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation renewed the commitment, announcing an additional $20 million through 2019 to support job training, education and innovative public/private community-based initiatives that address challenges many veterans face when returning to civilian life.  For more information about Walmart’s commitment to veterans, service members and military families, please visit: http://www.walmartcareerswithamission.com/ or http://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/veterans-military-families/ and follow on Twitter @WalmartToday. *Editor’s Note: These projections and reported hires/promotions include veterans hired under our original and expanded Commitment as well as other veterans hired by Walmart in this time frame. While we think it is particularly important to support service members as they make the transition to civilian life, Walmart believes all veterans deserve our respect and support, no matter when they left active duty.

In 2011, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed $20 million by 2015 to support veterans and their families with assistance for programs that provide job training, transition help and education. With the early completion of the commitment in May 2014, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation renewed the commitment, announcing an additional $20 million through 2019 to support job training, education and innovative public/private community-based initiatives that address challenges many veterans face when returning to civilian life.

While we think it is particularly important to support service members as they make the transition to civilian life, Walmart believes all veterans deserve our respect and support, no matter when they left active duty. ### About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

With the enhancements going into effect June 24, Walmart has offered differential pay since 2008, meaning that if an associate’s military salary is less than what they were making at their job at Walmart, the company will pay them the difference while they are on a military leave of absence. In 2016, Walmart associates took more than 4,400 military leave of absences. Walmart is one of the first major retailers to apply differential pay to include basic training, so associates who are considering enlisting in the armed forces can make that decision without fear of losing wages. In addition, Walmart is taking steps to streamline and simplify the internal process required to obtain differential pay – with the goal of making it easier on associates and their families, so they can spend less time on paperwork and more time on their service. “At Walmart, we’re turning jobs into fulfilling careers for veterans, active service members and their families, and we’re making it easier for them to work, live and serve,” said Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch. The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” The changes build upon Walmart’s already-robust support for veterans, military members and their families. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, in 2016, more than 200,000 men and women serving in the military transitioned to civilian life, and many find it difficult to navigate multiple agencies offering job placement and other services. To date, Walmart hired more than 170,000 veterans since it announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013*. Of those veteran hires, more than 22,000 have been promoted to jobs with higher pay and greater responsibility. On Memorial Day 2013, Walmart introduced the Veterans Welcome Home Commitment, which guaranteed a job offer to any eligible, honorably discharged U.S. veteran who was within 12 months of active duty. The initial goal was to hire 100,000 veterans by the end of 2018. In May of 2015, Walmart announced the expansion of that original projection, with the goal of hiring 250,000 veterans by the end of 2020. Walmart has also changed the eligibility from within 12 months of active duty, to any veteran who has been honorably discharged since the announcement of the commitment in May 2013. In addition to its commitment to hiring veterans, Walmart also ensures their family members can build long-lasting careers. Walmart’s Military Family Promise guarantees a job at a nearby store or Sam’s Club for all military personnel and military spouses employed by Walmart and Sam’s Club who move to a different part of the country because they or their spouse have been transferred by the United States military. Walmart also participates in the U.S Chamber of Commerce’s Hiring Our Heroes Program, recruiting tens of thousands of veterans through career fairs. This Memorial Day, Walmart is also announcing a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), the national organization that offers help, hope and healing to all those grieving the death of a loved one serving in the Armed Forces. The grant will enable TAPS to reach more survivors through their Casework and Emergency Assistance Programs. “As a military widow, I know how isolating it can be to lose a loved one,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS president and founder and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient. “The critically needed support provided by Walmart will enable TAPS to offer assistance to military families when they need it most, after the loss of their hero. We are grateful for our partnership with Walmart, which engages their employees across the nation and brings the strength of their brand to positively impact the lives of the families of America’s fallen heroes.

Kline (TMFDankline) May 23, 2017 at 9:54AM The robots are coming. That's a reality for the American workforce, and in some fields, like high-end factory production, they are already here. It's easy to see how robots will help with manufacturing, order-taking, and even running back-end operations for retailers, restaurants, and many other businesses. However, robots have not yet, and likely won't in the near future, replace human workers in customer service or in many public-facing retail jobs. Yes, a mechanized worker can make sure you get your Big Mac with no onions and extra pickles more reliably than a human can, but robots lack certain attributes their human counterparts have. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has taken note of that and has not only increased compensation for its workers, it has also dramatically scaled up training. The company has not forsaken technology or even decided to not use robots, but it's spending heavily to prepare its human workforce for the changing environment they work in. CEO Doug McMillion talked about those efforts in the company's Q1 2018 earnings call on May 17. In his remarks, he detailed his experience at the grand opening of the chain's 100th training academy, in Edmond, Okla. "I met associates there who were new to Wal-Mart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools," he said. "We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year." Wal-Mart's academies mix classroom and in-store training. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is a Wal-Mart Academy? About 75% of Wal-Mart management in the United States started as hourly employees, according to McMillion. The chain promotes over 150,000 workers to jobs with higher pay and more responsibilities each year. That flow of entry-level workers into increasingly higher-level jobs makes training a benefit not only to employees, but also the company. All entry-level employees take a basic training course called Pathways. As people work their way up at the company, they have the opportunity to learn new skills at the chain's academies, dedicated teaching facilities where employees take 2- to 6-week classes in advanced retail skills. The academies have dedicated teaching staff and Wal-Mart expects to double their number to over 200 by the end of 2017. The academies teach front-line hourly supervisors, department managers, and assistant managers, helping them gain new skills they bring back to their stores. This has become especially important as Wal-Mart has been making major shifts in how it operates in order to better integrate its physical and digital operations. "It's exciting to see our people feeling confident and even more empowered to take charge of their careers," wrote the CEO in a post on the company's website. "Our customers are seeing a benefit, too. As these graduates are going back to their stores and implementing their new skills, they're helping transform our shopping experience to be a consistently positive one." It's a new Wal-Mart Wal-Mart, under new digital boss Marc Lore, has been working to align its stores to a reality where consumers may order online and pickup in the store or buy something at a store for delivery at home. It's a fluid environment that requires a changed supply line system and employees better-versed in inventory management than simply looking in the stockroom for an item. Robots will have a part in that future helping with order picking, packing, and shipping at the chain's distribution centers. In addition, robot drones will take inventory and technology will be used in countless ways to enhance what human workers can do. While technology will help Wal-Mart reach its goals, the chain is acknowledging that front-line employees, store management, department leaders, and others will remain people. By investing in training those employees, Wal-mart not only builds better workers, it lowers turnover by showing people a path to advancement. Well-trained employees will not only be happier, they will do their jobs better, which is ultimately needed to get the most out of cost-saving technology advancements.

The event kicked off with a masterful keynote presentation by Suja Chandrasekaran, CIO, Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The former SVP and global chief technology officer & chief data officer at Walmart gave a tour-de-force recap of the current state of analytics across both retail and consumer goods. “As an industry we are behind in analytics,” she said. “And we can’t be behind. It is not rocket science we can master it.” The key to the mastery of next-gen analytics according to Chandrasekaran is artificial intelligence and machine learning that can provide true predictive insight into shopper behavior and demand. “Traditional analytics lose value over time,” she said. “While AI based systems gain value.” Following Chandrasekaran’s opening keynote, David Ahuja, senior director, Walmart Technology took to the stage and followed the theme of taking analytics capabilities to the next level. He spoke of the evolution of analytics from a misunderstood discipline to the backbone of every major organization today. Analytics started with the buzz of big data and IT execs spent a lot of time explaining its use to business leaders. Analytics 2.0 ushered in the age of the data scientist.  “We all hired a bunch of people with the title of data scientist and told them to go do data science,” he said. “They were all over the company doing great work but it was not very organized.” As we enter what he dubs Analytics 3.0 the digital enterprise is not about technology but providing value for the customer and retailers need to adjust their strategy and processes to meet this new reality. “Our biggest problem is data,” he said. “Not creating data but working with it. If you are not paying attention to governance, on how you make decision models, you will need to do it. If you do not get the data right you cannot do the analytics effectively.” The effective use of analytic tools was the cornerstone of David Dittmann’s, director, business intelligence & analytics services, Procter & Gamble, presentation on predictive and prescriptive analytics. He discussed P&G’s long history with analytics, from its humble beginnings in 1963 to its market-leading position today. He discussed the importance of getting business leaders’ buy-in to build truly dynamic analytic capabilities. “Leadership doesn’t view models as sexy,” he said. “You need to come up with a way to engage business in the models. There must be a place for senior leadership to come in and engage.” The key to enterprise level success Dittmann believes is the analysts’ ability to be highly fluent in the business. They cannot be a separate entity, but valuable members of the decision-making process. To earn this seat at the table, however, data scientists must be able or create unexpected insights that can be leveraged to make critical business decisions. The innovative use of analytics firepower was a key theme of Cameron Davies’, senior vice president, analytics, NBCUniversal, presentation. He discussed Everett Rogers five traits of successful innovations and provided an analytics spin to the author’s seminal work, and provided real-world examples from NBCUniversal. The five traits are create a relative advantage; compatibility; simple and easy to use; easy to trial; and observable result. Create a relative advantage. There are four types of superiority: create an economic benefit, social prestige, pain relief (Uber), and immediate reward (tinder) he said. “We created an analytics dashboard so people can get what they need and the team doesn’t have to spend 70% of their time sending out reports. Build from the business problem down, not the tech up.” Compatibility. The degree to which an idea aligns with the targeted users’ current worldviews, habits, and activities. Simple and easy to use. How well users can easily learn and adapt a concept’s key functions. Easy to trial. How well an innovation can be sampled, tested, or trialed at low risk. “You need to have centralized teams that can help people get started,” he said. “You need to be able to spin up a low cost proof of concept. Fail fast and cheap, adjust, then try again.” Observable results. How the benefits of the concept can be easily measure or observed. “Success breeds success and failure breeds contempt,” he said. “Profitable projects rarely have trouble finding funding.” This is just a small taste of the magic that was up on the stage at RCAS this year. If you are involved in the field of analytics or simply need a better understanding of the discipline to better perform your job, attendance at RCAS is a must. Be sure to join us at the end of April next year when RIS and CGT Magazine will once again join forces to put on RCAS 2018. As the event and the field grows this is the place to learn from and network with the best and brightest in the industry.

NEW YORK — Walmart wants to make sure its employees who take time off to serve in the military never have to take a pay cut. The company on Tuesday announced a new pay policy for all full-time and part-time workers who leave for voluntary or involuntary military assignments. Walmart’s pledge is to cover the difference in pay any time an employee’s military salary is less than what he or she makes working at the store. So even when a worker is on a military assignment, they’re now guaranteed to earn at least as much as they would working as a civilian at Walmart. The policy covers any military assignment from three days up to five years. Deer cleanup on aisle 6 The company already offers differential pay to some active service members. But this policy change vastly expands the existing program, and it now covers employees who want to do “voluntary services,” which includes basic training. Walmart says it will become “one of the first major retailers” to offer such comprehensive coverage. Walmart said the policy will now allow employees who are thinking about enlisting in the military “to do so without fear of losing wages during training.” Advertisement Gary Profit, a former Brigadier General in the armed forces who is now director of military programs at Walmart, said the “lion’s share” of Walmart workers who leave for military duty would take a pay cut without the program. Soldiers don’t typically draw a large salary, especially those who are newly enlisted. On its website, the U.S. Army says that soldiers with less than two years of experience make about $19,200 per year, or about $9.23 per hour. And the Army says that pay is slightly lower for the first four months of service. Walmart, meanwhile, has increased its pay in recent years after it was targeted by Fight for $15, a grassroots movement that lobbies for higher minimum wages. Advertisement In February 2016, the company boosted its minimum wage to $10 per hour from $9. Walmart said this week that its full-time workers now make an average of $13.60 per hour. The company’s maximum hourly wage is $24.70. Walmart is also in the middle of a massive push to hire veterans. The company has promised to hire 250,000 veterans who have been honorably discharged from service by the end of 2020. Profit, Walmart’s director of military programs, said the company has already hired 170,000 veterans since 2013. 40.712784 -74.005941 Related Stories Copperhead snake bites man inside Arkansas Walmart Tad Cummins arrest: Tipster reveals how teacher covered up identity Authors: CNN Wire Filed in: National/World News Topics: Guaranteed, Military Pay, Pay Cut, Walmart 390 Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel More in National/World News “007” actor Sir Roger Moore dies at 89, family says More from WGNO Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App facebook twitter instagram pinterest Email Alerts About & Contact Screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • EEO Report • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1 Galleria Blvd., Suite 850 Metairie, LA 70001 • Copyright © 2017, WGNO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Walmart Expands Military Leave of Absence Policy for its Associates, Removing Barriers to Service BENTONVILLE, Ark.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, Walmart announced expansions to its military leave of absence policy, offering differential pay to all eligible military associates taking on assignments lasting more than three days and through the duration of leave – including basic training. Walmart has offered differential pay since 2008. The enhancements, which go into effect June 24, mean that if an associate’s military salary is less than what they were making at their job at Walmart, the company will pay them the difference while they are on a military leave of absence. In 2016, Walmart associates took more than 4,400 military leave of absences. Walmart is one of the first major retailers to apply differential pay to include basic training, so associates who are considering enlisting in the armed forces can make that decision without fear of losing wages. In addition, Walmart is taking steps to streamline and simplify the internal process required to obtain differential pay with the goal of making it easier on associates and their families, so they can spend less time on paperwork and more time on their service. “At Walmart, we’re turning jobs into fulfilling careers for veterans, active service members and their families, and we’re making it easier for them to work, live and serve,” said Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch. The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” The changes build upon Walmart’s already-robust support for veterans, military members and their families. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, in 2016, more than 200,000 men and women serving in the military transitioned to civilian life, and many find it difficult to navigate multiple agencies offering job placement and other services. To date, Walmart hired more than 170,000 veterans since it announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013*. Of those veteran hires, more than 22,000 have been promoted to jobs with higher pay and greater responsibility. On Memorial Day 2013, Walmart introduced the Veterans Welcome Home Commitment, which guaranteed a job offer to any eligible, honorably discharged U.S. veteran who was within 12 months of active duty. The initial goal was to hire 100,000 veterans by the end of 2018. In May of 2015, Walmart announced the expansion of that original projection, with the goal of hiring 250,000 veterans by the end of 2020. Walmart has also changed the eligibility from within 12 months of active duty, to any veteran who has been honorably discharged since the announcement of the commitment in May 2013. In addition to its commitment to hiring veterans, Walmart also ensures their family members can build long-lasting careers. Walmart’s Military Family Promise guarantees a job at a nearby store or Sam’s Club for all military personnel and military spouses employed by Walmart and Sam’s Club who move to a different part of the country because they or their spouse have been transferred by the United States military. Walmart also participates in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Hiring Our Heroes Program, recruiting tens of thousands of veterans through career fairs. To recognize families who have made the ultimate sacrifice, Walmart is also announcing a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), the national organization that offers help, hope and healing to all those grieving the death of a loved one serving in the Armed Forces. The grant will enable TAPS to reach more survivors through their Casework and Emergency Assistance Programs. “As a military widow, I know how isolating it can be to lose a loved one,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS president and founder and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient. “The critically needed support provided by Walmart will enable TAPS to offer assistance to military families when they need it most, after the loss of their hero. We are grateful for our partnership with Walmart, which engages their employees across the nation and brings the strength of their brand to positively impact the lives of the families of America’s fallen heroes. On behalf of over 70,000 surviving military families who receive support from TAPS, we thank Walmart for leading the way in caring for those who have sacrificed for our nation’s freedoms.” Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have a long history of supporting veterans, service members and their families. In 2011, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation committed $20 million by 2015 to support veterans and their families with assistance for programs that provide job training, transition help and education. With the early completion of the commitment in May 2014, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation renewed the commitment, announcing an additional $20 million through 2019 to support job training, education and innovative public/private community-based initiatives that address challenges many veterans face when returning to civilian life. For more information about Walmart’s commitment to veterans, service members and military families, please visit: http://www.walmartcareerswithamission.com/ or http://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/veterans-military-families/ and follow on Twitter @WalmartToday. *Editor’s Note: These projections and reported hires/promotions include veterans hired under our original and expanded Commitment as well as other veterans hired by Walmart in this time frame. While we think it is particularly important to support service members as they make the transition to civilian life, Walmart believes all veterans deserve our respect and support, no matter when they left active duty.

Rick Scott's desk. 23 May 0 Comments Gov. Rick Scott has until Wednesday to decide the fate of one of the most heavily-lobbied bills in years, the removal of the so-called "liquor wall" so that Walmart, Target and other big box stores can sell liquor. Publix and local chain liquor stores tried mightily to kill the bill but it squeaked through the Senate, 21-17, and the House, 58-57, after years of intense lobbying on both sides. The lobbying is now aimed at Scott -- and the clock is ticking. RELATED NEWS/ARCHIVE Supporters of state parks tell Rick Scott: 'Veto this bad budget' 20 Hours Ago If Rick Scott vetoes public school budget, here's what happens 1 Day Ago 'A tough spot': 20 more House Republicans have to choose between Rick Scott and Richard Corcoran 3 Months Ago If Scott wants to use "the wall" to thank a friend and punish an enemy at the same time, it's not even a close call. Scott's ally on economic development issues, Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, is a leading critic of the liquor wall bill who voted no, and Scott's No. 1 nemesis, House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes, is a supporter who voted yes and whose brother, Michael, is a lobbyist for Walmart. Walmart has made three separate contributions to Scott's Let's Get to Work PAC totaling $110,000, including a $50,000 check on March 31, a week after the Senate sent the bill to the House. If the pro-business Republican governor signs this bill, he'll see headlines connecting the two. The bill (SB 106) passed the House amid controversy and allegations, reported here by the Florida Times-Union, that several lawmakers "took a walk" and skipped a close vote to avoid antagonizing special interests and lobbyists on either side. Two absent House members cast no votes after the roll call vote and a third changed his vote from yes to no. Those late votes are in the record but they don't change the outcome of a "board" vote. Still, that alone provides another rationalization for Scott to issue his first veto of the 2017 session.  If Scott is looking for five more reasons to veto the bill, at least that many House Republicans who voted to abolish Enterprise Florida also voted to tear down the liquor wall in the spirit of free enterprise. They are Reps. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast; Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford; Mike LaRosa, R-St. Cloud; Clay Ingram, R-Pensacola; and Frank White, R-Pensacola. They're noted here because Scott called out all five by name at recent events where he criticized the Legislature for turning its back on Florida's economy. A governor's veto pen also works nicely as a payback pen, and as they say in Tallahassee, "Everything is related to everything." CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly included Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Mount Dora. Sullivan voted no on SB 106.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – DSW, New York & Co, JC Penney, Foot Locker By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 23 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier.

Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn.

Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity."

By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands."

For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year.

The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points.

After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period.

Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members.

Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment".

Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier.

Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

During growing season in her town of East Nottingham Township, Pa., the 35-year-old stay-at-home mom walks down the street to her Amish neighbors’ farm to buy fresh eggs and pesticide-free strawberries, vegetables, and herbs. She skips the supermarkets near her home to purchase the “perfect” organic oranges and lemons that she says she can get only at Wegmans, a 30-minute drive away. About once per month, she’ll also make a special trip to Trader Joe’s, 40 minutes away, to load up on the organic brown rice and quinoa noodles she feeds her 1-year-old, Adam. When Henry and her husband, Bill, 34, a public-school music teacher, feel pressed for time, they grab the basics at a local Giant supermarket. Bill goes to BJ’s Wholesale Club on occasion. They sometimes have meal kits delivered by Blue Apron and HelloFresh. And they use AmazonFresh, the online grocery delivery service, which charges $15 monthly on top of the $99 annual Amazon Prime subscription. Henry admits that getting organic produce and meats delivered to their door is an indulgence. “But the convenience factor is worth every penny,” she says. End of the Middle-Class Market? Where does the traditional grocery store fit into this mix? Experts say the supermarkets that have anchored many a community are struggling to compete with higher-end retailers such as Wegmans on one hand and bargain vendors like Walmart and Costco on the other. Witness the disappearance of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, otherwise known as A&P, which folded in 2015 after 156 years. “Just as the middle class is shrinking, the middle class of grocery stores is being challenged,” says Leslie Sarasin, president and CEO of the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), a grocery industry group. The supermarkets that are doing well are premium stores such as Wegmans, specialty stores like Trader Joe’s, and discounters such as WinCo. “Traditional supermarkets are stuck in the middle,” Demeritt says. Consumer Reports subscribers’ preferences mirror these trends. In our latest ratings of 62 supermarkets and food retailers, based on survey responses from almost 58,000 subscribers, ­East Coast chain Wegmans earned the top spot, a place it has held since 2006. It’s beloved for most everything, from the quality and variety of ­produce to the courtesy of staff. (Our supermarket and grocery store ratings are available to subscribers.)  Other stores that did very well overall include Trader Joe’s, Publix, and the family-owned Market Basket chain, serving the Northeast. Walmart, with the largest market share for food and beverages of any U.S. retailer, scored well for competitive prices but otherwise was at the bottom of our ratings. Mainstream grocery stores still have fans. Our survey that found 70 percent of CR readers were either completely or very satisfied with the supermarkets where they do most of their grocery shopping. By contrast, only 48 percent told us they’re very or completely satisfied with their markets’ healthy offerings, and only 29 percent said the same about the price of their markets’ organic options. Keys to Shopper Satisfaction What draws us to a market week after week? A wide selection, high-quality produce, and good prices are the main attractions, our survey respon­dents say. But stores that offer an alluring sensory experience while grocery shopping—the scent of cinnamon-­apple pies from the bakery oven, the sight of plump purple and ivory eggplants in a rustic wooden case—bring us back. Attention to these details might ­explain Wegmans’ popularity. The chain, with 92 stores from Massachusetts to Virginia, charmed our survey respondents with its selection of healthy options, customer service, reasonably competitive prices, and fresh store-prepared foods, and the quality of its poultry and meats, among other standout features. “Wegmans produce is the freshest in town, and the selection is huge,” Barbara Goldenberg, of Frederick, Md., says of her local store. What else contributes to appreciation of a grocer? Stores with the highest scores for staff courtesy all did well. Increas­ingly, a commitment to principles that shoppers deem important—for instance, fair-trade goods, sustainably and locally farmed foods, and fair labor practices—also wins loyalty, says David Fikes, FMI’s vice president of communications and consumer/community affairs. “It’s now values as much as value,” he says. But price is and always will be a great motivator. Grocers with the highest scores for competitive prices are for the most part near the top of our ratings. One such store, Woodman’s, which oper­ates in Illinois and Wisconsin, passes savings on by selling certain items in bulk. WinCo, with 115 stores in the West, also sells bulk items, and takes no credit cards to avoid transaction fees. The growing variety of both low- and premium-priced food stores means a dedicated WinCo bargain hunter could be the same person frequenting Whole Foods for pricey organic cherries, Demeritt says. “People go to different places for different things,” she says.

Rather than taking a one-store-fits-all approach, some grocers are hypertargeting a single customer type and scaling back in size as a result. Those new locations offer a more “curated” grocery shopping experience—say, selling just a few choices of organic olive oil instead of many—saving shoppers the work of distinguishing among brands. To attract time-pressed millennials, Whole Foods has opened new Whole Foods Market 365 stores in four U.S. locations. The smaller-format stores feature primarily Whole Foods’ 365 Every­day Value products. Focusing on the higher-profit store brand and managing fewer square feet also could help the company’s profit margins, notes Asit Sharma, senior consumer goods analyst at the investing website Motley Fool. Aldi is a fast-growing, no-frills vendor that operates stores about a third the size of a typical American grocer. It sells a limited selection, mainly of private-label goods; our readers rated it highly for competitive prices. • Local farm partnerships. Many super­markets have added locally grown produce sections. Dierbergs, which debuts in our ratings this year, is one example. The family-owned chain, with locations mainly in Missouri, shows a photo gallery of local partner farms on its website. Readers gave the quality of Dierbergs’ local produce top marks. • Meal kits without the wait. To compete with online meal-kit vendors, Giant Food Stores, based in Pennsylvania, offers fresh meal kits through its partnership with the Peapod grocery delivery service. Each $15 box comes with enough premeasured, fresh ingre­di­ents to make two servings following a provided recipe. (See our reviews of five meal-kit services.) • Home delivery. Responding to the threat from online grocers, many chains now offer this amenity. (For more, you can check our ratings of four online grocers.) Safeway charges $13 to deliver orders of less than $150 and $10 for orders of $150 or more. Kroger and Walmart have begun testing door-to-door delivery in certain locations, with Walmart using ­the delivery service Deliv and car services Lyft and Uber. Publix is testing home delivery in certain ­areas of the Southeast. • Curbside service. Walmart offers a “click and collect” system called Online Grocery Pickup in more than 30 states: Consumers buy online and drive to a Walmart store to pick up their bagged orders at designated times for no fee. Kroger’s ClickList service, available in about 300 locations, works the same way. Patrons pay a $5 pickup fee, waived for the first three deliveries. AmazonFresh is experimenting with curbside pickup in two Seattle-area locations. The retailer plans to expand the service to Amazon Prime members without requiring an additional AmazonFresh membership fee. The Rise of the Virtual Market Amazon’s real impact on the industry, though, is in food delivery. In 2016 Consumers used its food and beverage channels—including Prime and Pantry for packaged goods and AmazonFresh for fresh and non­perishable groceries—more than any other online grocery retailer, says Cowen and Company, an investment research firm. AmazonFresh tops our satisfaction ratings of four online grocers, though its competitors—Instacart, Peapod, and FreshDirect—are close behind. Sixty-one percent of readers who used AmazonFresh for their grocery shopping told us they were highly satisfied with the service. Grocery shopping through online grocers is still a modest portion of the marketplace; in the U.S., just 23 percent of households are buying food and beverages this way, according to research released in January by FMI and Nielsen. But interest is projected to climb; 72 percent of all ages surveyed—and 80 percent of surveyed millennials—expect to buy groceries online in the future, the report notes. Amazon’s innovations could eventually influence the operations of walk-in stores as well. Bucking its virtual roots, the retail giant last year announced the opening of a new grocery store prototype: a location in Seattle with no checkout lanes. Instead of paying at a cashier (self-checkout or otherwise), customers would simply grab what they wanted and leave, without ever engaging with an employee. This would be made possible through a smartphone app and sensors placed throughout the store. Payment would be made automatically when the app linked to customers’ mobile-payment services. Initial customers were Amazon employees; in March the company postponed a public rollout, citing technical problems. Could the success of online groceries spell the end of the traditional kind? Not likely, analysts say. Stores will “just be smaller, more efficient, and focused on value-added shopping,” says Tré Musco, CEO and chief creative officer of Tesser, a brand-strategy and retail design firm based in San Francisco. “There will be more delivery and ordering online. Even if there’s no one at checkout, you might have face-to-face conversations with an in-house dietary consultant or the person who loads your groceries into your car, or a chef preparing meals to order. “As long as people want to see, touch, and smell their fresh food,” Musco adds, “the brick-and-mortar store is here to stay.” Editor's Note: This article also appeared in the July 2017 issue of Consumer Reports magazine.

Walmart is another problem for struggling retailers. It's making a big bet on digital commerce. Walmart now owns Jet.com and other online stores, including women's apparel retailer ModCloth, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw and footwear store ShoeBuy. By Jackie Wattles NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Walmart wants to make sure its employees who take time off to serve in the military never have to take a pay cut. The company on Tuesday announced a new pay policy for all full-time and part-time workers who leave for voluntary or involuntary military assignments. Walmart's pledge is to cover the difference in pay any time an employee's military salary is less than what he or she makes working at the store. So even when a worker is on a military assignment, they're now guaranteed to earn at least as much as they would working as a civilian at Walmart. The policy covers any military assignment from three days up to five years. The company already offers differential pay to some active service members. But this policy change vastly expands the existing program, and it now covers employees who want to do "voluntary services," which includes basic training. Walmart says it will become "one of the first major retailers" to offer such comprehensive coverage. Walmart said the policy will now allow employees who are thinking about enlisting in the military "to do so without fear of losing wages during training." Gary Profit, a former Brigadier General in the armed forces who is now director of military programs at Walmart, said the "lion's share" of Walmart workers who leave for military duty would take a pay cut without the program. Soldiers don't typically draw a large salary, especially those who are newly enlisted. On its website, the U.S. Army says that soldiers with less than two years of experience make about $19,200 per year, or about $9.23 per hour. And the Army says that pay is slightly lower for the first four months of service. Walmart, meanwhile, has increased its pay in recent years after it was targeted by Fight for $15, a grassroots movement that lobbies for higher minimum wages. In February 2016, the company boosted its minimum wage to $10 per hour from $9. Walmart said this week that its full-time workers now make an average of $13.60 per hour. The company's maximum hourly wage is $24.70. Walmart is also in the middle of a massive push to hire veterans. The company has promised to hire 250,000 veterans who have been honorably discharged from service by the end of 2020. Profit, Walmart's director of military programs, said the company has already hired 170,000 veterans since 2013. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Nick Stockton Science Date of Publication: 05.22.17. 05.22.17 Time of Publication: 11:00 am. 11:00 am A Curious Plan to Save the Environment With the Blockchain Getty Images Magic internet money—also known as cryptocurrency—is at an all-time high. The experts who watch this stuff predict that one bitcoin (the most famous cryptocurrency) will soon be worth $2,000. The big selling point of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is their use of something called the blockchain to make any transaction mossstly trustworthy. In a cryptocash economy, the blockchain renders treasuries, banks, credit cards, and other financial organs vestigial. Enthusiasts believe these decentralized, cryptographically sealed databases could starve inefficient middlemen from virtually any system. And today in Nature, conservation biologist Guillaume Chapron argues that blockchains can even save the planet. Basically, all a blockchain does is assign any piece of information a unique signature. If someone alters that information, that unique code no longer works, and you know something fishy is afoot. In bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the whole community then reviews every attempted transaction to ensure each is unique—preventing shenanigans like spending the same money twice. But it can come in handy elsewhere. Walmart recently launched a trial using a blockchain to fight food poisoning and waste by tracking food from supplier to shelf. Say a salmonella outbreak hits Sioux City, Iowa. Walmart’s supply chain blockchain would let it irrefutably trace the tainted product back to a spinach farm in Salinas, California. “One reason why we have environmental crises, like the overexploitation of natural resources, and pollution, is because the global economy is full of actors who are doing business without much accountability,” says Chapron. “When you go buy something, you have no idea where it comes from, how it’s made. There are so many intermediaries, and it’s very easy to cheat.” Cheating, in this case, means more than companies lying about where they dump their garbage. And actors can be anyone, including nation-states. Related Stories Damian Carrington The Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Flooded. Thanks, Global Warming Nick Stockton How Boring Old Pension Funds Might Curb Global Warming Cade Metz A Plan to Save Blockchain Democracy From Bitcoin’s Civil War Chapron mentions land ownership. Many countries promise land to indigenous peoples, only to renege once they discover the land is, say, sitting on top of sweet, light crude oil. “Governments have been known to make up completely new land registries and say, ‘Hey, this land is ours and nobody lives here,'” he says. Such double dealing wouldn’t be possible if the country placed its land registry in a blockchain. Some countries already do this. Transparency also improves under the blockchain model, Chapron says. Many sustainably sourced goods come from small communities vulnerable to graft and exploitation by middlemen. Using something akin to Walmart’s food safety program, a blockchain could ensure that a grouper being tossed through Tokyo’s Tsukiji Market actually came from a sustainable fisherman in Indonesia. The blockchain, Chapron argues, can also enable financial incentives to help the environment. With blockchain banking, for example, farmers in Kenya could get quick, corruption-free insurance payouts whenever an endangered elephant tromps through their fields. And the blockchain could discourage corporations and governments from backpedaling on their environmental promises or misreporting their progress. Even the increased efficiency of something like Walmart’s blockchain program can benefit the environment. Brigid McDermott is VP of blockchain business development at IBM, and she helped Walmart develop the program. “I spent about a three month period telling the press, ‘Look, blockchains aren’t magic, it can’t do everything, it’s not like we’re out here solving world hunger,'” she says. “But then I thought, ‘Wait, solving world hunger is exactly what we’re doing.'” She points out that about one-third of all food is wasted. A lot of this waste occurs because food is improperly handled, shipped, or stored somewhere in the supply chain and spoils. Eliminating spoilage saves resources. Now, this alone won’t solve world hunger. And like McDermott said, blockchains aren’t magic: You can’t encrypt a fish in Indonesia and expect it to pop out, sustainably caught, plump and shiny-eyed, in Tokyo. Making this work means getting people to adopt it. And that requires more than just beaming reliable internet across the developing world. “If you are going to use this technology to provide money to people in Africa, or grant land titles to Brazilian tribes, you can’t just ignore the fact of how easy it is for people to lose their private keys,” says Steve Wilson, the vice president of Constellation Research, who specializes in online privacy. Blockchain transactions are theoretically secure, but that security relies on people keeping track of their personalized string of characters. Even in the developed world, stories exist of people having their private keys phished away by hackers. Oh: And many governments and corporations probably aren’t eager to surrender their authority to computer code. Middlemen, either. “Just because the blockchain is safe doesn’t mean its users will be,” says Steve Wilson, the vice president of Constellation Research, who specializes in online privacy. The same forensic techniques the FBI used to root out Silk Road magnate—and prolific bitcoin user—Ross Ulbrecht could easily be employed by less scrupulous agents against indigenous farmers. Finally, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are incredibly volatile. “This paper says it would be cool to pay people in the developing world in cryptocurrency, but there’s no promise any of these currencies will even exist in two years,” says Wilson. Chapron believes basic market capitalism will solve these, and other, problems. Transactions—whether financial or otherwise—gravitate towards trust. And blockchains force trust on their users. Further, any untrustworthy users will be unsuccessful in a blockchain system. The revolution, says Chapron, is inevitable. “It will be like when Gutenberg made the printing press, and suddenly anybody could make texts and distribute them to people,” he says. “The Catholic Church tried to stop it, but the presses spread so fast and so far that they were eventually powerless.” Blockchains aren’t magic, but maybe they can perform miracles.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Business Whole Foods fans seen as key to turnaround Mark Kauzlarich / Bloomberg Pedestrians hold umbrellas while passing a Whole Foods Market in New York on May 22, 2017. Pedestrians hold umbrellas while passing a Whole Foods Market in New York on May 22, 2017. (Mark Kauzlarich / Bloomberg) Craig GiammonaBloomberg Privacy Policy Inside the Whole Foods Market in midtown Manhattan at lunchtime, it's easy to forget that the organic supermarket chain is suffering its biggest crisis since going public in 1992. A line 20-people deep waits at a juice and espresso bar near the bustling store entrance across from Bryant Park. In the food hall upstairs, the tables are packed with customers noshing on superfood salads and sushi. Too harried to stop for oysters, many shoppers order Nashville-style fried chicken sandwiches from digital kiosks and sample cold brew from Stumptown Coffee Roasters. Whole Foods Market, facing pressure from restless shareholders after nearly two years of sliding sales, still has cachet in New York and other pockets of the U.S. That unique foodie appeal is key to a turnaround if Chief Executive Officer John Mackey is able to improve operations, said Charles Kantor, a managing director at Neuberger Berman, one of the grocery chain's 10 biggest investors. "He got all the hard things right over the years, but he didn't get the easy stuff right," Kantor said. "There hasn't been laserlike focus in a long time." Mark Kauzlarich / Bloomberg Employees ring up customers at the checkout counter of a Whole Foods Market in New York on May 22, 2017. Employees ring up customers at the checkout counter of a Whole Foods Market in New York on May 22, 2017. (Mark Kauzlarich / Bloomberg) As grocers fight for traffic amid an intense price war and the threat of e-commerce, Whole Foods stands out among its peers with its prepared foods and in-house restaurants that make its stores destinations. The challenge for Mackey, who co-founded the company in 1980, is how to assuage Wall Street by boosting profits without ruining what made Whole Foods wildly popular in the first place. "They have to do two things at the same time that are diametrically opposed," said Roger Davidson, a former Wal-Mart grocery executive who works as a consultant. "They have to make sure they don't dumb it down." The hubbub at newer Whole Foods locations like the one in midtown Manhattan illustrates a brand loyalty that most retailers would envy, especially when brick-and-mortar stores are closing at a record pace. Neuberger Berman increased its stake in the company in 2015 because of its rare ability to "connect in an emotional way" with shoppers, said Kantor. The firm owns about 2.7 percent of Whole Foods shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was a time, before the current slump, when the arrival of a Whole Foods store meant shoppers would get access to products that weren't widely available elsewhere. The stores became magnets for foodies and affluent customers who were more likely to buy kale than iceberg lettuce. And usually there was little competition to lure them away. Now, the competitive ground has shifted. Whole Foods, which has about 450 U.S. stores, is getting pummeled by Kroger, Wal-Mart, Costco and other retail giants that have muscled into a market that it helped create. Sales have dropped for seven straight quarters, and shareholders are getting agitated. Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund, announced a stake in Whole Foods last month, pushing for wholesale changes including a possible sale of the company. The news sent shares soaring 10 percent on April 10. They slipped as much as 2.7 percent to $35.25 in New York on Tuesday. The stock had gained 18 percent this year through Monday, after three straight years of declines. Hoping to avoid a proxy fight, Whole Foods recently announced it would overhaul its board of directors by adding five new members. The company had hoped the changes would appease Jana, but the hedge fund rejected a proposed truce, preferring to keep its options open. In a bid to reignite sales and profit growth by October 2018, Whole Foods also said it would expand its nascent loyalty program and use data to improve how it stocks products.

(Mark Kauzlarich / Bloomberg) A few months earlier, Whole Foods abandoned its 1,200-store target, which had come under fire from Wall Street for being overly ambitious. The grocery chain is now focusing on relocating smaller stores to bigger nearby locations, banking that it can create flagships that double as dining destinations. "We've had tremendous success with those stores," Mackey said on a recent conference call, citing locations in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. Whole Foods also recently said it was doubling its cost-savings target to $600 million by the end of fiscal 2020, with a plan to invest some of that money in lower prices. The grocer has been dogged by its reputation for being overpriced -- customers gave it the tongue-in-cheek nickname "Whole Paycheck" -- making it tricky to bring in new shoppers. And while the chain can't win a price war with the likes of Kroger, Wal-Mart and the German chain Aldi, getting some of its prices more in line with conventional stores is still a key piece of a potential turnaround. Whole Foods can stand out with local cheese and olive oil that can't be found elsewhere, but it needs to lower prices on standard fare like organic milk, industry analysts say. "That can have a halo effect on the entire store's pricing," meaning shoppers will perceive value across the store, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Inmar's Willard Bishop. Part of the company's effort to cut costs includes centralizing much of its buying in Austin, Texas, where its headquarters are located. For years, Whole Foods has relied on a regional system. Buyers in the Northeast, for instance, controlled what products got put on shelves in that market. The strategy allowed Whole Foods to feature artisanal local brands. With the change toward more centralization, the retailer risks losing its reputation as a destination for unique products. "As you start to take away people with knowledge of the market, you lose," said Tim Sperry, a former Whole Foods executive and industry consultant. Mackey, 63, who took sole control last year after six years of sharing the CEO post with Walter Robb, insists that he can thread the needle: reducing expenses and lowering prices on groceries while keeping his stores on the leading edge of food trends. "We're not making these changes randomly -- it's very data-driven," he said in an interview, adding that shoppers will find unique local products at stores, despite the move to centralize operations in Austin. With activist pressure looming, Mackey doesn't have much time to show signs that he can get the company back on track. "You can't make these types of changes that quickly," said Davidson, the industry consultant. "It's a whole new way of doing business."

In a post on Facebook, Eva Hicks explained she "never in my life thought this would happen to me" - saying despite the racially motivated remarks from the woman, she loves America and will stay in the country. In the footage, the elderly woman can be heard unleashing on Ms Hicks after an altercation that allegedly started with the woman cutting her off and pushing her with her trolley. "Go back to Mexico. Go back wherever you're from. You're in America! You're in America!" the woman can be heard yelling at the start of the clip. Another shopper then interjects - and after being told to "stay out it", the shopper, who does not appear on camera says: "I don't need to stay out of it [because] you're yelling loud enough for everybody to hear", before urging her to "stop being ignorant". "A n**ger's calling me ignorant?" she says incredulously, before refocusing her attention on Ms Hicks. "You're the one that's rude. You know what you said. Just get out of here. Go back to Mexico. This isn't your country - we don't want you here." At that moment a Walmart employee approaches the conflict, saying "that's not true, we do want you here", before asking the woman to leave store. "I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, ma'am. This is inappropriate. You're causing a scene in the store," the employee says. The elderly woman then starts fake-crying, mocking Ms Hicks for being upset by the comments she'd made. But she refuses to leave, and again turns to Ms Hicks, saying: "Get your stuff and go. I'm not gonna listen to her mouth [off]." After yet more bickering, the woman appears to lose patience and walks away. "Whatever - I ain't listening to this bullcrap." Walmart is looking into the incident, saying they "value and respect everyone who visits our stores". "We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store," the company said in a statement. It is not known whether the police are getting involved. Newshub.

Every parent knows that. Not by themselves, of course – they’re clearly in cahoots with college registrars, airline gate agents, and checkers at Wal-Mart. There’s probably a secret meeting place where the people who decide to close half the checkout lanes compare notes with those who pick the passengers to get bumped. But the school bus drivers – well, there’s a lot of power behind that bifold yellow door. It’s important to get a good one. And in case you forget, there’s a sub driver lurking just around the corner ready to pounce. You start to appreciate your regular driver when you’ve been standing on the corner for 45 minutes and your boss is blowing up your phone with texts that say things like, “Are you coming to work today?” And you know it’s a sub, so you don’t have a cell number, and either he is at least 45 minutes behind schedule because he doesn’t know the route or he came 15 minutes early and blew by your stop because your little darling wasn’t standing there with his backpack slung over his shoulder. Dilemma: Wait five more minutes hoping he’ll show up, or throw your kid in the backseat and take your chances with the dreaded car line. That is a lose-lose proposition. School bus drivers can insist you wait at the exact spot on the route map, no matter that it’s 12 degrees and hailing basketballs. They can assign your child a seat away from his friends, ensuring endless whining about the unfairness of it all. They can drop your first-grader off at your house without a thought as to whether anyone’s home. Or they can be Jim Slaughter. Mr. Slaughter, who has been driving Bus No. 1 for 15 years, is that rare school bus driver who might detour a block off his route so your child doesn’t have to wait in the snow or walk home in the sleet. He’s the driver who will send you a text to let you know he’s running 10 minutes late because there was an accident on Second Street. And if your car, which is always in the driveway in the afternoon, isn’t there that day, he might give you call before letting your child off his bus. Sure, parents love him. But so do the kids. He might assign them seats that allow calmness and sanity to prevail, but there’s Free Seat Friday to make up for it. He’ll take help; fifth-graders can be bus helpers, but only after they’ve written an application essay explaining why they want to do it and why they should be selected. It’s an honor – and a leadership lesson. Well-behaved children are likely to get rewarded with a bag of donut holes on Friday, but Mr. Slaughter is likely to have a word with the parents of those who are less angelic. And if you were lucky enough to be on Mr. Slaughter’s route at the end of fifth grade, you got invited to a Jim-Slaughter-sponsored pizza party one afternoon just before summer vacation. He manages a bus the way good managers run a company: He’s fair. He holds them accountable when they make a mistake. He rewards them when they excel. He gives them an opportunity to advance. He earns his charges’ respect, and they earn his. Bus business is serious, but there are also donut holes and pizzas. On Tuesday, Mr. Slaughter, a former Air Force special investigator, drove Bus No. 1 for the last time. He’s ready to retire again. Come August, that’s going to be a very big seat to fill.   Share this: Email Print Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google Jim SLaughter management Periscope school bus Ted Streuli 7:49 pm Tue, May 23, 2017 The Journal Record Ted Streuli Tagged with: Jim SLaughter management Periscope school bus Ted Streuli Related Articles O’Connor: Shopping Oklahoma City to the world May 23, 2017 Hyde: The care that Americans deserve May 23, 2017 Around Town: Passing the baton May 23, 2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In December 2013, at the height of the shopping season, the retailer announced that it had suffered a major malware infection in its payment systems. Up to 40 million credit and debit cards had been skimmed. The following month the number increased to 70 million as investigators sorted out the mess. The fiasco ended up costing CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job, after 35 years with the company. The retailer also firmed up its point-of-sale security with the introduction of tougher chip-and-PIN-card technology. As break-ins go it was a massive hit, possibly the biggest theft of customer data ever reported. The states promptly took Target to task and on Tuesday the firm said that it had finally reached a settlement for the issue. "We've been working closely with State Attorneys General for several years to address claims related to Target's 2013 data breach," a Target spokeswoman told The Register. "We're pleased to bring this issue to a resolution for everyone involved. The costs associated with this settlement are already reflected in the data breach liability reserves that Target has previously recognized and disclosed." All of the money will go to the states, she explained, since this is not a settlement with consumers. The funds will go to states' budgets for them to disburse as they see fit. As fines go, $18.5m might sound like a lot – but Target made over $20bn in profits last year. Therefore the fine will cost the retailer a little less than eight hours profits, so it's hardly a big financial hit for the company. That said, Target has also allocated some $10m in compensation for its customers and has paid out $40m to banks and credit card companies to compensate for losses. But it's still hardly enough to amount to more than a slap on the wrist. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Target Data Theft Settlement Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register After years of warnings, mobile network hackers exploit SS7 flaws to drain bank accounts O2 confirms online thefts using stolen 2FA SMS codes 48 Comments Hey FCC, when you're not busy screwing our privacy, how about those SS7 cell network security flaws, huh?

Jabaraj spoke Tuesday (May 23) during the Quarterly Business Analysis Luncheon held in Fayetteville. As to the uncertainty, there’s a lot riding nationally on promises of lower corporate taxes, repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and when and how the Federal Reserve will unwind more than $2.2 trillion from its balance sheet. Jebaraj said there’s more going right in the local and state economies than wrong. The Northwest Arkansas economy is doing well. Nationally, the economy is in the third longest period of economic expansion at almost 96 months. He said the nationwide Small Business Optimism Index remains high despite a slight pullback in April after the failed attempt to repeal and replace healthcare legislation. Also moving in the right direction is the National Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which has been trending upward since 2014. The Purchasing Managers Index reading, which measures manufacturing, has been above 55 for the past eight months, which is fair for a sector whose reading was below 50 in early 2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the statewide manufacturing segment grew 800 jobs in January, and 300 of those were in Northwest Arkansas. Jebaraj said this employment sector continues to shrink overall as technology is doing more of the work. He said statewide manufacturing still accounts for 12% of the jobs and it’s 11% of the jobs in Northwest Arkansas. Consumers remain confident through April on the national scene with a sentiment reading close to 100. Jebaraj said that’s about as good as it gets and while sentiment is not quite as high as it was in 2016, it’s on par with levels in 2014. He said all the negative news and political posturing out of Washington is not yet impacting national economic performance. NORTHWEST ARKANSAS GROWTH, CONCERNS The local population is about 516,000 and Jebaraj said the labor force is growing at about 2% annually. He said people are moving in and finding jobs because the local unemployment rate is 2.5%, a bit higher than the 2% low mark hit in 1999. Statewide, the unemployment rate hit a record low of 3.5% in April as 19,700 new jobs were created in the state this year. Nationally, the unemployment rate stands at 4.4%. Mervin Jebaraj, interim director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas Another area where Northwest Arkansas continues to shine is in per capita income which is $52,000, above the national rate of $49,000 and much better than the $39,000 statewide average. He said while unemployment remains low locally and statewide, there has not been an uptick in wages. The only plausible explanation is that there is still slack in the labor force, and an obvious mismatch of open jobs with available talent. One troubled segment for the nation, state and region is retail. He said the country has shed 50,000 retail jobs this year, an unprecedented level historically. He said while retail is not a typically large employment sector for the state or region, it matters to how cities look and feel. He said with far too many department stores that more closures are coming and that could spell trouble for strip centers where they are located. “Department stores often anchor retail space and with some of the biggest names in retail closing stores, it remains to be seen what will happen to the real estate they occupy. Our local cities have spent a lot of money on infrastructure in the shopping districts and as stores close, cities will have to work to keep these areas from blight,” he said. Jeff Collins, former director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and an economic consultant for Talk Business & Politics, recently noted that sales tax revenue in the Northwest Arkansas economy closed out 2016 on a high note. Collections in Benton, Madison and Washington counties totaled $9.293 million in December, better than the $8.649 million in December 2015, according to Collins’ notes for The Compass Report. Tax revenue growth in the region is even more impressive when compared with the larger central Arkansas metro. “The Northwest Arkansas regional economy had sales and use tax collections totaling roughly $25.8 million in the quarter while the Central Arkansas regional economy had collections for the same period of roughly $27.5 million,” Collins noted. Economic conditions in four Arkansas metro areas were mixed in the final quarter of 2016, with the Northwest Arkansas and Fort Smith metros ending the year on a positive note relative to the third quarter, according to The Compass Report. Compared to the third quarter of the year, Central Arkansas and the Jonesboro metro showed slight declines. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, the pace of economic growth was down slightly in Central Arkansas and in Northwest Arkansas, up in the Fort Smith metro, and slightly better in the Jonesboro metro. Collins said a long-term risk for the Northwest Arkansas economy – and even so for the state economy – is the level of success Wal-Mart Stores reaches in meeting retail challenges. “Of all of the sectors of the economy, none has been more dynamic than retail in the past decade. Recent lay-offs at Wal-Mart corporate in Northwest Arkansas clearly underscore the challenges faced by traditional retailers seeking to compete in an increasing online marketplace,” Collins said. He noted that what should have everyone’s attention in Arkansas is that Amazon has a market cap of $449 billion compared to Wal-Mart’s $232 billion. “As Wal-Mart seeks to improve its ability to compete, local leaders are anything but disinterested spectators. Whether or not Wal-Mart will be successful remains to be seen but the need to continue the diversification of the regional economy is not at issue. The greatest risk is believing that past success implies future success. This is clearly not the case, as anyone from a metro area built on manufacturing can attest,” Collins said. STUDENT DEBT, NATIONAL ECONOMY OUTLOOK Household debt is also a concern as it surpassed $12.73 trillion earlier this year. Jebaraj said at the start of the recession in 2008 household debt was $12.68 trillion, but one major difference between then and now is the amount of debt associated with home ownership. He said there is no evidence now that shows home owners are oversold on their homes. The areas of concern are auto loans and student loan debt as each are seeing higher than normal 90-day delinquencies. He said student loan debt stands at $1.3 trillion and 11% of borrowers are more than 90 days past due. One area impacted from higher consumer and student loan debt is homeownership rates. He said most of the age brackets are showing declining homeownership, except for those age 65 and up. With high student loan balances, millennials who might want to own a home are likely making the equivalent of two car payments which can hurt their ability to save for a downpayment, he said. Jebaraj said the 2.5% expected national growth rate for the remainder of the year is predicated on the assumption that small and large businesses will benefit from corporate tax reform, if healthcare legislation is passed, and if there is some infrastructure investment announcement for early next year. He also is eager to see how the Federal Reserve decides to unwind its holdings of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet to the tune of $2.2 trillion. Jebaraj said if they raise interest rates in June and September by .25% each time, they will likely wait until 2018 to begin reductions in balance sheet holdings as they try to keep inflation in check. Inflation is about 2% and that’s where the Fed would like to see it stay. Jebaraj said if any of the underlying presumptions are missed then there could be some turbulence to the national economy with fallout at the state and local levels as well. Collins said GDP growth will continue to depend on consumer willingness to spend. “It remains to be seen if business investment will accelerate or continue to show mixed results. Analysts expect fiscal stimulus in the form of increased spending and tax cuts but the impact of both is at least a year out, assuming they occur at all,” Collins noted.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced today that it’s expanding its military leave-of-absence policy by offering differential pay to all eligible employees who are on military assignments lasting more than three days. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said in a news release that the differential pay will cover the duration of military leave, including basic training, for employees whose military salary is less than what they earn working for Wal-Mart. The company says its employees took more than 4,400 military leave of absences last year. The new policy takes effect June 24. Wal-Mart senior director for military programs, retired Brig. Gen. Gary Profit, said employees who want to serve in the military will now be able to do so more easily. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch.” Profit said. “The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” Wal-Mart also announced that it was giving a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a group that helps those grieving the death of a loved one who served in the Armed Forces.

And if it is, he said, it could be the help struggling retailers need. "If we get the pieces right, we will see the rebirth of American manufacturing without severe negative impacts on important sectors like retail," he said. The border adjustment tax, proposed in House Republicans' Better Way tax blueprint unveiled last summer as a way to raise $1 trillion in revenue, has generated fierce opposition among retailers. A group of CEOs representing companies such as AutoZone , J.C. Penney and Walgreens Boots Alliance descended on Washington in February to express their concerns about the BAT to lawmakers, including the president. Hundreds of companies have joined Americans for Affordable Products, a coalition of firms opposing the BAT. Target CEO Brian Cornell appeared alongside Simon at Tuesday's House hearing and issued a stern warning against the BAT. "Under the new border adjustment tax, American families -- your constituents -- would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less," he said. Simon, who clarified at the outset he was representing himself and not an industry or corporation, argued that the BAT tax could actually help retailers if it boosts U.S. manufacturing enough to create jobs and boost the middle class. "I don't want to ignore or bulldoze their concerns, because improperly implemented, it will be very, very hurtful for their industry and the consumer. But if we take the time to do the work and sit down in a group and iron out, lay out what it will look like, I think it will be very, very successful for U.S. manufacturing," he said. "Once the middle class jobs start to return to the country and the wage increases that would come with that, retail will start to see a resurgence and a period of growth." The retail sector has fallen on tough times as of late, with once-big names such as Sears , Macy's and J.C. Penney shuttering hordes of stores as they struggle to stay afloat. Sector job loss has accelerated as almost no firm seems immune. "Right now, the wind is coming out of retail sales because the wind is coming out of the middle class," Simon said. "But if we can rebuild a middle class through a manufacturing base, retail, in the long-run -- and I know everybody's dead -- but in the long-run, we'll be better." To be sure, there are a number of caveats to the border adjustment tax and Simon's argument. His theory assumes the BAT will be implemented slowly and not just as a 20% tax right away. It also assumes the retail sector will make changes to adjust. Perhaps most importantly, Simon's case assumes the BAT will actually make it somewhere legislatively. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham in February joked the measure wouldn't get 10 votes in the Senate, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in an interview Tuesday indicated the White House isn't exactly a fan. "It doesn't create a level playing field," he said. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

June 16 will be the last day of business for the grocery store at 2972 Iris Ave. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) Walmart, we hardly knew ye. The mega-retailer on Tuesday announced plans to close its Boulder outpost, a Neighborhood Market concept, less than four years after opening. June 16 will be the last day of business for the grocery store at 2972 Iris Ave. Company spokesperson Anne Hatfield said the decision was motivated by the changing nature of retail, including the shift to online shopping. "We're evolving as a company to make sure we're keeping up with those changes," she said. "Our customers want to shop when and how they want (and) we need to make sure we're providing that right blend of e-commerce offerings and physical stores." Hatfield said axing the Boulder store was an "isolated event" — no other closures are planned at this time. The Neighborhood Market concept, launched in 1998, is going strong, she said, with more than 600 locations around the country. About 70 employees in Boulder will be given the option to transfer to a nearby store. There is a Walmart Supercenter in Lafayette, two in Broomfield and two in Longmont. The 53,500-square-foot Neighborhood Market opened in October 2013 to protests from Boulder residents. Rumors abounded in the community for more than a year before Walmart announced its intentions; permits filed for the space, formerly home to Ross and PetSmart, did not identify the operator. Advertisement Details in the filings, such as paint colors, floor plan and cart corrals, matched the company's motif and fueled speculation and debate in the community about the world's largest corporation — often maligned for its business practices — setting up shop in a liberal enclave. Hatfield said Walmart does not have plans for a continued presence in Boulder but remains committed to Colorado. There are 100 Walmart and Sam's Clubs in the state, including one at Longmont's Village at the Peaks. The company remodeled 17 Colorado stores last year and plans to spruce up five more in 2017. This is the second national grocery store to close a Boulder location this year. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods shuttered its Baseline operation in February, part of an effort to shed smaller, older stores. Local grocer Alfalfa's saw a boost in sales from the Whole Foods closure, said company spokesperson Sonja Tuitele. The two stores, a mere two miles apart, catered to the same group of nearby organic shoppers. Tuitele is confident that Alfalfa's will continue to thrive in Boulder and wasn't surprised that Walmart hadn't in the hyper-competitive market that includes two Lucky's Markets, two Whole Foods, two Sprouts, three Safeways, two King Soopers, and a Natural Grocers and Trader Joe's. "Unless you differentiate yourself, it's easy to get lost in the fray." The overabundance of shopping options is no comfort to Karen Swett, who works out at the 24-Hour Fitness next door and shops at the Walmart for its convenience and low prices. "I know people are down on shopping at Walmart," she said, "but it's expensive enough to live in Boulder," and savings on groceries at the Neighborhood Market helped alleviate that pressure, if just a little bit. "I'm bummed it's closing."

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Continue Reading Below Starting on June 24, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail chain will offer “deferential pay” for any military-related absence that lasts longer than three days. The changes will expand the program to include coverage during basic training. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch,” Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart, said in a statement. Walmart also said it is working to simplify the application process for employees eligible for the military leave of absence policy. Walmart employees took more than 4,400 military-related absences in 2016, according to the company. A U.S. Army private with less than two years of service time earns about $19,198.80 annually, according to the army’s website. Walmart increased its minimum wage to $10 per hour in February 2016. Walmart says it has hired more than 170,000 veterans of the armed services since 2013, more than 22,000 of which were eventually promoted. The company is aiming to hire 250,000 veterans by the end of 2020. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The Military Times ranked Walmart 37th on its list of the best employers of veterans in 2017.

The analysts sees annual earnings of just under $122 million and an EPS of $2.22 are estimated for fiscal 2017. The analyst believes Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) “has the most meaningful competitive effect on the supermarket industry,” and elaborated in a note on how its gains will lower that of competitors. “Wal-Mart is taking share back from grocers at an accelerating rate,” said Wolf. First-quarter same-store sales grew 2 percent, a three-year best. Wal-Mart U.S. grocery sales also outperformed U.S. grocers by 2.9 percent. In 2016's Q4, outperformance was 1.6 percent. The last time Wal-Mart outperformed supermarkets was 2009–2010, making the last two quarters a major inflection point. Kroger Is Looking Better Than The Industry Kroger is currently trading below all members of Loop Capital’s food merchandisers group except for SUPERVALU INC. (NYSE: SVU) on comparative forward P/E and EV/forward EBITDA multiples. Wolf noted that while Kroger’s same-store sales have slowed, an inflection point is expected for Q1 from down (0.7 percent) to flat. Kroger is also pursuing a “click and collect” e-commerce strategy like Wal-Mart, which the analyst believes will be a growing aspect of grocery shopping in the future. These trends will likely help Kroger stay above the industry average as Wal-Mart puts on pressure.

 Walmart's former CEO and Target's CEO clash over one of Trump's key policies — and only one of them can be right Kate Taylor May 23, 2017, 11:49 AM 2,811 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP The border tax is causing a stir in the retail industry, as politicians and executives clash on how to fix a "broken" system.  "Under the new border adjustment tax, American families — your constituents — would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less," Target CEO Brian Cornell testified in a House of Representatives committee meeting on Tuesday. Cornell called the US's current tax code "broken." However, he said the proposed border adjustment tax, which taxes imports 20% while exempting exports, would only hurt American retailers and shoppers. According to Cornell, the border adjustment tax would more than double the retailer's tax rate to 75%, leaving Target unable to invest in hiring workers and opening new stores in the US.  "It's simple math," Cornell said. "If the government takes nearly four out of every five dollars we make... there's no capital to invest and no prospects for growth. And that matters a lot. Both to us and to the American economy. Instead of investing and creating American jobs, we’d be pushed in the other direction."   AP Meanwhile, former Walmart CEO William Simon spoke in support of the border tax. Simon, who stepped down from his position at Walmart in 2014, said that a border adjustment tax could help bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and contribute to the health of the American retail industry in the long term, if properly implemented over an extended period of time.  "Once the middle-class jobs start to return to the country, and the wage increases that would come with that, retail will start to see a new sort of resurgence and a period of growth," Simon said, noting he understands Cornell and other retailer executives' concerns. "Right now the wind is coming out of retail sales because the wind is coming out of the middle class."  The CEO of food processing company ADM, Juan Luciano, also spoke out against the border tax in the committee meeting. Industry trade group National Retail Federation has strongly opposed a border tax, saying it would result in higher prices for American shoppers.  The border tax has fallen out of the limelight in recent months, as retailers have lobbied against the tax and the provision has failed to gain the necessary support in Senate. Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman from Texas, said in Tuesday's committee meeting that the border adjustment tax, which he opposes, is currently on "life support."  SEE ALSO: Starbucks is quietly changing the business as furious baristas slam the 'cult that pays $9 an hour' NOW WATCH: Everything you need to know about Echo Look — Amazon's new device that will judge the way you dress Loading video...

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The program, which begins June 24, enhances a differential pay scheme that has been in effect since 2008, officials said. In 2016, Walmart associates took more than 4,400 military leave of absences. According to the U.S. Army website, soldiers with less than two years of experience make about $19,200 per year, or about $9.23 per hour, with pay slightly lower for new members. Walmart last year raised the minimum pay for its workers to $10 per hour. “At Walmart, we’re turning jobs into fulfilling careers for veterans, active service members and their families, and we’re making it easier for them to work, live and serve,” Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart, said in a statement. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch. The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.” Walmart said it is one of the first major retailers to apply differential pay to include basic training, so associates who are considering enlisting in the armed forces can make that decision without fear of losing wages. In addition, Walmart said it was taking steps to streamline the internal process required to obtain differential pay with the goal of making it easier on associates and their families. Walmart hired more than 170,000 veterans since it announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May of 2013, guaranteeing a job to any eligible, honorably discharged veteran. Of those veteran hires, more than 22,000 have been promoted to jobs with higher pay and greater responsibility, Walmart said. 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

In 2016, Walmart associates took more than 4,400 military leave of absences.   Walmart said it is one of the first major retailers to apply differential pay to include basic training, so associates who are considering enlisting in the armed forces can make that decision without fear of losing wages. In addition, Walmart is taking steps to streamline and simplify the internal process required to obtain differential pay with the goal of making it easier on associates and their families, so they can spend less time on paperwork and more time on their service.   “At Walmart, we’re turning jobs into fulfilling careers for veterans, active service members and their families, and we’re making it easier for them to work, live and serve,” said Retired Brigadier General Gary Profit, senior director of military programs for Walmart. “We believe that anyone who wants to serve in our Armed Forces should be able to do so without fear of losing wages or leaving their family in a lurch. The changes we’re making will remove financial barriers for all associates serving their country, including those who are starting their service journey through basic training.”   Walmart has hired more than 170,000 veterans since it announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013, which guaranteed a job offer to any eligible, honorably discharged U.S. veteran who was within 12 months of active duty. Of those hires, more than 22,000 have been promoted to jobs with higher pay and greater responsibility, the chain said.     The initial goal of the initiative was to hire 100,000 veterans by the end of 2018. In May  2015, Walmart announced the expansion of that original projection, with the goal of hiring 250,000 veterans by the end of 2020. Walmart has also changed the eligibility from within 12 months of active duty, to any veteran who has been honorably discharged since the announcement of the program in May 2013.   Walmart is also announcing a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS), the national organization that offers help, hope and healing to all those grieving the death of a loved one serving in the Armed Forces. The grant will enable TAPS to reach more survivors through their casework and emergency assistance programs.   Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Jet.com ventures into physical retail Lidl to make U.S. debut June 15—with low, low prices Sears’ Lampert takes on vendors in blog J.C.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

I read of a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, with multiple casualties confirmed. The story would develop throughout the night, and details of the tragedy are still unfolding. While I was standing in the security line, before I ever made it inside the venue, I learned 19 people had died. That number has since risen. Next at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion Who: Mary J. Blige When: 7:30 p.m. June 3 Where: Arkansas Music Pavilion, Rogers Cost: Starting at $30 plus fees Tickets: 479-443-5600 or visit arkansasmusicpavilion.com for information. It was hard not to think of that while watching a live music event, like 8,000 or so did on Monday night when the “Play that Song” tour featuring Train, O.A.R. and Natasha Bedingfield stopped in Rogers.  It’s possible that some there hadn’t heard of the incident before the night was over, that they didn’t receive a breaking news notification on their smartphone like many of us did. It was not mentioned by any of the three bands during their sets. If there were additional security measures taken, I didn’t notice them. That would have been difficult – the events were happening as we were all walking in the venue. But it was hard not to let that color the evening, which saw the headliners perform on a stage impressively decorated to look like a jukebox, complete with flashing half circles of light and a large video screen where the player exists. This was a night of radio-friendly pop, provided without apologies and meant to bring people together. In the same vein, there was a touching moment near the end of the night. Train performed the song “Black Hole Sun” as a tribute to recently deceased vocalist and songwriter Chris Cornell, who wrote the song with the rock band Soundgarden. Still images from various points in Cornell’s career flashed on the screen behind Train as they played. It was obviously well planned, and pulled together in a hurry, too – Cornell was found dead less than a week ago. The song brought people together at the AMP, because Soundgarden brought people together and many share in the collective loss. Music matters. And that was the perspective I found renewed listening to Train, a band I do not actively follow and that has more hits than I am aware of, considering the reactions of the crowd. Indeed, as one might expect on a tour called “Play that Song,” the band dropped all of the songs they’ve made famous, such as big, bouncy radio hits like “Meet Virginia” and “Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me),” which they used to close out their 90-minute set. Patrick Monahan of Train Lead singer Patrick Monahan paced around the stage and did his best to please fans. He grabbed a camera from a nearby operator and took matters into his own hands for a few minutes. He caught cell phones tossed at him and took selfies before tossing them back. And he seemed particularly enthused when singing with the opening artists doing guest spots. Natasha Bedingfield joined for the Train original “Bruises” and several members of O.A.R. took the stage for a lively run through Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al.” With an added blast from the O.A.R. horn section, it was the highlight of a fairly predictable and choreographed night of music. Train did all of the concert things – breaking down the band and coming forward for a quieter, acoustic-led interval punctuated by the song “Marry Me” and alternating between new and old. Train has been around since the mid-1990s. They know what they are doing. O.A.R. The opening acts did, too. O.A.R. has been around just as long. It seems like just yesterday my college friends were overplaying them. They blasted through their 45-minute set. Their sound is something of a blend of Dave Matthews Band, Dispatch and Chicago. If you get a chance to see them, make sure to watch for trumpeter/hype man Jon Lampley, who did not stop moving for one moment during those 45 minutes. His energy is intense. Bedingfield worked hard to get the crowd involved during her 30 minutes on stage. She had a tough go of it. The crowd was barely settled. The gear from O.A.R. was onstage behind her, and it covered up significant portions of her cloth backdrop. Her songs, and the covers that she chose, fit well in the mold of Train – light on substance, big on hooks. Natasha Bedingfield Before the headliners got on the stage, a woman next to me told me she wasn’t the world’s biggest Train fan. She ended up with a free ticket courtesy of a friend, and she said she expected to recognize more Train songs than she could name off the top of her head. Even if she didn’t know the band as well as some of those in our section, she told me this important thing: She rarely passes up free live music. Her friend gave her a ticket, and night of live music beats most alternatives. That’s something I’m reminded of, and something we cannot take for granted. Live music uplifts, not depresses. Live music heals, not harms. Live music unifies, not separates. The next time you get a chance, go see some live music. It’s good for you, and it’s good for us.   Discussion Fayetteville Flyer has specific guidelines for commenting.

Meyerle/Dreamstime) Tuesday, 23 May 2017 09:22 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Inside the Whole Foods Market in midtown Manhattan at lunchtime, it’s easy to forget that the organic supermarket chain is facing its biggest crisis since going public in 1992. A line 20-people deep waits at a juice and espresso bar near the bustling store entrance across from Bryant Park. In the food hall upstairs, the tables are packed with customers noshing on superfood salads and sushi. Too harried to stop for oysters, many shoppers order Nashville-style fried chicken sandwiches from digital kiosks and sample cold brew from Stumptown Coffee Roasters. Whole Foods Market Inc., facing pressure from restless shareholders after nearly two years of sliding sales, still has cachet in New York and other pockets of the U.S. That unique foodie appeal is key to a turnaround if Chief Executive Officer John Mackey is able to improve operations, said Charles Kantor, a managing director at Neuberger Berman, one of the grocery chain’s 10 biggest investors.  “He got all the hard things right over the years, but he didn’t get the easy stuff right,” Kantor said. “There hasn’t been laserlike focus in a long time.” As grocers fight for traffic amid an intense price war and the threat of e-commerce, Whole Foods stands out among its peers with its prepared foods and in-house restaurants that make its stores destinations. The challenge for Mackey, who co-founded the company in 1980, is how to assuage Wall Street by boosting profits without ruining what made Whole Foods wildly popular in the first place. “They have to do two things at the same time that are diametrically opposed,” said Roger Davidson, a former Wal-Mart grocery executive who works as a consultant. “They have to make sure they don’t dumb it down.” Brand Loyalty The hubbub at newer Whole Foods locations like the one in midtown Manhattan illustrates a brand loyalty that most retailers would envy, especially when brick-and-mortar stores are closing at a record pace. Neuberger Berman increased its stake in the company in 2015 because of its rare ability to “connect in an emotional way” with shoppers, said Kantor. The firm owns about 2.7 percent of Whole Foods shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was a time, before the current slump, when the arrival of a Whole Foods store meant shoppers would get access to products that weren’t widely available elsewhere. The stores became magnets for foodies and affluent customers who were more likely to buy kale than iceberg lettuce. And usually there was little competition to lure them away. Now, the competitive ground has shifted. Whole Foods, which has about 450 U.S. stores, is getting pummeled by Kroger, Wal-Mart, Costco and other retail giants that have muscled into a market that it helped create. Sales have dropped for seven straight quarters, and shareholders are getting agitated. Proxy Defense Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund, announced a stake in Whole Foods last month, pushing for wholesale changes including a possible sale of the company. The news sent shares soaring 10 percent on April 10. The stock is up 18 percent this year through Monday, after three straight years of declines. Hoping to avoid a proxy fight, Whole Foods recently announced it would overhaul its board of directors by adding five new members. The company had hoped the changes would appease Jana, but the hedge fund rejected a proposed truce, preferring to keep its options open. In a bid to reignite sales and profit growth by October 2018, Whole Foods also said it would expand its nascent loyalty program and use data to improve how it stocks products, A few months earlier, Whole Foods abandoned its 1,200-store target, which had come under fire from Wall Street for being overly ambitious. The grocery chain is now focusing on relocating smaller stores to bigger nearby locations, banking that it can create flagships that double as dining destinations. “We’ve had tremendous success with those stores,” Mackey said on a recent conference call, citing locations in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. Whole Foods also recently said it was doubling its cost-savings target to $600 million by the end of fiscal 2020, with a plan to invest some of that money in lower prices. The grocer has been dogged by its reputation for being overpriced -- customers gave it the tongue-in-cheek nickname “Whole Paycheck” -- making it tricky to bring in new shoppers.  Lower Prices And while the chain can’t win a price war with the likes of Kroger, Wal-Mart and the German chain Aldi, getting some of its prices more in line with conventional stores is still a key piece of a potential turnaround. Whole Foods can stand out with local cheese and olive oil that can’t be found elsewhere, but it needs to lower prices on standard fare like organic milk, industry analysts say. “That can have a halo effect on the entire store’s pricing,” meaning shoppers will perceive value across the store, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Inmar’s Willard Bishop. Part of the company’s effort to cut costs includes centralizing much of its buying in Austin, Texas, where its headquarters are located. For years, Whole Foods has relied on a regional system. Buyers in the Northeast, for instance, controlled what products got put on shelves in that market. The strategy allowed Whole Foods to feature artisanal local brands. With the change toward more centralization, the retailer risks losing its reputation as a destination for unique products. “As you start to take away people with knowledge of the market, you lose,” said Tim Sperry, a former Whole Foods executive and industry consultant. Threading Needle Mackey, 63, who took sole control last year after six years of sharing the CEO post with Walter Robb, insists that he can thread the needle: reducing expenses and lowering prices on groceries while keeping his stores on the leading edge of food trends. “We’re not making these changes randomly -- it’s very data driven,” he said in an interview, adding that shoppers will find unique local products at stores, despite the move to centralize operations in Austin. With activist pressure looming, Mackey doesn’t have much time to show signs that he can get the company back on track. “You can’t make these types of changes that quickly,” said Davidson, the industry consultant. “It’s a whole new way of doing business.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Photo: Rebecca Sanabria/Getty Images With reports that 41-year-old children’s apparel chain Gymboree will be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and shuttering 350 stores nationwide, questions about the kids retail market mount. Has online shopping fundamentally changed the way that parents shop for their kids’ clothes? Or is there still space for the Gymborees of the world? The answer to both questions, as is the case with most questions percolating in the ongoing brick-and-mortar versus e-commerce debate, is both yes and no. Brick-and-mortar isn’t going away anytime soon, particularly for kids apparel, say some analysts. According to Rachel Saunders, insights and strategy director at youth-research firm Cassandra, 78 percent of parents in the US prefer to shop in-store over online, and 70 percent shop continuously throughout the year, as opposed to seasonally. Photo: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images One key factor that maintains brick-and-mortar’s relevance in the kids clothes market? Sizing. “Sizes are always different,” says Korin Lewis. She shops in Austin for her 2-year-old daughter, and struggles with both size variance among brands and the need to keep pace with her toddler’s rapid growth. “Also, it’s just easier to tell in person what something looks like.” Store choice matters in any market, and kids clothing is no exception. “Whereas the family shopping experiences of the past were designed with the kid in mind, today’s experiences are more about appeasing parent and child alike,” says Saunders, adding that 54 percent of US parents prioritize stress-free options when selecting a retailer. “To Gen Y parents and their children, the best stores are a ‘destination’ or place of discovery that feels like a special experience.” In that way, Gymboree might have fit the bill as a destination-slash-discovery-zone if only it had returned to its roots by introducing more mommy-and-me classes to its struggling retail locations, but the company sold its Play & Music business to Singapore investment group Zeavion in 2016 for $127.5 million in an attempt to move the struggling corporation out of the red. After a buyout from Bain Capital in 2010, Gymboree reports a net loss of $324.9 million for 2017’s second quarter, with Bloomberg adding that the chain “hasn’t posted an annual profit since 2011, with losses totaling more than $800 million” and a debt of $1 billion. “To Gen Y parents and their children, the best stores are a ‘destination’ or place of discovery that feels like a special experience.” Walkable cities like New York are rich with kids clothes boutiques that give parents, as Saunders puts it, “a sense of calm, not chaos.” But elsewhere in the country, big-box stores like Target and affordable chains like Old Navy retain their foothold in the children’s retail space. “Target is our go-to for kids clothes,” says Shana Westlake, who lives in Rockville, Maryland. Target’s frequency of sales are a big draw for Westlake when shopping for her two kids, as is the superstore’s one-year return policy on apparel. “Most of my 4-year-old's everyday clothes are from Target.” Despite Target’s lag in sales at the end of last year, CEO Brian Cornell shared in the company’s 2016 Annual Report that “Signature categories, including Style and Kids, gained market share, growing approximately 3 percentage points faster than our total comparable sales,” and “two new blockbuster brands for kids — Cat & Jack and Pillowfort — […] have consistently generated double digit comp sales increases since they launched.” Target declined to share additional financial details when reached via the company’s media hotline. “There definitely is something to be said for maximizing my time that I don’t have [my daughter] with me, being able to go and get shampoo and other things like that while I’m also clothes shopping.” There’s another big upside for parents when it comes to shopping at megastores like Target and Walmart: the one-stop-shop factor. It’s a logistics benefit, albeit a double-edged one. “It’s like the story you hear, ‘Oh, I went in for paper towels and I spent $50 on kids clothes,’” says Lewis, who adds that it’s easier to shop solo than with her daughter in tow. “Time-wise […] there definitely is something to be said for maximizing my time that I don’t have her with me, being able to go and get shampoo and other things like that while I’m also clothes shopping.” Target and Walmart are also inexpensive. The inarguable facts that kids grow and play (often outdoors!) cannot be undersold; many parents nix high-end brands and seek out budget-friendly alternatives at chains like Gap-owned Old Navy specifically because they know they’ll need to buy replacement leggings and tees before YouTube’s Kids app can auto-load the next episode of Peppa Pig. Old Navy is the biggest earner of Gap’s brands, producing nearly $7 billion in sales by last tally. Though brick-and-mortar dominates right now, the future for kids clothes shopping looks like it’ll soon pivot to e-commerce. “Online shopping is slowly gaining momentum with parents, especially as more e-commerce platforms catering to parents emerge,” says Saunders. Photo: Bethany Mollenkof/Getty Images To that point, D.C.-based Marieke Lewis Brock shops frequently at Old Navy for her 2-year-old son, but largely online, taking advantage of their sales and promotions and applying rewards collected on her Banana Republic card (another sister company under the Gap Inc. umbrella). “Who knew that card would come in so handy?” she says. “I hardly pay anything, the clothes hold up well, my little boy loves what I pick out, and it’s super easy.” According to an industry survey, parents spend two-thirds more money shopping online and three-quarters more time shopping online than their non-parent counterparts. “Parents, especially working parents, are arguably the busiest adults in history,” explains trends expert Daniel Levine of Avant-Guide Institute. “Anything that makes their lives easier is going to be preferred over a similar activity that is more time-consuming.” Colleen Abel, a mom of two in Tulsa, agrees. “I hate shopping in person because the kids are always with me, and I am constantly rushed. Online shopping means I don't just grab the first thing I see to get it over with.” Jayme Kennedy, a mom of two in Upland, outside of Los Angeles, adds that limited proximity to malls renders online shopping much easier. In terms of brick-and-mortar, Target is Kennedy’s main option. “I hate shopping in person because the kids are always with me, and I am constantly rushed. Online shopping means I don't just grab the first thing I see to get it over with.” “The question is not just about how [superstores] are performing today, but what is the direction of the trend, and the outlook is not good,” adds Levine. “Target and other big-box stores need to do a better job of being multichannel to compete.” Sure, superstores are desirable because of their multifunctionality and ubiquity, but then there’s Amazon, the online equivalent of the all-in-one brick-and-mortar. “Absolutely e-commerce has changed the way parents shop, and Amazon is really the primary stakeholder in that shift,” says Cooper Smith, director of Amazon research for L2, a business-intelligence firm. Amazon’s “core strategy,” explains Smith, is to boost Prime membership, whose benefits include free two-day shipping and subscription services. “Parents fall squarely into the consumer demographic Amazon is targeting with Prime.” Smith adds that almost 50 percent of diapers sold on Amazon are eligible for Prime’s two-day shipping. “Now, who do you think owns those diapers? Amazon, of course.” The ease of buying necessities like diapers and socks on Amazon makes the e-commerce giant especially dominant in the baby market. Smith points to estimates from TABS Analytics that highlight baby goods as a $30 billion-a-year industry. Adds Smith, “Roughly 20 percent of those sales occur online, more than any other [consumer packaged goods] category, and of that online share, Amazon controls roughly 43 percent of the market.” “Parents fall squarely into the consumer demographic Amazon is targeting with Prime.” While Amazon delivers an online alternative to the convenience of an all-in-one brick-and-mortar, the site doesn’t necessarily deliver on the fashion-forward front. Instead, a host of specialty kids retail businesses have emerged online, not only as replacements for boutique shopping, but also as fulfillers of specific parental needs, targeting themes where brick-and-mortars may fall short — like choice, ease, and the kid pickiness factor. For a plethora of options and ample sales, there’s Zulily, an online-only retailer founded in 2010 and geared toward moms. “We launch 9,000 products a day in 100 different sales events,” says Zulily’s merchandise manager Lisa Vammen, “and it’s all up to 70 percent off, which is the icing on the cake for money-conscious parents.” The company reports net sales for 2016 at $1.5 billion. Relative newcomer Primary caters to an oft-iterated parental desire for simplicity, not to mention gender-neutral options. Founded in 2015, Primary’s gimmick is that its styles are gimmick-free, solid-colored basics with zero logos, slogans, or decoration — which, say co-founders Christina Carbonell and Galyn Bernard, formerly of Diapers.com, means that their styles can’t go out of style. “Who has time to reinvent the wheel every time your favorites get too small?” write Carbonell and Bernard via email. “Our customers appreciate the simplicity of Primary in terms of both the aesthetic of our clothing and the ease of shopping,” the latter of which hinges on browsing by color. Primary declined to share sales figures, but Carbonell and Bernard report that the company’s Facebook group has surpassed 150,000 fans. Photo: Al Seib/Getty Images And for more trend-conscious parents and kids, there are a number of new curated-box companies cropping up online that exclusively package looks for kids. KidPik, Rockets of Awesome, and Mac & Mia are essentially kid versions of Stitch Fix and Trunk Club, operating on a stylist-selected/keep-what-you-want model. KidPik calls their delivered shopping experience “fun-boxing.” There’s a third option alongside brick-and-mortar and online shopping, a time-honored tradition of parenting now given an extra boost by the efficiency of e-commerce: secondhand shopping, facilitated by apps. “In the aftermath of the recession, [Gen] Ys have become more selective about how they spend their time and money,” says Cassandra’s Saunders, adding that more than half of US parents buy clothes for their kids secondhand, and more than 40 percent resell their kids’ clothes once they’ve outgrown them, increasingly on platforms like Reshopper, Kidizen, and Envie. “In the aftermath of the recession, [Gen] Ys have become more selective about how they spend their time and money.” Facebook has proved valuable in connecting parents with one another to save bucks on needed items and de-clutter their homes of pieces they no longer need. “The combination of the wear and tear they put on clothes [and] how fast they grow out of them means we don't need a lot of new stuff,” says Ramona Layne Mueller, who shops secondhand on Facebook for her two kids under 5 years old. In Austin, closed Facebook groups like South Austin Buy-Sell-Swap Maternity, Baby & Kid Items, Ladies with Babies, and Austin Mamas Classified boast memberships in the thousands. Instagram, too, is a useful resale tool, especially among parents hunting for a specific item. Kennedy in Upland is a big fan of the platform for that purpose. “It's easy, and lots of times, you can find items that have sold out in stores. I’m currently waiting for an IG tag on an H&M unicorn dress for my unicorn-obsessed 6-year-old.” To all the unicorn-obsessed 6-year-olds out there, and their devoted parents, the shopping world is their oyster.

Don’t fret though, with the right strategy you and your family could have a Nintendo Switch of your own in no time at all. Tutorials on how to find the Nintendo Switch in stock are necessary because Nintendo has a long reputation of being very bad with new hardware launches. The Wii remained sold out for months. The Wii U didn’t sell well, but Nintendo even had trouble keeping it in stock early on. 2016’s NES Classic console was notoriously hard to find. Read: Nintendo Switch Buying Guide: Bundles, Games & Accessories Nintendo expanded production of the console to meet demand recently. For shoppers, that means the stores and sites they visit the most are getting Nintendo Switch consoles more often than they were in the days following release. Unfortunately, they just aren’t staying on shelves very long. Use these links and tips to find the Nintendo Switch in stock before Super Mario Odyssey, Arms and Splatoon 2 arrive later this year. Target, Amazon & Best Buy Finding a Nintendo Switch in stock at a retail store or retail website is still hard right now. They’re getting new units often, but gamers are quickly snatching them up. Create a reminder on your phone to check stock at these stores and websites every day. It’s hard to find the Nintendo Switch at retail stores like Target and Best Buy. Read: Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders Breakdown: What You Need to Know Amazon doesn’t have any of the Nintendo Switch in stock now. Resellers on the site do, but they don’t offer Amazon Prime delivery. Also, their prices are $100 more than the $299 the system sells for normally. Wal-Mart is in the same position as Amazon. It doesn’t have the Nintendo Switch in stock, but resellers who use the site as a storefront do. These resellers are offering the Nintendo Switch through Wal-Mart for $494. You can click the Notify Me When Available button on its store pages to get an email when stock returns. For now, Target does not have the Nintendo Switch in stock online or in store. You can add it to your registry for purchase when it does return. Best Buy lists the Nintendo Switch as sold out in stores and online. Shoppers can add it to their registry or a list to purchase later. GameStop shoppers have to choose between purchasing the $499 Nintendo Switch Bundles with Zelda or waiting until standalone Nintendo Switch consoles are in stock. How to Find the Nintendo Switch in Stock: Tracking Tool NowInStock’s Nintendo Switch tracking tool. Read: 3 Reasons to Buy a Nintendo Switch, 2 Reasons Not To The easiest way to find the Nintendo Switch in stock at any retailer is to use NowInStock. The site links you directly to the listings of a half-dozen retailers. It is updated multiple times a day too, meaning you can use the site to see if your favorite stores have the Nintendo Switch in stock before you leave home and when you return from work or school. eBay, Craigslist & Other Resellers Lots of enterprising users placed a Nintendo Switch pre-order so that they could resell later. If you’re desperate to play Nintendo’s latest games as soon as possible, you can purchase the console from these resellers. Expect to pay more for a Nintendo Switch when buying from someone that’s reselling. Sellers know that the console is difficult to get. They’re using that demand to justify big markups on the Switch. A quick check of your local Craigslist site should yield a few units selling for around $500. Don’t use PayPal or wire money to anyone. Meet them in a public place to make your exchange. eBay has users offering up their Nintendo Switch to the highest bidder too. There, the consoles are selling for as high as $650 with the site’s Buy It Now option. Plan on spending a little more at the site. Bidding wars could push prices to new highs. Nintendo says that it plans to sell millions of the Nintendo Switch consoles before the end of its fiscal year. Even if you can’t find a Nintendo Switch in stock now, you could find one soon. 12 Amazing Nintendo Switch Features You’ll Love Play Games on the Nintendo Switch in the Living Room   1 / 12 When docked, the Nintendo Switch allows anyone to play their video games on a high-definition television. In that way, the device is every bit the replacement for the Nintendo Wii U that we were expecting. Nintendo even describes it as a home entertainment console in its marketing materials. At first glance, the Nintendo Switch almost looks like a tablet with controller surfaces at the end – sort of like the current Wii U GamePad. Things can change quickly, though. Nintendo calls the attachments at each end of the device Joy Cons, short for Joy Controller. Each Joy Con has four sets of face buttons, a bumper and a joystick. Gamers can leave the Joy Cons attached to their Nintendo Switch or detach them later on. In this mode, you can remove the Joy-Con Controllers from the sides of the console and dock them with the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Grip. You can also pick up the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller for this mode and leave your Joy-Cons in place.     1 / 12 Click To Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – DSW, New York & Co, JC Penney, Foot Locker By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 23 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn. "We delivered a solid first-quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year. We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands."

For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year.

Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses.

Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period. Brand revenue at Vans was up 5% and by 6% at The North Face., but fell 5% at Timberland. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record first-quarter net sales of US$543.8m, a 4% increase compared with net sales of $525.1m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ScaleArc Study: Majority of Americans Expect a Top Retailer to Have a Website Outage This Holiday Shopping Season SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–ScaleArc, the leading provider of database load balancing software, today released the findings of its “Christmas in May Survey,” revealing that the majority of Americans (52 percent) anticipate that a top retailer will have a website outage during the upcoming 2017 holiday shopping season. Walmart was the retailer that took the number one spot on the list of retailers expected to have a major outage this holiday season, according to nearly 1 in 4 Americans (23 percent). ScaleArc, whose software helps keep retailers’ applications running smoothly, released its survey findings as it unveiled its new 2017 Black Friday prep checklist, designed specifically for online retailers who don’t want to be left behind this holiday season. “With ScaleArc, we achieved the best Black Friday in our company’s history,” says Craig Thayer, Chief Technology Officer for Sazze, the parent company to a range of eCommerce websites. “We were able to deliver 100 percent uptime, serving over 3 billion queries and tripling the amount of transactions from the previous year. We also saw a three-month return on investment (ROI), including a 10-day vs. 2-month deployment.” To help retailers prepare across their full technology stack, ScaleArc solicited best practices from its many retail and SaaS customers who routinely experience significant traffic spikes. ScaleArc compiled these findings in its “Black Friday Prep Timeline” infographic. “The season’s biggest online holiday shopping days – including Green Monday, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Free Shipping Day – make up the Super Bowl of eCommerce,” said Justin Barney, CEO of ScaleArc. “It’s becoming ever more critical that retailers prepare for game day all year long. As we saw with several big-name outages last season, even the smallest misstep in these important preparations can lead to major problems down the road. When web and mobile sites buckle under huge volumes of traffic and experience slowdowns or outages, retailers lose revenue and their brand suffers significant reputation loss.” Americans Likely to Take Action When a Website Fails According to ScaleArc’s “Christmas in May Survey,” more than half (52 percent) of Americans anticipate a major website outage from one of the top retailers this holiday shopping season. When asked which retailer will experience an outage, 23 percent of Americans predicted it would be retailer behemoth Walmart. Americans also called out other top retailers, including: Best Buy – 17 percent Macy’s – 16 percent Target – 16 percent Amazon – 14 percent Costco – 7 percent What’s more, more than half of Americans (51 percent) said they are likely to take action when an online retail site they are visiting experiences a slowdown or an outage. More than 1 in 4 Americans (26 percent) said they would immediately leave the website, and more than 1 in 5 Americans (21 percent) said they would visit a competitor website instead. Retailer Checklist for Black Friday – A Continuous Process Along with its survey findings, ScaleArc unveiled a checklist of what retailers need to be doing now to prepare for the upcoming holiday shopping season – the retail industry’s busiest time of the year for web traffic. Retailers understand the criticality of preparing for the year’s busiest season, in which many companies generate more than 30 percent of their yearly sales. Despite this preparation, however, every Black Friday season spawns a list of notable failures, with frustrated shoppers, ugly headlines, and revenue losses. ScaleArc compiled this chronological checklist to help IT and Ops teams reach targets throughout all 12 months, preparing for extreme scalability and continuous IT operations when Black Friday hits. Earlier research on application downtime highlighted that certain IT resources, including the database, often emerge as the weakest link in the technology chain. You can get more details by downloading the “Black Friday Prep Checklist.” May/June Add new features and new technology. If you have major infrastructure or architecture upgrades to do, now is the time. Even if these features and technologies do not apply specifically to Black Friday efforts, you need to get them into play so you know how they affect the entire system. Work towards a goal of zero downtime. Many Black Friday outages result from the database getting overwhelmed. Along with architecting for seamless and immediate database failover, you also need the application to work effectively with that database failover to keep customers logged in and productive during a database outage. Review your infrastructure with an eye toward avoiding downtime from maintenance windows. This approach includes maintenance for adding new services. Regardless of how well you’ve prepared, some element of infrastructure will need a last-minute change. Architect applications, the network, and the data tier to support zero-downtime maintenance so you can make last-minute adjustments without impacting your customers. July Increase site performance. It’s time to rev up the engine that will boost site performance to easily handle Black Friday traffic loads, delivering consistent and excellent customer experience. When it comes to databases, application performance bottlenecks tend to fall into three main categories: 1. poor query performance, 2. lack of concurrent capacity to handle high user loads, and 3. connection pooling / management issues. Look for technologies that can address these challenges. August/September Implement the system freeze and test all components. August is the time to stop making changes to your infrastructure. While most organizations have to occasionally accept last-minute updates beyond this point in time, most components should enter a freeze now. This time is also good for delving into analytics again to see where you have potential weaknesses in the system. Start applying load tests to see how all your infrastructure changes – particular at the data tier – are holding up. Testing at high load now gives you time to address any issues you uncover. October See how natural load increases are affecting your system. By early October, you’ll likely start to see traffic increase on a daily basis. Natural traffic growth can provide a better test backdrop than the load testing you engineer because it typically reveals surprises. Your Black Friday preparations should all be in place by now. November Analyze the traffic. Organizations with high Black Friday loads report Black Friday traffic being a 10X to 15X spike over rest-of-year numbers. Some organizations see as much as a 5X spike on Black Friday compared to Thanksgiving Thursday – it can be a dramatic traffic ramp. Make any last-minute adjustments. If you’ve been leveraging analytics throughout the year, any last-minute adjustments should be minor and most likely based on an unexpected traffic increase in October that signals higher traffic rates on Black Friday. December You made it! Wipe your brow, get a little sleep, and evaluate what just happened – it’s time for the post-mortem. You’ll need to replace band-aids with long-term fixes, identify your major infrastructure projects for Q1, and build a plan for increasing scalability next year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ScaleArc Study: Majority of Americans Expect a Top Retailer to Have a Website Outage This Holiday Shopping Season SANTA CLARA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–ScaleArc, the leading provider of database load balancing software, today released the findings of its “Christmas in May Survey,” revealing that the majority of Americans (52 percent) anticipate that a top retailer will have a website outage during the upcoming 2017 holiday shopping season. Walmart was the retailer that took the number one spot on the list of retailers expected to have a major outage this holiday season, according to nearly 1 in 4 Americans (23 percent). ScaleArc, whose software helps keep retailers’ applications running smoothly, released its survey findings as it unveiled its new 2017 Black Friday prep checklist, designed specifically for online retailers who don’t want to be left behind this holiday season. “With ScaleArc, we achieved the best Black Friday in our company’s history,” says Craig Thayer, Chief Technology Officer for Sazze, the parent company to a range of eCommerce websites. “We were able to deliver 100 percent uptime, serving over 3 billion queries and tripling the amount of transactions from the previous year. We also saw a three-month return on investment (ROI), including a 10-day vs. 2-month deployment.” To help retailers prepare across their full technology stack, ScaleArc solicited best practices from its many retail and SaaS customers who routinely experience significant traffic spikes. ScaleArc compiled these findings in its “Black Friday Prep Timeline” infographic. “The season’s biggest online holiday shopping days – including Green Monday, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Free Shipping Day – make up the Super Bowl of eCommerce,” said Justin Barney, CEO of ScaleArc. “It’s becoming ever more critical that retailers prepare for game day all year long.

A line 20-people deep waits at a juice and espresso bar near the bustling store entrance across from Bryant Park. In the food hall upstairs, the tables are packed with customers noshing on superfood salads and sushi. Too harried to stop for oysters, many shoppers order Nashville-style fried chicken sandwiches from digital kiosks and sample cold brew from Stumptown Coffee Roasters. The Harbor Bar at a Whole Foods store in midtown Manhattan. Photographer: Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg Whole Foods Market Inc., facing pressure from restless shareholders after nearly two years of sliding sales, still has cachet in New York and other pockets of the U.S. That unique foodie appeal is key to a turnaround if Chief Executive Officer John Mackey is able to improve operations, said Charles Kantor, a managing director at Neuberger Berman, one of the grocery chain’s 10 biggest investors.  “He got all the hard things right over the years, but he didn’t get the easy stuff right,” Kantor said. “There hasn’t been laserlike focus in a long time.” As grocers fight for traffic amid an intense price war and the threat of e-commerce, Whole Foods stands out among its peers with its prepared foods and in-house restaurants that make its stores destinations. The challenge for Mackey, who co-founded the company in 1980, is how to assuage Wall Street by boosting profits without ruining what made Whole Foods wildly popular in the first place. “They have to do two things at the same time that are diametrically opposed,” said Roger Davidson, a former Wal-Mart grocery executive who works as a consultant. “They have to make sure they don’t dumb it down.” Brand Loyalty The hubbub at newer Whole Foods locations like the one in midtown Manhattan illustrates a brand loyalty that most retailers would envy, especially when brick-and-mortar stores are closing at a record pace. Neuberger Berman increased its stake in the company in 2015 because of its rare ability to “connect in an emotional way” with shoppers, said Kantor. The firm owns about 2.7 percent of Whole Foods shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was a time, before the current slump, when the arrival of a Whole Foods store meant shoppers would get access to products that weren’t widely available elsewhere. The stores became magnets for foodies and affluent customers who were more likely to buy kale than iceberg lettuce. And usually there was little competition to lure them away. Now, the competitive ground has shifted. Whole Foods, which has about 450 U.S. stores, is getting pummeled by Kroger, Wal-Mart, Costco and other retail giants that have muscled into a market that it helped create. Sales have dropped for seven straight quarters, and shareholders are getting agitated. Proxy Defense Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund, announced a stake in Whole Foods last month, pushing for wholesale changes including a possible sale of the company. The news sent shares soaring 10 percent on April 10. They slipped as much as 2.7 percent to $35.25 in New York on Tuesday. The stock had gained 18 percent this year through Monday, after three straight years of declines. Hoping to avoid a proxy fight, Whole Foods recently announced it would overhaul its board of directors by adding five new members. The company had hoped the changes would appease Jana, but the hedge fund rejected a proposed truce, preferring to keep its options open. In a bid to reignite sales and profit growth by October 2018, Whole Foods also said it would expand its nascent loyalty program and use data to improve how it stocks products. A few months earlier, Whole Foods abandoned its 1,200-store target, which had come under fire from Wall Street for being overly ambitious. The grocery chain is now focusing on relocating smaller stores to bigger nearby locations, banking that it can create flagships that double as dining destinations. “We’ve had tremendous success with those stores,” Mackey said on a recent conference call, citing locations in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. Whole Foods also recently said it was doubling its cost-savings target to $600 million by the end of fiscal 2020, with a plan to invest some of that money in lower prices. The grocer has been dogged by its reputation for being overpriced -- customers gave it the tongue-in-cheek nickname “Whole Paycheck” -- making it tricky to bring in new shoppers.  Lower Prices And while the chain can’t win a price war with the likes of Kroger, Wal-Mart and the German chain Aldi, getting some of its prices more in line with conventional stores is still a key piece of a potential turnaround. Whole Foods can stand out with local cheese and olive oil that can’t be found elsewhere, but it needs to lower prices on standard fare like organic milk, industry analysts say. “That can have a halo effect on the entire store’s pricing,” meaning shoppers will perceive value across the store, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Inmar’s Willard Bishop. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Part of the company’s effort to cut costs includes centralizing much of its buying in Austin, Texas, where its headquarters are located. For years, Whole Foods has relied on a regional system. Buyers in the Northeast, for instance, controlled what products got put on shelves in that market. The strategy allowed Whole Foods to feature artisanal local brands. With the change toward more centralization, the retailer risks losing its reputation as a destination for unique products. “As you start to take away people with knowledge of the market, you lose,” said Tim Sperry, a former Whole Foods executive and industry consultant. Threading Needle Mackey, 63, who took sole control last year after six years of sharing the CEO post with Walter Robb, insists that he can thread the needle: reducing expenses and lowering prices on groceries while keeping his stores on the leading edge of food trends. “We’re not making these changes randomly -- it’s very data driven,” he said in an interview, adding that shoppers will find unique local products at stores, despite the move to centralize operations in Austin. With activist pressure looming, Mackey doesn’t have much time to show signs that he can get the company back on track. “You can’t make these types of changes that quickly,” said Davidson, the industry consultant. “It’s a whole new way of doing business.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Lt. Matt Parish, a spokesman for the Livingston Police Department, said that when the parents showed up to pick the boy up, they appeared to be under the influence of some type of drug. Debbie Nelson, 38, and Kenneth Nelson, 37, of Livingston, were booked into the Polk County on a felony endangering a child charge and a Class B misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance charge. Parish said that the parents gave Livingston PD officers conflicting stories, but the boy told police that his mom went into Walmart to get a Moneygram. The boy said his dad was in the car with him, and when he asked if he could go to the restroom, his dad said yes, and the boy went inside. Parish said the boy’s mother came back out, got in the car, and they drove off. The boy told police that he came out and saw them driving away from the store. At that point, the boy started chasing them, Parish said. Shoppers saw the boy on a median in the parking lot, Parish said and called police. After Livingston police arrived on the scene and talked to the little boy, they tried to call his parents. When they didn’t have any luck contacting them, they brought the boy to the police department and contacted Child Protective Services. Parish said it took the boy’s parents 40 minutes to show up at the police department after they had been called. Debbie and Kenneth Nelson both appeared to be under the influence of some type of drug, Parish said. The officers did a search of their car and found a partially smoked synthetic marijuana cigarette in the ash tray, Parish said. Both people were arrested and taken to the county jail.

Possible Drug Incident Near Huntington Restaurant Across from Hospital Home » News » Musician Pens Lyrics about Huntington's "Hope" IMAGES Musician Pens Lyrics about Huntington's "Hope" IMAGES Wednesday, May 24, 2017 - 00:17 Edited by Tony Rutherford from Multiple Reports Huntington has had a series of high profile  drug sentencing and overdose reports/arrests over the last few days. Among them, the driver of an ice cream truck cited for under the influence of drugs and a needle found in a children's shoe rack at WalMart. A former MU football player has pleaded guilty to heroin distribution from his dorm room, too. The shoe needle raises further precautions for parents who acknowledge this could have been at a playground. Caregivers and parents have new concerns --- they might need to check public playing areas BEFORE allowing their children to play, especially in the hot weather which leans toward uncovered attire such as bare feet, flimsy flip flops, sleeveless shirts and shorts. Freelance writer/musician David Williams, who's also a substance abuse counselor, penned the lyrics for a song chronicling Huntington's drug epidemic , woes, and challenges to overcome. HOPINGTON They busted the ice cream man with heroin last night, And they towed his truck too,  There's pictures on the net taken at Walmart,  Of a syringe inside a pair of shoes, There's addicts dying all over town,  But the Mayor's accepting awards, Arguing over if addiction is a disease we are headed for a social civil war The poison is spreading, patience is thin This is a battle we have to win We have to make our city great again Grace is needed to erase all sin Like Rocky Meadows said,  It's not Moneyton It's Hopington Heroin took Bobby's job and money away It left him with kind of debts a soul can't pay He was found in a ditch on the side of a street They put him in recovery and he got back on his feet He was down  He got up again Grace is needed to erase all sin Let's come together my friends This ain't Moneyton No it's not Moneyton It's Hopington It's Hopington If your looking for help it's not hard to find There's good people happy to share their time If you need a helping hand you can find a friend Because this ain't Moneyton it's Hopington The poison is spreading, patience is thin  This is a battle we must win Got to make our city great again Like Rocky Meadows said This ain't Moneyton It's Hopington Hopington   THE IMAGERY BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE REPEATED RESPONSE OF FIRST RESPONDERS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. LOCATIONS WILL NOT BE IDENTIFIED NO WILL ORIGINAL FB POSTERS. ALL COME FROM DAVID WILLIAM'S PAGE.  Williams added: "the media and recovery workers will embrace King Kool the way they have prostitute Lisa Stone and encourage him to seek recovery. King Kool had a high profile arrest like Stone and public hit rock bottom. The media and recovery personnel were there to help Lisa Stone and I believe she is still recovering in Louisville. It would be great if King Kool could get the same opportunity. Not only could these two get the help they need but also become the face of hope for those addicted in Huntington. Their recoveries could bring much needed inspiration to those thinking about recovery." Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

ON AIR NOW12:00 AM - 5:00 AMCoast to Coast Abandoned barn destroyed in southeast Edmonton fire Caley Ramsay May 23, 2017 04:14 pm WATCH ABOVE: Video of the fire from the Global 1 news helicopter between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday. An abandoned barn was destroyed in a fire in southeast Edmonton on Tuesday afternoon. Firefighters were called to the area of Whitemud Drive and 17 Street, behind a nearby Walmart, at around 4:10 p.m. Video from the Global 1 news helicopter showed firefighters dousing the barn and surrounding grass at around 4:30 p.m. Large plumes of grey smoke filled the air. District chief Terry Krucik said when firefighters arrived, the barn was engulfed in flames and the fire was spreading towards the train tracks. “It was actually at the tracks. The guys were able to get it under control there with the use of our all-terrain pumpers,” he said. “It started in the farm yard and moved toward the tracks. “This is an abandoned farm property. It’s actually scheduled to be demolished. There was no one living there at the time, but there was still active power, gas and septic systems that we had to look out for.” Thirty-two firefighters were involved in battling the blaze, which was brought under control shortly after 5:30 p.m. Krucik said the hot weather was tough on fire crews as the temperature hovered around the 29 C mark at the time. “Our firefighters are more used to cold weather than hot weather, so it took a round out of them,” he said. “All firefighters are checked out by EMS upon exiting the fire and we’ve had no injuries.” Traffic heading east on the Whitemud was moving slowly at around 5 p.m. The cause of the fire is under investigation. This was the scene of a fire on the southeast side of the city at around 4:40. Crews still on-scene fighting the blaze. @GlobalEdmonton pic.twitter.com/CR0rHOyPTr — Lauren Fink (@LaurenFink_) May 23, 2017 Kirby Bourne Trending More Latest More Vancouver Traffic Tweets by @AM730Traffic Current Traffic Incidents You May Also Like More News New report envisions big changes for future of Granville Island 2 hours ago We're getting a closer look at the possible long-term future of Vancouver's Granville Island.

The publisher hopes that Drummond’s popular cooking show and her blog — which snags 23 million page views per month — translates into a magazine success story. It is the second test issue to launch from Hearst in recent weeks. The test launch of the travel title Airbnbmag hit this week. Joint ventures hold down launch costs, but TV success is not an automatic pass to success. Dr. Oz The Good Life moved to 950,000 circulation at 10 times a year at the start of the year, but poor ad support caused the company to cut back to a quarterly “bookazine” earlier this month. Vicki Wellington, who is also publisher of Food Network Magazine as well as Pioneer Woman, says of Drummond: “She never wrote a business plan on how to be a success. She’s basically been operating from the heart.” In her first meeting at the Hearst Tower in September, Drummond wore cowboy boots, Wellington said. Drummond married Ladd Drummond and moved to his sprawling Oklahoma ranch when she began doing a mom blog on cooking, country life and family in 2006 that soon gained a national following. Her blog eventually turned into a guest appearance on Bobby Flay’s cooking show and eventually her own Food Network show and a bestselling cook book. Wellington said the first test issue has 35 ad pages. “It sold out very quickly,” she said. “I had to turn people away.” The company is only distributing 150,000 copies of the first issue. The second test issue, scheduled for September, will broaden out beyond the Walmart chain, said Wellington.

It doesn’t end well. Sarah Taylor 7 hours An angry white woman goes off on a racial rant against a Latina woman and a black woman. (Image Source: Twitter Video screenshot) 86 Follow Share Tweet A video of an unnamed, angry white Walmart shopper — reportedly from Centerton, Ark. — using racial epithets directed at both black and Latino women went viral after it was shared Monday on Facbeook. Eva Hicks, the Latina woman accosted by the white woman, was looking for medicine and reportedly asked the white woman to move out of her way, politely saying, “Excuse me.” The white woman in the video began shouting at Hicks to “go back to where you came from” and suggested that the Latina woman “leave America.” A black woman intervened, and the white woman advised the black woman to “stay out of it.” The unidentified black woman told the white woman that she wanted the white woman to “stop being ignorant,” and then things got even uglier. “A n****r’s calling me ignorant?” the white woman asked, and turned her attentions back to Hicks, who she once again told to leave the country. “This is my country!” the white woman continued to yell until management stepped in. “We don’t want you here!” she added. When the store manager intervened, he advised the white woman that Hicks had every right to be there and asked the white woman to vacate the premises. Sharing the video on her Facebook, Hicks wrote, “I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country.” A spokesperson for Walmart tweeted on Tuesday that they do not condone racial or discriminatory behavior in any way, shape or form. Walmart’s statement read: “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” Share Tweet 86 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends to TheBlaze!

When it comes to government policies interfering with market prices, the GOP has loudly denounced everything from caps on oil prices that caused the gas lines during the Carter administration to the numerous ObamaCare price controls producing disastrous results. They have argued correctly that price controls always result in product shortages and other negative results for consumers. Given this history, House GOP members should be rushing to repeal a price control measure sponsored by Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinThe GOP must fight against the Durbin amendment's price controls It’s time to rethink prisoner re-entry Congress urges Trump administration to release public transit funding MORE (D-Ill.) back when he was Senate Majority Whip. The Durbin amendment of the infamous 2010 Dodd-Frank financial “reform” law slapped price controls on the fees that banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Now, debit card issuers must charge prices the Federal Reserve defines as “reasonable and proportional to the cost.” ADVERTISEMENT On top of that, costs that these fees can cover are only “incremental costs,” a definition that leaves out most fixed costs like computer hardware and software used to process the card transactions. Not only are banks and credit unions forbidden to make a profit on the debit card fees they charge to retailers, they can’t even cover all their costs. Talk about picking winner and losers.   In the House, Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is spearheading a plan, the Financial Choice Act, which repeals these price controls as well as other provisions in Dodd-Frank that are harmful to community banks, credit unions, and consumers. Earlier this month, Hensarling’s committee voted to approve the bill, but some GOP lawmakers are reportedly trying to drop the Durbin repeal provision from the bill before it comes to a House floor for a vote. Why? Well, it may have something to do with strong lobbying from multibillion-dollar corporations lobbying hard to keep getting ill-gotten gains from Durbin Amendment price controls. Big retailers like Walmart and Home Depot have reaped a windfall from not having to pay the full cost of processing debit card purchases. The Electronic Payments Coalition, a group representing payment card networks, banks, and credit unions of all sizes, calculates from Federal Reserve data that retailers have taken in $42 billion from the Durbin amendment. A Home Depot executive bragged on a stock analysts’ conference call that price controls could add up to $35 million per year to the chain’s bottom line. If the Durbin amendment explicitly bars banks and credit unions from recouping the full cost of a debit card transaction from a retailers, who pays these costs? Consumers. The costs have been shifted to them in the form of reduced benefits, like free checking, and higher fees at their banks and credit unions. In 2009, the year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, 76 percent of checking accounts were free of charge. By 2011, this share had fallen to 45 percent, and by 2012 to 39 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Service charges on non-interest bearing checking accounts have also increased dramatically. A 2014 George Mason University study calculates that the Durbin Amendment contributed to 1 million Americans losing access to the banking system — becoming “unbanked” — by 2011. And the savings on retail goods and services that retailers said would be passed on to consumers turned out to be miniscule or nonexistent. Even accounting for some lower prices in highly competitive markets, the public still suffered a net welfare loss of $22 to $25 billion — the amount lost (in free checking and imposition of new bank fees) that exceeded any gains from lower retail prices — according to a 2015 study published in the Oxford Review of Law & Economics. Smaller retailers are also losing out from the Durbin amendment. They often make purchases with debit cards and checking accounts, in addition to accepting them as forms of payments. So they have been losing their free checking, just as consumers have, and business debit card rewards. If the Durbin amendment’s price controls stay in effect, eventually everyone will lose out. Price controls are notorious for choking off innovation, which could otherwise make payment processing better and cheaper. Only so many costs can be transferred to consumers, and both the quantity and quality of services from financial institutions in debit card processing may suffer from lack of investment. The results for retailers could be lost sales and a dearth of technology to fight the ever-increasing hazard of security breaches. Shortages are an outcome of all price controls that act as price ceilings, as these do. As the great free-market economist Thomas Sowell writes in his book Basic Economics, price ceilings mean “less is supplied at a lower price than at a higher price — less both quantitatively and qualitatively.” As the House moves forward with the Financial Choice Act, now is the time for Republicans to remember first principles and fight these price controls, just like they fought ObamaCare price controls. As conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote shortly after Dodd-Frank and the Durbin amendment were enacted, “Standing idly by is an endorsement of Obama administration price controls and Dick Durbin’s leadership. It is also an abdication of conservative principles and responsibility." John Berlau is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

The fired McDonald’s manager who successfully sued after she was told she’d have to take a humiliating demotion or lose her job had reason to smile. On Tuesday, Ontario’s highest court upheld a ruling by an Ottawa judge finding that the 67-year-old grandmother had been “set up to fail” and was constructively dismissed after more than 25 years working at McDonald’s restaurants in Ottawa and Newfoundland. The court of appeal also found no reason to alter the judge’s decision to order McDonald’s to pay Brake $104.499.33 — plus interest and costs — to make up for the lack of notice and damages she suffered as a result. That’s on top of the additional $120,000 the company that manages the restaurant has been ordered to pay to cover Brake’s legal costs. “I’m on top of the world,” said Brake Tuesday. “It means everything to me. I’m very, very happy that the courts took the time to listen to an individual who took a company like McDonald’s on, and we won.” Brake said she hopes the appeal court’s decision will finally end the legal saga that began in 2012 after she was told she’d have to take a demotion to first assistant or be fired. The demotion didn’t involve a reduced salary, but would require Brake to report to a much younger manager she herself had trained, along with a significant loss in benefits. The ultimatum came after Brake received her first negative performance review in November 2011 after a decade of positive assessments, court heard. Following that negative review, she was transferred from the restaurant she managed on Hazeldean Road to one of the worst performing McDonald’s in the country, located in the back corner of a Walmart store at the Kanata Centrum. The judge found Brake was then put on a disciplinary program and subjected to performance standards that were arbitrary and unfair. Brake testified she worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for five months. Brake achieved what the court described as “outstanding” scores compared with McDonald’s own corporate standards in customer service and quality and cleanliness, but just narrowly missed a third goal. Brake was told she had failed the program and would have to take the demotion or leave. After leaving McDonald’s, she tried to find other management jobs, but got no offers. Attempts to set up a babysitting service and work as a cleaner also failed. Eventually she took a job with Tim Hortons, and later Home Depot as a cashier. Brake said she is looking forward to her former employer finally paying up. But Brake doesn’t have any intention of quitting her current job — she had to dip into her retirement savings to survive after she left McDonald’s. “I haven’t got anything yet,” said Brake. “Yes, it’s a lot of money but at the end of the day I have to watch every cent to keep on living.” The owners of the McDonald’s franchise could still try to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the test for cases is stringent. Only a small percentage of cases are ever heard by the country’s top court. A lawyer representing the McDonald’s franchise didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday. “My gut tells me this is over,” said Brake’s lawyer, Miriam Vale Peters. “Five years later she’ll see her money. That’s the reality of Esther Brake.” Vale Peters said she never expected the case to drag on as long as it has. “This is a case that I never thought would go this far,” she said. “In my experience, 99 cases out of 100 settle. I’m surprised, and I continued to be surprised up until the day I was to be in court, that we were still there.” The court noted in an earlier decision that the judgments in the case could have been avoided if the McDonald’s offers to settle weren’t so “woefully inadequate.” Brake said people have come up to her in the Home Depot store where she works now and told her they were proud of her for taking McDonald’s to court. Brake said she feels vindicated by the decisions from the two courts. “The first thing I would tell anybody is, if they feel they are being treated unfairly — it’s a tough battle, I’m not saying it’s an easy battle — I tell them, ‘Go for it. Don’t hold back. Go for it.’ If you tell the truth, you could win.” aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour Videos Trump Will Get A Private Lawyer To Handle Russia Investigations Stephen Colbert Won't Face Discipline For His Foul-Mouthed Trump Joke 'No Fun League' No Longer: NFL Cuts Some Celebration Penalties Blue Whales Weren't Always The Giants They Are Today Part Of The Philippines Is Now Under Martial Law Slain College Student Honored At What Would've Been His Graduation 2017 05 23 Dickenson Russia Probe Mounts: 3 Intelligence Directors Testify Before Congress NFL Hall Of Fame Defensive Tackle Cortez Kennedy Has Died At 48 Here's Just How Many Displaced People There Were In 2016 The Eastern Black Rhinoceros Has Officially Returned To Rwanda Trump's Budget Proposal Is Based On Some Pretty Optimistic Assumptions Previous Next More Videos Photos Google I/O 2017 Conference Flooding in Quebec Tornadoes leave death, devastation in Texas Crane climber in Toronto rescued Paddlers get creative for Float Your Fanny Down the Ganny Samsung unveils new phones, camera Fire at former Ont. biker clubhouse Check out Canada's most expensive homes Donald Trump greets White House tourists Mansion or fixer-upper?

Hancock County investigators say 25-year-old Mykiea Miller is dressing up as a female and using stolen credit cards and identifications taken from residents’ homes throughout the county. The suspect is believed to put money on gift cards from the stolen credit cards, then open up a layaway, go to a different Walmart and try to return the layaway items for cash. When authorities first reviewed surveillance they thought the suspect was female, but he ended up giving away his identity. Hancock County Sheriff’s Department Criminal Investigator Anthony Gambino said, “They provided a name to the Walmart to open the layaway and since they do not require ID to open up a layaway, we believed at first it to be fictitious. Throughout our investigation we were able to 100 percent identify this person as the person who opened the layaway.” Investigators say during one of the burglaries the suspect stole a gun and could be armed and dangerous. If you know where Miller is you are urged to contact the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department at 228-466-6900. View (…) comments Most popular No degree. No skills.

(AP) — Michigan lawmakers are looking to help create policies for body camera footage obtained by law enforcement officers, including how to maintain and handle the recordings. The Republican-dominated state House unanimously passed legislation Tuesday that would require police departments to develop written policies on using body cameras. The bill also would exempt some footage from being obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests. Republican state Rep. Jim Runestad of White Lake, who is sponsoring the bill, said he could not believe some of the testimony he heard about officers having to go to the local Wal-Mart to buy their own cameras and then tossing their footage into a box at work. Latest news videos "It was the wild, wild West so there was absolutely the need for this kind of bill. That's why you saw unanimous support across the board," Runestad said. Lisa McGraw, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Press Association, took issue with the portion about exempting some footage. She said if an officer is shown acting inappropriately, that footage should not be held back. Runestad said the bill calls for most footage to be requested under the Freedom of Information Act and that only in certain sensitive situations will it not be released. "You can't have a situation — and the state of Michigan, the people are not gonna tolerate — where you have a slip and fall in your bathroom and they capture you naked on the floor and people want to make a blooper show out of that," Runestad said. He added that he knows there have been times when people have posted such footage on YouTube for people to watch and make fun of whoever is in the video. Moving the bill "one word, one inch" another way would have collapsed the support for it, Runestad said. The bill now goes to the Michigan Senate, which is also led by Republicans.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman May 1 – 7: Bristol’s Weekly Traffic Alert BRISTOL – In an effort to keep motorists informed, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) provides weekly information about highway construction and maintenance projects in southwestern Virginia. When traveling through highway work zones, use caution and be alert to changes in traffic patterns and slow-moving or stopped traffic.   To help motorists take the guesswork out of travel plans, call VDOT’s 511 or visit http://www.511Virginia.org/ for real-time traffic information.   Underlined entries with asterisks (***) indicate the listing is new or the status of the project has changed since last week’s traffic alert.     INTERSTATE PROJECTS ***Interstate 81 – Exit 14:  Work is underway to reconstruct Interstate 81 exit 14 to better accommodate traffic volumes and to replace the north and southbound interstate 81 bridges at exit 14. During the week of May 1, be alert to flagging and heavy equipment along Old Jonesboro Road and Dennison due to bridge and grading work.  (Completion: fall 2018) ***I-81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road: Replacement of the Interstate 81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road near exit 10 in Washington County is underway.

During the incident that started Monday night, minutes before midnight, deputies were called to the Walmart in York where they encountered Robert Miltson Williamson outside the store. Williamson, 29, of Hickory, N.C., was wearing a University of South Carolina polo shirt with the tag still on it, the officer reported, and in his hands were an open box of cupcakes and a cellphone. “Williamson stated he was cold so he put the short sleeve shirt over his tee shirt,” the report states. “He stated he was hungry and ate some of the cupcakes, and he needed to call someone and no one would let him use the phone.” Williamson, who was outside the store with the items and no money to pay for them, told the deputies he “did not steal anything,” the report says. “He also stated he did not shoplift as he did not conceal any of the items,” the report states. The deputy told him “Three of the cupcakes were concealed in his stomach.” Williamson was charged with shoplifting the box of cupcakes, cell phone and polo shirt, according to the report. He remained in the York County jail, records show.

The Pittsburgh Foundation is narrowing the focus of its former Day of Giving fundraiser to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties that directly support people with needs in five areas. The foundation said this year's Critical Needs Alert event begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will last 16 hours. “The shift (from a general fundraising event) aims to support the safety net for basic needs and respond to the needs of our community,” said Kelly Uranker, the Pittsburgh Foundation's director of the Center for Philanthropy. “We want everyone to benefit from the prosperity that has occurred in the region over the last couple years,” Uranker said. In the past, the former Day of Giving event benefited a wider array of nonprofits across the region. The Pittsburgh Foundation was forced to reschedule last year's event after a glitch with its online fundraising platform caused problems about 10 hours into the daylong campaign. More than 820 nonprofits participated in the rescheduled event last September. The Critical Needs Alert event will support organizations that help people with needs related to child care, food and nutrition, physical and mental health, housing and transportation. Participating organizations include family health care centers, local YMCAs, women's centers, soup kitchens and transportation-service organizations such as the Braddock-based Heritage Community Initiatives. Uranker said the new event aligns with the foundation's “100 Percent Pittsburgh” principle, which aims to support the one-third of the region's population that falls below the poverty line and allows them to benefit from the region's improving economy. Mt. Ararat Community Activity Center, one of this year's participating nonprofits, helps provide childcare to children up to age 5. The center hopes to use money they receive from this year's fundraiser to open a larger childcare facility. “We hope that by moving to a larger facility, we will eliminate our waiting list and provide childcare to others in the community, beyond our own waiting list,” said Denise Williams, Mt. Ararat's executive director. “The funding we will gain from this Critical Needs Alert will be extremely beneficial as these are critical years for our children.” The Pittsburgh Foundation has allocated up to $657,000 to match funds raised by the participating foundations. For example, if all the groups collected a combined $600,000, the matching funds would bring the total amount raised to $1.2 million. To donate, people should visit PittsburghGives.org between 8 a.m. and midnight Tuesday. There is a minimum donation of $25. Emma Curtis is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Stephanie Kuo / KERA News View Slideshow 2 of 3 Stephanie Kuo / KERA News View Slideshow 3 of 3 Stephanie Kuo / KERA News To help address youth unemployment in North Texas,  several companies recently gathered at the first-ever Dallas Opportunity Fair, a day-long hiring event to help local 16- to 24-year-olds find jobs. Listen Listening... / 4:53 The KERA Radio story. Who are the disconnected? Thirteen percent of young people in Dallas-Forth Worth are what social scientists call the “disconnected.” “This would be young adults, who have graduated or not graduated high school, who have moved into a job maybe once, but not stuck, with no career path,” said Laurie Larrea, president of Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas. “And they tend to fall into a group of ‘what else can I do?’ They lose hope and they fall away.” Young parents, folks with criminal records, people buried in debt and living in poverty: Larrea said any combination of these factors are barriers to finding stable employment. Move into neighborhoods like South Dallas and Oak Cliff, and the number of disconnected youth goes up to one in four. In West Dallas, it’s as high as 34 percent. In contrast, the lowest rate of disconnection in all of North Texas is just 6 percent – in West Plano. That’s according to data from Measure of America, a project from the Social Science Research Council. The highest rate of youth disconnection in North Texas is in West Dallas and the Fair Park area. The lowest is in West Plano. Credit Measure of America Larrea said Dallas as a whole has a robust economy. But she says too often, pockets get ignored. “That doesn’t say that every community participates equally and is seeing that same bounce from the economy. How long do you ride a wave like this?” she said. “We need these kids. We need them in the pipeline. Employers need them. Our economy needs them.” Connecting the disconnected That’s why at the first-ever Dallas Opportunity Fair, more than 30 national employers were prepared to offer 1,700 jobs on the spot. It was billed as one of the largest youth job fairs in state history. Large retailers like JCPenney, Five Guys, Walmart and even Sprinkles cupcakes set up stalls at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in downtown. The ambience was more county fair than job fair. It felt like a place not to be bogged down by the stresses of work. There was a Starbucks station teaching aspiring baristas the art of a latte. Macy’s employees showed folks how to tie a tie, and LinkedIn took free headshots and helped create online profiles. There were also application and resume-building stations, as well as practice interviews. A practice interview station helped prep applicants with tips: what questions to ask and words to never use. Credit Stephanie Kuo “These young people arrive, often having been told that they are not ready to work and that they’re not even hirable. We reject that,” said John Kelly, senior vice president of global social impact and public policy for Starbucks. The coffee company leads the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, which is a national coalition of employers and social service organizations, dedicated to eliminating youth unemployment around the country. The group put on this fair in Dallas and previously hosted events in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Seattle.   “This isn’t a career fair. This is literally a job fair, where they go in and they interview, and many of them will walk out with one or two job offers,” Kelly said. “And that’s transformative to a kid or a young person who has been told they’re not hirable.” Getting a job is not enough Javion Darrell Roshyne Brandon is 16 years old and is really just starting out in life. “I love working. I like helping people, and money. I love money,” he said. "I’d do anything it takes to get a job.” Brandon started off working on a chicken farm when he was just 13, but this will be his first time tackling a more corporate gig. “I had butterflies in my stomach. I ain’t gonna lie,” he said. “It was my first time doing any kind of interview. I learned a lot of things: how to sit down and talk to people, what questions to ask and how was I supposed to approach myself.” For 17-year-old Diamond Robinson, finding a job in her neighborhood in South Dallas is tough. The area hasn’t seen much development or job opportunities. An inspiration wall at the job fair allowed attendees to post their dreams and ambitions. Credit Stephanie Kuo / KERA News “It’s kind of messed up. You have to go out of the way, and sometimes you don’t want to go out of the way just to work,” she said. “But you have to provide, so you have to do what you have to do.” Robinson can’t drive, and she worries about hours-long commutes by bus. She also has a 2-year-old daughter – so before she can even work, she needs to find childcare she can afford. Robinson shares that problem with many. Dallas’ teen pregnancy rate is 50 percent above the national average – and it has the highest rate of repeat pregnancies in the country. That’s a huge barrier to finding work. Starbucks’s John Kelly said he knows just getting a job isn’t enough. “We want them to be successful, so the employers are working with community groups to identify some of those practices that employers are going to have to do differently, such as providing transportation.” Many local nonprofits provide bus passes or vanpools already, but Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said there’s a way to do more. “We’re working with DART on how we can provide greater transportation. I met with the CEO of Uber, and we’re going to talk about different test markets to get people to jobs,” he said. “There are certain parts of Southern Dallas that don’t have retail capabilities, and we’ve put a lot of money out there as a city council to attract retailers.” Rawlings said the city also needs to better connect young people to programs that can help with building life skills – like how to cash a check or open a bank account. Helping them attain enough academic proficiency to understand complicated application and tax forms is also a priority. An economy for everyone Until then, many of the opportunity fair’s attendees are grateful to have a job at all. Each new hire was met with bells and cheers. Tekeyh Harris got an offer from Macy’s. “I’m feeling really excited,” she said, giggling. Meshi Scott got three jobs and was leaning toward accepting the one from Five Guys. “I didn’t think I was going to leave with a job today, but I did, so I’m excited,” she said. “I mean, I’ve been struggling to find a job. It’s been hard. I just had a baby so, I’m just ready to work.” With a push from the Opportunity Fair, Dallas inches closer to its goal: an economy where there’s a place for everyone.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    AutoZone Inc. reported profit and sales that missed analyst estimates as the seller of car replacement parts joined a chorus of retailers saying U.S. tax refund delays squelched demand early this year. Net income excluding some items was $11.44 per share during the third quarter ended May 6, trailing the low end of 25 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales for stores open at least one year declined 0.8 percent, also missing projections. AutoZone joins retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Foot Locker Inc. in saying customers curbed spending while waiting on tax refunds. Legislation passed in 2015 aimed at preventing fraud may have postponed funds being remitted to 25 million to 30 million U.S. households this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists wrote in February. “For whatever reason, we don’t quite understand, those refund dollars never seemed to show up,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Rhodes said on a call with analysts. “It has been such a big driver of industry sales, and it just went away.” Capital expenditures at AutoZone’s “mega hub” stores and wage increases fueled by low unemployment also pushed up costs, while a second consecutive mild winter hurt demand for some products, Rhodes said. “What we have experienced over a two-year period of time in the Northeast, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic is alarming,” he said. “It has to do with what’s going on with the weather pattern; we can see it in specific categories that are very related to snow, ice and potholes.” Shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based AutoZone plunged as much as 9.4 percent to $597.45 as of 2:10 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday drop since November 2008. The stock fell 16 percent this year through the close Monday, trailing the 6.9 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. Other auto parts and repair chains also declined, including Advance Auto Parts Inc., O’Reilly Automotive Inc. and Monro Muffler Brake Inc. “While the sales slowdown in the industry in February and March was well publicized, it seems the company was in a bigger hole than we had anticipated,” Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, wrote in a report Tuesday. “Sales did pick up in April and early May, but not enough to make up for the early quarter shortfall.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

In yet another example of how racism still plagues our country, a video of a white woman hurling racial slurs at a Latina shopper at Walmart has now gone viral. In the clip, the rude woman was triggered after Eva Hicks politely asked her to move her cart so she could get to the medicine she was shopping for. Related: Trump Supporter Holds Up Flight Trying To Become The Next United Airlines Victim As she was yelling at Hicks to "go back to where you came from" and to "leave America," a black shopper intervened to tell the hysterical woman to "stop being ignorant" — to which the white woman responded: "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" Ugh. So fucking disgusting. Hicks posted a video of the gross confrontation on her Facebook with the caption: "I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Yes me. Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country. Friends please share." You can watch the interaction (below): Disgraceful!

While her team is undecided about whether the star will suspend the rest of her tour (despite previous contradictory reports), Ari and her crew are focusing on the victims and less about upcoming shows like Thursday's O2 arena show, according to Billboard's sources. As we previously reported, the singer tweeted feeling "broken" about the horrific and deadly attack at her concert on Monday night. We can't even imagine what she or any of the others affected by this tragedy have been going through.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, May 24, 2017 Corporations are cheering a U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting where they can be sued for patent infringement, but some intellectual property lawyers say loopholes in the ruling likely mean lawsuits will continue to be filed in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions. The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that patent infringement cases can only be heard in a court either where the defendant is headquartered or where an act of infringement has occurred and the defendant has a "regular and established place of business." Legal experts said a sale of a product was sufficient as an act of infringement and the definition of a regular and established place of business was broad enough that companies could probably still be sued in a jurisdiction if they had stores, warehouses or even remote employees there. "I saw a lot of anti-patent people doing a victory dance yesterday without really understanding what this decision means," said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor Group, a Texas-based company that buys patents and seeks to license them to other companies. Technology companies in particular had sought Monday's ruling as a means of combating plaintiffs, including patent holding firms often derided as "trolls." According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 percent of all patent lawsuits in fiscal year 2016 were filed in the largely rural Eastern District of Texas, which borders but does not include Dallas, home to several Fortune 500 companies. Monday's ruling came in a lawsuit Kraft Heinz Co <KHC.O> brought against the beverage flavoring company TC Heartland LLC. Though the case involved a beverage sweetening technology, it attracted the attention of Dell Inc, HP Inc, Adobe Systems Inc <ADBE.O>, SAP America Inc <SAPG.DE>, Wal-Mart <WMT.N> and other companies, as well as the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable, all of whom filed briefs supporting the defendant. Defendants claim procedural rules favor plaintiffs and the district's judges rarely dismiss cases before trial, making litigation there expensive and increasing the pressure to settle. "The overall effect of the ruling will be to limit cases in the district," said Q. Todd Dickinson, the former director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office now in private practice at the law firm Polsinelli. "But it's not a panacea. There are ways to get around it." The Supreme Court's "regular and established place of business" could be as simple as a retail store, said Michael Smith, a patent lawyer with Siebman, Burg, Phillips & Smith in Marshall, Texas who often represents defendants. He noted Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, a frequent target for East Texas patent lawsuits, has stores in Plano and Frisco, two Dallas suburbs that fall within the district. Distribution or call centers might also qualify, said Pridham, and there are court decisions suggesting even companies with only remote employees in East Texas could still be sued for patent infringement there. Several lawyers said they expected plaintiffs to also begin suing independent retail companies who merely sell allegedly infringing products. If that were to happen, the product makers would almost certainly have to indemnify their retailers, said Paul Janicke, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Smith said he expected plaintiffs to try to add retailers as defendants to more than 1,000 pending cases in the hopes of keeping them in the district. "What this ruling does is put a target on the back of every retailer operating in the Eastern District of Texas," he said. Dickinson said a wave of lawsuits against retailers could prompt Congress to enact legislation shielding them from patent lawsuits relating to products they do not manufacture. There are other potential loopholes unrelated to the "place of business" language. Matthew Rizzolo, an IP lawyer with Ropes & Gray who represents both plaintiffs and defendants, noted Monday's decision did not address either foreign companies or limited liability companies, leaving both still potentially vulnerable to lawsuits in the Eastern District. "Now you are going to see a lot of fights over those issues," he said.

The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that patent infringement cases can only be heard in a court either where the defendant is headquartered or where an act of infringement has occurred and the defendant has a "regular and established place of business." Legal experts said a sale of a product was sufficient as an act of infringement and the definition of a regular and established place of business was broad enough that companies could probably still be sued in a jurisdiction if they had stores, warehouses or even remote employees there. "I saw a lot of anti-patent people doing a victory dance yesterday without really understanding what this decision means," said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor Group, a Texas-based company that buys patents and seeks to license them to other companies. Technology companies in particular had sought Monday's ruling as a means of combating plaintiffs, including patent holding firms often derided as "trolls." According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 percent of all patent lawsuits in fiscal year 2016 were filed in the largely rural Eastern District of Texas, which borders but does not include Dallas, home to several Fortune 500 companies. Monday's ruling came in a lawsuit Kraft Heinz Co brought against the beverage flavoring company TC Heartland LLC. Though the case involved a beverage sweetening technology, it attracted the attention of Dell Inc, HP Inc, Adobe Systems Inc , SAP America Inc, Wal-Mart and other companies, as well as the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable, all of whom filed briefs supporting the defendant. Defendants claim procedural rules favor plaintiffs and the district's judges rarely dismiss cases before trial, making litigation there expensive and increasing the pressure to settle. "The overall effect of the ruling will be to limit cases in the district," said Q. Todd Dickinson, the former director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office now in private practice at the law firm Polsinelli. "But it's not a panacea. There are ways to get around it." The Supreme Court's "regular and established place of business" could be as simple as a retail store, said Michael Smith, a patent lawyer with Siebman, Burg, Phillips & Smith in Marshall, Texas who often represents defendants. He noted Apple Inc, a frequent target for East Texas patent lawsuits, has stores in Plano and Frisco, two Dallas suburbs that fall within the district. Distribution or call centers might also qualify, said Pridham, and there are court decisions suggesting even companies with only remote employees in East Texas could still be sued for patent infringement there. Several lawyers said they expected plaintiffs to also begin suing independent retail companies who merely sell allegedly infringing products. If that were to happen, the product makers would almost certainly have to indemnify their retailers, said Paul Janicke, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Smith said he expected plaintiffs to try to add retailers as defendants to more than 1,000 pending cases in the hopes of keeping them in the district. "What this ruling does is put a target on the back of every retailer operating in the Eastern District of Texas," he said. Dickinson said a wave of lawsuits against retailers could prompt Congress to enact legislation shielding them from patent lawsuits relating to products they do not manufacture. There are other potential loopholes unrelated to the "place of business" language. Matthew Rizzolo, an IP lawyer with Ropes & Gray who represents both plaintiffs and defendants, noted Monday's decision did not address either foreign companies or limited liability companies, leaving both still potentially vulnerable to lawsuits in the Eastern District. "Now you are going to see a lot of fights over those issues," he said.

The victim, 31, told Peoria police he had gone to Walmart in East Peoria and then taken the bus back to Peoria after buying a weed trimmer and a TV. When he got off the bus shortly before 11 a.m. in the 400 block of Evans Street, he went into a store to get something to drink and then started to walk to a house in the 1000 block of Northeast Monroe Street.  A person who looked like a teenager then approached him and asked if he wanted to sell the TV, before spraying him in the face with what the victim thought was pepper spray. The teen and another person then took the weed trimmer and the TV and left in a van. The victim told police he didn't get a good look at his assailants.    About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services My Profile Advertise With Us Customer Service Newspaper in Education Internships Contact Us Market Place Shop Cars Homes Free Classifieds Ad Classifieds Community Info Community Served About us Historic Headlines Peoria History Forms Anniversaries Births Engagements Weddings 100th Birthday Jobs in Peoria Pets Place a Classified Ad Real Estate Rentals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

If you don't know how to perform hands-only CPR, now's your chance to learn. Kylee Cruz gave us a demo with the paramedics from American Medical Response. When bystanders perform compression-only CPR until Emergency Medical Services (EMS) crews arrive, they can triple a sudden cardiac arrest victims's chance of survival. From May 21-27, 2017, American Medical Response (AMR), the nation’s largest provider of emergency medical services and medical transportation, will team up with the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) for one of the largest CPR trainings in history. The fifth annual World CPR Challenge will aim to train 1 million people to save lives by performing compression-only CPR. With more than 350,000 Americans experiencing sudden cardiac arrest annually, AMR wants to make sure bystanders are trained and ready to assist. In compression-only CPR, hard, fast and rhythmic chest compressions allow oxygenated blood to flow through the body, keeping the brain and other essential organs alive until first responders arrive and can restart the heart. It only takes five minutes to learn this life-saving technique. The free lessons -- open to the public at select locations -- are a part of AMR’s 2017 World CPR Challenge. Community members in all groups are encouraged to learn how to recognize the signs of sudden cardiac arrest and perform compression-only CPR. Since kicking off the annual World CPR Challenge in 2013, AMR has seen bystander CPR double from 21 to 41 percent. This year, the International Association of Fire Chiefs and the American College of Emergency Physicians are joining the nationwide initiative to train one million people in bystander CPR. Compression-only CPR classes are offered during National EMS Week on the following dates.

Ellen Langas Enactus Business May 23, 2017 2:59 PM Enactus teams show entrepreneurial chops at the Kansas City Convention Center By Diane Stafford stafford@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story One of the nation’s premier showcases for student talent has filled the Kansas City Convention Center this week with the Enactus United States National Exposition. Over two days of competitive presentations, about 2,700 students representing about 100 colleges and universities have tried to convince judges that they have the best ideas for entrepreneurial projects that could lead to business innovation while also producing meaningful social impact. In exchange for the hours of on-campus preparation, Enactus participants also got direct access to hirers at an exclusive career fair. Hallmark Cards, Wal-Mart Stores, The Hershey Co., Bimbo Bakeries, Post Consumer Brands, Schwan’s Food, Robert Half, Synchrony Financial and Unilever were among employers who attended the Monday and Tuesday event, with some of them suggesting they were prepared to hire on the spot. “We’re finding that new college graduates are entering a healthy job market, but competition is fierce, with many entry-level professionals applying for the same job,” said Paul McDonald, senior executive director with Robert Half. “The management and real-world work experience students acquire through Enactus provides a significant advantage.” McDonald cited initiative, a focus on results, community contributions and project experience as assets that Enactus students bring to the table. “These students are uniquely prepared for future success,” said David Hall, president of Hallmark Cards. “They are socially conscious, business savvy and embody the entrepreneurial spirit. That is a combination you don’t find in every college student, and that’s what makes them so attractive to a company like Hallmark.” Enactus, formerly known as Students in Free Enterprise, is an organization that encourages university teams to devise “real-world” projects, always with the eye of improving livelihoods. Each team had to prepare multimedia presentations that were evaluated by judging panels of business, social service and academic leaders. The winners take home $10,000 in prize money and the chance to go on to the international competition, this year set for September in London. On Tuesday night, the student team from John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Ark., was declared the winner and named the 2017 Enactus United States National Champion. Local teams from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Kansas City Kansas Community College were among participants. Visit KC estimated an economic impact of $2.6 million from the 2017 convention. Enactus has committed to return to Kansas City for its 2018 and 2019 expositions.

The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that patent infringement cases can only be heard in a court either where the defendant is headquartered or where an act of infringement has occurred and the defendant has a "regular and established place of business." Legal experts said a sale of a product was sufficient as an act of infringement and the definition of a regular and established place of business was broad enough that companies could probably still be sued in a jurisdiction if they had stores, warehouses or even remote employees there. "I saw a lot of anti-patent people doing a victory dance yesterday without really understanding what this decision means," said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor Group, a Texas-based company that buys patents and seeks to license them to other companies. Technology companies in particular had sought Monday's ruling as a means of combating plaintiffs, including patent holding firms often derided as "trolls." According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 percent of all patent lawsuits in fiscal year 2016 were filed in the largely rural Eastern District of Texas, which borders but does not include Dallas, home to several Fortune 500 companies. Monday's ruling came in a lawsuit Kraft Heinz Co brought against the beverage flavoring company TC Heartland LLC. Though the case involved a beverage sweetening technology, it attracted the attention of Dell Inc, HP Inc, Adobe Systems Inc , SAP America Inc, Wal-Mart and other companies, as well as the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable, all of whom filed briefs supporting the defendant. Defendants claim procedural rules favor plaintiffs and the district's judges rarely dismiss cases before trial, making litigation there expensive and increasing the pressure to settle. "The overall effect of the ruling will be to limit cases in the district," said Q. Todd Dickinson, the former director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office now in private practice at the law firm Polsinelli. "But it's not a panacea. There are ways to get around it." The Supreme Court's "regular and established place of business" could be as simple as a retail store, said Michael Smith, a patent lawyer with Siebman, Burg, Phillips & Smith in Marshall, Texas who often represents defendants. He noted Apple Inc, a frequent target for East Texas patent lawsuits, has stores in Plano and Frisco, two Dallas suburbs that fall within the district. Distribution or call centers might also qualify, said Pridham, and there are court decisions suggesting even companies with only remote employees in East Texas could still be sued for patent infringement there. Several lawyers said they expected plaintiffs to also begin suing independent retail companies who merely sell allegedly infringing products. If that were to happen, the product makers would almost certainly have to indemnify their retailers, said Paul Janicke, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Smith said he expected plaintiffs to try to add retailers as defendants to more than 1,000 pending cases in the hopes of keeping them in the district. "What this ruling does is put a target on the back of every retailer operating in the Eastern District of Texas," he said. Dickinson said a wave of lawsuits against retailers could prompt Congress to enact legislation shielding them from patent lawsuits relating to products they do not manufacture. There are other potential loopholes unrelated to the "place of business" language. Matthew Rizzolo, an IP lawyer with Ropes & Gray who represents both plaintiffs and defendants, noted Monday's decision did not address either foreign companies or limited liability companies, leaving both still potentially vulnerable to lawsuits in the Eastern District. "Now you are going to see a lot of fights over those issues," he said. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

News Local news Breaking News Testimony: Nonprofit head spent state grant money on personal expenses Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune Franshuan Myles, photographed Aug. 4, 2016, at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago, is now on trial after being accused of using state grant money for a personal spending spree. Franshuan Myles, photographed Aug. 4, 2016, at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago, is now on trial after being accused of using state grant money for a personal spending spree. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Jason MeisnerContact Reporter The teenager was purportedly paid $8.50 an hour as a summer youth instructor under a state grant designed to keep impoverished kids on Chicago's West Side out of trouble. But in reality, the girl didn't instruct anybody, federal prosecutors allege. Instead, she spent the summer of 2011 working as an intern for longtime state Sen. Kimberly Lightford, answering phones and performing clerical duties in the senator's west suburban office. The details came to light Tuesday in the federal fraud trial of Franshuan Myles, the head of a now-defunct nonprofit accused of lying to state officials about her use of the $60,000 Illinois Youth Recreation Corps grant six years ago. Prosecutors alleged Myles was supposed to use the funds to employ 20 youths ages 16 to 19 to instruct other kids in physical activities, arts and crafts, and other programs in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. Instead, Myles submitted falsified paperwork misrepresenting how many instructors she'd actually hired and spent thousands of dollars on personal expenses, such as her car loan, utility bills and shopping sprees, according to the charges. On Tuesday, Marla Skinner, a longtime aide to Lightford, testified that one of the girls on the list had spent that summer working as an unpaid intern in the senator's Westchester office. The girl worked five days a week, typically from 9 a.m. to either 3 p.m. or 5 p.m., Skinner said. Lightford was not accused of wrongdoing. She did not respond to calls from the Tribune seeking comment. Another teen purportedly hired by Myles that summer — who records show is the grandson of former Illinois Rep. Coy Pugh — had instead spent his time as a paid intern for a private accounting firm that had done business with Pugh, according to testimony Tuesday. Myles, 39, was charged last year with one count each of wire fraud and mail fraud stemming from her work at Divine Praise Inc. Her indictment sparked interest after the Tribune revealed last May that Myles wrote a Divine Praise check for $4,932 to 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin, identified by authorities only as "Individual A," just two days after the state money landed in her bank account. The check — which was displayed Tuesday for jurors on a video screen — was one of numerous expenditures from a Divine Praise bank account highlighted by prosecutors in the second day of Myles' trial. Ervin was not accused of wrongdoing, and prosecutors have not alleged there was anything illegal about the check Myles sent to him. Myles' attorney, Michael Petro, has previously told the Tribune that the money came from a separate $5,000 grant from the Wal-Mart Foundation and was given to Ervin so he could buy back-to-school backpacks for children in his ward. Also shown to the jury Tuesday was a $100 check from Divine Praise to a campaign fund controlled by then-state Sen. Annazette Collins. Records show Myles' grant application was faxed to state officials from Collins' West Side office. Although she did hire a number of instructors, Myles also used the windfall from the state to buy shoes at Designer Shoe Warehouse, home improvement supplies from Home Depot and apparel from stores such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, according to prosecutors. She rented a car for a former Divine Praise officer, paid down the loan on her 2008 Dodge Charger and made cash withdrawals totaling about $2,800, prosecutors said. "While the state of Illinois saw a way to enrich the lives of kids, this defendant right here saw a way to enrich herself," Assistant U.S. Attorney Amarjeet Bhachu said in his opening statement Monday. In his opening remarks, Petro said Myles may be guilty of sloppy bookkeeping but that no proof exists she stole any money. Myles grew up in West Garfield Park and has "spent her whole life trying to make the neighborhood a better place for the people who live there," Petro said. Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday afternoon after calling more than a dozen witnesses over two days. Myles decided not to testify in her own defense, and her attorneys rested their case without calling anyone to the stand. U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo scheduled closing arguments for Thursday. jmeisner@chicagotribune.com Twitter @jmetr22b Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Jason C.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jill Rothenberg By Jill Rothenberg May 20 Follow @ejillrothenberg Gerald Salazar, right, and John Montoya sit and chat inside the Pueblo Mall in Pueblo, Colo. Despite the death of the mall in many parts of the country, it remains a mainstay in some rural areas. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Hair freshly done from the beauty parlor on a recent Friday morning, Ada Clark, 93, and her daughter Carol, 63, met in front of the J.C. Penney in the Pueblo Mall, about 100 miles south of Denver. Their afternoon plan: a walk around the mall, followed by lunch at Red Lobster. When the mall was built in 1976, Pueblo was a booming steel town. The Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. was the city’s largest employer, and a now-empty meatpacking plant also offered good wages. The mall — with its 1,100 retail jobs — has outlasted them both. It’s also the social hub for the city — and for the many small towns east to Kansas and south to New Mexico. “Any time I get out of town to go to the mall and maybe to Sam’s Club, I guarantee that within an hour or so, I’m going to run into someone I know,” said Steve Francis, 60, of Lamar, a town of nearly 8,000 people 120 miles east of Pueblo near the Kansas border. “You take your family, your neighbors, and you make a day of it. The Pueblo Mall isn’t just the only game in town two hours away, it’s the only game in town for three counties.” The Pueblo Mall is an outlier in the age of Amazon.com, when socks and laundry detergent and televisions — nearly anything you can think of — can be delivered to your front stoop within hours. The rise of online shopping has summoned a death knell for some of the old standard-bearers of retail. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) The Pueblo Mall attracts shoppers from hundreds of miles away. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Macy’s and J.C. Penney, for instance, have in recent years reported crippling losses and widespread store closures. When those big anchor stores close, suburban malls find it hard to replace them. Many ’60s- and ’70s-era enclosed malls have been abandoned, razed or reimagined. “With department store closings, many malls will have to get creative with how they utilize space,” said Amy Raskin, who follows urbanization trends as chief investment officer at Chevy Chase Trust. She said many malls nationwide have converted space into multifamily residential units, whereas more rural malls may take on nonstandard anchor tenants, such as a Walmart. Despite Pueblo’s three Walmarts and the arrival of a Dick’s Sporting Goods and an Ulta Beauty store, the Pueblo Mall is bustling. On weekends, its nearly 3,000 outdoor parking spaces fill up. Inside are a few relics of the golden age of American malls: Amy’s Hallmark, Claire’s, Kay Jewelers. And in the food court is an Orange Julius, with its old-school classics and a modern update: smoothies. The mall does not track visitors, according to manager Timothy Schweitzer, but based on sales trends, he says traffic has increased 3 percent to 5 percent in the past year. He said the mall’s average sales per square foot are healthy, holding at around $400 over the past six months. He attributed this to the bigger-name tenants that have opened in recent years, including Bath and Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, Charlotte Russe, Hot Topic and Zumi. It draws kids from all over on the weekends. “It’s still not ­unusual to see out-of-town teams from La Junta [65 miles], Rocky Ford [54 miles] or Walsenburg [53 miles] walk around the mall after soccer or basketball games,” said Carol Clark, who works for the CW Railway and lives 25 miles south in Colorado City. Clark says that when the mall was built, downtown Pueblo suffered and many of its stores closed. The mall became Pueblo’s new town square. The folks who frequent the Pueblo Mall say they go there for the shopping and the socializing. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Now it’s among the city’s main employers, along with two hospitals, including the state-operated Colorado Mental Health Institute. State and federal corrections (there are 13 prisons and the nearby federal Super Max in adjoining counties) also provide jobs, as well as a burgeoning legal marijuana industry that emerged after the passage of Colorado’s Amendment 64. As revenue from online shopping climbs nationally — up 14.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year ago — regional malls like Pueblo’s can compete by tailoring themselves to their consumers, said David Mitroff of Piedmont Avenue Consulting in Oakland, Calif. “People are ordering online, and that changes the whole shopping dynamic,” Mitroff said. “But now the mall has barber shops, gyms, local stores and other things you can’t just buy on Amazon. Or you can go see what they have. You can touch it.” Shoppers like Carol Clark do order online — in her case, ­30-pound bags of specialty dog food that can be obtained cheaper and more conveniently that way than by buying it in Pueblo. “The mall, whether in Pueblo or in Denver where my daughters live, is more social,” she said, “and we may or may not buy something.” Civic pride and tradition also play a part. In some markets with older regional malls, people buy from a traditional anchor store such as a Sears because it’s American, Mitroff said. “It reinforces ‘this is our mall, this is our city, let’s shop there,’ ” he said. “Especially if it’s the same price, why wouldn’t you do that? And if city officials say, ‘Do you understand that when you buy at J.C. Penney here, we actually get tax revenue off of that? But if you buy from Amazon, we don’t.’ ” Two factors working in the Pueblo Mall’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Shoppers in southern Colorado are often more willing to drive longer distances for their retail purchases, especially for ­durable goods such as refrigerators and other appliances, according to Chris Markuson, director of economic development for Pueblo County. Two other factors work in Pueblo’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. “What this means is that these malls are safe,” said Brian Harper, CEO of New York City-based Rouse Properties, which owns 34 malls in 19 states. “If you’re, say, the third or fourth mall in Cleveland, Ohio, you’ve got to re­invent.” The Farmington Mall in Farmington, N.M., about 300 miles southwest of Pueblo and on the edge of the Navajo Nation Reservation, is a regional focal point. “The Farmington Mall is a perfect example of a mall that will always just be a mall,” Harper said. “A big night out in Farmington, New Mexico — and it’s great — is Red Lobster and a football game afterward — it’s ‘Friday Night Lights.’ Or it’s Red Lobster and the mall or vice versa. So it serves as the hub for Farmington, because there’s no downtown.” The indoor playground is a draw for families. The mall holds community events throughout the year. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) But Harper said that even regional shopping centers miles from major metropolitan centers can adapt and offer something new to consumers. Back at the Pueblo Mall on a Friday afternoon, Bruce and Jennifer Miller watch their 2-year-old son and other kids in a small indoor play area near Sears “When I went to the mall as a kid, it was like ‘Yes!’ and sort of a big deal,” says Bruce Miller, a Pueblo native who works in construction. “But when I was a kid, there was no playground. My son really loves it.” The mall holds community events throughout the year, including a “Walk with a Doc” mall-walking program, health fairs, school concerts and, recently, a Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Day and a “Pueblo’s Got Talent” showcase. In front of the playground is the Boot Barn, a national Western and workwear chain that serves people from the many ranches and farms that dot the counties of southern Colorado. The store even stays open on holidays when the rest of the mall is closed. “We had a good day this past Easter,” store manager Jenni Pacheco said. “You can’t predict when your work boots are going to need to be replaced, even if it’s on a holiday. We have rodeos, fairs [the Colorado State Fair is held each August in Pueblo], concerts and even father-daughter dances that keep us busy all year.” And there are plans for new mall tenants, including entertainment outlets, restaurants, and possibly a grocery store, Schweitzer said. A Planet Fitness has opened, along with the women’s plus-size store Torrid. On a recent Friday afternoon, Toni Brgoch of La Veta, a town of 750 that is 65 miles southwest of Pueblo, stopped by the Clinique counter at Dillard’s. Though she was on her way back from visiting her grandchildren in Denver and could have picked up makeup at one of the larger malls, she preferred to stop in Pueblo, where she has been shopping for 42 years. “When my children were young, we came to Pueblo for doctor’s appointments and the mall — we’d make a day of it,” she said. “Growing up in Walsenburg, we had a J.C. Penney, where my mom worked, and a Montgomery Ward mail-order center. But now there’s just a Safeway. Taking the stores out of these towns hurts them. I hope this mall stays.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

report this ad / Rob Beschizza / 7:41 am Mon May 15, 2017 Review: Mainstays $9 portable electric burner From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Mainstays Single Burner is a portable electric coil hotplate you can buy for $9 at Walmart (and Amazon). It has a 1m two-prong cord, an adjustable power control (temperatures are not marked) and rubber feet. I tested it with a steel stock pot with 8 quarts of water. After turning up the heat I watched it for a while. It got the water to about 160 degrees but it was only slowly rising and I doubt it would have gotten to a boil. Touching the steel to observe the element, I felt a strange tingling, rippling sensation in my arm. “That’s odd,” I thought, lifting the pot up to look at the element. The sensation left me. Part of the element glowed red but mostly it remained dark. I placed the pot back on the element and the moment it touched it that weird tingle shot up my arm again. “Oh, I’m being electrified,” I said, “because I bought a $9 electric burner from fucking Walmart.” SHARE / TWEET / 47 COMMENTS Gadgets / mistakes / Reviews report this ad GET THE BOING BOING NEWSLETTER Inexpensive keyboard has two settings: “OFF” and “NO” The mechanical Royal Kludge keyboard (Update: in stock here) seems to do well with Amazon reviewers, but there are no guarantees you’ll receive one with the coveted OFF/NO switch.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Sports Supplement Market – Drivers and Forecasts by Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio analysts forecast the global sports supplement market to grow at a CAGR of almost 9% during the forecast period, according to their latest report. The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global sports supplement market for 2017-2021. The market is segmented on the channel (online stores and retail outlets), and geography (the Americas, EMEA, and APAC). The rise in awareness about health and fitness and the growth in the number of gyms around the world have triggered an upsurge in the consumption of sports nutrition products like sports supplements. The increase in investments by governments and pharmaceutical companies to develop healthcare facilities in developing countries is likely to have a positive impact on the market as the availability and accessibility of products is likely to grow with the expansion of healthcare facilities in developing countries. Thus, with an increase in such initiatives by governments and pharmaceutical companies, the desire to use sports nutrition products such as sports supplements may grow in the coming years. Looking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio research analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global sports supplement market: Increasing demand for natural products Increased participation in sports and fitness activities Upsurge in disposable income Increase in sales outlets Increasing demand for natural products The demand for natural products is growing with the increasing awareness about the harm caused by toxic and chemical products to the human body. In the past few years, the shift towards simpler ingredients has gained momentum as people have become more interested in knowing about the ingredients in food supplements such as sports supplements. Major retailers such as Costco, Walmart, and Whole Foods are enforcing food supplement producers to make sweeping changes to the products that they supply to them. Amber Chourasia, a lead health and wellness research analyst at Technavio, says, “The demand for natural and herbal products is on the rise due to the shift in consumer preference from synthetic ingredients to natural ingredients. With the increase in demand for natural products, vendors are continuously introducing such products to cater to the customers’ demand.” Increased participation in sports and fitness activities Participating in sports and physical fitness activities play a significant role in promoting health and wellness among children and adults. These activities not just improve the physical fitness and health of the individual, they are also an integral strategy to stem childhood obesity, which is a critical health priority in countries like the US, Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, and Hungary. Physical activities include reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome and improving the metabolic health of children. “Increased interest, especially among young consumers, in maintaining a good physical appearance, is leading to the rise in the number of bodybuilders, which has driven the consumption of sports supplements. Athletes and bodybuilders build muscle through training, and it is important for them to have a balanced and healthy diet. Sports supplements are used to increase their endurance during sports or exercise regimes,” says Amber. Upsurge in disposable income The per capita disposable income exhibits low volatility in developed countries because of a spike in double-income households. Disposable incomes have increased globally, especially in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. This allows people, who are actively engaged in sports and gyms, to spend more on sports nutrition products as these products help in improving stamina and endurance, which are required for physical activities. The population is shifting from rural to urban areas due to financial opportunities. The rise in disposable income has changed the living standards of consumers, enabling them to buy necessities and luxury health and wellness products such as sports supplements, which will open vast opportunities for manufacturers during the forecast period.

The company announced May 23, 2017 that it would close the store due to Boulder’s highly competitive retail environment and the rise of online shopping. The mega-retailer Walmart on Tuesday announced plans to close its Boulder outpost, a Neighborhood Market concept, less than four years after opening. Company spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said the decision was motivated by the changing nature of retail, including the shift to online shopping. Hatfield said axing the Boulder store was an “isolated event” — no other closures are planned at this time. The Neighborhood Market concept, launched in 1998, is going strong, she said, with more than 600 locations around the country.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint WASHINGTON – Target CEO Brian Cornell told the House Ways and Means Committee Tuesday that a proposed border adjustment on products imported by U.S. companies would raise Target's tax rate to 75 percent and would increase the prices of "everyday essentials" for Americans by 20 percent. Cornell faced off with other executives in a debate over a part of a Republican tax reform plan that tries to encourage U.S. corporations to sell American-made products and create American jobs by forcing those who import products to pay taxes on the cost of those foreign-made products, not just on the profits earned from their sale. The proposal, known as a border adjustment tax, aims to offset tax cuts elsewhere in the tax reform plan being considered in the House. In a hearing focused on keeping existing American jobs and creating new ones, Cornell, whose Minneapolis-based corporation imports a significant portion of its inventory, strongly opposed the border adjustment. He called it a plan that wagered "paychecks on an untested theory." But other committee witnesses, including former Wal-Mart CEO William Simon, backed the border adjustment plan. "Properly implemented, it is in the best interest of our country for this to be considered," Simon told the committee. Simon called for a "safety net" for retailers like Target, suggesting an extended phase-in for the border adjustment to blunt its negative impact. He also talked about transforming worker training. LEILA NAVIDI &#x2022; leila.navidi@startribune.com Target CEO Brian Cornell called the border adjustment tax an “untested theory” that would raise retail prices substantially for consumers. "Let's bridge the gap," Simon said. But he maintained that the country must recover a manufacturing sector it has lost over the past three decades. For the American economy to prosper, Simon said, "we have to make things." Juan Luciano, CEO of global food processing and commodities giant Archers Daniels Midland, offered support for the border adjustment based on what he said were current inequities in the world market. Those inequities had led to pricing advantages that allowed places like Ukraine to wrest from the U.S. the title of "bread basket of the world." Businesses in other countries "enjoy tax systems with lower rates and border adjustments that give them an advantage," Luciano said in his statement to the committee. "When investment in agriculture moves to other countries, jobs move there, too." Cornell made the opposite argument, emphasizing Target's plans to invest $7 billion in American communities. He also tried to draw in the range of businesses that rely on imports — "car dealers, grocery stores and gas stations." Cornell said consumer price increases driven by the border adjustment would need to be offset by increases in the value of the U.S. dollar in order not to hurt Americans. He said experts he has talked to have "grave doubts" that currency exchange rates can offset price hikes in things like clothing, groceries and medicine. Target supported tax reform and was willing "to put every tax break we receive on the table," but he insisted that the border adjustment would not spur growth. Ninety-seven percent of the apparel sold in the U.S. is not made in this country, Cornell told the committee. "Those supply chains don't exist in the U.S." "No one is growing bananas in Ohio or coffee beans in Michigan," Cornell added. The supply chain for electronics is similarly limited in the U.S. It will take time to bring back manufacturing and in the case of low-end products it may not make economic sense even with a border adjustment. Despite those limitations, another witness, economist Lawrence Lindsey, cited research that said the border adjustment would cause a "one-time price increase of just 1 percent." The committee's Republican majority appeared of two minds about policies that in essence make importing products and parts more costly and less desirable than selling American-made. They liked the idea of rebuilding American manufacturing and creating American jobs, but worried about consumer pricing. No member of the witness panel could say that the dollar would appreciate fast enough to neutralize negative effects on consumers. Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota said he could not support border adjustment as it was introduced in the Republican tax plan last December. In February, he told the Star Tribune that he supported border adjustment but had reservations. Paulsen on Tuesday asked Cornell to suggest policies that might make the country's corporate tax structure better. The Target CEO stressed a need for certainty, noting that there are too many "ifs" in the current tax plan. "I can't sit with my employees and say if all these [policies] pass, our company will be OK," he said. jim.spencer@startribune.com 612-270-1266 SpencerStrib View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Walmart currently operates 375 stores in Florida.     The coming months will also see Walmart announce the official grand opening of its 150-acre e-commerce distribution center in Davenport, Florida. The facility, which has recently been certified as fully operational, represents an approximate investment of more than $300 million with two buildings spanning more than 2.2 million sq. ft.   The discounter also confirmed plans to break ground later this year on a new distribution center for perishable goods in the City of Cocoa, Florida. The company is planning an investment of more than $145 million on the planned 640,000 sq. ft. facility.   "This year has been an exciting one for Walmart in Florida, and we’ll build on that momentum as we continue to focus on how to better serve our customers through innovation and investments so they can save both time and money,” said Elise Vasquez-Warner, Walmart’s VP and regional general manager in North Florida. “We’ve had a sharp focus on making our store experience second to none and our customers are telling us that our plan is working."   Walmart’s 2017-2018 investment plans build on the chain's growth last year in Florida, which included: *Hiring more than 3,225 Floridians by opening more than 20 stores/clubs across the state.   *Investing millions of dollars in more than 30 store remodels across the state.   *The expansion of its online grocery pickup service to 70 stores and the launch of Walmart Pay statewide.   *Opening a state-of-the-art supercenter in Lake Nona that showcases new approaches to technologies, services, products and store layout, which will be tested with customers and evaluated for potential implementation in other locations across the country.  Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Jet.com ventures into physical retail Lidl to make U.S. debut June 15—with low, low prices Sears’ Lampert takes on vendors in blog J.C.

Paul Sakuma AP Politics & Government May 23, 2017 12:18 PM Target CEO tells Congress that GOP’s proposed import tax would hurt his customers By Alex Daugherty adaugherty@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON A proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as a way to overhaul the nation’s tax system received a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and reception to the plan by business leaders and House Republicans was mixed. The tax on imports, dubbed the border adjustment tax, has divided Republicans. Proponents argue the tax would help American manufacturers while raising $1 trillion over 10 years, and opponents say the plan would result in higher prices for consumers and cause businesses to lay off workers. Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have said the border adjustment plan doesn’t have a chance of passing the Senate, while the White House has remained relatively silent over the proposal in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the CEO of Target testified against the idea to the House tax-writing committee, as many large retailers are leery of a tax on the thousands of products they import from foreign markets. “Under the new border adjustment tax, American families – your constituents – would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell. “Eighty-five percent of Americans shop at Target every year. We believe this new tax would hit those families hard, raising prices on everyday essentials by up to 20 percent.” But the former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart was cautiously optimistic. “I have weighed the considerable challenges this proposal presents to retail with the significant benefits it will deliver to the economy as a whole and have concluded that properly implemented, it is in the best interest of our country for this to be considered,” William Simon said. Simon retired in 2014, and Wal-Mart is opposed to the border adjustment plan. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:34 Myrtle Beach weather forecast for 5.24 Pause 1:42 Myrtle Beach weather forecast for 5.23 0:08 Officials talk with neighbors near the suspected meth lab 2:34 Generation gap spreads from Atlantic Beach to Myrtle Beach at Bikefest 1:20 Surveillance video shows woman jumping out of trunk after kidnapping 1:12 Police find 'couple' of one-pot meth labs 1:28 Back to Football in Myrtle Beach 0:46 Jim McMahon plays at Monday After the Masters 0:05 100 lucky kids get free bikes as Pelicans celebrate Splash's birthday 0:34 At a loss for words, Frank Martin tries to describe 'surreal' experience of making first Final Four Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email White House unveils President Trump’s tax plan The Trump administration unveiled its tax overhaul plan April 26 during the daily press briefing. White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said the plan is “the most significant tax reform legislations since 1986.” C-SPAN A few Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voiced reservations to the tax Tuesday. Minnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen, who represents a competitive district and did not vote for President Donald Trump, said he was opposed to the border adjustment tax. “This has to be done in a very thoughtful way, a way that addresses the very real and valid concerns,” Paulsen said. “I cannot support the border adjustability provisions as introduced last year in the blueprint. I really want to urge this committee to listen, to be educated and to address these concerns that we heard.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Other Republicans on the committee, including Reps. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania and Jim Renacci of Ohio, pushed Cornell and Simon over the implications of the tax for consumers. “I’ve been skeptical of the border adjustment as a central element of the blueprint, but I’m trying not to be,” Renacci said. “Does border adjustment pick winners and losers? Who will the tax burden ultimately shift to, and is it compliant with our international treaty obligations?” It is unclear at this point whether the World Trade Organization would take punitive action against the United States for implementing the tax. Tuesday’s hearing brought a change in messaging from Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who said the proposed border adjustment tax would end what he and others call a “made in America tax” for domestic manufacturers. There isn’t any such tax – American manufacturers are, like all exporters, taxed on their exported goods by foreign governments – but it’s an argument the House Republican leadership hopes will convince the president and his supporters that border adjustment would help middle- and working-class Americans. “In the tax reform blueprint we propose to end the ‘made in America’ tax and instead tax all products and services equally when they are sold in America at a low rate of 20 percent,” Brady said. “And we lift the tax on ‘made in America’ products and services when they are sold abroad — for the first time leveling the playing field for American workers, businesses and farmers.” Democrats are generally against the border adjustment tax and say Ryan and Brady’s plan doesn’t help middle- and working-class employees enough. “There are many unknowns about the border adjustment tax,” said Ways and Means ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass. “What would the BAT’s impact be on American jobs? Who will be the winners and losers as a result of the BAT?” The tax overhaul plan supported by Ryan and Brady also reduces corporate taxes to a flat rate of 20 percent, establishes three personal income-tax brackets instead of the current seven and eliminates many deductions. The nation’s tax system has not been overhauled since Ronald Reagan’s administration. Brady said he wanted to pass a tax overhaul plan by the end of the year. Alex Daugherty: 202-383-6049, @alextdaugherty House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, is in favor of imposing a 20 percent tax on imports as part of a tax overhaul plan that reduces the corporate and personal income tax rates. Other Republicans oppose the plan.

Tuesday’s hearing brought a change in messaging from Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who said the proposed border adjustment tax would end what he and others call a “made in America tax” for domestic manufacturers. There isn’t any such tax – American manufacturers are, like all exporters, taxed on their exported goods by foreign governments – but it’s an argument the House Republican leadership hopes will convince the president and his supporters that border adjustment would help middle- and working-class Americans. “In the tax reform blueprint we propose to end the ‘made in America’ tax and instead tax all products and services equally when they are sold in America at a low rate of 20 percent,” Brady said. “And we lift the tax on ‘made in America’ products and services when they are sold abroad — for the first time leveling the playing field for American workers, businesses and farmers.” Democrats are generally against the border adjustment tax and say Ryan and Brady’s plan doesn’t help middle- and working-class employees enough. “There are many unknowns about the border adjustment tax,” said Ways and Means ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass. “What would the BAT’s impact be on American jobs? Who will be the winners and losers as a result of the BAT?” The tax overhaul plan supported by Ryan and Brady also reduces corporate taxes to a flat rate of 20 percent, establishes three personal income-tax brackets instead of the current seven and eliminates many deductions. The nation’s tax system has not been overhauled since Ronald Reagan’s administration. Brady said he wanted to pass a tax overhaul plan by the end of the year. Alex Daugherty: 202-383-6049, @alextdaugherty House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, is in favor of imposing a 20 percent tax on imports as part of a tax overhaul plan that reduces the corporate and personal income tax rates. Other Republicans oppose the plan.

The Pittsburgh Foundation is narrowing the focus of its former Day of Giving fundraiser to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties that directly support people with needs in five areas. The foundation said this year's Critical Needs Alert event begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will last 16 hours. “The shift (from a general fundraising event) aims to support the safety net for basic needs and respond to the needs of our community,” said Kelly Uranker, the Pittsburgh Foundation's director of the Center for Philanthropy. “We want everyone to benefit from the prosperity that has occurred in the region over the last couple years,” Uranker said. In the past, the former Day of Giving event benefited a wider array of nonprofits across the region. The Pittsburgh Foundation was forced to reschedule last year's event after a glitch with its online fundraising platform caused problems about 10 hours into the daylong campaign. More than 820 nonprofits participated in the rescheduled event last September. The Critical Needs Alert event will support organizations that help people with needs related to child care, food and nutrition, physical and mental health, housing and transportation. Participating organizations include family health care centers, local YMCAs, women's centers, soup kitchens and transportation-service organizations such as the Braddock-based Heritage Community Initiatives. Uranker said the new event aligns with the foundation's “100 Percent Pittsburgh” principle, which aims to support the one-third of the region's population that falls below the poverty line and allows them to benefit from the region's improving economy. Mt. Ararat Community Activity Center, one of this year's participating nonprofits, helps provide childcare to children up to age 5. The center hopes to use money they receive from this year's fundraiser to open a larger childcare facility. “We hope that by moving to a larger facility, we will eliminate our waiting list and provide childcare to others in the community, beyond our own waiting list,” said Denise Williams, Mt. Ararat's executive director. “The funding we will gain from this Critical Needs Alert will be extremely beneficial as these are critical years for our children.” The Pittsburgh Foundation has allocated up to $657,000 to match funds raised by the participating foundations. For example, if all the groups collected a combined $600,000, the matching funds would bring the total amount raised to $1.2 million. To donate, people should visit PittsburghGives.org between 8 a.m. and midnight Tuesday. There is a minimum donation of $25. Emma Curtis is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

In case you missed it: Five cities, five one-way tickets - one handgun. Has anything changed since the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting? Local News Palm Beach County News Man accused of upskirting 'did not know that taking photos of girls was illegal', cops say A 38-year-old Chad Thomas Gorman from Lake Park is facing eight counts of video voyeurism after admitting to police to taking upskirt photos of young women at a local Walmart.   A 38-year-old Chad Thomas Gorman from Lake Park is facing eight counts of video voyeurism after admitting to police to taking upskirt photos of young women at a local Walmart.   Adam SacasaContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Police found more than 400 photos of women, including eight upskirt photos and a video, on the phone of a man lurking around the women’s section of a Wal-Mart, according to a Jupiter police arrest report. A security guard first noticed Chad Gorman, 34, of Lake Park, at the store at 2144 W. Indiantown Rd. late Friday afternoon as Gorman spent time walking around the women’s apparel section. The guard noticed Gorman following around young girls with the camera app open on his phone, police said. At one point, security watched as Gorman moved behind an 18-year-old wearing a green dress and took a picture from underneath her as she crouched down looking at clothing. Security called Jupiter police and when an officer arrived, he confronted Gorman about the photos. “I did not know that taking photos of girls was illegal,” Gorman told the officer, according to the report. A check of Gorman’s phone turned up “numerous photos of girls and several upskirt photos of women’s panties,” officer Christopher Morgan wrote in the arrest report. In total, investigators found 453 photos of women and a video of young girls on his phone, they said. The 18-year-old targeted for upskirting was located and told police that she wished to prosecute, the report said. Gorman told investigators he was just killing time shopping at Wal-Mart while waiting for his girlfriend to get off work, according to the report. He faces eight counts of video voyeurism and was released from the Palm Beach County Jail after posting $24,000 bond. Efforts to contact Gorman for comment Tuesday were not successful.

But Wal-Mart trains about a quarter-million of its employees a year in more advanced skills. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Retraining generally isn't a top priority in the retail sector, analysts say. But Wal-Mart trains about a quarter-million of its employees a year in more advanced skills. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Harry Friedman has run a consultancy training entry-level retail workers in customer service and other basics for 35 years. But in all his years, he has not retrained retail workers for new skills. "Nope; we do none of it," he says. "I don't know that anybody does any of it." Many retail workers are undergoing what economists call "job displacement," meaning they are losing their jobs largely because of major technological shifts. Layoffs in traditional retail have accelerated sharply this year, with hundreds of store closings and nine U.S. chains filing for bankruptcy so far in 2017. Most of those losing their jobs are low-skilled, entry-level workers, while retailers look instead to bolster the e-commerce sides of their businesses, hiring for higher-skilled positions such as logistics and warehousing. Whereas some industries invest to retrain their workers with new skills for new times, to date the retail industry has not successfully done that. Friedman says that is not good news for the laid-off workers. "It's a pretty bleak picture, I'm sorry to say," he says. Staff and training in general are not top priorities for most retailers, he says, making things tough on his business. Friedman compares retail to other businesses displaced by technology. "It's like owning a film processing store or a travel agency; it's kind of tough," he says. Business Retailers Scrambling To Adjust To Changing Consumer Habits Various industries continue to struggle to keep their workforce apace with the demand for more technical know-how. Manufacturing, for example, requires higher order computing skills on the assembly line, so workers have had to train up. Retail is increasingly diverse, what experts call "omnichannel," meaning most retailers sell through a hybrid of online and traditional stores. Hiring is most in demand for work in e-commerce: warehousing, logistics and technology. The National Retail Federation says that to better equip people for those new jobs, it launched a training and certification program for workers. Maureen Conway is skeptical that will work. Conway, who is executive director of the Economic Opportunities Program for the Aspen Institute, notes the industry backed a similar certification program over a decade ago. "Unfortunately, it didn't seem that retailers valued somebody with this certificate versus somebody who didn't," she says. There are myriad challenges to retraining in retail. Frieda Molina, deputy director of MDRC, a social research group, says many retail workers simply don't want to stay in the industry. Business Its Survival In Doubt, Sears Struggles To Transform Once Again "It's hard to make that case to them, given the more negative reputation of retail, and the fact that many people at that lower level don't have the resources to be able to invest time and effort and lost wages potentially, in getting additional training," she says. Kathryn Shaw, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, says manufacturing adapted in a way that retail cannot. "These [manufacturing workers] who need to be retrained were both highly paid, on average, and pretty skilled," she says, so there was a strong economic incentive for them to retrain and retool for the more complex jobs. Retail workers, by comparison, tend to be young and don't intend to make a career in retail because of the relatively low pay. "They're not very skilled to begin with, and they're not very attached to the industry," she says. Shaw says when factories closed, their workers lived in a community, which made it easier to target them for retraining. By contrast, retail workers tend to be far more dispersed, geographically, making them harder to target for such programs. Wal-Mart realizes it has a workforce challenge. Two years ago, the retailer started an academy that trains about a quarter-million of its employees a year, while they work, in more advanced skills. Business Demographic Shifts Contribute To The Changing Face Of Retail Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer for Wal-Mart, says the training — for both in-store and online operations — has paid off in higher comparable-store sales and improved customer service marks. "It is very economic for retailers to invest in their people at all levels," she says. McLaughlin says Wal-Mart is trying to partner with other large retailers to develop industrywide training standards. "Retailers do need to look at their people, and create paths for them that are exciting, and provide the skills they need to succeed, not only in the jobs of today, but as these jobs continue to evolve," she says.

Since the attack last night, there has been an outpouring of solidarity and international outrage, from Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said: "This is a direct and brutal attack on young people everywhere, on freedom everywhere." We live in an age of multiple terrors, from the terror of having your house demolished and your family rendered homeless under "legal" means in Palestine, to the terror of having your house blown up by a "smart bomb" in Mosul, or a barrel bomb in Aleppo, or a Saudi bomb in Yemen or an American drone in a whole variety of nations - to the terror of "regime change" in Libya or Iraq, when whole countries implode and, public health and education, rights for women and minorities and basic security vanish overnight. And, of course, the subsequent terror of giving your life savings to a human smuggler and risking your life to escape - only to face virtual imprisonment, demonisation and an uncertain future. Then there is the terror of growing old alone with no health insurance in America, the terror of being a young person facing a lifetime of under-employment and zero-hours contracts, barely able to afford basics like food and shelter in a some of the world's wealthiest nations. The terror of watching horror videos of your tax dollars at work and dictators on parade on Facebook, while wondering how you will pay your rent, let alone resist the horror. And the terror of being a tax-paying Muslim citizen in, say, Quebec City or Queens, and having friends and relatives gunned down while praying or abused while walking home with their children. Or the terror of being in the wrong place at the wrong time in San Bernadino, or almost any other city in the US, the biggest arms exporter in the world, where guns can be purchased at Walmart. The terror of neoliberalism reimagined as a slasher flick. While there is no equanimity of suffering, and some terrors are certainly more awful than others, there is an undeniable connection between them. They are all the terrible fruits of the industry of fear.  It's an industry that's undeniably profitable - see Trump's recent $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis. Already benefiting from Western weapons to murder more Yemenis in the ongoing conflict that has killed more 1,500 children and destroyed 2,000 schools, now the Saudis will benefit from "sophisticated radar-precision guided arms".  And Trump's visit to Israel has undoubtedly continued the long-time American status quo when it comes to facilitating and funding violent the occupation of Palestine. Islamophobia, the knee-jerk, illogical reaction to a 'war on terror' that has killed thousands of Muslims, is as much an industry as the network of crime and arms sales that prop up global terror The ironies of the global "war on terror", initiated by a nation that has funded violent Wahhabism and ongoing occupations, and spent decades undermining secular nationalist movements in the Middle East and West Asia and directly funding extremism in places like Afghanistan (where the Taliban's Qurans are printed in the American Midwest) and fomented violent sectarianism in Iraq, are not lost on many commentators. But Islamophobia, the knee-jerk, illogical reaction to a "war on terror" that has killed thousands of Muslims, is as much an industry as the network of crime and arms sales that prop up global terror. They are two sides of the same very profitable coin.  To decry one is not to support the other - it is to remove the thin veil that separates them and reveal what lies beneath. Here in Canada, after an "anti-Islamophobia motion"  passed in the wake of the Quebec City massacre, Muslim scholars and community leaders are already facing the vitriol of right-wing racists rallying around "free speech" issues. And one only has to read the often terrifying comments sections of virtually any story with a Muslim theme in leading English or French language dailies to realise that the virulent spirit of anti-Semitism of our terrible mid-century moment is now being re-visited on men, women and children who happen to be part of the billion-strong global community of Muslims. When I published my first book on Iraq, Dancing in the No Fly Zone, about pre- and post-invasion realities, employees of a neo-con "thinktank" tracked me down on Amazon, and called me an evil "Saddamist" - apparently for documenting conversations with Iraqi women who spoke about the terrible new post-invasion violence against women by fundamentalist militias, and expressed nostalgia for the pre-invasion days when their daughters could walk to school safely, while there was also subsidised day care. All this despite the fact I was actually expelled from Iraq by Saddam's regime for writing critically about it. Recently, Islamophobe trolls on social media called me an "apologist for Islam", for suggesting that blaming Islam for the region's woes may be rather simplistic and misleading. Spot the difference? Whichever "enemy" happens to suit the status quo - whether Western-backed police state bogeyman or well-armed and funded criminal networks of terror - is ripe for demonisation as a way to "otherise" the people we are bombing and invading and turning into refugees, even as we are making deals with their leaders. It's ironic too, being called "an apologist for Islam" - as if Islam itself, more than other faiths or movements that wielded ideology as a weapon should require apology - considering my great-grandparents were Christian refugees fleeing Ottoman oppression in what was then Syria and what (after some imperial border shifting) is now Lebanon. And yet they came from a village known for its interfaith harmony. Even at the height of the civil war, Muslims and Christians from Karoun would go to other villages to preach peace and tolerance and brotherhood. In the new world of dispersed diasporas and cultural isolation, racism and materialism are the new oppressors, wielded as weapons by the merchants of fear The day I met Lebanese-Canadian artist Jamelie Hassan in the imperially named London, Ontario (kind of the Canadian commonwealth equivalent of Paris, Texas), and had strong Arabic coffee with her, was a special one - realising as we sipped ahweh holoh that her Muslim grandfather and my Christian great-grandfather had done the same thing every day as neighbours in Karoun. But in the new world of dispersed diasporas and cultural isolation, racism and materialism are the new oppressors, wielded as weapons by the merchants of fear.  So why should I, great-grand daughter of Christian refugees, care about Islamophobia? Because it distorts the real political and human rights issues at play in the region and the world and falsely casts them as "religious" ones. Because my ancestors were part of a persecuted minority in a dying, bloated empire that used them as cannon fodder for imperial wars. Because I care about secularism and democracy and peaceful co-existence. I'm not sure how this makes me an "apologist for terror", or an "anti-Semite" as I was once called for writing an article about a women's centre in Gaza, or a "Saddamist" or any number of "otherising" names empire likes to foist upon us. While alt-right White supremacists continue to play the "blame Islam" card for the evils of this world, they fail to distinguish between Islam, the faith of a billion human souls, and the criminal terror networks - and they fail to note that most acts of terror perpetrated in the name of Islam in the West are carried out by troubled young citizens with criminal records, direct experience of racism, and often serious mental health and addiction issues – or, as in the case of recent incidents in Germany, by soldiers posing as Islamists to discredit refugees.  Shouldn't we in the West look to our own society's failings before condemning the faith of a billion people? In the end, the vision of Islam as an unbending, fundamentalist monolith is shared by both Islamophobes and the extremists they decry, and both feed into the profits of arms dealers, human traffickers and recruiters of disaffected young men from Manchester to Mosul, and from Leeds to Libya. Like Charlton Heston's anguished cry at the end of the classic 1970s dystopian film: "Soylent Green is people!", I say: "Terrorism is us!"  The sooner we stop terrorising each other, and connect the dots between our shared - if somewhat inequitable - experiences of oppression, the less power we give to the tandem ideologies of the international fear factory. Let us sit, like old neighbours from the global village, and share coffee and stories. We have nothing to lose but our imagined labels for each other and the terror of feeling powerless.

The Impossible Burger is now sold at nine Umami Burger locations around Los Angeles. (Photo: Diana Kruzman, USA TODAY) 54 CONNECTTWEET 54 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE A new breed of plant-based burgers -- ones that actually taste like real beef -- are poised to add some sizzle to the restaurant industry. Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, both based in California, are on the forefront of delivering what they say are delicious, healthy burgers made entirely from plants. They could soon challenge existing meat producers and steer more consumers away from meat. But price could stand in their way, even as these new plant-based burgers gain prominence in restaurants and retail stores nationwide. They are already beginning to make inroads. Last week, a Los Angeles-based restaurant chain, Umami Burger, began offering the Impossible Burger at nine locations. Both makers plan to eventually introduce their products at large-scale burger chains. The companies have significant backing. Impossible Foods says it has $180 million in investments from supporters like Bill Gates and Google Ventures, while Beyond Meat also received venture capital from Gates as well as the Humane Society. The reaction from the beef industry, however, hasn't been as enthusiastic. Plant-based burgers are breaking out into the market at a time of rising beef consumption, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects to grow 11.7% by 2025. And many cattle farmers don't have an incentive to switch to growing plant-based proteins, said Sara Place, the senior director of sustainable beef production research at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Though their products are similar, the two companies are taking different marketing directions. Impossible Foods started introducing its meatless patty to chefs in New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas last year after spending five years developing the product. Beyond Meat is going straight to supermarkets. It is now sold in about 11,000 stores nationwide, including some Walmart, Target, Whole Foods Market and Kroger locations. "Impossible Foods is ... seeding their products with trendsetters and influencers and hoping that they'll go viral," said food marketing expert Jeffrey Hirsch, the founder of marketing firm The Right Brain Studio.  "That seems to be a more exclusive, premium, higher-profit-margin kind of strategy, where they're counting on people to discover [the burger] when they go out and then demand it at the supermarkets." Impossible Foods' burger is made from a base of wheat and potato protein, but its most unique – and patented – ingredient is heme (rhymes with "team"), a molecule found in blood that gives the Impossible Burger its meaty taste and red color. A worker lays down meatless patties on the griddle at Umami Burger in Los Angeles.  (Photo: Diana Kruzman, USA TODAY) Heme used for the burgers is harvested from yeast rather than animals, the company says, with the goal of appealing to people who want to help reduce animal cruelty and environmental impact without compromising on their love for meat. Patrick Brown, who taught biochemistry at Stanford University for 25 years before founding Impossible Foods, said he sees a far larger market for the Impossible Burger than the fewer than 4% of Americans that the Vegetarian Resource Group said are vegan or vegetarian, based on a Harris Poll survey last year. “People who love meat … do not value the fact that meat comes from an animal,” Brown said. “This food is delicious in a way that only meat is delicious, and they want that deliciousness.” Beyond Meat spent seven years developing its burger, which uses pea protein and beet juice to mimic the texture and appearance of ground beef. Founder Ethan Brown, who is not related to Impossible's Patrick Brown, said that he doesn't see Beyond Meat as a threat to big meat producers. Instead, he wants them to join him in producing plant-based rather than animal-based protein. And some, like meat industry giant Tyson -- which has a 5% stake in Beyond Meat -- have already started to listen. "We are a threat to people who insist that meat has to come from an animal," Ethan Brown said. "It depends on how open they are." But Hirsch said these companies may face difficulty competing with large-scale beef producers, and not just because of price. "They're still not mainstream, and if there was really demand you would see them at McDonald's and Shake Shacks -- but you don't," Hirsch said. Another barrier is price. Though Patrick Brown said producing an Impossible Burger is inherently cheaper than producing a beef patty because of the low cost of the plant-based ingredients, the burger currently sells for $16 at Umami Burger, and at similar price points in other restaurants nationwide. Beyond Meat sells two quarter-pound patties for $5.99, while two average beef-based burger patties would cost just over $1 at most grocery stores. The companies say, however, that they will lower prices by producing their alternative beef in bulk -- and Patrick Brown said that the Impossible Burger could rival commercially produced beef in price within three years. “We’ve designed our product to be competitive with commodity ground beef,” said David Lee, Impossible Foods' chief financial officer. “All that’s missing is the scale.” 54 CONNECTTWEET 54 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qR3biF

Non-venomous snakes have round pupils. Two years ago, the Independent Herald sat down with Dustin Burke, an Oneida police officer and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency boating officer who knows as much as anyone about the snakes that can be found in the northern Cumberland Plateau region. Burke informed readers at the time that there are only two species of venomous snakes that can be found in our neck of the woods, and that most of the snakes found here are harmless. With the arrival of warmer weather, snakes are once again turning up in places they share with humans. Residents who are startled to find a snake in their driveway, on their lawn or, worst of all, in their garage, often take to Facebook to enlist friends’ help in identifying the snake. So, with that in mind, we thought it might be time for a light refresher course. Within the confines of this page, it is impossible to describe every type of snake that you might encounter in Scott County. After all, there are nearly two dozen different species of snakes that inhabit the northern plateau region. But the most important question, in most people’s mind, is simply this: Are they poisonous? That can be surprisingly easy to ascertain. What poisonous snakes live here?  Many people are surprised to learn that only two types of venomous snakes can be found along the northern plateau: copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. There are no eastern diamondbacks to be found on the plateau or anywhere else in East Tennessee, nor are there water moccasins or cottonmouths. While you may encounter cottonmouths and even pygmy rattlesnakes as you venture into parts of Middle Tennessee, those two species do not inhabit areas this far east. If I'm bitten, will I die? Of the two species of venomous snakes that are found on the northern plateau, both are on the lower end of the spectrum as far as level of toxicity. While bites from either can make their victim seriously ill, and even be deadly, fatal bites from either copperheads or timber rattlers are rare. In fact, fatal snake bites are rare even when they involve the more venomous snakes not found in Scott County. It is estimated that as many as 8,000 people in the U.S. are bitten by a venomous snake annually, and only about five of those people die. Most venomous snake bites are the culprit of copperheads, due to the snake’s sheer numbers in the continental U.S., but it rarely kills its victims, because its bite is the least toxic of any venomous snake found in North America. There are exceptions, of course. In 2014, a 52-year-old Missouri man died after attempting to pick up a copperhead to show it to his son while they were on a camping trip. He was the third American to die from a copperhead bite in the 2010s. A 50-year-old man died of a heart attack one day after being bitten by a copperhead in Missouri in 2011, and a 26-year-old Chattanooga man died of a copperhead bite in January 2011. On the other hand, timber rattlers are quite toxic, and among North America’s deadliest snakes. The danger of their bite is offset by their mild disposition. Timber rattlers tend to rattle well in advance of striking. In fact, some experts say that neither timber rattlers or copperheads are likely to strike unless physical contact is made. What do I do if I'm bitten? In case of snake-bite, old-timers recommended making a cut around the bite area and attempting to suck out the venom. Until recent years, Walmart sold snake-bite kits, which included a small scalpel and suction device. But experts now recommend against the old-school method. The Mayo Clinic recommends calling 911 immediately. Delays in treatment can make your condition worse and increase the risk of death. In the meantime, it is recommended that you remain calm, since anxiety and increased heart rate can speed the rate at which your body absorbs the venom. Remove jewelry and tight clothing, since swelling is likely to occur, and position the bite area so that it is at or above the heart. The Mayo Clinic recommends against applying a tourniquet or applying ice, cutting the wound, or drinking caffeine or alcohol. How do I determine if a snake is poisonous? The best approach is to treat every snake as though it’s venomous, which means maintaining a comfortable distance and allowing it to continue on its way. But there are ways to determine whether a snake is venomous or harmless. Both species of venomous snakes found in Scott County are like every other venomous snake in the U.S., with the exception of coral snakes: they are pit vipers, with slit eyes. If a snake has round eyes, it is not poisonous. Often, copper-bellied water snakes or eastern hognose snakes are confused with copperheads, but they do not have round eyes. A less effective way of determining whether a snake is venomous is by the shape of its head. Both copperheads and timber rattlers have diamond-shaped heads, but some non-venomous species can have heads that mimic those shapes. In fact, a common defense mechanism of some species of non-venomous snakes is to flatten their heads so that they appear larger. Do non-poisonous snakes bite? Yes, non-venomous snakes that feel threatened will often bite. In fact, some species of non-venomous snakes found on the northern plateau are much more aggressive than either copperheads or timber rattlers. And while their bites may not inject venom, their tiny teeth can cause wounds that can become infected from bacteria in the snake’s mouth. Rat snakes and garter snakes, for example, produce toxins that help them kill their prey, although that toxin is considered clinically insignificant to humans. The best advice? If you see a snake, leave it alone. What purpose do snakes serve? All snakes serve a useful purpose, even venomous snakes. Primarily, snakes feed on mice, rats and other small mammals that invade our homes and damage our crops. Without snakes, rodent populations would be much higher. Voles, for example, can be especially damaging to your garden, while moles can virtually destroy your lawn. Most gardeners know the importance of keeping a cat or two around, but a rat snake that decides to hang out on the edge of your property could be a welcome “pet.” It is a myth that rat snakes — or black snakes — keep venomous snakes away; rat snakes have actually been known to hibernate with copperheads and rattlesnakes. But having rat snakes around creates competition for food, making it less likely that a copperhead or timber rattler will take up residence on your property. Meanwhile, researchers have discovered in recent years that snake venom may contain certain toxins that hold the key to curing chronic illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes. Is it really illegal to kill a poisonous snake in Tennessee? It is, but that is only part of the answer. A common misconception is that it’s illegal to kill venomous snakes on public land, such as the Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area. But, technically, it’s illegal to kill any snake, anywhere. Does that mean it’s against the law to kill a copperhead in your front yard? Technically, yes. Obviously, you aren’t likely to see a wildlife officer turn up at your doorstep if you post a photo of a dead snake on Facebook. But a park ranger or wildlife officer might not be as forgiving if you stop to kill a snake — regardless of whether it’s venomous — on the North Cumberland Wildlife Management Agency or in the Big South Fork. Are you sure there are no cottonmouths around here? It's a hard myth to dispel, but the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency says cottomouths — or water moccasins — are found west of the Tennessee River, with the exception of a handful of counties (like Perry and Williamson) just east of the river. If you think you saw a cottonmouth in East Tennessee, experts say, you most likely saw a northern watersnake.

Inmates Leave Community Work Farm; Sheriff Ends Farm Partnership May 23, 201710:23 AM EDT Catherine Pegram Local News The Aroostook County Sheriff has cut ties with a farm in Houlton after two inmates at a community work project there took off. Sheriff Darrell Crandall says 20-year-old Jacob Poitraw and 25-year-old Jeston Davis took a pick up truck from the farm Saturday and drove to a nearby Wal-Mart. One of the men’s accused of stealing a large ashtray of cigarette butts outside the store. Crandall says the two returned about ten minutes later, but the farm staff never noticed the men had left. Poitraw and Davis are now charged with escape, theft and unauthorized use of property. The Sheriff says inmate work projects are valuable to the community and the jail and wants to continue them.

The Pittsburgh Foundation is narrowing the focus of its former Day of Giving fundraiser to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties that directly support people with needs in five areas. The foundation said this year's Critical Needs Alert event begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will last 16 hours. “The shift (from a general fundraising event) aims to support the safety net for basic needs and respond to the needs of our community,” said Kelly Uranker, the Pittsburgh Foundation's director of the Center for Philanthropy. “We want everyone to benefit from the prosperity that has occurred in the region over the last couple years,” Uranker said. In the past, the former Day of Giving event benefited a wider array of nonprofits across the region. The Pittsburgh Foundation was forced to reschedule last year's event after a glitch with its online fundraising platform caused problems about 10 hours into the daylong campaign. More than 820 nonprofits participated in the rescheduled event last September. The Critical Needs Alert event will support organizations that help people with needs related to child care, food and nutrition, physical and mental health, housing and transportation. Participating organizations include family health care centers, local YMCAs, women's centers, soup kitchens and transportation-service organizations such as the Braddock-based Heritage Community Initiatives. Uranker said the new event aligns with the foundation's “100 Percent Pittsburgh” principle, which aims to support the one-third of the region's population that falls below the poverty line and allows them to benefit from the region's improving economy. Mt. Ararat Community Activity Center, one of this year's participating nonprofits, helps provide childcare to children up to age 5. The center hopes to use money they receive from this year's fundraiser to open a larger childcare facility. “We hope that by moving to a larger facility, we will eliminate our waiting list and provide childcare to others in the community, beyond our own waiting list,” said Denise Williams, Mt. Ararat's executive director. “The funding we will gain from this Critical Needs Alert will be extremely beneficial as these are critical years for our children.” The Pittsburgh Foundation has allocated up to $657,000 to match funds raised by the participating foundations. For example, if all the groups collected a combined $600,000, the matching funds would bring the total amount raised to $1.2 million. To donate, people should visit PittsburghGives.org between 8 a.m. and midnight Tuesday. There is a minimum donation of $25. Emma Curtis is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Johnson City Police say 27 year old Jonathan Morales allegedly acted up on May 14 and refused to leave the store after being denied his attempt to buy alcohol. Police say Morales allegedly grabbed the manager’s cell phone from his hand as he attempted to call police and threw it to the ground, breaking it. Morales fled the store before police arrived but was identified and found later. In addition to grand larceny, Morales is charged with two counts of criminal mischief. He’s been ordered to appear in Village Court next month.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Fresher, Faster, Cheaper: Consumer Reports Finds America’s Grocery Shopping has Undergone a Revolution YONKERS, NY (PRWEB) May 23, 2017 In a society that wants “perfect” organic produce and meats delivered to the door, the act of filling up the pantry is undergoing a revolution. Consumers demand fresher produce, organic choices, low prices, and more convenience from their grocers, finds Consumer Reports in latest look at the future of grocery shopping. They’re willing to go well beyond their neighborhood supermarket to get what they want, and food retailers are introducing a variety of innovations to adapt. In its story, “Faster, Fresher, Cheaper,” CR notes the pace of innovation in grocery stores and convenience trends. These trends include smaller-footprint stores that offer more-limited, “curated” food selections for time-pressed customers; in-store meal kits; home delivery; curbside pickup; and partnerships with local farms. CR also examines the supermarket of the future, which could include in-store sensors communicating with smartphone apps for easy purchase and no checkout lines; and boutique-style “concierges” offering help throughout the store. “The new American shopper wants food that’s very fresh, minimally processed and that satisfies an adventurous palate. Shoppers also want it to be convenient and easy to get,” said Tobie Stanger, Consumer Reports senior editor. “With all the choices available in stores and online today, it’s a buyers’ market for consumers in many parts of the country.” A recent Consumer Reports’ survey found 70 percent of respondents were either completely or very satisfied with the supermarkets where they do most of their grocery shopping. By contrast, only 48 percent told CR they’re very or completely satisfied with their markets’ healthy offerings, and only 29 percent said the same about the price of their markets’ organic options. Earlier in the month, Consumer Reports revealed its latest ratings of 62 supermarkets chains, based on responses from over 50,000 CR subscribers. East coast chain Wegmans earned the top spot, a place it has held since 2006. Other stores that did very well overall include Trader Joe’s, Publix, and the family-owned Market Basket chain, serving the Northeast. Walmart, with the largest market share for food and beverages of any U.S. retailer, scored well for competitive prices but otherwise was at the bottom of CR’s ratings. The Rise of the Virtual Market Six percent of the CR readers who were surveyed reported their experiences with online grocers. AmazonFresh topped CR’s satisfaction ratings of four online grocers. The survey is just one part of the not-for-profit organization’s latest look at the evolution of the supermarket industry and how consumers are changing the way they shop for food. Convenience and saving time are the online grocers’ major appeal. Sixty-one percent of respondents who used AmazonFresh told Consumer Reports they were highly satisfied with the service. While AmazonFresh earned top marks, Instacart, Peapod, and FreshDirect are close behind. While Amazon’s real impact on the industry has been through its food delivery, CR reports its innovations could eventually influence the operations of walk-in stores as well. Amazon’s brick-and-mortar grocery store prototype, where no checkout lanes exist (self-checkout or otherwise), allows people (Amazon employees during the test period) to buy what they need without having to engage with a human, changing the way consumers shop. In March, Amazon postponed the public rollout, citing technical problems. For more supermarkets and grocery shopping services or to get CR’s complete review and ratings pick up a copy of the Consumer Reports July 2017 issue, on newsstands starting June 6, 2017 or visit CR.org. The story also includes best time- and money-saving food shopping tips, healthy shopping strategies for vegans and to learn how to shop like a food expert. Consumer Reports Survey Methodology The 2016 Annual Supermarkets Survey surveyed 57,805 Consumer Reports subscribers about their grocery shopping. Grocery store ratings are based on 50,218 responses, reflecting readers’ 93,447 shopping trips to supermarkets, supercenters, and warehouses between July 2015 and September 2016. Online grocery reader scores are based on 1,721 ratings of online grocers.

We like this definition. The rise of the virtual market: AmazonFresh tops satisfaction ratings of online grocers YONKERS, NY (PRWEB) May 23, 2017 In a society that wants “perfect” organic produce and meats delivered to the door, the act of filling up the pantry is undergoing a revolution. Consumers demand fresher produce, organic choices, low prices, and more convenience from their grocers, finds Consumer Reports in latest look at the future of grocery shopping. They’re willing to go well beyond their neighborhood supermarket to get what they want, and food retailers are introducing a variety of innovations to adapt. In its story, “Faster, Fresher, Cheaper,” CR notes the pace of innovation in grocery stores and convenience trends. These trends include smaller-footprint stores that offer more-limited, “curated” food selections for time-pressed customers; in-store meal kits; home delivery; curbside pickup; and partnerships with local farms. CR also examines the supermarket of the future, which could include in-store sensors communicating with smartphone apps for easy purchase and no checkout lines; and boutique-style “concierges” offering help throughout the store. “The new American shopper wants food that’s very fresh, minimally processed and that satisfies an adventurous palate. Shoppers also want it to be convenient and easy to get,” said Tobie Stanger, Consumer Reports senior editor. “With all the choices available in stores and online today, it’s a buyers’ market for consumers in many parts of the country.” A recent Consumer Reports’ survey found 70 percent of respondents were either completely or very satisfied with the supermarkets where they do most of their grocery shopping. By contrast, only 48 percent told CR they’re very or completely satisfied with their markets’ healthy offerings, and only 29 percent said the same about the price of their markets’ organic options. Earlier in the month, Consumer Reports revealed its latest ratings of 62 supermarkets chains, based on responses from over 50,000 CR subscribers. East coast chain Wegmans earned the top spot, a place it has held since 2006. Other stores that did very well overall include Trader Joe’s, Publix, and the family-owned Market Basket chain, serving the Northeast. Walmart, with the largest market share for food and beverages of any U.S. retailer, scored well for competitive prices but otherwise was at the bottom of CR’s ratings. The Rise of the Virtual Market Six percent of the CR readers who were surveyed reported their experiences with online grocers. AmazonFresh topped CR’s satisfaction ratings of four online grocers. The survey is just one part of the not-for-profit organization’s latest look at the evolution of the supermarket industry and how consumers are changing the way they shop for food. Convenience and saving time are the online grocers’ major appeal. Sixty-one percent of respondents who used AmazonFresh told Consumer Reports they were highly satisfied with the service. While AmazonFresh earned top marks, Instacart, Peapod, and FreshDirect are close behind. While Amazon’s real impact on the industry has been through its food delivery, CR reports its innovations could eventually influence the operations of walk-in stores as well. Amazon’s brick-and-mortar grocery store prototype, where no checkout lanes exist (self-checkout or otherwise), allows people (Amazon employees during the test period) to buy what they need without having to engage with a human, changing the way consumers shop. In March, Amazon postponed the public rollout, citing technical problems.

The story also includes best time- and money-saving food shopping tips, healthy shopping strategies for vegans and to learn how to shop like a food expert. Consumer Reports Survey Methodology The 2016 Annual Supermarkets Survey surveyed 57,805 Consumer Reports subscribers about their grocery shopping. Grocery store ratings are based on 50,218 responses, reflecting readers’ 93,447 shopping trips to supermarkets, supercenters, and warehouses between July 2015 and September 2016. Online grocery reader scores are based on 1,721 ratings of online grocers.

News Local news Breaking News School disciplinary incident ends with a Naperville teen's suicide: 'They scared him to death' After he was reprimanded at school, Corey Walgren, 16, walked out of Naperville North High School and committed suicide, according to his mother, Maureen Walgren. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) After he was reprimanded at school, Corey Walgren, 16, walked out of Naperville North High School and committed suicide, according to his mother, Maureen Walgren. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Stacy St. ClairContact ReporterChicago Tribune On the last night of his life, Corey Walgren sat with his parents in the kitchen and talked about the colleges they would visit over spring break. At 16, Corey didn't know what he wanted to study — maybe business, maybe astronomy — but he liked the idea of attending a Big Ten school. He wanted a big, bustling campus with different kinds of people, a place that could match his energy and varied interests. His parents, Doug and Maureen Walgren, described it as an exciting but bittersweet discussion with their eldest child, a rite-of-passage conversation that occurs in kitchens all across the country. It ended with the family deciding to visit the University of Iowa and the University of Minnesota, both of which seemed realistic options given Corey's solid grade point average and extra-curricular activities. With his future before him and a high school hockey tournament that weekend, Corey went to bed that night as he had for much of his life: Happy. Healthy. Home. "There was no concern for anything," Maureen Walgren said. "Everything was fine. Everything was normal." Life for the Walgren family would never be normal again, at least as they knew it on that January evening. The following day, Naperville police suspected that Corey — who had no criminal history and had never been in serious trouble at school — had video on his phone of a consensual sexual encounter with a 16-year-old classmate and possibly played it for friends. At lunchtime, he was called into the dean's office. There, with a police officer and campus dean, Corey was questioned about possessing and possibly sharing "child pornography," allegedly threatened that he'd be put on the state's sex offender registry, then was left alone to wait for his mother. It does not appear any pornographic images were found on the teen's phone, but it did contain a file with audio of the sexual encounter. Police did not intend to pursue charges, records show, and they indicated they wanted to handle the matter in a way that ensured Corey understood the seriousness of his actions and how it affected his classmate. Yet Corey left school after the confrontation, walked nearly a mile to downtown Naperville and committed suicide by falling from the top of a parking deck. "I think they wanted to scare him straight," Maureen Walgren said. "Instead, they scared him to death."

Corey Walgren, a 16-year-old Naperville North High School junior, committed suicide in January. (Family photo) Paralyzing grief A young man whose life seemed so full of promise to those who knew him, Corey Walgren now serves as the subject of a cautionary tale in Naperville, the affluent west suburban community where many have whispered about his final day but few talk about it openly. In many ways, Corey's story represents a dangerous melding of teenage sex, modern technology, a 16-year-old boy's poor judgment and a response from school officials and local police that legal experts say may have violated the law. And with its many uncomfortable and heartbreaking turns, it's a difficult story for his parents to share publicly. They still struggle with an often paralyzing grief, and they have two other children they want to protect. But Corey's parents also believe their son's death could have been prevented. They say they feel an obligation to speak out. "This could happen to anyone's child," Maureen Walgren said. A junior at Naperville North High School, Corey Walgren had caused his parents little worry growing up. He was the oldest of three children, a lanky teen with strawberry-blond hair that leaned toward red and a background that would make a strong foundation for a college application: He routinely made the honor roll, earned a varsity letter in hockey his freshman year and worked part time busing tables at a local Italian restaurant. He had a tight-knit group of friends and was the one who made sure everyone in their circle knew the weekend's social plans. Though only an occasional fisherman as a child, he surprised his parents by joining the high school's competitive fishing team his freshman year; he later persuaded several of his hockey teammates to do the same. There was nothing that made him happier than his dog, a Chihuahua-dachshund mix he called Buppy, and McChicken sandwiches from McDonald's dollar menu — in that order, friends say. "He wasn't afraid to branch out and be friends with everyone," said Zach Rang, a hockey and fishing teammate. "He was a hilarious kid who always made sure that everyone felt included." Like many boys and girls in his neighborhood, Corey started playing hockey after the Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010. He quickly mastered skating, which led to a club team and a childhood filled with predawn practices and weekend tournaments. In a sport where most young players want to be forwards, he agreed to be a defenseman because he was one of the few who could skate well backward. "He was the kid who did whatever you told him to do and never complained," said Chris Hall, the parent who serves as president of the Naperville North Hockey Club. "He was a dependable kid from an involved family. You could count on him to be at every practice and every game." During his final season, Corey was the only player on the Naperville North team who didn't earn a single penalty. It's an unusual statistic for someone playing his rough-and-tumble position, and one made even more surprising given that Naperville North led the conference in penalties at one point. "It says everything about Corey," Hall said. "He wasn't taking runs at people or throwing elbows. He played the game his way and was very good at it." Child pornography The Tribune pieced together what happened to Corey through documents from police and the DuPage County coroner, obtained under the state Freedom of Information Act, as well as interviews with his parents, friends and others. The police reports were heavily redacted and withheld all information about the confrontation at the high school less than two hours before Corey killed himself. The Tribune, though, obtained from other sources a less redacted copy of the police reports, including the report written by the officer who questioned the teen. The DuPage County coroner released its report, which shows police described the case as a "child pornography" investigation. In a statement to the Tribune, Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall called Corey's death a tragedy but said the officer who questioned him acted properly. "At the time of the incident, the Police Department determined that the school resource officer followed proper policies and procedures," Marshall said. Naperville District 203 officials also provided a statement saying the district was "incredibly saddened by Corey's death," but believed it handled the situation appropriately. "At the outset of this incident, we worked to ensure a thorough and fair review of the facts, and involved the appropriate school and law enforcement officials," the statement said. "Our main concern with any matter involving students is fairness, discretion and objectivity. The school district feels confident that we handled this issue appropriately and engaged the right officials pursuant to the protocols and procedures that govern student affairs." On Jan. 11, records show, a female classmate told a dean that she had learned that Corey had a recording of a sexual encounter they had shortly before Christmas, and believed he had played it for friends. Police described her as "mortified," according to the coroner's report. The Tribune was unsuccessful in attempts to reach the girl's family. At lunch that Wednesday, Corey was showing friends the giant Walmart sandwich his mother had packed for him when a school administrator walked up and asked to speak with him. Walgren followed him to an office, where a school dean and a Naperville police officer assigned to the campus were waiting for him. Officer Brett Heun asked Corey if he could download the contents of his phone and remove the "illegal items," according to a police report. Police told the coroner's office that Corey consented to the request and was "very cooperative, forthright and did not appear to be scared." The recording the officer sought ended up being a video file with no discernible images. Police described it as "very dark" and "more of only audio." A lawyer for the family said nothing can be seen in the recording. According to the redacted police records, the officer and school dean spoke with Corey about the recording for 18 minutes before trying to reach his parents. I think they wanted to scare him straight. Instead, they scared him to death. — Maureen Walgren Illinois law requires police to "immediately make a reasonable attempt to notify the parent" after a minor is taken into custody. Unless a juvenile believes that he is free to stop the questioning and walk out of the room, according to a legal expert, he is considered to be in police custody. "There's no question his parents should have been called," said Sheila Bedi, a Northwestern University law professor and an attorney with the school's MacArthur Justice Center. "The clear intent of the law is to give a parent the opportunity to intervene if their child is being interrogated." To be sure, the courts have found that students have fewer rights in a school setting because administrators have a legitimate need to maintain a conducive learning environment. The Illinois Council of School Attorneys' guidelines also state that school resource officers can interview students without parental permission if it's a school-related incident or may have potential consequences for the safety of students or employees. The advisory, published in January 2015, lists as possible situations fights that may result in retaliation on campus, threats made against another student, gang-related offenses and drug possession. But the guidelines also state that when school officials request a police officer to interview a student for law-enforcement purposes, administrators "shall, before allowing the law enforcement agent to interview the student, attempt to contact and obtain permission of the student's parent or guardian." According to the guidelines, schools can skip parental notification in cases where there is imminent danger or if officers need to act promptly to prevent the destruction of evidence in a serious crime. Walgren family attorney Terry Ekl said none of those exemptions would apply in Corey's situation. "Parents of students understandably trust that when they send their children to school, the best interests of their children will be the one and only priority of school staff, including, especially, that any allegations involving misconduct of a child will be handled reasonably," Ekl said. "In this case, the Naperville North High School staff, including the assigned liaison Naperville police officer, violated that trust." After speaking to Corey alone, the dean and police officer tried to reach Doug Walgren on his cellphone. They also tried the family's home phone before calling Maureen Walgren at work. Heun, the officer, talked to Maureen Walgren on a speakerphone with Corey in the room. He told her that her son was being investigated for "child pornography" and could end up being placed on the sex offender registry, Walgren said. Her heart pounding and her head spinning, Walgren asked if she needed to hire a lawyer. Heun told her "no," according to her recollection and the coroner's report, which was based in part on interviews with police. Heun, however, wrote in his police report that he declined to answer the question. "I told her that was a decision she needed to make as I could not influence her one way or the other," Heun wrote. "I explained to her that my goal was to keep this incident out of the courts." Heun suggested the case might be resolved with what is typically called a "station adjustment," a legally sanctioned way of reprimanding minors without formally arresting them. Under state law, punishments can range from a lecture to community service or counseling. A formal station adjustment includes an agreement signed by both the youth and his or her parents, indicating that the juvenile will abide by the terms. "She (Maureen Walgren) stated Corey would fulfill it without a problem," Heun wrote in his report. The officer then told Maureen Walgren he intended to download items from Corey's phone and needed her consent, according to the reports. Walgren, a nurse, said she would leave work immediately and be at the school within 50 minutes. After the phone call ended, the officer and the dean walked Corey to an office waiting area and told him to sit down. The two then went to speak with Principal Stephanie Posey, leaving Corey to wait for his mother. Corey, his parents said, must have realized the gravity of the situation. For years, his parents had lectured him about how bad decisions — especially ones involving sex — could lead to serious problems. Every time there was a news story about a teenager in trouble with police, his mother pointed it out to him. "We had lots of what we called 'Making good choices' conversations," Doug Walgren said. In fact, the Walgrens had had one of those conversations with Corey the previous weekend. He had confided to them he recently had had a sexual encounter, in large part because he told them it had been his first time and he was worried about potential consequences. "It wasn't a comfortable conversation, and we're not proud that we had to have it," Maureen Walgren said. "But we addressed it as a family." Indeed, the family moved ahead and, a few days later, had the forward-looking conversation about college visits. As Maureen Walgren drove to the high school, summoned by authorities, her thoughts alternated between thinking she wanted to "wring" Corey's neck and praying the situation wasn't as bad as she feared. The term "registered sex offender" echoed in her mind. She tried to calm herself by repeating what Heun said about the station adjustment, though she said she texted a friend for advice on hiring a lawyer. "I know how fearful I felt at that moment. I was completely shaken," she said. "I can only imagine what Corey was thinking. He must have been terrified." Maureen Walgren drove straight to the school, arriving 15 minutes earlier than she predicted. Corey, however, had already left.

Maureen Walgren and her husband, Doug, are dealing with the suicide of their 16 year-old son Corey. (Nuccio DiNuzzo/Chicago Tribune) The search After signing into the building, Maureen Walgren immediately asked to see her son. A dean pulled her into an office, shut the door and told her that they couldn't find Corey. She said she assumed he had simply gone back to class. In her mind, it was the only plausible explanation for an increasingly surreal situation. The dean told Walgren that they believed Corey had left the building. She said they asked if there was any reason to believe he would hurt himself. Corey had no history of mental illness or suicidal ideation, according to the coroner's report. He hadn't exhibited any signs of depression in the days before he died or in a routine text exchange about next year's class schedule with his mother that morning. "I told them that under normal circumstances, no, he wouldn't hurt himself," Maureen Walgren said. "But these weren't normal circumstances." Walgren knew Corey parked on a side street near the campus, so she left the building to see if his silver Toyota Highlander was still parked there. She asked the school to contact police so they could begin searching for Corey. School officials found Corey's keys in his backpack, meaning he had likely left on foot. They informed his mother, who then drove home to see if Corey had walked there. When she didn't find him at the house, she headed back to the school, passing through downtown as she drove. At 2:37 p.m., a Naperville police officer spotted the teen sitting on the ledge atop a five-story parking garage located less than a mile from campus. He looked calmly at the patrolman, according to the police report, and did not appear to be in distress. The officer had not been briefed on the situation at the high school and did not know if the teen posed a threat, so he did not approach Corey. Instead, he drove past him and planned to park by a row of nearby cars for cover in case he was dangerous. When he looked back seconds later, Corey was no longer on the ledge. At 2:38 p.m., Corey Walgren — big brother, varsity hockey player, bass fisherman, honor roll student and social coordinator for a tight-knit group of friends — plummeted 53 feet. His mother was about five blocks away. The hospital Minutes after Corey fell, Maureen Walgren called the school again to see if her son had been found. Heun — who had just been notified about the parking garage incident — asked her to return to the school. "She asked if we had found Corey yet and I told her I believed we had found him and I needed her to return to NNHS," Heun wrote in his report. "She asked if Corey was safe and I told her I wasn't sure but I needed her to return to NNHS. She asked if Corey was in the hospital and I told her I wasn't sure and again told her I needed her to come back to NNHS so I could talk with her." When Walgren arrived at the school, Heun told her that someone had fallen from the parking garage and was injured. Dreading the answer, she asked if the person had curly, strawberry blond hair. Heun didn't know. She asked what the person was wearing, but Heun didn't have that information either, the police report shows. Walgren told Heun she wished he had told her about the parking deck when she was downtown so she could have driven there — though no police officer would knowingly send a victim's mother to such a scene. A doctor who happened to be passing by immediately began treating Corey, who was still breathing. Maureen Walgren knows this now and is haunted by the thought of not being with her son in those last moments. "I was so close when it happened," she said. "I'm a nurse. I could have done something. I could have at least ridden in the ambulance with him so he wasn't alone. I could have held my son's hand while he took his final breaths." As Heun drove Walgren to Naperville's Edward Hospital, the police department emailed him pictures from the parking deck security cameras. The images were of such poor quality that it was impossible to make out the color of the person's hair or clothes. Maureen Walgren asked to look at the images and immediately recognized Corey's gait, the shoulders that were identical to his father's and the clothes he had worn to school that day. There was no doubt it was her child. "And I knew immediately that he was dead," she said. "I just knew it in my heart." She called her husband, a software engineer who had started a new job in Schaumburg that week, and told him he needed to get to the hospital. She didn't tell him why. She didn't want him driving all that way knowing what had happened. When Maureen Walgren arrived at the hospital, she was taken to a private room and her fears were confirmed. Corey had been pronounced dead at 3:27 p.m., less than three hours after he had been called into the dean's office. A doctor explained how they tried to save Corey's life, but his injuries were too severe. Doug Walgren arrived a half-hour later and also was told Corey was dead. He began having chest pains and trouble breathing, according to police reports, but he repeatedly refused to be admitted to the hospital. "I needed to see Corey," he said. There has to be a change in their policy and their procedures. Corey's death cannot go by with no meaning at all. — Maureen Walgren No. 18 More than 2,000 people attended Corey Walgren's wake, including several area hockey teams in their game sweaters. His hockey club decided not to play in the tournament scheduled for the weekend after Corey's death, so its archrival Naperville Central volunteered to take Naperville North's spot and played in Corey's memory. In a Hollywood script, Naperville North would have overcome the tragedy and lifted a trophy at the season's end. Instead, the team won only a couple more games and suffered an early exit from the playoffs. "Obviously, our first thought was that we wanted to win for our guy," teammate and close friend Michael Hall said. "But in our hearts, we knew the season was over as soon as we were told what happened. Hockey wasn't in the forefront of our minds anymore. There was just such a huge hole in our lives." The team retired Corey's No. 18 sweater, a number he chose because he was a member of the Class of 2018. It also created the Corey Walgren Memorial Trophy, an honor given to a varsity player who has earned the respect of teammates and coaches "through dedication, hustle and exemplary sportsmanship." Corey's younger siblings — Josh, 14, and Shannon, 11 — are also still learning to cope without their older brother, who they had always relied on to come up with games and stories to keep them entertained. They have insisted their parents maintain all the traditions Corey enjoyed, including the annual Super Bowl party that they had always thrown to celebrate Corey's Feb. 5 birthday. Three weeks after Corey's death, they had 50 people over to watch the game in the family's finished basement, the place where Corey's friends had spent countless hours playing video games and shinny hockey. His parents hadn't been in the basement since Corey's death, but they were willing to hold the gathering if it comforted Josh and Shannon. They ordered the six-foot Subway sandwich Corey always liked and found solace in the stories that friends and family shared that night. "We all have waves of grief and it hits us at certain times," Doug Walgren said. "And we're the only ones who can help each other through it." Corey's parents continue to struggle with their son's death and the circumstances surrounding it. Several weeks ago, Edward Hospital notified them that 19 employees from the hospital and its affiliates had accessed Corey's medical records after his death without authorization, an unsettling invasion that reflects the widespread curiosity about his suicide and compounded the family's grief. Doug and Maureen Walgren plan to file a lawsuit against both the school district and the police department. They hope legal action will spur the school and police to rethink how they handle future incidents involving minors. "There has to be a change in their policy and their procedures," Maureen Walgren said. "Corey's death cannot go by with no meaning at all." The Walgrens have had minimal contact with school officials or the police department, though Maureen Walgren contacted Naperville North a few months ago to ask for a copy of Corey's final report card. "He had worked so hard to a get a B in pre-calculus," she said. "I wanted to have a proof of that. I wanted to have proof that he had done it." And he had. sstclair@chicagotribune.com Twitter @StacyStClair Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Crime Mental Health Research Hospitals and Clinics Naperville Medical Research Ice Hockey College Basketball Sports Breaking Eat.Drink.Do.

But Wal-Mart trains about a quarter-million of its employees a year in more advanced skills. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Harry Friedman has run a consultancy training entry-level retail workers in customer service and other basics for 35 years. But in all his years, he has not retrained retail workers for new skills. "Nope; we do none of it," he says. "I don't know that anybody does any of it." Many retail workers are undergoing what economists call "job displacement," meaning they are losing their jobs largely because of major technological shifts. Layoffs in traditional retail have accelerated sharply this year, with hundreds of store closings and nine U.S. chains filing for bankruptcy so far in 2017. Most of those losing their jobs are low-skilled, entry-level workers, while retailers look instead to bolster the e-commerce sides of their businesses, hiring for higher-skilled positions such as logistics and warehousing. Whereas some industries invest to retrain their workers with new skills for new times, to date the retail industry has not successfully done that. Friedman says that is not good news for the laid-off workers. "It's a pretty bleak picture, I'm sorry to say," he says. Staff and training in general are not top priorities for most retailers, he says, making things tough on his business. Friedman compares retail to other businesses displaced by technology. "It's like owning a film processing store or a travel agency; it's kind of tough," he says. Business Retailers Scrambling To Adjust To Changing Consumer Habits Various industries continue to struggle to keep their workforce apace with the demand for more technical know-how. Manufacturing, for example, requires higher order computing skills on the assembly line, so workers have had to train up. Retail is increasingly diverse, what experts call "omnichannel," meaning most retailers sell through a hybrid of online and traditional stores. Hiring is most in demand for work in e-commerce: warehousing, logistics and technology. The National Retail Federation says that to better equip people for those new jobs, it launched a training and certification program for workers. Maureen Conway is skeptical that will work. Conway, who is executive director of the Economic Opportunities Program for the Aspen Institute, notes the industry backed a similar certification program over a decade ago. "Unfortunately, it didn't seem that retailers valued somebody with this certificate versus somebody who didn't," she says. There are myriad challenges to retraining in retail. Frieda Molina, deputy director of MDRC, a social research group, says many retail workers simply don't want to stay in the industry. Business Its Survival In Doubt, Sears Struggles To Transform Once Again "It's hard to make that case to them, given the more negative reputation of retail, and the fact that many people at that lower level don't have the resources to be able to invest time and effort and lost wages potentially, in getting additional training," she says. Kathryn Shaw, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, says manufacturing adapted in a way that retail cannot. "These [manufacturing workers] who need to be retrained were both highly paid, on average, and pretty skilled," she says, so there was a strong economic incentive for them to retrain and retool for the more complex jobs. Retail workers, by comparison, tend to be young and don't intend to make a career in retail because of the relatively low pay. "They're not very skilled to begin with, and they're not very attached to the industry," she says. Shaw says when factories closed, their workers lived in a community, which made it easier to target them for retraining. By contrast, retail workers tend to be far more dispersed, geographically, making them harder to target for such programs. Wal-Mart realizes it has a workforce challenge. Two years ago, the retailer started an academy that trains about a quarter-million of its employees a year, while they work, in more advanced skills. Business Demographic Shifts Contribute To The Changing Face Of Retail Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer for Wal-Mart, says the training — for both in-store and online operations — has paid off in higher comparable-store sales and improved customer service marks. "It is very economic for retailers to invest in their people at all levels," she says. McLaughlin says Wal-Mart is trying to partner with other large retailers to develop industrywide training standards. "Retailers do need to look at their people, and create paths for them that are exciting, and provide the skills they need to succeed, not only in the jobs of today, but as these jobs continue to evolve," she says.
