PART: 1 2 3 4 Part 2 Walmart to Acquire Jet.com: Will It Be Enough to Beat Amazon? PART 2 OF 4 Is Walmart Paying Too Much for Jet? By Adrian Stevens  | Aug 11, 2016 4:21 pm EST Why price doesn’t matter much to Walmart Walmart (WMT) has been criticized for overpaying for the one-year-old startup, Jet.com. Although Walmart didn’t share any details about Jet’s revenues or profitability, we do know that Jet is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies and is gaining a foothold among urban and Millennial customers in the United States (IVV). The combination of Walmart’s retail expertise and Jet’s offerings could certainly strengthen Walmart’s competitive positioning against Amazon (AMZN) and other brick-and-mortar rivals, including Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Macy’s (M). As you can see in the graph below, e-commerce sales in the United States are expected to rise. Through this new acquisition, Walmart is clearly looking to leverage the huge US retail e-commerce market. Fundamentally, Walmart overpaid for Jet Jet is yet to prove its business model, especially in the absence of profits. The company’s CEO (chief executive officer) Marc Lore expects the company to be profitable by 2020. The company has also burned a substantial amount of cash on marketing. Jet also failed to deliver on its earlier promises. It dropped its annual membership fee of $50 in order to stay competitive and attract buyers. The strategy led the company to lose out on shipping while lowering the discounts it offers. One of Jet’s key differentiators is its lower prices, which could be a threat to Amazon.

Ben Sun, an early Jet investor, writes about his optimism for the e-commerce site's sale to Walmart by Ben Sun Aug 11, 2016, 8:00am EDT tweet share Linkedin Marc Lore, CEO of e-commerce site Jet.com, which was recently acquired by Walmart. We were thrilled to wake up to Monday’s headlines announcing Walmart’s $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com — the largest U.S. e-commerce transaction to date, but a small price to pay, given Walmart’s $230 billion market cap and drive to secure a toehold against its main rival, Amazon. Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart — the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart. It’s no surprise that Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart; led by Marc Lore, co-founder of Quidsi (parent of Diapers.com), the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart, which has been playing catch-up to Amazon’s e-commerce domination for years. As the only New York-based seed fund in Jet’s first round (we invested alongside New Enterprise Associates, Accel, Bain Capital Ventures and MentorTech), Primary Venture Partners has long believed in the company’s strategic vision. With Lore at the helm — he’s a repeat entrepreneur looking to make huge waves in a pool he knows so well — this investment decision was one that we immediately jumped at when we were given the chance two short years ago. The balance that’s hard to beat First, a bit about the titan that Jet has been challenging. Amazon has built a successful $240 billion business by leveraging its scale to find the right balance of price, selection and convenience. Finding that right balance enables consumers to buy anything they want, whenever they want, with just the few clicks of a button, and at prices that rival any brick-and-mortar store. It has shaped the way we think, the way we shop and the way we demand, and it’s largely responsible for our dwindling patience when it comes to waiting in lines. Amazon has come closest to finding that balance with Amazon Prime, which gives users free one- or two-day shipping on most items for just $99 per year (or $10.99 per month, for the commitment-phobic). The offering makes up the majority of Amazon’s gross merchandise volume, and Prime subscribers are increasing by leaps and bounds (the Prime customer base grew from 19 million to 63 million in the last year). Moreover, subscribers making twice as many purchases and spending more than double, on average, than non-Prime customers. With market share of 42 percent of the ecommerce market, and more than 7 percent of total retail sales occurring online, there’s no one who can beat Amazon at its own game in the foreseeable future. There’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality — it is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier Prime is a great deal for consumers, to be sure, enabling them to make impulse purchases with nary a thought to back-end shipping costs and logistics. But there’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality. With Prime, Amazon has made itself an indispensable way of life for consumers who want to log on and quickly purchase any item they need, whenever they need it — be it a few sticks of deodorant or a flat-panel TV — without any consideration for shipping costs. This way of shopping, while attractive from the consumer side, is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier. Amazon has attempted to streamline fulfillment through programs like Vendor Flex, which it launched in 2013 in an attempt to ship goods faster and cheaper by co-locating an Amazon fulfillment center within a manufacturer’s warehouse. The arrangement has eliminated many overhead and shipping costs, enabling Amazon to sell diapers and other items cheaper than its competitors. Amazon building a warehouse next to where P&G stores its Pampers allows the company to sell a pack of Pampers at the lowest price. However, if a customer wants to add to that purchase a small bottle of California Baby Lotion (which is not owned by P&G), that item will be shipped from a different warehouse, which means that the additional costs of shipping ultimately fall to the customer. However, if a supplier could combine the two items into one box, it could pass those shipping savings onto the customer and offer a better price. It was this notion that Marc Lore and the Jet team went after, knowing that they couldn’t compete with Amazon for single-unit orders. Fighting back with a price-first approach In his time at Quidsi, Lore had a front-row seat as Amazon snowballed and gained more and more traction. He realized that he could never beat Amazon at its own game, but he observed the structural weakness of the single-unit purchase consumer mentality, and found his angle of attack. He launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. So while Amazon tinkers with finding the perfect balance between price, selection and convenience, Jet prioritizes price, in hopes of being the go-to e-commerce platform for those that value price (which are a lot of people).. Marc Lore launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. From his years in ecommerce, Lore understands better than most that designing a site experience and back-end fulfillment infrastructure to support multiple-unit orders is very different than the processes involved in single-unit orders. He built Jet from the ground up with the specific customer experience, marketing, technology, supply chain, fulfillment logistics and infrastructure processes to encourage and support multi-unit purchases. Lore realized that if he got this right, it’s a model that Amazon wouldn’t be able to easily (if ever) replicate with its existing infrastructure that’s so squarely focused on single-unit purchases. We’ve seen this same price versus multi-unit purchase battle between Costco and Walmart. Seemingly after a similar customer, the discount retailers are vying for market share with two vastly different business models: Walmart via sheer scale and enormous selection of goods (it carries 120,000 SKUs and boasts a $230 market cap), and Costco via a warehouse model that makes most of its revenue on annual membership fees. Costco’s membership fee offers a big advantage for customers, as it enables Costco to sell its wares at the lowest prices without having to sweat its negligible profit margins. Those low prices, in turn, encourage customers to purchase more items at once — an approach that has resulted in an average Costco order of almost $400. So despite having fewer retail stores than Walmart and only 4,000 SKUs, Costco has been able to claim a meaningful position in the market, with a $75 billion market cap to boot. The moral of the story? With a differentiated merchandising strategy and the right infrastructure in place, a meaningful portion of the consumer population can be trained to value price over selection and convenience. Jet’s strategy offers Walmart a critical toehold Jet is chipping away at Amazon’s e-commerce dominance in the same way, and its success just 12 months out of the gate has proven that the battle for the e-commerce kingdom is far from over. The company has already hit a $1 billion run-rate gross merchandise value. It’s no wonder, then, that Jet is such an attractive buy for Walmart, which has been modeling its e-commerce strategy on Amazon’s for years. That mimicry hasn’t gotten the company very far, however, with Amazon far outpacing it in every facet of the digital game. Walmart now realizes that its path to success lies in fighting back in a nontraditional way, and has chosen Jet as its key differentiator. Jet gives Walmart a smart, alternative model for competing with Amazon. Rather than struggling to find that same balance of price, convenience and selection that Amazon has nearly perfected with Prime, Jet strives to gain loyal customers by valuing price above all. Lore and his founding team of repeat entrepreneurs are playing their own game by their own rules, and in Jet they’ve built an operation that’s already claimed a meaningful share of the ecommerce market. Backed by Walmart’s supplier clout, customer reach, and balance sheet strength, we expect Team Jet to be upping their game radically in the months and years to come.

In a press release, CVS officially announced CVS Pay, a barcode-based solution to paying for goods and prescriptions in the company’s retail locations. CVS Pay is very similar to Walmart Pay, namely in that it is operated entirely through the recently updated CVS app. Once a user adds their debit or credit card(s) to the CVS app, they present the cashier with a barcode or a pickup number displayed in the app. Once the barcode has been scanned, users can choose a card to pay with, initiate the process, and ultimately sign for the purchase if required. One benefit of CVS Pay that the company is touting is its support for Heath Savings Account and Flex Spending Account cards. Because so much of the business CVS does is prescriptions, many users would need to use one of those cards to checkout. There’s also support for MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover, so if a user needs to split a prescription purchase from the rest of their purchase, they can do just that. CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty rewards is also built directly into the new CVS app. The ultimate goal of CVS Pay, the company says, is to “use digital tools to drive convenience.” CVS Pay is the latest solution from CVS Health that uses digital tools to drive convenience, as the company continues to develop and invest in new ways to make healthy lifestyles easier and more accessible for customers nationwide. Shortly after the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, CVS began disabling NFC terminals in stores in favor of the CurrentC mobile payments solution, which has since seen better days itself. Apple responded to CVS and other retailers shutting off NFC terminals, explaining the early success of Apple Pay and the response from users. Since then, some of the MCX/CurrentC retailers have started supporting Apple Pay, including Best Buy and Rite Aid, but Walmart and CVS have instead decided to launch their own services. CVS Pay can be accessed via the CVS app, which is available on the App Store now. CVS Pay is currently supported at locations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, with a nationwide rollout expected by the end of this year. The full press release is below: CVS Pharmacy Launches Breakthrough, End-to-End Mobile Payment Experience WOONSOCKET, R.I., Aug. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) today announced the launch of CVS Pay , a new, end-to-end mobile payment solution at CVS Pharmacy. CVS Pay now part of the CVS Pharmacy mobile app integrates payment, prescription pickup and the ExtraCare loyalty program all in one quick scan at checkout. CVS Pay is the latest solution from CVS Health that uses digital tools to drive convenience, as the company continues to develop and invest in new ways to make healthy lifestyles easier and more accessible for customers nationwide. “Over the past year, our digital team has brought to market numerous new digital tools like CVS Pay that make shopping at CVS Pharmacy easier and more convenient,” said Brian Tilzer, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, CVS Health. “We’ve been excited by the level of customer adoption of these digital solutions, and we will continue our quick pace of innovation and deployment to make our customers’ health care experience even easier.” CVS Pay offers more than just a payment solution: customers can now use their CVS Pharmacy mobile app to streamline their checkout experience at the store combining multiple steps into one easy scan. For customers picking up a prescription, CVS Pay offers a simple, private and end-to-end pharmacy experience. Customers will have the ability to refill, manage multiple prescriptions and get alerts when prescriptions are ready, all within the app and then pick up and pay using a single barcode. Customers can also link their ExtraCare card with CVS Pay, meaning a single scan at checkout will process all ExtraCare deals, earn new rewards and handle payment for the transaction. To use CVS Pay, customers simply add any of their credit or debit cards in the CVS Pharmacy app. When they are ready to check out at a CVS Pharmacy store, they’ll show the store associate the barcode in their app. (At the drive-thru, they’ll share their pickup number.) The associate will scan the barcode, ring up the purchases, let the customer choose a payment method from those stored in the app, and then process the payment. All verifications for prescriptions and payment like name/birthdate, signature, and PIN take place directly in the app, so transactions are hassle free. Once complete, the customer will receive a confirmation of payment in the app. CVS Pay is currently available in select markets, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware and a nationwide rollout is expected to kick off later this year. The solution is available on iOS and Android devices the same platforms the CVS Pharmacy app is available on today and works with all major credit (MasterCard, Visa, Discover, American Express), debit, Health Savings Account, and Flexible Spending Account cards. About CVS Pharmacy CVS Pharmacy, the retail division of CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), is America’s leading retail pharmacy with over 9,600 locations. It is the first national pharmacy to end the sale of tobacco and the first pharmacy in the nation to receive the Community Pharmacy accreditation from URAC, the leading health care accreditation organization that establishes quality standards for the health care industry.

Yes, that’s right — there’s yet another way for you to pay with your phone. But CVS’ method, like that of Walmart Pay and Starbucks, is a mobile payment solution that uses a barcode. So unlike the top dogs — Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay — it’s not using near field communication or Magnetic Secure Transmission — you have to open the CVS Pharmacy app, add your credit card information, pull up your barcode at the register, and have the clerk scan your phone. You then choose one of the payment methods you have added and that’s it, your order has been processed and you’ll see confirmation in the app. If you’re at a CVS drive-thru, you only need to share a pickup number, and for prescriptions, you’ll need to verify your identity through the app before orders are processed. Related: Walmart Pay is here to enhance your Walmart shopping experience If you’re a CVS ExtraCare customer, you can link your ExtraCare card to CVS Pay so that you only need to use your phone to access all ExtraCare deals and rewards, and handle payment. The company says CVS Pay is currently available in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, but the feature will see a nationwide rollout “later this year.” CVS Pay works with all major credit cards — including MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express –debit cards, Health Savings Accounts, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

Published Aug 11th, 2016 3:16 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Recruiting doctors to Northwest Arkansas is a constant challenge. That’s why the Walmart Foundation has awarded a $750,000 grant to the new Northwest Arkansas Community Internal Medicine Residency Program. Foundation and medical industry officials announced the program Thursday (Aug. 12) at Mercy Hospital in Rogers. The Walmart Foundation gift will go toward covering the residency program’s first two years of operating costs, including residents’ salaries. There are some federal funding sources that should kick in after year two, but program officials said they are also looking for endowment funds to ensure the program is sustainable long term. “The Walmart Foundation aims to enhance the lives of families in northwest Arkansas and understands the importance of job training and education when it comes to recruiting and retaining top medical talent,” said Julie Gehrki, senior director of the Walmart Foundation. “We are very proud to support this partnership and help advance great physicians seeking a meaningful career in healthcare.” Mercy Health System Northwest, Veterans Health Care of the Ozarks and the Little Rock-based University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences are partnering in the new program that began with its first eight resident physicians at the end of June. The program is based at the UAMS campus in Fayetteville. Five of the physicians are serving their residencies at Mercy Health System Northwest Arkansas in Rogers, while the other three are at the Veterans Health Center of the Ozarks in Fayetteville. All eight will practice at both locations as well as the residency continuity clinic on the UAMS campus in Fayetteville. The program is expected to grow over the next two years until there are 24 residents by 2018. The program is a step to solving the major shortage of residency programs across the state and particularly in Northwest Arkansas. The doctors said Northwest Arkansas is short about 148 residents which equates to about 3,700 missed appointments a day for those needing to see a doctor. Gehrki said the missed appointments were a staggering statistic that resonated with the Foundation because the missed appointments are likely among the underserved by healthcare. “We are thrilled to partner with the Walmart Foundation to bring more talented physicians to train – and, hopefully, stay – in Northwest Arkansas,” said program director Dr. Thomas Schulz, an associate professor in the UAMS College of Medicine’s Department of Internal Medicine. He said the program received accreditation in September 2015 from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. “We received 237 applications and we selected 35 for interview and we ended up with a class of eight. We wanted those doctors with a pioneer sort of spirit because this is a brand new program. We ended up with a very special inaugural class,” Dr. Shulz said. Residents are trained in a variety of internal medicine subspecialties including critical care medicine, cardiology, emergency medicine, geriatric medicine, gastroenterology, oncology and pulmonary disease. The residency program is important to the region’s effort to address its doctor shortage, especially with regard to primary care doctors who treat adults and the elderly, said Dr. Steve Goss, president of Mercy Clinic Northwest Arkansas. The number of students graduating from schools of medicine and osteopathy is growing, but the number of residencies lags, he said. Mercy wants to do its part to help educate the next generation of doctors by giving them an intensive clinical experience. Mercy also wants to be part of building northwest Arkansas as a destination for great health care, and the residency program is part of that, Goss said. “We believe if we train them here, many of them will stay here. It’s another way to attract great physicians,” he said. “The field for these residents is highly competitive. Imagine going through the expense of completing your medical degree and then not being able to find a place to do your residency. There is very little a doctor can do until they complete their residency program.” Earlier this year Goss told Talk Business & Politics that as the local region continues to expand and health care providers open more clinics to bring care closer to home, the shortage of doctors and other advanced practitioners has worsened. Mercy Hospital in Rogers announced plans to recruit and hire 100 new doctors as part of their 5-year $247 million expansion plan. Goss said it’s getting a little easier to recruit doctors to the region, but they hope to also build a pipeline of new resident doctors with the new internal residency program. He said the program also gives the hospital a three-year trial period with the residents and hopefully they will be able to retain many of these doctors once they finish their residency. The first eight residents in the new program include doctors from near and far away. • Dr. Sonia Chaudhary, University Medical College Faisalabad in Faisalabad, Pakistan • Dr. Chris Finlay, UAMS • Dr. Nhanmy Huynh, St. George’s University School of Medicine, Grenada, West Indies • Dr. Naveen Kallarackal, Ross University School of Medicine, Portsmouth, Dominica • Dr. Matthew Neoh, UAMS • Dr. Mark Shelnutt, UAMS • Dr. Kristopher Stepps, UAMS • Dr. Michelle Valentine, Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Parker, Colo. “We are excited at Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks for this opportunity to partner with UAMS for the internal medicine residency program,” said Bryan Matthews, medical center director. “Through its partnerships with affiliated academic institutions, VA conducts the largest education and training effort for health professionals in the nation. Our affiliation with UAMS will continue this effort, and ensure that medical professionals are well trained to meet the unique needs of veterans.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 17shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ken Smith What will a Trump presidency mean for Arkansas’ advanced energy economy?

It will use some of those resources to double down on its digital operations.  As plans go, it isn't a bad one — that's what Walmart, after all, is doing. Earlier this year, Walmart announced plans to close 269 stores, with 154 in the US. It still is willing to invest in new stores in strategic markets — it has plans to open more than 300 stores for this fiscal year — but it is determined to crack the online sales nut. Just this week it announced it was investing $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com. The playbook, in other words, is a familiar one in these post-Amazon days. Integrate online sales with the brick-and-mortar operation so it is one seamless entity for consumers who don’t want to be limited to one channel. To be sure, the solution is not as straightforward as all that. In Macy's case, many of its stores represent valuable real estate that the company is better off monetizing. At least that has been the argument of its activist shareholders for a while. Can Macy's Get It Right? But leaving such complexities aside, why can't retailers get the main point right — that is, deliver a worthwhile omnichannel solution. More urgently, can Macy's finally get this formula right? One sign that it really does intend to shake up the house was the announcement in June that CEO Terry Lundgren was stepping down. A luminary among retail executives, Lundgren was responsible for putting Macy's on the retail map back in the day. Unfortunately, he is also a strong — and some might say stubborn — supporter of the brick-and-mortar department store model.  Transparent Pricing This could be just how Lundgren came up in the industry, but there are other reasons why Macy’s and retailers in general are not enthusiastic fans of online sales: they make pricing just a wee bit too transparent. In the first quarter, Macy's lowered its guidance for margin in part because price transparency was increasing online, according to comments made by CFO Karen Hoguet. Specifically, she said this in response to a question about her view of longer term consolidated gross margin: "Well, I think the transparency is in part why we've lowered the guidance for margin. When we release the fourth quarter we had talked about the gross margin being up this year and we no longer think that will be the case. So I think that's where that came into play." Macy's Is Big on Retail Tech The irony is, Macy's has been a fervent believer in investing in retail technology as can be been in this CMSWire interview with Yasir Anwar, head of Digital Technology and Group Vice President at Macy's. Anwar is also the founder of Macy's Labs, which is focused on experimental digital initiatives. "We have built an organizational DNA that allows us to innovate frequently," Anwar told us in February 2016. "We are able to easily build something and experiment and make changes quickly so the shape of the product we are creating is defined by the customers." One example, he said, was m by Macy's, an experimental mobile optimized website in which curated deals are offered in various categories. More recently — just last month in fact — Macy's announced the pilot of "Macy's On Call," a mobile web tool that uses IBM Watson to answer natural language questions about a store's product line up. Tweaking the Experience But it may be that Macy’s would be better off focusing on that original formula — the omnichannel experience, Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, told CMSWire. "There are simple things Macy’s can do to marry online shopping, the retail experience and shipping," he said. Based on Macy's statements about its store closure plans, the retailer plans to invest some of the savings in back office operations, better logistics and its private label stock. All of this, Caporaso said, can be woven into an omnichannel plan. If, that is, Macy's really wants to do so.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Lake Wales police rescue child from locked car Thursday Aug 11, 2016 at 2:41 PM The father and grandmother of a 3-year-old girl face charges of child neglect without bodily harm after they left her in an SUV on Wednesday with only a vent cracked when they went into a Wal-Mart. By Marilyn Meyer The Ledger LAKE WALES — The father and grandmother of a 3-year-old girl face charges of child neglect without bodily harm after they left her in an SUV on Wednesday with only a vent cracked when they went into a Wal-Mart. The child was treated and released from Lake Wales Medical Center and suffered no apparent injuries, Lake Wales police Lt. David Black said in a news release. Timothy Adams, 28, and Anna Adams, 57, both of 1495 Meadowlark Trail, Frostproof, were booked into the Polk County Jail. Each told investigators they thought the other adult had taken the child out of the SUV. Shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday, a customer notified Wal-Mart employees that a child was alone in a vehicle with the windows rolled up, according to a news release. When police officers arrived, they found a Honda Element not running, the windows up except for rear vents that were cracked open and a child who appeared to be crying. The little girl was communicating with the officers but was sweating, her hair stuck to her forehead and her cheeks red. Officer Matt Rhoden broke a front passenger window and Sgt. Bruce Yoxall pulled her out of the vehicle. “The child clung to Sgt. Yoxall, wrapping her arms around his neck and laying her head on his shoulder,” Black said. The temperature at the time was 86 degrees, partially cloudy, with humidity at 74 percent and a feels-like temperature of 95 degrees, Black said. The child was in the car for more than 20 minutes, he said. Temperatures in an enclosed car rise rapidly, putting anyone inside, whether child or pet, in danger of sunstroke and eventual death. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, when the outside temperature is 85 degrees, the air inside an enclosed car can reach 104 degrees in 10 minutes, 114 degrees in 20 minutes, and 128 degrees in an hour. Video shows the Honda Element being parked at 3:44 p.m. Four minutes later, Timothy Adams gets out of the SUV and takes his 6-year-old daughter from the rear passenger seat and pushes her in a shopping cart toward the store. Anna Adams gets out of the driver's door and follows about 20 feet behind, Black said. “She appeared to look back at the vehicle on several occasions as she is passing it and walking away from it,” Black said. The Wards returned to the vehicle after they were paged in the store, Black said. Officers worked with the Florida Department of Children and Families to find a safe place for the children. — Marilyn Meyer can be reached at marilyn.meyer@theledger.com or 863-802-7558.

Walmart Acquisition Could Mean Most Jet Customers Have To Pay Sales Tax Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Acquisition Could Mean Most Jet Customers Have To Pay Sales Tax Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 11, 2016 1:28 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup wal-jet walmart jet acquisitions mergers and acquisitions sales tax E-commerce companies don’t have to collect sales tax from customers who live in states where they have no physical presence, which could be anything from their headquarters to a distribution center. That’s been one of the advantages that Jet has had in the marketplace over its chief rival Amazon, which has facilities in 28 states, including the most populous ones. Jet customers in most states don’t have to pay sales tax. However, that could change soon, after Walmart’s acquisition of the young e-commerce company. The Wall Street Journal explains that Jet has physical presences (distribution centers or offices) in seven states, so only shoppers in Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Utah have to pay sales tax on purchases from the site. Walmart, on the other hand, has a physical presence in all 50 states. While integrating Walmart’s inventory on the Jet site would expand its offerings and create all sorts of exciting savings using the company’s cart-building algorithm, integrating with Walmart to that extent would mean losing its advantage in states that have a sales tax. Jet founder Marc Lore sold his previous company, Quidsi (Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com), to Amazon, and it operates independently from Amazon’s distribution network. So does Zappos.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Back-to-School Sale: Walmart vs. Target Deals on School Supplies By Jennifer Riley Aug 11, 2016 | 1:16 PM Frenzied parents towing their children to Walmart, Target and other big box stores for back-to-school supplies in August, is an annual tradition that is as much exciting for kids as it is exhausting for parents. To save parents some time and energy, we've done the research to see whether Walmart or Target has the better deal on popular items on school supply lists. Check out the deals below and see which store you should go to and save a trip. Markers Perennial favorite Crayola Markers which boasts "Preferred by Teachers!" on its cover is the same price at Walmart as it is at Target. A pack of 10 classic color Crayola Markers is $0.97 at both stores, but Target notes that the regular price is $0.99 and the $0.97 is the sale price. Also Target has the bonus that patrons who spend $30 on school supplies will get a $5 giftcard. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Wide-Ruled Loosed Leaf Paper 150 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper comes in at a cool $0.82 at Walmart and 125 sheets of similar filler paper at Target is $0.75 a pack. Walmart is the better deal here. Crayons A set of 24 Crayola Classic Color Pack of Crayons, 24 count, is only $0.50 at Walmart while at Target a comparable set but with the benefit of being labeled nontoxic is $1.37 #2 pencils Walmart has cheaper #2 pencils, with a 20 pack being sold for only $0.97 while at Target a pack of 24 #2 pencils from the generic store brand up&up is $3.94 – that's a big difference. Glue Another school favorite, Elmer's washable school glue, sells for just $0.50 for a 4 fl oz bottle at Walmart while the exact same glue sells for $1.03 at Target – that's more than double the price! School Box Both Walmart and Target carry the Advantus clear pencil box but at Walmart it's $2.00 while at Target it's $2.04. Overall it seems like Walmart beats Target when price are compared on an individual basis, but if you expect to spend over $30 on supplies, you may find that Target's spend $30 and get $5 giftcard more rewarding.

Skip to content People Crime News Courts & Trials Cold Cases Crime Underground Meth Lab 'Stumbled Upon' Beneath a Wal-Mart Parking Lot, N.Y. Police Say By Harriet Sokmensuer•@hgsokmensuer Posted on August 11, 2016 at 10:45am EST Share Tweet Email Pinterest YouTube Authorities say they are investigating an underground meth lab that was “stumbled upon” earlier this week beneath a Wal-Mart parking lot in western New York, PEOPLE confirms. Police discovered the lab while conducting a separate investigation of the area, in a culvert near the parking lot of an Amherst Wal-Mart on Monday afternoon, Amherst police detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto tells PEOPLE. (Other businesses share the Wal-Mart parking lot, DiNoto says.) DiNoto calls the lab’s discovery “strange” since the town does not deal with many meth-related crimes. “[Meth] is becoming more common but certainly not commonplace,” she says. Soon after the discovery, members of the New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Evidence Recovery Team, which deals with meth labs and dangerous chemical situations, arrived at the scene, DiNoto says. The parking lot was not evacuated during the search – the area was not believed to be dangerous, DiNoto tells PEOPLE. She says the lab was small and included a pair of goggles and a makeshift table made out of a piece of wood on an old tire. Investigators wore Hazmat suits as they cleared evidence, including spray cans and various chemicals believed to be methamphetamine, from the underground lab, DiNoto says. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

However, they do believe the suspects entered the underground lab through the culvert, which opens up behind the Wal-Mart. There are no known suspects at this time, DiNoto says, but officials are hoping to identify the lab operators using Wal-Mart surveillance footage. “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, tells PEOPLE in a statement. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Lt. DiNoto believes the suspects are local teenagers who are familiar with the culvert and its surrounding wooded area, calling it their “stomping ground.” “It was definitely someone who knew [the culvert] was there and played in it a million times,” DiNoto says. “And one day was like, ‘Oh this would be a nice private place to do our business without being discovered.’ “ Show Full Article See Also More People Logo Aunt of Girl Killed in Tennessee School Bus Crash Shares Grief: ‘Sometimes You Just Have to Break Down’ John Bobbitt Speaks Out 23 Years After Infamous Attack: How is His Life Now?

August 11, 2016 Why did Walmart take the unusual step to tackle chemicals? Michelle Mauthe Harvey Director, Supply Chain Environmental Defense Fund Related Stories Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Building an Effective Data Acquisition Strategy: Acquiring Product Material and Compliance Data Addressing Supply Chain Risk, Sustainability in Strategic Plans Co-op, Nestle, Sainsbury’s to Cut Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Manufacturers: Sustainability is Everyone’s Responsibility Related Topics All EL Stories Guest Column Products & Planning Sustainability Sustainable Facilities Sustainable Packaging & Paper Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Walmart recently announced progress on its groundbreaking Sustainable Chemistry Policy, a 2013 plan that set the stage for some 700 suppliers to rethink how they make more than 90,000 home and personal care products. Result: The world’s largest retailer drove out more than 11,000 tons – 23 million pounds, or 95 percent by weight – of prioritized chemicals from that group of products in less than 30 months. A lot still remains to be done. But this story is a good one and Walmart’s leadership, sustainability team and buyers – deserve credit for what they accomplished. What’s perhaps equally extraordinary is that they chose to do so at all. Sustainability wins are typically also economic wins. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and your energy expenses drop. Address water use in drought-prone areas, and you avoid costly supply chain disruptions that cause price spikes and make customers unhappy. But chemicals? The business case can be thin to none. Changing chemicals is difficult and risky Even when the science says it’s time to make a change because one or more legal ingredients we once believed to be safe turn out not to be – changing a product formula without changing the product can be difficult. It also takes time: on average 18 to 24 months. Product ingredients are the smell, the feel and the way a product cleans or softens or does whatever it’s supposed to do. Change it, and you risk sales if customers reject the alternative. There are few-to-no marketing wins here, either. Despite the fact that pretty much everything and everybody is a chemical mixture, people don’t want “better” chemistry. They want no chemistry, and keep looking for chemical-free products that don’t exist. Walmart decided to tackle ingredient chemistry anyway. It begs the question: Even with years of persistent nudging from Environmental Defense Fund, why would Walmart do this? Three plausible business reasons One answer is that customers – along with scientists, advocates and bloggers – were really starting to voice concerns over chemicals in products, so it made good business sense to respond. Another is that the timing was right. A lot of companies were already making formulation changes, so a request for improvements could be achievable. Also important to note is that Walmart and other retailers have paid hefty fines over improper product disposal. So eliminating regulated substances from product ingredients could reduce the risk of more penalties. All three are plausible business reasons. You’ll have to ask Walmart why to get their answer. But what I’ve experienced – and the reason I’ve stayed in Bentonville for almost 10 years – is what’s stated in Walmart’s sustainable chemistry policy itself: “Walmart and Sam’s Club believe that customers/members should not have to choose between products that they can afford and products that are better for them and the environment.” The people with whom I’ve worked at Walmart, especially on product chemistry, live by that statement. Idea rippled through industry When Walmart released its policy, the company didn’t just call for the ouster of the high-priority chemicals. Walmart took a leadership stance. Walmart committed to making the product ingredients transparent to customers. The company embraced informed substitution, which means it’s intent on making sure that ingredients targeted by the new policy are replaced with better ones. And for its private brand products, Walmart set its sights onSafer Choice, a voluntary labeling program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that requires every ingredient to be as safe as possible. Target’s chemicals initiative was announced shortly afterwards. The ripple effect spread across the personal-care products industry, with companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive following with their own chemicals-focused efforts. So let’s stop a moment and give credit where credit is due – to the people who chose to make things better, whatever their reasons.  This story has been republished with permission by the Environmental Defense Fund Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Building an Effective Data Acquisition Strategy: Acquiring Product Material and Compliance Data Addressing Supply Chain Risk, Sustainability in Strategic Plans Co-op, Nestle, Sainsbury’s to Cut Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Manufacturers: Sustainability is Everyone’s Responsibility Reader Comments There are no comments for this story.   Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website Energy Manager News Energy Performance Contracts Facilitate Big Changes for CA School District NextEra, TVA Launch Largest Solar Project in Alabama Trane Introduces Water-Cooled Chiller In Antitrust Filing, Sierra Club Alleges NEXUS Pipeline Would Raise Retail Rates Excessively Public Service Co. of Oklahoma Requests Extra Time for $75M Rate Refund IKEA Builds Sustainability, Energy Savings Naperville, IL, Almost Ready for Consumer Energy Management Miramar FAA Location Taps Solar NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

By buying Jet.com, a shopping website, Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, has joined the ranks of investors betting on so-called “unicorns”, or private startups valued at over $1 billion. The acquisition is the most expensive deal ever for an American e-commerce startup, and a sign of just how worried Walmart executives are by the rise of Amazon. It’s also an admission that despite heavy internal investment, the Bentonville giant’s own site, Walmart.com, is nowhere near enough. Walmart still accounts for a tenth of American retail sales, but that has declined from 11.6% in 2009, according to Cowen Group, a financial-services firm. Amazon’s share is about half of Walmart’s, but it is growing fast. Moreover, last year, of every $10 that American shoppers dispensed on goods, $1 was spent online. Even the Walmart faithful are beginning to use Amazon. Last year just over a tenth of Walmart’s customers shopped on Amazon too.   Online, where the future battle lies, the news for Walmart is scarcely better. Last year its global e-commerce sales increased by 12% to $13.7 billion, compared with a 20% jump to $107 billion of sales at Amazon. At the start of the year Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth slowed to 7%. For its chief executive, Doug McMillon, this may have been a trigger to make a quick acquisition. Amazon’s fast and efficient shipping through Amazon Prime has also proven hard to match, as has its range of products (Amazon is said to offer well over 200m different items, while Walmart.com serves up around 11m). Buying Jet.com is unlikely to change the dynamic between the two giants. In technology circles, some view the shopping website as an ugly foal masquerading as a unicorn. It is believed to lose around 30 cents for every dollar of sales it makes (it does not release the figures), because of its alluringly low prices. The more it sells to its customers, the more it loses. Its investors will be glad of the generously priced exit offered by Walmart. One attraction is Jet.com’s real-time pricing algorithm, which tempts customers with lower prices if they add more items to their basket. The algorithm also identifies which of Jet.com’s vendors is closest to the consumer, helping to minimise shipping costs and allowing them to offer discounts. Walmart plans to integrate the software with its own. Buying this platform makes more sense than trying to develop it internally, says Charles O’Shea of Moody’s, a rating agency. Walmart is also buying talent. Jet.com chief executive Marc Lore has e-commerce pedigree. He co-founded Quidsi, the parent company of Diapers.com and Soap.com, among others, which Amazon itself snapped up for $545m six years ago. Mr Lore will now run both Jet.com and Walmart.com. Walmart also desperately hopes that Jet.com will help it attract millennials, a demographic it wants to do better with. Jet.com boasts a base of millennial shoppers which Walmart claims is growing by around 400,000 per month. Yet buying online-only Jet.com does not solve another problem that Walmart has, which is how to fuse its e-commerce business with its big-box stores. Nine out of ten Americans live within ten miles of one of its ubiquitous boxes, meaning the firm’s online shoppers can collect their purchases nearby. Walmart says that shoppers who spend both online and in physical stores end up buying more than those who keep to bricks and mortar. But the firm faces two hard truths. First, building an e-commerce business is horribly expensive. Second, as more people shift to shopping online, they may shun Walmart’s vast, neon-lit boxes. This may make the titan of efficiency less profitable and force it to close more stores. It is not unlike the scenario that, not so long ago, Walmart inflicted on small chains of local shops. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (11) Editors’ picks Protest and lose your passportTo silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship Many are left stateless as a result Britain’s youngAre they screwed?

But they showed surprising optimism about the economy.  By Linda Feldmann, Staff writer August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved A Walmart store in La Habra, Calif. Jae C. Hong/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Washington — Ask a bunch of moms about their emotions around the 2016 presidential campaign, and a torrent of negativity comes flooding out. Start with “frustrated,” “divided,” and “worried.” Then the longer explanations emerge. “There’s a lot of name-calling rather than getting to the point,” says Donna G., a clinic manager in Columbus, Ohio.

Test Your KnowledgeCould you pass a US citizenship test? Find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 “No matter who wins, the country will be so divided it will be hard to get anything done,” says Connie M. of Phoenix, a caregiver for her parents. These are all “Wal-Mart moms” – regular Wal-Mart shoppers with children at home, who make up between 14 percent and 17 percent of the electorate. Since 2008, they have voted with the winning party in every election except 2014, making them a bellwether voting bloc. Their comments, made in focus groups Tuesday evening in Columbus and Phoenix, provide insight into voter choices in November. But all was not gloom and doom for the 20 women, who varied in age, race, income, and education level. Most extraordinary, perhaps, was their take on the economy – overall, not bad. “It’s the economy, stupid” is a campaign staple, and this year is no exception. Republican Donald Trump has zeroed in on the anxieties of working-class white voters, targeting immigration and international trade as culprits. Democrat Hillary Clinton has pledged to continue the economic recovery that started under President Obama but has left some workers feeling insecure amid stagnant wages and slow economic growth. When each focus group was asked to weigh in on the economy, nearly everyone reported that they were at least holding their own, if not getting ahead. “In some aspects, I feel like we’re moving forward with the economy,” said Africa C., a business operations manager in Phoenix. “I’m looking at the price of gas, for example. We’re hitting bottom.” Representatives of the focus groups’ sponsors – Democratic pollsters Penn Schoen Berland and Republican pollsters Public Opinion Strategies – pointed out to reporters watching the sessions remotely via videolink that both Phoenix and Columbus are strong markets. Still, it’s rare to get a group of Wal-Mart moms together, and not hear an outpouring of concern about personal finances. Whether this is good news for Mrs. Clinton – who is running, in some ways, for a third Obama term – is a matter of conjecture. Focus groups are not scientific, though they do add substance to the dry numbers of opinion polls. Current measures of whether the nation is heading in the “right direction” are dismal – only 28 percent of Americans say “yes,” to 65 percent “no.” Usually, such a big “wrong track” number would refer to a bad economy. But in their questionnaires, the Wal-Mart moms mostly listed other issues as their top concerns, such as terrorism, racism, and health care.   Such a big “wrong track” number would also normally spell trouble for the party in power. But 2016 is no normal cycle, with the two major-party candidates held in such low regard by the public. The Wal-Mart moms are no exception, and in the two focus groups, the views of Clinton and Mr. Trump were downright brutal. When asked for single words to describe candidate Clinton, “cold,” liar,” and “untrustworthy” were typical responses. “I think she’s emotionless, especially compared to Trump,” said Julie B., an office administrator in Columbus. “People have been tearing her apart forever,” and so “she has an extremely hard shell around her.” “That’s a strength,” another woman responded. The women were also asked who they would rather have over for a cookout; most said Trump. “Personally he’d be more fun than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me,” said Donna G. of Columbus. When asked to describe a President Hillary Clinton, some assessments improved. “Confident,” said one woman. “Experienced,” said others. Others noted she would be the first woman president. But when the Columbus group was asked if the “woman thing” made a difference, a chorus came back: no. One woman begged to differ. “I have two daughters,” said Dana W., a food service worker in Columbus. “It would be a big step for women, but that’s the only positive about Hillary.” Trump didn’t fare any better with the Wal-Mart moms. One-word descriptors were “joke,” “loud,” and “combative.” “I have a feeling the whole world would be laughing at us” if Trump were elected, said Julie B. of Columbus. Even women who were leaning toward Trump had serious reservations. “If Hillary was elected, we’d get more terrorism, but I think Trump would get us into World War III,” said Stephanie C. of Phoenix. When asked who they thought would win the election (not whom they personally support), nearly all the women in both groups said Clinton – but they didn’t rule out the possibility that Trump could be elected. As for their personal choices, the women were selected for the focus groups because they were either undecided or had not fully decided on whom to support. With three months to go before Election Day, seven of the 20 women said they were leaning toward Clinton, five leaned toward Trump, and eight were undecided. Ohio, in particular, is a major battleground; Arizona is a red state that the Clinton campaign sees as increasingly winnable. Other aspects of the campaign, aside from the candidates, came in for harsh criticism – starting with the news media. “It seems like the focus is just on the individuals and how crazy things can get, rather than … what are the important things that we should be dealing with or talking about,” said Gidget B., a customer service manager in Columbus. The kerfuffle over Trump’s comment Tuesday on “Second Amendment people” is the latest example. The episode had just taken place when the focus groups convened, and it was impossible to ignore. When the moderator in Columbus brought it up, one woman said, “He could be more well-spoken,” alluding to the ambiguity of Trump’s statement. Julie B. offered her interpretation: “Sounds like he’s saying basically, take her out.” Some women blamed social media for sowing discord among voters. It used to be that, in polite company, one should avoid discussing religion and politics, said one woman. Now, with social media, it’s all out in the open. “It’s actually an insight into people’s minds,” said Ivania L., a radiation safety officer in Columbus. But “it also leaves a little bad taste in your mouth…. I never expected how ugly it’s getting. People are losing friends and acquaintances. You’re just being de-friended completely.” Social media has also provided a platform for racism, said Dana W. of Columbus. “I’ve seen a lot of what Donald Trump has brought to the table,” she said.   Some women wished out loud that the third-party candidates got more media coverage, and a few said they were considering voting for the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson. But they also acknowledged the reality that the Democrats and Republicans dominate American politics, and that the choice is between Clinton and Trump. Said one woman: “I wish we could start all over.” Next up Trump economic speech: first step to unifying GOP (+video) Trump's unraveling GOP: How we reached this point Together, Obama and Bush seek national unity in Dallas (+video) Are Pennsylvania voters ready for a woman president?

Are you depressed about the presidential election? Do Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton astound you with their weapons-grade yet quasi-comical awfulness? When you read the news of the day, do you fight an insistent urge to throw your computer out the window, chop off your hair, don some scary-looking face paint, and disappear into the desert wilderness like the crabby late 19th-century writer Ambrose Bierce? Well, join the club. On Wednesday, RealClearPolitics' Alexis Simendinger highlighted the despair of the nation’s “Wal-Mart moms,” as revealed in what may have been the most depressing focus groups in the history of mankind. Gathered in Ohio and Arizona, the participants compared this year’s election to, as a Washington Post report put it, “choosing which arm to cut off.” The Wal-Mart moms are rightly despondent, along with the many fine Americans trying to figure out what to do in this nightmarish political year. Parents of small children, it turns out, are particularly peeved. “What can this election possibly teach our kids?” they ask. “What conclusions about the world can they possibly draw? How can I tell my children I voted for someone terrible?” Take heart: This is a hidden opportunity! Understood properly, the election of 2016 can impart some crucial life lessons to kids of all ages—and perhaps it will even deliver those same lessons to the adults who somehow missed them the first time around. (This is wildly optimistic, I know.) Read on: Truth can be stranger than fiction. I spent Tuesday afternoon unplugged from the news. When I logged back in at cocktail hour, I discovered that one presidential candidate had a rally featuring the grinning father of a terrorist sitting in the audience directly behind her podium, which was weird. This was quickly eclipsed, however, by the fact that another presidential candidate jokingly implied that maybe someone who likes the Second Amendment might assassinate the other presidential candidate. This is real life. It is not made up. Who says the world isn’t full of mystery? It is not a good idea to joke about assassinations or people dying. “I heard about this Second Amendment joke,” Paul Ryan told the press on Wednesday. (Note to Paul Ryan: Everyone has heard about Donald Trump’s Second Amendment joke. EVERYONE. It was terrible, and Trump will probably ensure that it lives on for 16 more news cycles, but more on that later.) “You should never joke about something like that,” Ryan continued. Well, yeah, no kidding. Most people learn this when they’re around 4 years old, but it bears repeating, apparently. Meanwhile, recent footage of Ted Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Senate nominee, shows him joking that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death “happened at a good time.” Life lesson: Please don’t do this. It’s not that hard. Sometimes, it’s best just to say “Sorry.” Can we have a special dedication go out to all those exhausted, overworked news cycles that refused to die because Donald Trump refused to say “sorry”? As Trump told “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon last September, “I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong.” For her part, Hillary Clinton seems to believe that merely pretending certain things didn’t happen—like, say, sending classified emails from a vulnerable rogue server—substitutes for expressing regret. Attention, kids: Do not try this at home. In life, you will frequently be wrong. A little self-reflection—and an occasional, honest “I’m sorry”—will get you a long way. If you’re an 11-year-old and you defend Trump’s use of bad words, you’ll get to appear on CNN with your mom! OK, never mind. Please don’t teach your kids this. But it did happen to young Matthew Schricker, a robust Trump supporter who also managed to heckle Mike Pence at a North Carolina rally. If past trends regarding child political prognosticators hold true, a hemp-wearing Matthew will passionately lead the world’s largest Bernie Sanders/Occupy Wall Street rally to date in downtown Seattle in the spring of 2021. There is no man—or woman!—behind the curtain. “Fortunately,” as Willie Nelson once said, “we are not in control.” Herein lies one of the weirdest discoveries a young person can make: The world may be run by grown-ups, but many of them are just as clueless as kids! There is no vastly competent “man behind the curtain.” Most of us are winging it; some adults are just better at hiding that fact than others. If our hapless leading presidential candidates don’t bring that point home—along with the importance of limiting the power of government and politicians—I don’t know who will.

High-Def Digest Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming Blu-ray Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Home News Walmart Set to Acquire Jet.com for $3 Billion Walmart Set to Acquire Jet.com for $3 Billion Posted Mon Aug 8, 2016 at 09:30 AM PDT by Steven Cohen The retail giant is buying the e-commerce company.   Walmart has announced plans to acquire Jet.com for approximately $3 billion. The deal is poised to help expand Walmart's e-commerce growth and customer reach. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart." As part of the deal, Jet and Walmart will remain separate brands, allowing Walmart.com to continue its extension of the company's retail stores while Jet.com will continue to provide its own unique customer experience. Led by co-founder and CEO Marc Lore, along with fellow co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust, Jet.com has positioned itself as one of the fastest growing e-commerce websites in the US. Here are a few of the company's key features and accomplishments per the press release: - Demonstrated ability to scale with speed, reaching $1 billion in run-rate Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and offering 12 million SKUs in its first year. - A growing customer base of urban and millennial customers with more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. - Best-in-class technology that rewards customers in real time with savings on items that are bought and shipped together, thereby reducing the supply-chain and logistics costs often buried in the price of goods. - A select group of more than 2,400 retailer and brand partners tailored to create an attractive and distinctive assortment for consumers. The deal has been approved by the Boards of Directors for both companies but is still subject to regulatory approval. Walmart expects the acquisition to close this calendar year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-edition Classifieds Jobs Homes Public Notices Suspected meth lab beneath Walmart lot stumps police Wednesday Aug 10, 2016 at 11:51 AM A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. By LINDSEY BEVERThe Washington Post A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. "I was completely astounded," Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. "It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. "Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new." Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a "preventative patrol," according to CBS affiliate WIVB. "Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day," Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: "We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good." Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine." But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. "We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore," Chamberlin told the station. "We were shocked when we found out about this," Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. "It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police." Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such "clandestine laboratories." It states: "A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present." Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are "highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties" and that the chemicals used in them are "extremely toxic." "A Meth lab can be located anywhere," it states. "The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests." According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. "It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area," Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: "This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line." Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. "They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically," Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: "They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark." Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. "It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous," Lucey told the Buffalo News. "Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation." "Certainly, they weren’t thinking," he added.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Mexican unit said it has agreed to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool for about USD 852 million as the world's largest retailer streamlines operations in its largest non-US market. Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica , also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos (USD 852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as USD 2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly USD 480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for USD 626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about USD 247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about USD 26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about USD 6.93 billion.

The retail giant made the biggest acquisition in e-commerce start-up history earlier this week. Here's what it could mean for the company and investors. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Aug 10, 2016 at 6:52PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) completed the biggest acquisition of an e-commerce start-up in history earlier this week, buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart will pay $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stock over the next five years for the year-old company that was launched as a challenger to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for online retail supremacy. Since news of the deal broke, Wal-Mart has been criticized by several corners of the media for overpaying for the start-up, but there are plenty of reasons why it could prove to be a smart move. 1. Wal-Mart could use the help Jet.com may only be a year old, but the company has already reached an annual run rate of $1 billion in sales, something that took Amazon four years to accomplish. Jet's marketplace model, however, means that it generates significantly less than that as actual revenue. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has seen its e-commerce growth rate slow each quarter over the last two years, falling to just 7% in its most recent report. E-commerce has taken on growing importance as same-store sales have slowed, Wal-Mart stores have saturated the country, and Amazon and other competitors have taken market share. The company has struggled to gain traction in online retail despite intensified efforts in the space, including increased capital spending, launching a competitor to Amazon Prime called ShippingPass, rolling out online grocery pickup, and making several smaller acquisitions in the past. With the Jet buyout, Wal-Mart gets much more than an additional $1 billion in sales. It gets access to the millions of names in Jet's customer base, which include a large number of urban and millennial customers that Wal-Mart has historically had trouble courting. It also gets access to Jet's proprietary infrastructure and technology. Its "Smart Cart", for example, features an algorithm that lowers prices as customers add more items to their order or give up returns. Finally, Wal-Mart will add Jet.com founder and CEO Marc Lore, one of the leading minds in e-commerce, to its ranks. Lore's first company, Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com and Soap.com, was sold to Amazon for $550 million in a bidding war with Wal-Mart. After spending two years inside the e-commerce leader, Lore departed to found Jet, the most ambitious company to challenge Amazon in several years. Lore will run Jet as well as Wal-Mart's e-commerce division once the deal closes. 2. $3.3 billion isn't that much for Wal-Mart It's difficult to value some acquisitions. Jet doesn't disclose revenue, but some analysts estimate its price-to-sales valuation is about six times, or about double that of Amazon. Though that may be expensive for an unprofitable and not-yet-proven company, it could be worth much more than that to Wal-mart if it allows the retailer to unlock increased e-commerce growth. Past big-ticket acquisitions like Facebook's purchase of Instagram and Google's takeover of YouTube were questioned by industry followers at the time, but both now look like steals, as they have become core components of each company. And Wal-Mart isn't poor either. The $3.3 billion price is less than it generates in profit in an average quarter. The company spends most of that income on returning capital to shareholders. Last year, it returned more than $12 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks, money that in no way helps its competitive position. For a company now struggling to grow, it's clear that e-commerce is a bigger priority than share repurchases, if not the company's single most important mission. Notably, Amazon has also made big acquisitions on its way to e-commerce domination, spending more than $2 billion combined on Zappos, Kiva Technologies, and Lore's old company, Quidsi. If Wal-Mart had made those acquisitions instead, perhaps it would find itself in a different position today. 3. Wal-Mart is still the best positioned company to challenge Amazon Wal-Mart's profits, in addition to justifying the Jet acquisition, are also a key advantage against Amazon, and the retailer should be able to outbid Amazon on any company or asset they both value. It actually did top Amazon's bid for Quidsi, but at that point, the start-up had already signaled that it would sell to Amazon. More importantly, the company has assets that no other retailer, online or off, can match. Those include a network of more than 4,000 stores across the nation, giving the company a location within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. While Amazon is busy trying to build up its own shipping fleet to complement traditional logistics providers, Wal-Mart has one of the largest private trucking fleets in the country, with about 6,000 tractor-trailers that it will start using to support e-commerce operations. The tech know-how, strategy, and innovation from Jet should also boost Wal-Mart's prospects, and its own logistics and economies of scale should benefit Jet. Investors should remember that Wal-Mart doesn't have to beat Amazon in order to win -- it just has to accelerate growth in e-commerce to return the overall company to growth. In fact, the Jet acquisition offers evidence that Wal-Mart and Amazon may be moving in different directions. Long a champion of low prices, Amazon has shifted from that strategy in recent years with its Prime membership program, which places an emphasis on convenience over price. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has branded itself on "always low prices", and Jet's pricing algorithm puts a similar emphasis on low prices. In fact, the company promised to be the cheapest retailer on the internet. What could ensue, then, is a bifurcation in e-commerce as Wal-Mart targets more price-conscious customers and Amazon ramps up services for its Prime members, such as Prime Now, which promises delivery in under an hour, and Prime Fresh, the grocery delivery service. Beyond the acquisition, the key for Wal-Mart will be to successfully integrate Jet, execute on an enhanced e-commerce platform, and grow demand. Wal-Mart's fortunes won't change overnight, but the acquisition is a sign the company's priorities are in the right place.  With $27 billion in annual operating cash flow, the company has plenty more firepower to pour into e-commerce if it chooses.

The transaction, which involved 119 stores, is subject to regulatory approval, Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB and Liverpool said in statements Wednesday after markets closed. Liverpool will pay 15.7 billion pesos, assume 1.4 billion pesos of debt and distribute an additional 3.3 billion pesos to shareholders after the deal is completed. As part of the deal, Liverpool will also pay rent to Walmex for all 34 store locations where Suburbia stores stand alongside Wal-Mart stores. The deal lets Walmex get out of a business it no longer considers part of its core operation of discount retail and grocery stores, which are riding a wave of growth in consumer spending. Walmex, a publicly traded unit of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant, announced last week that July sales rose 12.1 per cent from a year ago at stores open at least a year, almost double the 6.8 per cent rise in the previous month. “We are totally focused on our main business and our target is to double our total sales by 2024,” Walmex chief executive officer Guilherme Loureiro said in the statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange. This is the second purchase this year by Mexico City-based Liverpool, a high-end department store chain that’s seeking to diversify. The company agreed last month to buy a stake in Chile’s Ripley Corp SA, sending its stock plunging, as disappointed investors were hoping the company would expand domestically. The deal was announced after trading closed yesterday. Walmex shares are little changed this year, while Liverpool has dropped 9.7 per cent. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Each year she and her family take a day to shop together and this year it was at Toronto Eaton Centre. Before school starts in September, Owen’s mom will take a family picture on the front steps of their home, which she has done every year since Owen started school. “It’s fun to have that tradition,” said Owen, a Ryerson student. The bulk of back-to-school shopping in the GTA takes place closer to Labour Day weekend, but for many retailers and shoppers, it has already begun. Back-to-school traffic at Cadillac Fairview malls, which includes the Eaton Centre, Fairview and Sherway Gardens, is second only to the holiday season, according to spokesperson Vanessa Jenkins. August is a peak month for shopping and the third-busiest shopping month of the year, after November and December, with 75 per cent of families making their back-to-school purchases in that time, said Jenkins. Mall traffic at Cadillac Fairview properties was up 4 per cent in 2015, over the previous year, and sales per pedestrian were up 8 per cent in the period. On average, Canadian parents are expecting to spend $461 on their children this back-to-school season, including school supplies and clothing — $132 more than last year’s average, which was $329, according to a survey conducted by retailmenot.ca. But while the average spend for an elementary school student is expected to be $318, it’s expected to be $412 for high school students and $1,630 for university students, reflecting the higher cost of setting up a dorm room and study space. “Right now, our top purchases online include mini fridges, mattresses and TVs (this is more of a back-to-campus shop) as well as stationery items such as notebooks,” said Felicia Fefer, manager of marketing and public relations for Walmart Canada. The bulk of back-to-school shopping will take place in-store, said Fefer, but Walmart is seeing a significant growth of orders on walmart.ca and through the mobile app. Walmart began marketing back-to-school in July. “We are ready when customers are ready to shop for BTS and there are always early shoppers,” said Fefer. Price is the most important consideration for shoppers, Fefer said. Walmart is projecting that Canadians will spend approximately $500 on average, on back-to-school shopping. Walmart is seeking to expand its back-to-school business with a collection of recipes and shopping lists to reach out to trying to save time on meal preparation during the school year. Some retailers at Yorkdale Mall have begun back-to-school sales but the busiest weekend is Labour Day weekend, said general manager Claire Santamaria. “Mid-August, that’s when we start to see our traffic patterns start to increase, especially around the weekends,” said Santamaria. Retailers are targeting parents on Facebook and using Twitter and Instagram to promote products to students. “We’ve had a really good year-to-date, so, if we continue the trends that we’ve been seeing this year, then yes, it will be better than next year,” said Santamaria. “If you want to get what you want, now is a good time to do it.” Back-to-school shopping queries on the comparison-price website Shopbot.ca began trending upwards before the middle of July, two weeks earlier than last year, according to spokesperson Lia Almeida. Sought-after products include: Birkenstock sandals, Nike Air Max shoes, Adidas Superstar shoes, the iPad mini, Asus Zenbook, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, iPod touch, GoPro Hero 4, and in toys, Pokemon Cards, Pokemon Nintendo games and accessories, Baby Alive Doll, Frozen Backpack and DJI phantom drones More queries are coming into Shopbot.ca from mobile phones. Mobile traffic to the website more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, and is on track to increase an additional 35 per cent this year, Almeida said. Some product searches are driven more heavily by mobile than others, she said — 78 per cent of searches for Air Jordan shoes or Birkenstock sandals are made via mobile phone. At eBay in Canada, the busiest week during last year’s BTS season was the week of Sept. 13. Mobile has also been increasing in use and makes up 57 per cent of transactions globally, according to a spokesperson. Some malls are adding an experiential component to their back-to-school offerings. Dixie Outlet Mall plans to host a virtual reality adventure lounge, which will include interactive gaming and complimentary WI-FI. Guests will be able to test drive the new Samsung Gear VR. “Our shoppers’ needs are evolving and they’re looking for a more dynamic and well-rounded shopping experience,” according to spokesperson Cristina Avila. The mall, off the QEW in Mississauga, is also offering travel discounts to Enterprise Autoshare and Uber riders who make the trip to shop back-to-school.

A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. Advertisement Continue reading “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals – including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. Advertisement Continue reading “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” It states: “A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A Meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” Advertisement Continue reading According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. “It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line.” Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added. newyork-meth _____ Keywords: New York, Amherst, Walmart, meth lab, methamphetamine Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Employees packed boxes for shipping in December at a Jet.com warehouse in Swedesboro, N.J. COLE WILSON NYT i The New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Traditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them. Now Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer and the dominant player of big-box stores, is turning to someone else’s technology and talent. On Monday, the company announced it was buying Jet, the year-old online bulk retailer, for $3.3 billion, the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Wal-Mart’s clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone. “The other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, ‘You know, absolutely, we’ve been failing at doing this,’ ” said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. “Bringing in an expert might be the key to it.” Overall, Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company’s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was “too slow.” Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business. Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Wal-Mart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth. Wal-Mart said Jet offered it access to “urban and millennial customers,” two groups that the retailer’s large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Wal-Mart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country. Still, the $3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago. Wal-Mart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the start-up does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something — or someone — else: Marc Lore. Lore, an e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon’s edge. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately. Wal-Mart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet’s ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition. Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79.3 billion, while Wal-Mart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O’Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody’s. “We view this as a race for second,” O’Shea said. “Amazon’s lead is so great that it’s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:47 Questions remain about death of 10-year-old boy on water slide Pause 3:10 Energy 101: How do wind turbines work? 2:13 Chiefs rookies help distribute Thanksgiving food 3:55 KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 2:59 Still no motive in March shooting deaths of four men in Kansas City, Kan. 2:11 Mizzou's Charles Harris on senior day, NFL Draft 3:14 Chiefs QB Alex Smith explains why he wore a safety pin 1:47 Teen writes about living at home with the crack addict her mother married 0:18 Raw video: Fatality fire, 34th Terrace and Erickson Road 1:55 Gun shop pays $2.2 million to settle death case Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 13 hours ago KC Chamber recognizes Donald J.

Joshua Lott, Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email It's a well-known fact that voters do not particularly like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton: the two pols consistently have the lowest favorability ratings of any major party nominees in recent political history. But "unfavorable" doesn't quite capture the particular level of disgust some voters have for both candidates in the race this year--a fact underscored by a pair of focus groups of undecided swing-state moms Tuesday night. Asked to describe their feelings about their two major-party options, the women's responses ranged from "frustrated" and "conflicted" to "fearful" and "screwed." As one woman in Phoenix put it, the choice between Trump and Clinton is "like choosing which arm to cut off." Play Video CBSN Did Trump insinuate violence with Second Amendment comment?

"I'd pick Minnie Mouse right now" if the election were today, said Ivania L, a radiation safety officer from Columbus. The focus groups in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, Ariz., were part of a series of "Walmart Moms" groups, jointly run by Democratic pollster Margie Omero of Penn Schoen Berland and GOP pollster Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies since 2008. They were conducted Tuesday night and screened live for reporters in Washington, D.C. "Walmart moms" are predominantly white, 18- to 44-year-old women children who have shopped at Walmart at least once in the last month--and they're representative of a swing demographic that makes up roughly 14 to 17 percent of the American electorate. These women largely voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but chose Republicans in the 2010 midterms; of the 20 women who attended both groups Tuesday, all have said they are undecided in the 2016 race. "What you get here is an incredible frustration with the campaign--they feel irritated, they're tired of the candidates," Newhouse said of the focus groups, adding that the women are "disgusted" by their choice in November. And unlike in past elections, both Trump and Clinton have almost universal name ID--meaning that not only did the women in Columbus and Phoenix know a lot about each candidate, but they had pretty strong opinions about both of them. On Trump, the one-word descriptions women offered up included "racist," "derogatory" and "petty." "He kind of acts like a 2-year-old," said Lukisha H., a teacher from Phoenix. "I have a 2-year-old--I see the similarities." "He's a jerk," said Ruth P., a client services specialist from Columbus. "To call a woman a 'fat pig' on national television--yeah, you're doing that intentionally." Though some of the women admitted that they liked his brashness, they also felt it would inevitably get him--and the country--in trouble. "I think his weakness is his mouth," said Donna G., a clinic manager from Columbus. "To me he has no filter ... when you're in a political office that high, I think it could be a huge issue with him on all levels." As for Clinton? The word that kept coming up is the same one that has consistently dogged her in national polling: "untrustworthy." The various Clinton scandals that have been swept under the rug are so numerous, said Linda C. from Phoenix, that it's hard to keep track of them all: "There's so much stuffed under there they can't even lay the carpet down flat now," she quipped. "I think she lies about things, and big things," said Maria S., a homemaker in Columbus. Julie, an office administrator, replied: "I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot." The women also seized on the scandal over Clinton's email practices as proof that she considers herself above the law. "If anybody else did that, they would have lost their job," said Anita A., a health analyst from Columbus. Mary H., a retired cable TV sales representative from Columbus, was more blunt: "She's a cold-hearted b**ch," she said. While many of the moms felt the country was headed in generally the right direction, many feared for the future when a new president takes office--whether it's Clinton or Trump. "Really either way the future's going to be harder," said Stephanie C., a customer service representative from Phoenix. "I see more damage to the economy if Hillary is elected, an increase in terrorism ... but I think Trump would get us right into World War 3." © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Kroger has nearly 3,000 stores, more than 120 of which are Marketplace stores.  We went to three Marketplace stores in the Richmond, Virginia area to check them out. Here's what we found. The store is massive. This image shows only one quarter of the front of the buildings. Kroger Marketplace stores are typically 100,000 to 145,000 square feet  which is about three quarters of the size of a Walmart Supercenter. Business Insider Stepping inside, shoppers are greeted by the fresh produce department. Business Insider It's one of the biggest departments in the entire store, and it's meticulously organized. Business Insider Starbucks is nearby so you can grab a drink before you shop. Business Insider Just beyond the produce department, there are several prepared food counters like this one, where three chefs are behind the counter rolling sushi. Business Insider The "fresh meals" kitchen features all kinds of customizable dishes, including pizza, sandwiches, and burrito bowls made to order. Business Insider Some pizzas are pre-made, but you can customize anything. Business Insider Here's a closer look at part of the menu. Business Insider You can order your food using touch-screen kiosks. Business Insider Or grab it to go from the salad bar. Business Insider There are self-checkout registers near the prepared food counters so people grabbing lunch or dinner don't have to wait in long lines. Business Insider The store also cuts down on lines by setting out freshly sliced deli meat to go. Business Insider There's a drink bar if you're dining in... Business Insider ... and the dine-in seating area features flat-screen televisions, a fireplace, and lounge chairs. Business Insider Back in the main part of the store, there's a giant wine selection that stretches across four aisles. This department features 500 types of beer and nearly 2,000 types of wine. Business Insider There's also a wine bar with craft beers on tap. Business Insider Here's a closer look at the wine bar. Business Insider The bakery has some cool gadgets like this self-service bread slicer. Business Insider Like everything else in this store, the meat department is huge. Business Insider Check out that meat selection. It goes on forever. Business Insider There are all kinds of kitchen appliances... Business Insider ...from standing mixers to microwaves, mini refrigerators, and blenders. Business Insider The store even offers a selection of home goods. Business Insider There are lots of decorative items like picture frames and vases... Business Insider ...as well as more useful things like silverware sets and cutting boards. Business Insider One aisle is devoted to towels and bathroom accessories, such as soap dispensers and trash cans. Business Insider Stylish pillows and baskets are for sale... Business Insider ...and there's a small selection of rugs. Business Insider A few aisles are stocked with college dorm decorations. Business Insider Futons and bean-bag chairs are featured. Business Insider The fashion department offers clothes and accessories. It's nearly the same size as the produce department. Business Insider It offers back-to-school items like backpacks. Business Insider ...and a large selection of sneakers, heeled shoes, and flip-flops. Business Insider Everything is affordable. Most pairs of shoes are under $20. Business Insider There are workout clothes including sports bras and running shorts. Business Insider And more fashionable tops and dresses. Business Insider There's also an aisle devoted to accessories like scarves and handbags. Business Insider A fitting room is on site for anyone who wants to try the clothes on. Business Insider If you get tired while walking around the store (and you probably will) there are several benches to take a rest. Business Insider You can even buy a bike. Business Insider There's an emergency clinic offering health care... Business Insider ...and a jewelry store. Business Insider There's also a toy department. Business Insider And on your way out, you can pick up some outdoor furniture.

Ari Levy, CNBC & Rolfe Winkler, WSJ: Walmart & Jet, Google & anti-trust, Uber & China, Elon & Energy, CEOs & bad behavior Hi everyone, Producer Jacqui here. Ari Levy of CNBC and Rolfe Winkler of The Wall Street Journal joined @Jason for a must-see News Roundtable on This Week in Startups. An amazing discussion that kicked off with big deal of the week, Walmart snapping up Jet.com for $3b, that crackled on to Google, the government, anti-trust, the entire U.S. debt problem, the Chinese Market, the very future of energy (featuring, naturally, Elon), and the latest in startup CEOs behaving badly. And more. [ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): http://ctt.ec/00i8b ] Subscribe in iTunes: http://bit.ly/TWiSTAV And watch here! Some key discussions M&A The big deal of week is Jet.com being bought for $3B by Walmart. What’s behind the deal? Walmart.com has been around since 2000 and has never bridged the gap with Amazon, remaining the #2 player in e-commerce. Could Jet.com & CEO Marc Lore be the answer? Politics & Google What’s the story of Google, the White House, and anti-trust? Google was investigated on anti-trust grounds by the FTC, but ultimately, the decision was made against pursuing any anti-trust case. The Obama administration has been pro-tech and pro-Google. And lobbying works — both parties have been fairly reluctant to launch any anti-trust campaign within technology in the US. Debt in economy Debt-to-GDP in the economy, even after some of the de-leveraging from 2009, is still at a level that is “mind-boggling.” The problem is in private debt (corporate, student loan, credit card, mortgage debt). Is this why millennials do not accumulate assets? Where do we go from here? Bad behavior Using the recent Hampton Creek controversy as a starting point, the panelists debate questionable CEO startup behavior of late. When Silicon Valley prioritizes growth over everything, yet any appearance of impropriety IS impropriety, where is that line … exactly? Elon Musk & the future How much do you want the future to arrive early? Elon would like the world to solve global warming and get off fossil fuels in his lifetime. But we have to decide as a society where to allocate funds. Is there a sustainable, bull market in electric- & self-driving cars? And when you factor in all of the capital and regulatory requirements required, do you bet on Tesla? (or Apple? Google?).

World NEWSPAPERS Boca Raton Folsom Orange County St Augustine Vero Beach Published:August 10th, 2016 13:26 EST Meth Lab Discovered in Sewer Under Walmart Parking Lot By Robert Paul Reyes "Police, fire and hazmat crews are investigating a suspected meth lab found in a sewer under the parking lot of the Walmart on Sheridan and Bailey Monday afternoon. WGRZ Is anyone surprised that there`s a sewer underneath a Walmart store? Walmart is a blight on America, it destroys local competition from mom and pop stores, and sells toxic wares from China. What a perfect location for a meth lab: In a sewer underneath the parking lot of a Walmart store. A smart businessman sets up shop where his customers are located, Walmart shoppers thrive on cheap merchandise and cheap meth. The chemicals used in making meth are more dangerous than the germs that live in sewers -- any idiot who buys meth deserves to lose all his teeth, brain cells and money.

Walmart To Stop Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 300 Additional Stores Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart To Stop Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 300 Additional Stores August 10, 2016 2:02 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No price-match here trying to save more walmart price match savings rollbacks Making Changes expanding the changes Back in May, Walmart announced that 500 of its stores in the U.S. would stop in-store price matching ads from local competitors. Despite assurances that it had no plans to expand its no-price-matching policy, the retailer has quietly ditched the service at 300 additional stores.  Consumerist reader Jeffrey tipped us off to the possibility that the big box retailer was discontinuing the policy at additional stores when he recently noticed signs at his local Walmart. Because Walmart refused to indicate what stores were affected by the policy change in May, it was unclear if his store was part of the initial change. A rep for Walmart confirmed that as of August 1, 300 more stores across the country had stopped allowing customers to price match local ads at the register. “Because we believe you don’t have to trade down or sacrifice quality to save money, customers are finding new savings in select markets as we lower prices on our assortment of national brands and quality private brand items they want,” the rep said in a roundabout way of confirming the additional stores changing their policies. Under the outgoing policy, Walmart allowed customers to bring in local competitors’ ads and if the prices were lower for a product, they would be able to purchase that item at the cheaper price. Since Walmart still isn’t saying which stores — or even which regions — are affected by this policy change, the only way for customers to know if they can’t price-match is when they get to the store. The changes are being announced in-store with blue signs at registers — like those seen by Jeffrey — and managers will be on hand to assist customers. Again, the rep tells Consumerist that in lieu of the Ad Match program, the 800 stores will offer new “significant, long-term” rollbacks on thousands of items that were commonly price-matched, including consumables, groceries, paper products, and other products. “We understand Ad Match provided an additional layer of reassurance for customers,” the rep said. “That’s why we’re working hard to deliver upfront low prices that customers can trust every day of the week.” August 10, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No price-match here trying to save more walmart price match savings rollbacks Making Changes expanding the changes Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related No price-match here Walmart Ending Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 500 Stores; Won’t Say Which 500 getting money back Amazon Stops Price-Matching Everything But TVs, So Here’s Your Guide To Other Retailers’ Policies how low can you go?

The people responsible had to travel 244 metres from the culvert’s opening to reach the apparent lab, which was discovered beneath a Walmart store.  (MIKE BLAKE / REUTERS File Photo)   By Lindsey BeverThe Washington Post Wed., Aug. 10, 2016 A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 3.6 metres under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. Article Continued Below “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York state Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York state, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A Meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about 6.4 kilometres from Walmart. “It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line.” Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers travelled some 244 metres from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added.

He said he had a woman at his home and she asked him for a hot dog while they were watching TV. He said he went downstairs to make a hot dog and when he returned, the woman, his car and house keys and wallet were gone. He then discovered the vehicle missing. He said the wallet included $380 cash and credit cards. He only knew the woman by her first name and said she was between 25 and 30-years-old. Officers called a phone number he had for her, but the voice mail was full. The man was advised to change the locks on the house. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 46, was arrested at Walmart July 29 for the suspected theft of two TVs and a computer, valued at a total of $1,045. He said he did not have a receipt for the items but was there to return them. He also gave a false identity and was cited for falsification. He was found to have several active warrants in South Euclid. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: Two East Cleveland women, 20 and 21, were arrested at Walmart Aug. 3 for the theft of $204.35 worth of women's clothing, shoes and underwear. They bagged the items in the self-checkout area, but did not pay for them. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 44, was arrested at Walmart around 4:15 a.m. July 29 for trespassing and the suspected theft of a pair of shoes and five pairs of pants. He was wearing the stolen pair of shoes and a pair of worn shoes was found in the shoe aisle. He had been arrested at the store in July and served a trespass notice at that time. The total value of the theft was $101.68. Criminal damage, Eastway Road: Something was thrown through the front window of a home at 2:30 p.m. July 31, causing damage. The resident said he looked outside but did not see anyone in the area. Officers believed the damage could have been caused by a BB. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Newburg Heights woman, 28, was arrested at Walmart Aug. 1 for the suspected theft of $688.33 worth of grocery, laundry and clothing items. An employee said she under-rang massive amounts of merchandise at the self-checkout section of the store. Impaired driving, South Belvoir Boulevard: Officers responded to a report at 6 a.m. July 30 of a vehicle that had crashed in a resident's front yard. The driver was located walking away from the accident and identified as a 31-year-old South Euclid man. He said a deer may have caused him to lose control of the vehicle. He was subsequently arrested for hit-skip, driving under suspension and operating a vehicle while impaired. His driving history showed six previous OVI convictions, including four in the last six years. He told officers he likes to drink and said he did not feel drunk at the time of the crash. Impaired driving, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights man, 29, was arrested for operating a vehicle while impaired after he was stopped at 1:37 a.m. July 30 for driving without illuminated headlights. He was taken to Hillcrest Hospital for a blood draw, but refused to allow it. While there, he made several comments about displaying his genitals to the female staff and at one point urinated on the floor of his room. He was also cited for obstructing official business and failure to comply with the order of a police officer. Fraud, Haywood Drive: A woman reported July 29 she received a welcome packet in the mail from a credit union and learned there was a savings and checking account fraudulently opened in her name. After discovering this, she ran a credit report and found a credit card had also been fraudulently opened in her name. There was no monetary loss associated with the incident and there are no suspects. Driving under suspension, Warrensville Center Road: Officers located a disabled vehicle at 10:43 p.m. Aug. 3 and found the driver was changing two tires that had blown out. It was learned the Cleveland man, 43, had 13 open driving suspensions and warrants with Highland Hills and Cleveland Heights police. One large bag and two small bags of marijuana were found inside the vehicle, along with a scale. The man was cited for driving under suspension, drug abuse and possession of drug paraphernalia. Unwanted guest, Warrensville Center Road: At 1:51 a.m. Aug. 1, officers responded to an apartment for a report of a woman who was asked to leave by her boyfriend and his mother, but refused. She told officers she was a tenant, but she was reminded her name was not on the lease and she had been given a trespass warning in March. She eventually collected some of her belongings and then left the building. At 3:48 a.m., officers returned to the apartment after the residents said the woman returned and threw an object through a window and slashed three tires on one of their vehicles. They found her drinking a beer in the area and returned her to the station, where she became belligerent and verbally assaulted officers. At one point, she pulled her pants down and exposed herself to officers and kicked and punched officers, causing injuries to several of them. The South Euclid woman, 36, was charged with assault on a police officer, open container, criminal trespass and criminal damaging. She was subsequently taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Reports indicate she also removed all of her clothing while in the booking area and defecated on the bench and floor. Theft, Mayfield Road: A shoplifter ran from Giant Eagle July 30 and was subsequently located hiding behind a couch in a resident's garage on South Green Road. The stolen items, valued at a total of $90.37, were found in her purse and on the ground near the garage. It was later learned the Cleveland woman, 53, had bed bugs after seeing scars on her legs and arms. She was cited for theft and given a trespass warning. She had active warrants with several agencies, but none were able to take her into custody. Littering, South Belvoir Road: A woman reported July 28 seeing a man throw an empty beer can into a resident's yard as he walked along the sidewalk. She had previously seen him do the same thing so she followed him and took a photo. Officers located the South Euclid man, 67, who admitted throwing the can onto a front yard. He was cited for littering. See more South Euclid news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest. If you would like to discuss the police blotter, please visit our crime and courts comments page.

Each year she and her family take a day to shop together and this year it was at Toronto Eaton Centre. Before school starts in September, Owen’s mom will take a family picture on the front steps of their home, which she has done every year since Owen started school. “It’s fun to have that tradition,” said Owen, a Ryerson student. The bulk of back-to-school shopping in the GTA takes place closer to Labour Day weekend, but for many retailers and shoppers, it has already begun. Article Continued Below Back-to-school traffic at Cadillac Fairview malls, which includes the Eaton Centre, Fairview and Sherway Gardens, is second only to the holiday season, according to spokesperson Vanessa Jenkins. August is a peak month for shopping and the third-busiest shopping month of the year, after November and December, with 75 per cent of families making their back-to-school purchases in that time, said Jenkins. Mall traffic at Cadillac Fairview properties was up 4 per cent in 2015, over the previous year, and sales per pedestrian were up 8 per cent in the period. On average, Canadian parents are expecting to spend $461 on their children this back-to-school season, including school supplies and clothing — $132 more than last year’s average, which was $329, according to a survey conducted by retailmenot.ca. But while the average spend for an elementary school student is expected to be $318, it’s expected to be $412 for high school students and $1,630 for university students, reflecting the higher cost of setting up a dorm room and study space. “Right now, our top purchases online include mini fridges, mattresses and TVs (this is more of a back-to-campus shop) as well as stationery items such as notebooks,” said Felicia Fefer, manager of marketing and public relations for Walmart Canada. The bulk of back-to-school shopping will take place in-store, said Fefer, but Walmart is seeing a significant growth of orders on walmart.ca and through the mobile app. Walmart began marketing back-to-school in July. “We are ready when customers are ready to shop for BTS and there are always early shoppers,” said Fefer. Price is the most important consideration for shoppers, Fefer said. Walmart is projecting that Canadians will spend approximately $500 on average, on back-to-school shopping. Walmart is seeking to expand its back-to-school business with a collection of recipes and shopping lists to reach out to trying to save time on meal preparation during the school year. Some retailers at Yorkdale Mall have begun back-to-school sales but the busiest weekend is Labour Day weekend, said general manager Claire Santamaria. “Mid-August, that’s when we start to see our traffic patterns start to increase, especially around the weekends,” said Santamaria. Retailers are targeting parents on Facebook and using Twitter and Instagram to promote products to students. “We’ve had a really good year-to-date, so, if we continue the trends that we’ve been seeing this year, then yes, it will be better than next year,” said Santamaria. “If you want to get what you want, now is a good time to do it.” Back-to-school shopping queries on the comparison-price website Shopbot.ca began trending upwards before the middle of July, two weeks earlier than last year, according to spokesperson Lia Almeida. Sought-after products include: Birkenstock sandals, Nike Air Max shoes, Adidas Superstar shoes, the iPad mini, Asus Zenbook, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, iPod touch, GoPro Hero 4, and in toys, Pokemon Cards, Pokemon Nintendo games and accessories, Baby Alive Doll, Frozen Backpack and DJI phantom drones More queries are coming into Shopbot.ca from mobile phones. Mobile traffic to the website more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, and is on track to increase an additional 35 per cent this year, Almeida said. Some product searches are driven more heavily by mobile than others, she said — 78 per cent of searches for Air Jordan shoes or Birkenstock sandals are made via mobile phone. At eBay in Canada, the busiest week during last year’s BTS season was the week of Sept. 13. Mobile has also been increasing in use and makes up 57 per cent of transactions globally, according to a spokesperson. Some malls are adding an experiential component to their back-to-school offerings. Dixie Outlet Mall plans to host a virtual reality adventure lounge, which will include interactive gaming and complimentary WI-FI. Guests will be able to test drive the new Samsung Gear VR. “Our shoppers’ needs are evolving and they’re looking for a more dynamic and well-rounded shopping experience,” according to spokesperson Cristina Avila. The mall, off the QEW in Mississauga, is also offering travel discounts to Enterprise Autoshare and Uber riders who make the trip to shop back-to-school. What Canadians are planning to buy for back-to-school, according to Retailmenot.ca: 80 per cent said clothes 75 per cent said shoes 74 per cent said school supplies 61 per cent said back packs 44 per cent said textbooks 20 per cent said beauty and grooming products Read more about: Walmart, Eaton Centre The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen.

Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station. “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good,” he added. Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town.

No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” It states: “A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about 4 miles from Wal-Mart. “It’s a concern.

(WIVB New 4) A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in Upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: an underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick G. Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” [Did you leave your backpack meth lab in a Walmart bathroom?] Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding, “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. Crews are coming up from underground @news4buffalo pic.twitter.com/M2caFSNyI6 — Callan Gray (@CallanGray4) August 8, 2016 “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the storm sewer, according to the Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” It states: A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present. [Deadly Chinese drugs are flooding the U.S., and police can’t stop them] According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, a few miles from the Walmart. “It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the discovery this week, adding: “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line.” On Tuesday, town officials were surveying the apparent crime scene. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added, “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added.

DEPRIEST Associate Editor The Haz Mat Team from the Clarence Fire Company responded Monday to the scene of a reported meth lab in the sewers beneath the Walmart store at Sheridan Drive and Bailey Avenue in Amherst. Also involved were the Eggertsville Hose Company, Brighton Fire Company and Buffalo Fire Department. Photo by David F. Sherman. Purchase color photos atwww.BeeNews.com Amherst police are currently investigating an apparent illegal drug lab housed within a sewer line underneath a Walmart parking lot. According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. The detective said that at as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody as they were working to pursue leads in the case based on evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether or not there may be other hidden labs in the immediate area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m. Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311. email: kdepriest@beenews.com Return to top Clarence Special Events 2016 Click for schedule Browse Archives

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Kathy Gilsinan Aug 10, 2016 Global Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Just days after I interviewed the legal scholar Rosa Brooks about her book on her time as a civilian advisor in President Barack Obama’s Pentagon, the United States bombed Libya again. This was the third such strike in the U.S. campaign against ISIS there, but this time, Reuters reported, U.S. officials said it “marked the start of a sustained air campaign.” Still, it was hard to tell how much of a turning point it really was. Small numbers of American special-operations forces have been active in the country since late last year, ostensibly to support local partners against ISIS, though details are vague. By launching more airstrikes at the beginning of August, America was not so much opening up a new front in its war on the group as maintaining an existing one. And it wasn’t so much changing tactics as amplifying them. Did this mean that the United States somehow became more “at war” in Libya last week than it had been the week before? For that matter, as U.S. planes have accelerated their bombing campaign against militants in Afghanistan this summer, and President  Obama has vowed to leave some 8,000 troops there through the end of his term, is the United States any less “at war” there than when U.S. combat operations in the country officially ended in December 2014? What about  in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, where U.S. drones have killed thousands of people outside of what the government considers “areas of active hostilities”? Related Story The Drone War Crosses Another Line Brooks’s new book, How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything, is about the limits of categories like these, just as much as it’s about war and the American military. Brooks, a writer and law professor at Georgetown University, bases her account in part on her two-plus years at the Defense Department, where she observed the blurring of the line, in her words, “between war and not-war.” The Pentagon, she writes, is on the one hand a “vast, bureaucratic, death-dealing enterprise;” on the other, the U.S. military operates in “nearly every country on earth” and in many cases its activities have nothing to do with shooting at bad guys. Its personnel, she notes, have been involved in everything from Ebola response in Liberia to agricultural reform in Afghanistan to health care in Malaysia. The range of their work is as remarkable as it is unsettling. If the U.S. military’s job is to protect America’s own security, why is it doing all of these things? Brooks contends that the amorphous nature of modern security threats—conflict and terrorism, but also things like climate change and financial collapse—have made it “increasingly difficult to define a uniquely ‘military’ role and mission.” It’s not just that the Bush and Obama administrations’ pursuit of terrorists around the world have pushed the geographic boundaries of the so-called war on terror beyond the more formal battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. It’s also that, as the military has sucked up an increasing share of America’s foreign-policy resources in the post-9/11 era, the Pentagon has become “like a Super Walmart with everything under one roof,” as retired General David Barno tells Brooks. “Like Walmart,” she writes, “the military can marshal vast resources and exploit economies of scale in ways impossible for mom-and-pop operations. And like Walmart, the tempting one-stop-shopping convenience it offers has a devastating effect on smaller, more traditional enterprises—in this case, the State Department and other civilian foreign policy agencies.” I spoke to Brooks recently about war, peace, and the space in between. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation. Kathy Gilsinan: The lines between “war and non-war are growing indistinct,” as you say. As a very basic question, what is war? And do you know it when you see it? Rosa Brooks: I think we have absolutely no idea what war is. I think everything that frightens us, we now label war, more or less. And that’s a problem. As an analytic category, [war] has lost any clarity it might once have had. Gilsinan: Are there any common features to things that are war-like? Brooks: They run the gamut, and they have fewer and fewer common features. We look at Syria and we say, “Oh look, there’s war.” And that’s the sort of traditional understanding of war. Lots of people who are shooting each other, blowing each other up, generally killing each other. But we also are thinking of cyber [operations], more and more, primarily through the framework of war. We look at terrorism through the framework of war. Already some of our thinking about what we call “illicit transnational actors”—not terrorists, but groups like narco-smugglers and traffickers—[is] beginning to get framed as part of war and war-like stuff. When we think of sort of the classic understanding of war that we’ve had in Western society, it owes a huge amount to [Carl von] Clausewitz, the 19th-century Prussian military strategist whose very famous definition of war was: “War is the continuation of politics by other means.” But Clausewitz was really clear what those “other means” had to include, and Clausewitz’s understanding of war was that it had several defining facts that differentiated it from other kinds of competitions or conflicts that weren’t war. So, to Clausewitz, war is organized, it’s violent, it’s on a mass scale—not an individual scale—and it is for the pursuit of political ends. For Clausewitz, a game of chess is not war, because it’s individual, not violent, and it has no political ends. A rugby match where people end up with bloody noses and broken arms is not war, because although it’s organized, it also has no political ends. A barroom brawl is not war, because it’s not organized, and it has no political ends. Economic competition between states, however fierce, is not war, because it’s not bloody—it’s mass, it’s organized, and political—but it’s not violent. “We live in a world where technology has enabled individuals to cause a level of disruption that it might once have taken war to achieve.” In the terms of Clausewitz, where you have mass armies of thousands and thousands of people, and single battles that are killing tens of thousands of people, terrorism is small potatoes. But increasingly, we’ve got these things that, they’re not mass, they may not be organized, the political ends are sometimes unclear, and yet we’re calling them war. It’s not completely crazy that we want to, since we now live in a world where technology has enabled both states and even individuals to cause a level of disruption that it might once, 100 years ago, have taken war to achieve. So on some level, why not call it war if it sort of does what war does? On the other hand, Clausewitz would not have recognized [it], if you said “We’re at war with terrorism.” He would have just said, “Whatever you’re doing is not war.” Gilsinan: I see how terrorists aren’t, under the Clausewitzian definition, doing acts of war on the United States, but the United States’s “war on terror” is organized, violent, on a mass scale, and for the pursuit of— Brooks: We’re certainly responding with something that looks more like war. It’s just not all that clear that it’s entirely reciprocal. Could you have a war if only one party knows it’s a war? I don’t know how that fits into the Clausewitzian framework. Gilsinan: Do you have in mind a glory era in which the lines were totally clear—[an American] war started when Congress declared it and ended with a signed peace agreement between the combatants? Or are there ways in which we’ve seen this continuum, rather than binary, between war and not war? There was never a peace agreement when the fighting stopped after the Korean War in 1953. Brooks: The line between war and not war has never been as clear as international lawyers sometimes like to pretend it is—that we have this nice, neat framework that says wars have beginnings and ends; there are places that are at war; there are places that are neutral. There are combatants; there are civilians. You can kill the combatants, you can’t kill the civilians, end of story. And it’s never been that neat, obviously. On the margins at least, there have always been actors who didn’t quite fit—partisans, guerrillas, countries that were technically not at war but where there was a lot of proxy war activity going on. The categories were never perfect; they were always somewhat arbitrary. But now the exceptions have kind of overwhelmed the rule. Gilsinan: “Now” being in the post-September 11th era? Brooks: Very much so. September 11th itself didn’t create this world, but it’s both the symbolic beginning and a dramatic acceleration of a lot of trends that had been out there already. Gilsinan: Which is interesting, because that era, in terms of the U.S. response, was kicked off with the more classic, interstate wars. You invaded Afghanistan, you invaded Iraq. Brooks: Absolutely. And it was in some ways an illustration of our difficulty in thinking beyond the framework of traditional state-on-state conflict. Like there we were, confronted by something very different—an attack that didn’t involve traditional weapons, by a non-army, from multiple different nationalities. But the only thing we could figure out how to do to respond was go and invade a bunch of states. Gilsinan: Then it sounds like the categories weren’t necessarily a good thing. Brooks: They certainly limited our imagination, but I don’t know if I’d characterize it quite that way, because we had a choice. It was not inevitable that the 9/11 attacks would be categorized as starting a war in a legal sense. They could have been categorized as crime, they could have been categorized as in between—it’s not quite a war, not quite a crime, [so] we’re going to do some stuff that’s in between. It was not that there were no alternative categories available, it was that the Bush administration was not interested in using them. And I am not sure of the extent to which they themselves thought through the long-term implications of choosing to call it war—I think some did, some didn’t—but they sent us down one path, when other paths were available. “All these categories we’ve been talking about—war, peace, conflict, combatant, military—we made them up.” Gilsinan: When you went in [to the Pentagon] versus when you came out, what would you say was the biggest difference in your thinking about what war means? Brooks: I was both impressed and somewhat terrified by the dawning awareness that the Pentagon does everything. If you go in with a bit of a stereotype of, the military shoots guns and blows stuff up, and then you find yourself in meetings with military officials who are talking about running a program to prevent sexual violence in the Congo, and doing a big research project on how you most effectively dissuade foreign militaries from using sexual violence during conflict, and then you walk into another meeting and people are talking about how to promote micro-enterprise among Afghan women, it’s both kind of amazing and inspiring—that there’s this unbelievably diverse set of talents and people [and] projects. It’s amazing that the U.S. can still marshal so much talent and idealism. At the same time, it’s kind of scary, because you think, “Wait, whoa, is this the right place? Do we know what we’re doing? And what happens to the military as an institution when we’re asking it and expecting it to be all things to all people?” Gilsinan: What does happen? Brooks: Well, we’ll find out. It’s a big experiment, and I think there are several possibilities. There’s a bad for the military, bad for the world possibility, and here’s what that one looks like: The U.S. military does everything, but it’s doing a lot of stuff that people weren’t trained to do, does it badly, that has bad effects on the lives of human beings all over the world. It also decreases U.S. credibility, because what the world sees as the face of the U.S. is the military. It’s a uniformed figure, which has bad ramifications for civil-military relations worldwide and for democracy. Meanwhile, the military as an institution is demoralized and less effective because we’re trying to force one institution to do too many things. [There is a] more interesting possibility. All these categories we’ve been talking about—war, peace, conflict, combatant, military—we made them up. They didn’t come down from a divine power. This invites us to radically rethink what it is we want from our institutions, and how to organize them. And if the military is not doing these things well, but we think the United States needs to do them, and if we think it’s not realistic that the State Department or USAID starts doing them again or doing them well, it invites us to say, why shouldn’t we have a radically different military that combines within it a whole spectrum of activities, from traditional war-fighting to things that we think of as more peace-building and development? Why not really change how we think of the military, and change how we recruit, change our training, to make this an institution that does those things, does them well, and does them accountably? And that would be really hard. I think most people both in the military and outside of it sort of recoil at that and tend to want to go back to the much simpler “Well, shouldn’t the military just fight?” I don’t know if that’s even possible anymore. Gilsinan: [We’re discussing] the dangers of this blurring of the line between war and not war. And yet there are fewer people dying in wars now than in the World War II era, when the boundaries were pretty clear, even if not completely clear. So on the one hand, the U.S. military is in maybe more countries than ever before, almost every country on earth. On the other, the worldwide level of killing going on is substantially lower than [at] almost any time in history. If the long-term trend is in this positive direction, how much should we worry about the categories? Brooks: I think those are separate questions. I don’t think they necessarily have a whole lot to do with each other. But I also would question whether we have a long-term trend. In the sweep of human history, 50 or 60 years is not a long-term trend, and I do worry about that. Of course it’s good that we, over the last few decades, have seen a reduction in the number of people dying in violent conflict around the globe, but on the other hand, the world we live in remains extraordinarily dangerous in many, many ways, including some quite new ways, driven by technology—the speed at which epidemics can move around the world has increased due to changes in transportation technologies, the speed at which economic disruption can move around the globe because of changes in electronic technologies, et cetera. And, by the way, there are very many thousands of nuclear warheads and old-fashioned sources of destruction. So I’m not all that comfortable when people say, “Oh, happy, happy news, interstate conflict and death have dropped in the last few decades.” There have been plenty of other decades in world history where you’ve gotten a few decades, a hundred years, or a few hundred years of relative cessation in violence, only to have new catastrophes. I am very, very skeptical of claims that what we have is a long-term trend, as opposed to saying we have no idea whether this continues or not, and lots of things could destabilize it. “The Russians have been very creative about operating in that space between war and peace in ways that have been very hard for the West to respond to.” Gilsinan: One of the things that could destabilize it is the expansion of the U.S. military all over the world and the tendency to view everything that scares us, as you say, in terms of war. Brooks: When you build up a national and international legal system where our ability to constrain power and coercion are very much linked to the creation of this particular set of legal and political categories—armed conflict, foreign, domestic, military, civilian—then when those categories get blurry, you lose your ability to effectively constrain power. But that’s not the same thing as saying the answer is necessarily to shore up the categories again. The categories themselves are arbitrary—what’s important is their relationship to a much broader system of consensus, of institutions, of laws, and so forth. We didn’t create these categories because there’s something magical about [them], we created these categories because they were part of a system that helped us achieve certain normative goals that have to do with the rule of law, with promoting stability and peace and so forth, and if the categories aren’t doing it, then maybe the categories don’t make sense anymore. Maybe we now live in a world in which we need an in-between category, something that’s in between war and peace, with a set of in-between implications for law and for power and for rights. Gilsinan: Are those categories Western-invented? To what extent is, say, Russia observing those categories? To what extent is China? Brooks: Every culture in the world has had some concept of war and some notion of what should be permissible and what should be prohibited during wartime, and what the distinctions are between warriors and non-warriors. In that sense, there’s nothing Western about it. In a narrower sense, sure they’re Western—the Geneva Conventions [are] what we think of the modern law of armed conflict, [and they] very much arose out of conflicts between Western states in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. I think Russia and China—partly because they’re authoritarian, which gives them the ability to move a little more rapidly because they don’t have to worry about debate or argument, and they’re less scrupulous, frankly—have been much more quick than Western states to look at the issues we’ve been talking about and say, “These categories don’t make any sense anymore, and that is an opportunity for us. We can exploit the West’s continuing insistence that the categories do make sense while we do whatever we want.” Gilsinan: The “little green men” and turning off the electricity in Ukraine. Brooks: Absolutely, the Russians have been very creative about operating in that space between war and peace in ways that have been very hard for the West to respond to, in part because they sort of confound our categories. We want to look and say, is there a war? Or is there not a war? And the answer is, well, hard to say. Gilsinan: And that opens up space—potentially dangerous space—because I think some of what constrains American policymakers is saying “Look, do we really want to start a war with Russia over Crimea?” But if there’s some in-between option, of combating Russia in Crimea or contesting the annexation of Crimea, without resorting to war but resorting to some sort of in-between category—do you see that happening already? Brooks: Not very much. I think that particularly in the special-operations community within the military, [there are] conversations about [how] we’re probably permanently in some kind of gray area between war and peace. Our adversaries are operating with comfort and creativity in that world. How do we operate in that world? I think the question is, if we’re going to be operating in that world, how do we do so while preserving our commitment to rule of law and democracy? Gilsinan: The drone war is one of these issues where you could say it represents an in-between category—we’re not at war with Pakistan, we’re not at war with Somalia. There’s a long history of soldiers trying to kill at a distance, stretching back to the ages of throwing spears and longbows and up through the age of cruise missiles. And you mention that you’re troubled by the innovation of drones but that you had trouble articulating what it is about drones in particular that was disturbing. Can you try to articulate it? Brooks: The drone war both highlights what is promising and what is frightening about some U.S. efforts to kind of operate in that in-between space. Start with the promising part: Yes, of course, we’ve always tried to find ways to kill the bad guys from a distance without risking the lives of our people. It’s not a bad thing to want to do that. It’s a good thing. Nobody thinks our troops should be engaging in hand-to-hand combat with terrorists because it’s more chivalrous or something. And also the drone strikes represent part of a trend towards the individualization of warfare, where instead of firebombing Tokyo or Dresden, which kills thousands upon thousands of people from soldiers to infants indiscriminately, we now have a technology that enables us, combined with our intelligence and surveillance resources, to be really focused in who we target and say, we’re not going to drop a bomb on cities in Syria, we’re going to bomb this guy over here. And we are pretty amazingly good at hitting that guy and nobody else—not always, no question. And I sometimes say to my friends who say “I don’t like targeted killing,” “Would you prefer untargeted killing?” Because that’s what World War II was most of the time, with catastrophic results for civilian populations. But here’s the dark side: Because it’s individualized, because it operates below the radar and it’s a technology that enables covert use of force across borders, it becomes invisible and shielded from meaningful democratic accountability, and shielded to some extent from international laws because of the deniability. This is our way of exploiting categories. The Russians use the little green men, when we use covert targeted strikes by unmanned vehicles. We then get to say, “Hey, this is just lawful wartime targeting combatants, there’s nothing new here, so leave us alone.” And yet at the same time, normally in a traditional war you know who the enemy is, you know where the battle is, and we don’t know any of those things. The claims the U.S. makes about these targeted strikes are completely non-falsifiable because they’re really not saying anything, and what little they say says, “Well, we can’t tell you who we targeted, we can’t tell you why, it’s a secret, trust us.” And that’s very, very frightening.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.)

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

The nostalgic TV revival is a genre still in search of a purpose: Too often, shows like Arrested Development, Full House, and The X-Files have returned for no reason other than to gin up easy viewership, to appeal to those seeking to remember better days. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is the first such TV sequel that really uses the long-delayed circumstances of its existence to its advantage. There’s a smart self-awareness to the show (available on Netflix starting Friday) that goes beyond sly winks to the camera about how long it’s been since its titular mother-daughter team have appeared onscreen. Considering it could merely exist as a cheap cash-in, that A Year in the Life feels so emotionally resonant is somewhat miraculous.

DEPRIEST Associate Editor The Haz-Mat team from the Brighton Fire Company respond to the scene of a reported meth lab in the sewers beneath the Walmart store at Sheridan Drive and Bailey Avenue in Amherst on Monday. Also involved were the Eggertsville Hose Company, Clarence Fire Company and Buffalo Fire Department. Photo by David F. ShermanPurchase color photos at www.BeeNews.com Amherst police are currently investigating an apparent illegal drug lab housed within a sewer line underneath a Walmart parking lot. According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. The detective said that as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody as they were working to pursue leads in the case based on evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether or not there may be other hidden labs in the immediate area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m. Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311. email: kdepriest@beenews.com Return to top Browse Archives

As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for US$500 million in 2010. Analysts say the acquisition still won't enable Wal-Mart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed, Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Wal-Mart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. “This acquisition in tandem with its joint venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. “As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online.” As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it will incorporate some of Jet.com's “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. It is built on a pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper's home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal should help accelerate its path to profitability. McMillon said Wal-Mart customers likely will see lower prices and new brands aimed at millennials that have been carried by Jet.com. Wal-Mart customers may also have more control over creating their own basket to save money. As for perhaps merging the two sites eventually, McMillon said Wal-Mart wants to be thoughtful about how it approaches that. “This is about winning over time,” he said.

(Photo: John Zeedick, AP) Amazon.com's (AMZN) stock might be one of the hottest things going on Wall Street. The company is also worth more than any other retailer, and is the fifth most valuable U.S. company. But Amazon's bottom line is far less impressive. Despite all the attention Amazon gets from investors, ten retailers including Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), even fellow online retailer Priceline Group (PCLN) and apparel discounter TJX (TJX) are more profitable than the feared retailer hailing from the Pacific Northwest, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Amazon.com's retail dominance will be on full display this week and next as a wide variety of retailers report their quarterly results. The rapid growth of Amazon has already caused tectonic shifts in the retail business, made clear this week by Walmart's gutsy $3 billion buyout of small e-commerce player Jet. Amazon's influence is so widely watched that retailers attempt to steer clear of it and Bespoke Investment Group maintains a "Death By Amazon" index that tracks how retail stocks perform relative to Amazon (hint: Amazon is crushing them). "Three major trends affect business: globalization, demographic and technology," says Erich Joachimsthaler, CEO of brand consulting firm Vivaldi Partners Group. "These tectonic trio of shifts favor Amazon and its business model." Amazon.com's stock is outpacing the rest of retail.  (Photo: S&P Global Markets Intelligence) Bullishness for Amazon certainly isn't overlooked by investors. Thanks in part to the stock's 48% rise over the past 12 months, shares of the online retailer are trading for 191 times adjusted earnings over the past 12 months. That's five times higher than the average 36 times trailing price-earnings ratios of the other retailers in the S&P 500. But what's less known is that despite Amazon's larger-than-life image to consumers, the company's profits don't even come close to many of its retail peers. While Amazon has put Walmart on the defensive and is worth 59% more on the stock market, the nation's No. 1 retailer is actually 647% more profitable than its online rival. Walmart reported net income of $14.4 billion over the past 12 months, dwarfing the $1.9 billion reported by Amazon. USA TODAY Amazon posts fifth straight profit on Prime, cloud strength While Amazon is proud of selling just about any product imaginable, even a specialty retailer like Home Depot earns more. Home Depot's net income of $7.2 billion over the past twelve months outstrips Amazon's, even though Amazon's revenue of $120.6 billion is 33% higher than Home Depot's. Similarly, TJX, the company that operates discount apparel stores, hauled in $2.3 billion in net income over the past 12 months -- nearly 20% greater than Amazon.com's bottom line. It might be tempting to think Amazon's lower net income is a result of its online model that requires heavy tech investments. But name-your-own price online retailer Priceline.com earned $2.7 billion, 38% more than Amazon. Amazon, which started up in 1994, is far younger than its brick-and-mortar peers and famously lost billions of dollars in its early years. Still, the company generally has been profitable since 2001 despite heavy investments to expand its distribution network, and so it may be surprising how badly its earnings lag its rivals'. Make no mistake: Amazon.com's growth and momentum make it a darling with investors. The company's revenue soared 26% in the past 12 months, blowing away the average 8.8% growth of other big retailers. Walmart's top line shrunk 0.5% over the past 12 months by comparison. Eventually, retailers might get their mojo online and give Amazon.com some competition. But until then, the company's valuation continues to be larger than life even ias its profits play catch-up. "We believe the size of the market represents an opportunity for Amazon," says Tuna Amobi, analyst at S&P Global, in a report to clients. 74 CONNECTTWEET 276 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bfby0q

Jet is barely a year old — it was founded by CEO Marc Lore, in July of 2015, after Lore had already sold another online commerce startup to Amazon for over $500 million. But despite considerable fanfare around its opening, Jet has yet to prove itself: Eighty-one percent of U.S. consumers still don't know the company exists, and Jet has been burning through cash to build out its staff, marketing, and customer base. It had to drop its $49 membership fee last October, and it doesn't anticipate becoming profitable until 2020. "If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn’t be worth what they’re paying for it," Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of venture capital research firm CB Insights, told The New York Times. But dig a little below the surface, and Jet and Walmart seem to complement each another well. Let's start with Walmart. While it remains the world's largest company by revenue — last fiscal year, it pulled in a whopping $482 billion in sales — it's still primarily a brick-and-mortar company and struggles with online retail. That's not to say it doesn't have any online presence. In fact, it's the second biggest online retailer in the U.S. The problem is that the biggest, Amazon, is so far ahead of it. Raking in over $79 billion in revenue last year, that e-commerce colossus alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in online sales in 2015. By contrast, Walmart's online sales only reached just over $13 billion in 2015, or 2.5 percent of its business. And up until now, Walmart has done very little to change this dynamic. Yes, it's been keeping pace online with Amazon, growing at 12 percent to Amazon's 13 percent over the course of last year. But Walmart's online business starts from such a massively smaller baseline that it needs to do something extraordinary to catch up. More troublingly, Walmart has stumbled recently instead: Amazon grew 31 percent in the most recent quarter, while Walmart's online business grew just 7 percent — less than half the internet retail average. And Walmart is losing out to more traditional competitors, too: Staples almost equaled Walmart's online sales last year, and Target's online business — while much smaller — has recently grown a remarkable 30 percent. Bourree Lam noted at The Atlantic that the overall world of retail may finally be reaching the tipping point where no one can ignore the online side of the business anymore: "In the past decade, Walmart has largely focused on its sales in its physical locations. But earlier this year, the company announced the closure of over 150 U.S. stores." Observers also argue that Walmart's online site just isn't as user-friendly as Amazon's. So plenty of people now see the rise of online sales as a threat to Walmart's business. The purchase of Jet and the melding of its institutional expertise with Walmart is a way to deal with all this. In fact, Lore himself will take over running Walmart's online activity once the deal goes through. Then there's Jet's side of things. While it's currently in the red, Jet is hardly the first tech startup to spend its early years focusing on growth and sales over profits, trusting the latter will come in time. Its sales in February 2016 were 50 percent higher than in September 2015. Walmart said Jet has added 400,000 shoppers monthly, and is on track to reach $1 billion in sales annually — and all of that after just one year of operation. The merger should also speed along the process by which Jet gets its finances into the black. But Jet's real value lies in the algorithm it developed, which has allowed it to price competitively against even Amazon. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar retailers that rely on bulk in their business model let you buy a whole lot of each individual item — five pounds of mayonnaise or whatnot. The idea behind Jet, rather, is to allow shoppers to buy lots of smaller items — a normal amount of mayonnaise, of toilet paper, of cleaning supplies, etc. — all in one bulk purchase. And then, the algorithm accounts for what a customer wants to buy, where they live, and which retailers have shipping capacity nearby, and uses that information to game out the cheapest way to get all those items to them. As customers add items to an order, all the items get cheaper. And as a result, Jet's been able to offer prices that are 10 to 15 percent lower than its competitors. The one wrinkle is this business model relies heavily on the suppliers — their locations, their physical infrastructure, and the ability to coordinate all those pieces. That's where Walmart comes in: It boasts an enormous physical infrastructure of stores and distribution centers, all of which can now be placed at the beck and call of Jet's algorithm. Mergers between established powerhouses and young guns are always rife with uncertainty. But at least on paper, this one looks like a perfect match. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Posted: Aug. 10, 2016 0 Comments SHARE Photos by Candace Moore Walmart will occupy the former Albertsons grocery store on U.S. 1 north of 17th Street. The 40,000-square-foot building fits with Walmart's Neighborhood Market concept. Wawa, new to Indian River County, is currently building a gas station-convenience store on the southeast corner of U. S. 1 and 8th Street. Construction will soon begin on a new retail strip center on the adjacent property to the south. Illinois-based DTS Properties recently purchased Indian River Commons from Wells Fargo Bank for $16.5 million. Simon Property Group lost this shopping center and Indian River Mall in foreclosure last year. Developer Michael Rechter is adding an additional 10,000 square feet of retail space to Indian River Plaza (formerly Kmart Plaza) that will house new tenants, Moe's Southwest Grill, Vittorio's Pizza, Eden Salon & Spa and Mattress One. By Candace Moore, The Newsweekly Posted: Aug. 10, 2016 0 While commercial real estate has experienced a robust boom over the past three years, the old adages "what goes up must come down" and "once bitten twice shy" remain strong in the minds of investors. Meanwhile, others prefer to gamble and "make hay while the sun shines." Some economists forecast that global economic instability will cause a decline in real estate growth, which has realized a nearly 12 percent year-over-year price appreciation on a national average since 2013. But Ken Maggiacomo, president & CEO of Sperry Van Ness International Corp., sees it differently. "Even in the event of a domestic economic slowdown, the global uncertainty could lead to lower interest rates and even greater inflows of foreign capital supporting the domestic commercial real estate market," said Maggiacomo. "The current risk/reward proposition of U.S. investment is unbeatable." Florida has become one of the hottest markets in the country, drawing both national and international attention from developers and investors alike. With Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville setting a record-breaking pace in new commercial development and resales, smaller cities like Vero Beach are benefiting from the overflow, due to comparably lower real estate prices. Consequently, local business owners are moving locations to better position themselves for the future growth of Indian River County and the Treasure Coast as a whole. "There are four areas where we are currently seeing an interest in commercial growth," said John McCoy, chief of Current Development for Indian River County. "U.S. 1 between 8th and 16th Streets, U.S. 1 and Oslo Road, Route 60 west of 43rd, and at the Route 60 and I-95 interchange." New Walmart After sitting vacant for several years, the old Albertson's building on U.S. 1 north of 17th Street will have a new tenant: Walmart. "We are excited to bring our Neighborhood Market store to Vero Beach on U.S. 1 and provide our customers the benefits of a Walmart closer to the beach," said Walmart spokesperson Phillip Keene. "Our small format store will generate additional tax revenue, stimulate new investment and economic growth, and provide jobs for the area." Their neighborhood store concept has a smaller-footprint, averaging 38,000-square-feet, approximately a quarter the size of a Supercenter. Walmart plans to open the new location in early 2017 and employ approximately 95 associates. They currently operate more than 70 Neighborhood Markets in Florida. Walmart on Route 60 will remain open. Busy places New construction is underway in many locations along U.S. 1 between 8th and 20th Streets, beginning with the new Cumberland Farms at 17th Street. Local developer Michael Rechter is building a new retail center in the Indian River Plaza (formerly known as Kmart Plaza), which will soon house Moe's Southwest Grill, Vittorio's Pizza, Eden Salon & Spa, and Mattress One. Ay Jalisco Mexican restaurant will be closing their location on Miracle Mile next week to move into their newly constructed building located at 1902 U.S. 1. Owners plan to keep the location on Route 60 open. At the intersection of U.S. 1 and 12th Street, a new-to-the-area Wawa gas station and convenience store is under construction and a retail shopping center will be built adjacent to it. On the opposite corner, Dollar Tree has taken over half the retail space of Staples. According to McCoy, the former Lincoln Mercury dealership has been sold and will be the future site of O'Reilly Auto Parts and Goodwill. Out west "There are many retail users looking at Vero Beach right now, with the larger investors looking along the Route 60 corridor," said McCoy. "Aldi Supermarket and two hotel chains, including Fairfield Inn & Suites, are very interested in developing properties here." Illinois-based DTS Properties recently purchased Indian River Commons, adjacent to Indian River Mall, for $16.5 million dollars from Wells Fargo Bank. Simon Property Group lost the center in foreclosure last year. The center includes Best Buy, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Michael's, Office Depot, Ross, Carnival Shoes, Play It Again Sports, Firehouse Subs and 24/7 Fitness. Across the street, a Delaware developer is breaking ground for an Outback Steakhouse to be built next to the new free-standing Chick-fil-A that opened a few months ago. The existing Outback Steakhouse on U.S. 1 will be leased to national restaurant chain currently under lease negotiation with Rechter. Downtown Downtown Vero Beach is seeing a continued resurgence of growth as more restaurants and shops open surrounding 14th Avenue. A 7000-square-foot office building will be built at 1745 20th Street near the Indian River County Courthouse. Owner-developer Joseph Foglia and architect Hal Lambert collaborated with his brother Ron Lambert and Billy Moss of Lambert Commercial Real Estate on the conceptual plan. "The old diesel plant inspired us to keep with the same historic look that will compliment downtown. People have a real affection for that building," said Moss, "and this project perfectly blends the growing interest in both downtown and Route 60 development." The two-story brick structure is planned to have offices on the second floor with a lobby and 30 parking spaces underneath the building at street level. Its location is already drawing the attention of area attorneys and other law professionals, according to Moss, who will handle the sales and leasing with the rest of the Lambert Commercial team. Diesel plans Michael Rechter who is working feverishly to open American Icon Brewery on July 4, 2017, couldn't be more honored to have been awarded the purchase of the old diesel power plant from the city. "With this unbelievable project, I am excited to transform an iconic building into a fantastic brewery that will transform downtown," said Rechter. "With amazing projects going on all over town, I believe that Vero Beach is poised for the next phase of growth and redevelopment." With a presidential election around the corner and global economic pressures fueling caution, most major real estate economists are taking a positive but prudent stance on future commercial growth. SVN CEO Kevin Maggiacomo concludes, "Investors and property owners should be aware that today's commercial real estate economy has little in common with previous downturns. As such, we believe that the risk and return profile of commercial real estate is still attractive in 2016 and likely to remain so for at least the near-term horizon." 0 Share Tweet Email Print Specialty Publications Jupiter Courier Newsweekly Vero Beach Newsweekly Treasure Guide Progress & Innovation Luminaries Living Well Advertise with us The Vero Beach Newsweekly is inserted into the Indian River Press Journal every Wednesday and home delivered to select non-subscribers in Indian River County reaching more than 25,000 homes every week; nearly 9,000 to affluent homes in the 32963 area code.

Photo: Reuters Are the recent acquisitions of Monster Worldwide Inc. by Randstad Holding NV and of Jet.com by Wal-Mart the last roar of the old economy? The two deals coming within days of each other continue a trend of acquisitions by large old economy companies of start-ups from the digital world. Thus, last month Verizon Inc. bought Yahoo! Inc., a year after it acquired the former America Online for $4.4 billion. Last January, Capital One acquired San Francisco-based money management app, Level Money, and in January 2013, Avis Budget Group Inc. bought Zipcar which changed the car rental business with its hourly rentals plans. In December 2011, health insurance giant Aetna acquired mobile health startup, Healthagen, the developer of the popular health app iTriage. Much like Verizon and Aetna, the 56-year old Randstad Holding NV, a Dutch multinational, has been a global leader in its business. While Monster’s bread and butter and mainstay is its website, Randstad focuses on recruitment centres. It has some 4,500 branches. Wal-Mart is, of course, a global behemoth, the largest company in the world by sales. By contrast, the companies they have acquired are products of the digital age, whose promise often exceeded their performance. Both Monster and Jet.com had reached the end of the road. A day before the announcement of the acquisition, Monster reported a net loss in the second quarter of $124.2 million. One of the pioneers of the new economy, the company has seen its fortunes plummet over the years. Its stock peaked at more than $86 a share at the height of the Internet bubble in March 2000, valuing the company at almost $8.4 billion. From there to a valuation of $429 million, the price which Randstad paid, is the story of many digital start-ups that left it too late. These acquisitions mark the coming together of two intersecting currents. Start-ups who have lost their way and are either running out of cash or simply out of momentum and see no future are putting themselves up for adoption. And old economy giants petrified by the changes around them and fearful of being left behind in the new digital world are using their last weapons—their vast cash hoards—to buy them up, often to the bafflement of outsiders. Also Read: Randstad to buy job ads site Monster for $429 million Thus, even as Wal-Mart, whose online sales made up just 3% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, coughed up $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com, analysts seemed more concerned about the impact of anti-trust moves in Japan on Amazon’s operations, than the challenge to its business from the Wal Mart-Jet combine. Wal-Mart’s move also comes at a time when Amazon is pushing the boundaries of technology in retailing by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted shopping. Jet’s acquisition still doesn’t get Wal-Mart anything resembling Amazon’s Alexa AI which is its equivalent of a digital shopping assistant. In fact, all the major computing platforms from Microsoft, Google and Apple have some form of voice-activated AI assistant with search capability. There is thus a touch of desperation in the Bentonville-based giant’s purchase of Jet.com. Its revenues are stagnating—down at -0.7% for its year ending March 2016, while operating income declined by 11% in the same period. By contrast, Amazon’s Q2 revenue was up 31% y-o-y while operating income was up 180% to $1.3 billion. Bit players like Jet.com have increasingly got left behind in the winner-takes-all world of digital services. Wall Street Journal reported that Procter & Gamble Co., the world’s biggest advertising spender, in a rejig of its digital advertising strategy, is scaling back spends on smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. That has meant a rash of new-economy start-ups available for a song. And large, old economy companies are past masters at beating down such acquisition targets. But whether buying a start-up when its descent down the cliff has already started, is such a great idea, no matter the cost, is open to debate.

Local and New York State Police set-up a crime lab in the Walmart parking lot after officers on regular patrol found evidence of the meth lab in a large culvert that runs under the parking lot, WIVB reported. The unsecured culvert is large enough that people could stand and make meth inside. "We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore," Captain Scott Chamberlin told WIVB.

Published Aug 9th, 2016 7:49 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. –––––––––––––––––– Price matters. Retailers like Wal-Mart pride themselves on everyday low prices and “the customer is always right” mantra. So when a price mistake occurs at the retail shelf and a $12 LED lightbulb is marked down to $1.20 who takes the loss? In most cases the store cashier will honor the lower price and the store gets dinged for the mistake. However, suppliers also face risks when prices are incorrect at the shelf, according to retail experts. Dr. Chris Medenwald, an analyst with Fayetteville-based Field Agent, recently highlighted common reasons why consumer products are misplaced at retail in a blog post. He said with one passing glance a price tag can often make or break a sale. “An unappealing price, as perceived by the shopper, is a double-edged sword. Not only will you lose an immediate sale, you may also say goodbye to a customer for life – since they’ve already made a determination about your brand such as it’s too expensive or perhaps for other items, it’s too cheap,” he noted. He said suppliers often emphasize sales price and for those doing business with Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores that is always the case. But with more than 4,500 different stores across the U.S. how do suppliers know the prices that shoppers see at the shelf are the right ones. “Retail partners might, after all, misprice your products, leaving you and others wondering why sales are so disappointing,” he added. HUMAN ERROR The most obvious reasons an item is wrongly priced is because of human error. He said pricing errors can occur in simple misprints, or products can be missed within a certain category or item that is supposed to have a price adjustment. There is also the chance of pricing information being accidentally overlooked by store workers. If the price is wrong on the shelf and that wrong price correlates with the scanned price at the register the item could completely sell through before the mistake is caught. CVS made the mistake in 2011 of incorrectly pricing a Zhu-Zhu toy pet item. The price should have been 20% off the $20 price. But a pricing error was made as the stores advertised the toy items for 5 for $10 or $2 each. The items were sold at 7,000 stores and the retailers took a huge loss as the product sold out in a few hours time. Such mistakes are not that common according to Jami Dennis, CEO of Vendor Masters in Bentonville. She said prices are usually wrong because of human error at the store or a structural issue where it’s wrong in the retailer’s inventory system which is typically set up by the supplier or a consultant representing them. She said it is also possible for store managers or buyers to reduce a certain price because of competitive issues in a particular market and they don’t always tell the supplier they are doing it. “Once a buyer reduced a Walmart price to be more competitive in the H-E-B market in order to try and gain some marketshare from that retailer, which they can do. When it works the product will usually sell through and the supplier can always see the prices of their products within Walmart’s inventory system by running a simple report on the Retail Link portal,” Dennis explained. She said the one thing suppliers will want to monitor in such cases is to be sure the buyer and supplier margins are protected with the lower price, because if the margin is not there for the buyer there is always a chance they could discontinue the product. She said a short term price decrease is not typically a problem, but a longer-term lower price could drive down an item’s average price and negatively impact a supplier’s scorecard rating. DESYNCHRONIZATION Products may also be mispriced because of desynchronization. Dennis said when a new item is created and set up in Walmart’s system there could be a mistake made with respect to cost, color or quantity, for example. She said in cases like this the problem is more global and 9 times out of 10 it’s caught within the first 24 or 48 hours a product is on the shelf. When this happens the item when scanned in a store may indicate “item not found” in which the cashier has to use the shelf price, which might or might not be the correct price. Dennis said when the mistake is made in the item set-up, at the very least there will be a conversation with the supplier to discuss who eats the charge because the supplier will likely have some liability. She reiterated that suppliers can easily track the sales of their products to the store level using Retail Link and it’s to their advantage to look at the pricing reports on a regular basis, if they aren’t using a consultant to monitor that for them. She said if there is a pricing problem it will show up in the sales numbers. The one exception would be for suppliers like bread companies and bottlers who deliver directly to the stores, bypassing the distribution centers.

Now it’s as easy as parking. Four Southwest Florida Walmart Supercenters on Tuesday launched a free online ordering system that cuts out pushing shopping carts, browsing aisles and waiting in line. Now shoppers can select from more than 30,000 items online at Walmart.com/grocery and pick up the load from the store without ever having to leave their car. Walmart staff members have been training at select Southwest Florida Supercenters for about three weeks, said Ryan Reed, Walmart’s e-commerce market coach, who is based in Tampa. They are ready to do all the footwork for customers, from pulling the items from the shelves to pushing it out to the car. “It’s all about convenience and really doing taking the next step and doing our best to provide the low cost of Walmart, and helping people save time and spend time with their families,” Reed said. Where it's available The service is now available at the supercenters at 5315 Cortez Rd. W. in Manatee County, 17000 Tamiami Trail in North Port, 13140 S. Tamiami Trail in Osprey and 4150 Tamiami Trail S. in Venice. The staff at the Osprey Walmart Supercenter already had carried out four online deliveries by noon on Tuesday, said Christina McFadden, the Osprey store manager. Not everyone has the time or ability to browse through a grocery store. McFadden expects the program to gain popularity in the next month or so as the word spreads, and then to boom when Southwest Florida’s seasonal population returns in the winter. “I think it’s going to be a great experience," Mcfadden said. “I think it’s going to help a lot of our elderly customers who may have a harder time maneuvering through the store and maneuvering through the parking lot.” Popular across a large swath The program has been popular in a variety of demographics. In other markets where it has been introduced, busy families have used the service to set up quick shopping trips on the way home from work or from school and after-school activities. Parents of college students have used it to buy groceries for their out-of-town college students. “We’re going to take that anxiety of shopping and be able to do the shopping for them,” McFadden said. About 90 percent of customers use online ordering for fresh meat, dairy or produce to their baskets, but items such as diapers, school supplies and large dog food bags, according to information from Walmart.  How it works There is no sign-up fee, but a customer must spend at least $30 to use the service. All products cost the same as they do inside the store. Pickup orders can be scheduled for any day of the week and up to three weeks in advance. Same-day pickup is available, and orders placed by 1 a.m. are available for pickup after 8 a.m. that day and orders placed by 10 a.m. can be ready by 4 p.m. Stores with the service have parking spots labeled for online shoppers. The spots are marked with a phone number, and customers are asked to call it to let the staff know they’ve arrived. Expanding; not unique Walmart began rapidly rolling out the online pickup program late last year, and it’s now available in two dozen other Florida stores including locations in Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Naples, Orlando, Pensacola, Tampa and West Palm Beach. Walmart is not alone in its effort to simplify errands. Publix Super Markets Inc. announced plans last month to pilot grocery-delivery services with Instacart in parts of Miami. Shipt launched in the Sarasota-Bradenton area in October, and the on-demand mobile app promises to deliver Publix groceries right to your doorstep for a membership fee and a slight upcharge on products.

 There is a hidden risk in Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com Jamal Carnette, The Motley Fool Aug. 11, 2016, 10:03 PM 3,991 facebook linkedin twitter email print A shopper walks down an aisle in a newly opened Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago in this Sept. 21, 2011 file photo. Reuters/Jim Young This week, the United States' largest retailer, Wal-Mart, confirmed earlier rumors by buying upstart e-commerce company Jet.com. The Wall Street Journal reports Wal-Mart acquired the company for a total of $3.3 billion -- $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. Overall, this is a small sum for the Arkansas-based retailer; as a point of comparison, the $3.3 billion figure is approximately half of what the company paid in dividends last fiscal year. On the surface, it makes sense for Wal-Mart. Perhaps the biggest shift in the history of retailing, and certainly within the past decade or so, is the rapid growth of e-commerce. In that time, e-commerce sales have grown from a paltry 3.5% of total retail sales to 7.7% in preliminary estimates of Q1 2016. Overall, e-commerce has grown at a clip of 15% over the last two years, versus the overall real GDP growth of 2% to 3% during this period. Overall, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is a small bet on a growing market the company clumsily conceded to the likes of Amazon.com decades ago. The real risk to this deal is unlikely to show up in either company's balance sheet. The culture could not be more different between Jet and Wal-Mart A large-scale study from Big-Four accounting company KPMG found that 83% of all mergers failed to boost shareholder returns. There are many theories why shareholder value does not materialize: paying too much for the acquired company, synergies figures that fail to materialize, and poor due diligence. However, the biggest reason generally given is a mismatch in corporate culture. By all accounts, the cultural differences between Wal-Mart and Jet could not be more different. Wal-Mart, an established retailer, is mostly worried about their bottom-line results, paying billions for share buybacks in an attempt to boost their earnings-per-share figures. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. The Wall Street Journal article notes that the company has been adding 400,000 shoppers monthly and was on pace to sell $1 billion in merchandise annually. However, the company is unprofitable, and its goal of undercutting Amazon's prices would make it hard to grow margins. Last year, the company abandoned its goal of a $50 subscription fee, much like Amazon's Prime service, in an attempt to expand its shopper base. It appears Jet has sacrificed profit for growth. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. Business Insider Earlier this year, Wal-Mart did the exact opposite, choosing higher profit margins over revenue by closing 269 worldwide stores, many of which were the company's smaller Walmart Express concept and underperforming stores in Brazil. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet was the easy part There are potential benefits to the merger. Jet now has the buying power of the world's largest retailer and will most likely increase its already enviable 12-million SKU figure. What Jet brings is an Internet-focused and growth-first mentality. The downsides are obvious: If Wal-Mart applies its ruthless cost-cutting culture, it's likely Jet's growth will slow as marketing is pared back in favor of profit. Although the two will remain separate brands, there's an additional risk Jet becomes defined by Wal-Mart, which is the exact opposite of what a high-flying technology-based company would want to happen. In addition to the obvious financial loss in the event the acquisition fails, which is negligible in Wal-Mart's case, the company faces additional costs to combine distribution and potentially falling margins in the event Jet's razor-thin margin operations become a larger part of Wal-Mart's revenue haul. Overall, this was an aggressive move for a company continuing to fall behind in e-commerce. However, paying for Jet was the easy part; successfully integrating both companies is where this battle will be won or lost.    Read the original article on The Motley Fool. Copyright 2016.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search CVS Pay officially unveiled, dashing Apple Pay rumors Brittany A. Roston - Aug 11, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We’ve known for a few weeks now that CVS Pharmacy has been working on making mobile payments available in its stores, and all signs pointed toward those mobile payments involving Apple Pay. While CVS had confirmed in a roundabout way that it was looking into mobile payments, it didn’t specify platforms one way or the other. Now, it turns out via an official announcement, CVS wasn’t planning to launch Apple Pay: it was developing its own mobile payments platform called CVS Pay. CVS announced the new mobile payments platform today, saying it is an end-to-end payment platform launching in CVS Pharmacy stores. CVS Pay, much like Walmart Pay before it, is part of the CVS Pharmacy app, bringing the payments system, loyalty program, and prescription pickup tools all together in a single mobile destination. Much like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Walmart’s own version, CVS Pay has customers add their debit and/or credit cards to the CVS Pharmacy app, after which point they can hold their phone out to be scanned when checking out. The app presents a barcode, which the cashier scans. After scanning, the items are scanned, then the customer taps which payment card they want to use within the app. The app can also be used to handle all aspects of prescriptions using a single scannable barcode. In order to verify prescriptions and payments, the user has to enter some kind of detail, like a PIN and signature. Payment confirmations are delivered in-app after the payment goes through. In the present, CVS Pay is available in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, but the company anticipates rolling it out to all stores across the nation by the end of this year. Both iOS and Android apps are supported, with the mobile payment app supporting all major credit cards, including American Express, MasterCard, Visa, and Discover. The app also supports debit cards, HSAs, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

Macy’s announced plans on Thursday to close about 15% of its department stores, the latest effort to adapt to shifting consumer preferences for online shopping. In a sign of how dramatically the retail shopping landscape is changing, Macy’s is closing 100 of its stores nationwide. Macy’s announced the closures Thursday. They represents about 15% of all Macy’s department stores. The iconic retailer did not disclose the locations of stores, but said most of them will be shut down in early 2017. The Macy’s move is the latest in a wave of store closures amid the rise and success of Amazon and other online shopping options. For instance, Walmart announced plans in January to shut down 269 stores this year and just this week, inked a $3.3 billion deal to acquire Amazon rival Jet.com. Sports Authority, once the nation’s largest sporting goods retailer, is shutting all 450 of its stores after filing for bankruptcy. Other traditional retailers such as Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl’s have also pulled the plug on hundreds of stores in recent months. It’s a grim picture for retail store workers — there have been 47,000 retail layoffs announced so far this year alone, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data. Walmart’s closures alone impacted 16,000 workers. Macy’s closures come amid a sixth-straight quarterly decline in sales. However, sales fell less than feared and the company said it’s “encouraged” by recent sales trends. Wall Street applauded the dramatic store closures, sending the stock surging 16%, on track for its best day since 2008. Macy’s said its new strategy is to concentrate its financial firepower and talent on its best-performing locations. The department store plans to invest in strong stores by highlighting new vendors, increasing the size and quality of its staff and investing in new technology. “We operate in a fast-changing world, and our company is moving forward decisively to build further on Macy’s heritage,” Macy’s CEO Terry Lundgren said in a statement. Macy’s said the store closures could result in the loss of about $1 billion in sales, even after accounting for shoppers who would go online and to other Macy’s locations. The company plans to offset that loss in sales by cutting costs, even beyond shutting down these stores. It’s not clear how many jobs will be impacted by these moves. Macy’s told CNNMoney it won’t detail layoffs until it finalizes its store closure list. Macy’s said employees at stores slated for closure may be offered positions in nearby stores “where possible,” Macy’s said. Workers who are laid off will be offered severance benefits. “Macy’s is committed to treating associates affected by store closings with respect and openness,” the company said. Karen Hoguet, Macy’s chief financial officer, said most of the stores being closed are “underperformers, or are in weak locations.” The Macy’s move is the latest blow to malls, many of which rely on the iconic department store to serve as an “anchor” tenant. Those malls impacted risk losing a major source of revenue and a suffering a traffic slowdown in traffic that is likely to hurt other stores. Struggles for other department stores make filling the hole left by Macy’s even more challenging. Shares of major mall owners General Growth Properties and Simon Property Group slumped 3% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday. Even some premiere Macy’s locations could eventually be scaled back. The company said it continues to “analyze possibilities” of bringing in alternative tenants into its flagship Herald Square location in Manhattan as well as the downtown stores in Chicago and Minneapolis. Macy’s revealed it’s also in talks to sell its Men’s Store on Union Square in San Francisco for redevelopment. Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said the Macy’s store closures are “sensible,” but largely the result of a “self-inflicted defeat.” “Macy’s has simply not bothered with a large rump of stores for many years: they have lacked investment, been devoid of management attention, and now look distressed and dispirited,” Saunders wrote in a report. The key will be whether Macy’s is truly committed to rejuvenating its remaining stores in a way that gives consumers a reason to shop in person rather than online. 32.898004 -97.040015 Related stories Martha Stewart Frying Pans Recalled for Causing Welts and Burns Macy’s Closing Up to 40 More Stores Starbucks, Other Companies Look to Hire 100,000 Young People Filed in: National/World News Topics: Business Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email How Do You Express Yourself?

The section of Holton Whitehall Road, extending from U.S. 31 to Silver Creek Road, is expected to be closed for up to three weeks during the road reconstruction project. An open cut across Holton Whitehall Road is planned for today, Aug. 11, for work on a water main crossing. This map shows the area on Holton Whitehall Road where the road construction project is taking place.Google Map  The project, designed to improve the roadway and add turn lanes to that stretch of Holton Whitehall Road, was originally scheduled to begin on Aug. 1. The project had been delayed because of some changes to the original plan for the project, according to the Muskegon County Road Commission. Wal-Mart, which hired its own contractor for the project, is heading the completion of the project through a permit with the Muskegon County Road Commission, which has oversight of that section of road. Turn lanes will be added to that section of the road, which will be widened as part of the project. It is currently a two-land road in that section extending from U.S. 31 to Silver Creek Road. A detour is posted, directing motorists on Holton Whitehall Road to take Russell Road, then White Lake Drive, and then Whitehall Road. According to the road commission, local traffic may be able to get through, however, it is encouraged to use the detour route for safety reasons. The 122,000-square-foot store will offer a full line of fresh produce, general merchandise including health and beauty items, baby and pet supplies, toys and games, electronics, sporting goods, apparel and household items. A full-service pharmacy with drive-thru, vision center, money center, digital photo-processing center and Wal-Mart pickup will also be at the location. Wal-Mart is tentatively planning a grand opening in the spring or early summer of 2017, a spokesman said earlier this year. The construction of the store is the end of a long, pre-construction legal battle between the Bentonville, Ark.-based company and a local group calling itself BOW NOT — Back Off Wal-Mart, Not Our Town.

PETERSBURG Related News/Archive Suspect arrested in St. Petersburg home invasion after chase in stolen car; second man sought 1 Month Ago Police: St. Petersburg mother arrested for child abuse 4 Months Ago Arrest made in St. Petersburg Walmart attack 2 Months Ago A 39-year-old man was arrested Aug. 3 on charges that he stole a macaw named Kirby, according to an arrest report. Kirby was at home with his owner, James Clark, at 3237 53rd Ter. N when Danny Ray Teer broke into the mobile home and took him, the report says. Clark told Pinellas sheriff's deputies he knew who stole his bird, worth about $2,500. When they visited Teer, deputies found Kirby in good condition and took him home. Teer of St. Petersburg told deputies he stole Kirby "due to Clark owing him money for labor provided as an employee/employer agreement," a report states. Teer was jailed on a charge of burglary while the structure was occupied. LARGO Couple used stolen electricity meter for eight years, says a Duke Energy report to police A couple living at 8765 Abbey Lane are accused of stealing a neighbor's power meter and using it for more than eight years, totaling $15,358 worth of electricity, arrest reports state. Duke Energy reported to Largo police that Calvin Berry and Aneta Giadla had been using the meter since December 2007. After their arrest, Giadla, 39, admitted that Berry, 37, installed the meter years ago, according to the arrest report. They were jailed Aug. 2 on charges of grand theft from a utility. Clearwater Police: Driver slammed into telephone pole, but tells officers a different tale On Aug. 2, David Schnabel Jr. reported that he was the victim of a hit-and-run in the 2400 block of Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard. A blue Ford F-150 struck him as he pulled out of an AutoZone parking lot, he told officers. But after police inspected his car, along with a witness statement, it was determined that Schnabel, 30, "had in fact hit a telephone pole and was at fault for the traffic accident," an arrest report states. Schnabel told them he lied "to avoid getting in trouble." He was arrested on a charge of false report of a crime, and cited for careless driving. Compiled by Laura C.

By Jay Hancock August 11, 2016 Walmart holds down prices through brutal negotiation with suppliers. Similarly huge insurance companies might strike better deals with hospitals and pass on the savings, some suggest. (iStock) Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. Now that hospitals have themselves combined, in many cases, into companies that dominate their communities, insurance executives argue the only way to fight bigness is bigness. No. 2 health insurer Anthem’s proposed marriage to No. 6 Cigna would let the combined company “manage the cost drivers that negatively impact affordability for consumers,” Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish told Congress last year. The bigger company could “negotiate better reimbursement rates” with medical providers, says Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher. In metro areas with only a few big insurers, hospital and doctor bills tend to be lower than what economists would otherwise expect. If only one or two insurers are bidding to include providers in their networks, hospitals and doctors must submit to the offered deal or risk getting shut out of a huge piece of business. This KHN story also ran on NPR. It can be republished for free (details). “There’s some literature out there that does show that when you have relatively concentrated insurance markets, they tend to keep actual hospital costs down,” said Yevgeniy Feyman, a researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a fellow with the Manhattan Institute. The American Hospital Association as well as the American Medical Association, trade groups for hospitals and doctors respectively, have long worried that insurance mergers do just that. Now that Anthem is trying to buy Cigna, and No. 3 health insurer Aetna wants to buy No. 5 Humana, they’re even more concerned. Both deals “have the very real potential to reduce competition substantially” and “diminish the insurers’ willingness to be innovative partners with providers and consumers,” AHA lawyer Melinda Reid Hatton wrote to antitrust authorities after the combos were announced. But hospitals have built their own market power through numerous mergers, giving them broad ability to raise prices paid by employers, taxpayers and consumers beyond what a competitive market would allow, economists argue. Hospitals “are much more concentrated than insurance markets,” said Glenn Melnick, a health care economist at the University of Southern California who has researched the matter. “They face a lot less competition than the [health] plans do.” Why not give hospital giants somebody their own size to negotiate with? For one thing, insurers might just pocket higher profits from low provider prices instead of passing the savings to consumers and employers. “I don’t find any evidence that reduction in provider payment leads to reduction in insurance premiums, and I don’t know of any study that does,” said Leemore Dafny, an expert in insurance markets and an economist at Harvard Business School. Feyman suggests requiring insurers in concentrated areas to spend 90 percent of their revenue on medical care. That might reduce their ability to boost profits with premium increases while preserving their ability to hold down hospital and doctor costs, he said. But he sees such a measure as only a “worst-case scenario” for the most monopolized insurance markets, not a recipe to allow the Anthem and Aetna deals to go through. Antitrust regulators are siding with the hospitals and doctors. Late last month the Justice Department sued to block both insurance mergers, arguing that competition is important to keep premiums down and that the deals “would leave much of the multitrillion-dollar health insurance industry in the hands of three mammoth insurance companies.” They also rejected the Walmart argument, which is related to what economists call “monopsony.” Monopsony is the opposite of monopoly: Instead of using market dominance to raise prices for consumers, huge buyers force down prices from suppliers. Walmart is often described as holding monopsony-like power. But critics of the insurance deals say monopsony can go too far. If the buyer pushes prices too low, suppliers stop producing, making needed goods and services unavailable. “As a result of the merger, Anthem likely would reduce the rates that … providers earn by providing medical care to their patients,” the Justice Department argued. “This reduction in reimbursement rates likely would lead to a reduction in consumers’ access to medical care.” Accepting Walmart logic for health care might bolster arguments for an even bigger, more powerful buyer of medical services: the government. A “single-payer,” government health system, of the type advocated by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, would be the ultimate monopsony: one buyer, negotiating or dictating prices for everybody. Neither the hospitals nor the insurance companies want that.

just-style home News & insights News Walmex sells Suburbia clothing unit for US$853.3m By Beth Wright | 11 August 2016 Font size Email Print Supermarket retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico, known locally as Walmex, has agreed to sell its Surburbia apparel division to Mexico's biggest department store chain, El Puerto de Liverpool SAB, for MXN15.7bn (US$853.3m) in a move it says will allow it to focus on its core business.. As part of the deal Liverpool will assume MXN1.4bn in debt related to leases, and an additional MXN3.3bn in dividends and a capital reduction when the deal closes. It is understood the acquisition includes 119 stores, of which seven are fully owned, 78 are on property leased from third parties and 34 alongside other Walmex operations, as well as Suburbia brands and other marketing and logistics assets. For the year ended 31 December 2015, Suburbia accounted for 3.5% of consolidated sales of Walmex and 5% of its consolidated EBITDA. Following the earlier sales of its restaurant and banking business, the sale of Surburbia represents the final step in Walmex's plan, announced in 2013, to rationalise its portfolio of operations and focus on its efforts on its core retail business. "The agreement reached with Liverpool is good for our shareholders, our associates and our clients," says Guilherme Loureiro, executive president and CEO of Walmart de Mexico. "Surburbia and our associates are in good hands to continue to grow and serve our customers. With this agreeement, we are fully focused on our core retail business and our objective of doubling our total shares by 2024." Walmex placed Surburbia on sale in January but said it would give no assurances that a transaction would take place.

Donald Trump, with his unfiltered rhetoric and lack of political experience, may be ushering Hillary Clinton into the White House, according to self-described swing-voter moms, who are more resigned than enthusiastic about that prospect. Participants in two small discussion groups of up-for-grabs female voters in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, described their presidential choice as the “lesser of two evils” Tuesday evening as Democratic and Republican pollsters and journalists listened in. In both cities, moderators asked the women a series of questions, including “How can Trump win?”  “If something happens and Hillary Clinton is indicted,” replied Joanna, a 30-year-old mother of four from Phoenix, who said she’s a homemaker and undecided about the presidential contest.  Like nine others in her focus group of 10, Joanna predicted Trump would lose to Clinton this fall. Their predictions aligned precisely with 10 mothers gathered separately in Columbus. “I think Donald Trump is going to say something that’s going to scare everyone,” predicted Gidget, a married mother of two and customer service manager from Columbus, who nonetheless said she’s leaning toward voting for the New York businessman. “They’ll think, ‘Whoa, he’s off the chain.’” “He’s a jerk,” said Ruth, a client service specialist from Columbus, describing Trump. “That’s just who he is,” she added, pointing to his TV persona when he starred in the reality series “The Apprentice.” The women, all mothers who shop regularly at Wal-Mart, were paid to participate and screened as likely voters. They described an election climate many said they found unsettling, in which “racism” and differences of opinion splintered the discourse among relatives in otherwise close families, between spouses, and created frictions between offspring and parents. Facebook and social media during this election cycle amplified political divisions, the women observed, along with coverage of the race by major media outlets they faulted as biased and addicted to conflict. “I’ve already gotten tired of hearing about it, and we’ve got months to go,” said Anita, a divorced health analyst and mother of one child in Columbus.  “I had to stay off social media for a week,” said Stephanie, a Trump-leaning undecided customer service representative and saleswoman from Phoenix. “It’s just too much.” Ohio and Arizona are among nine states on the RealClearPolitics Electoral College map considered toss-ups. Based on the latest polling, the RCP map shows Clinton leading Trump, 256-154, in the candidates’ pursuit of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.  “Wal-Mart Moms” is a label applied by some political analysts since 2008 to a key subgroup of not-especially-partisan female voters. They’re described as young-to-middle-aged mothers (18 to 44 years old), mostly white, and registered with both major political parties. They make up an estimated 14 percent to 17 percent of the electorate.  The demographic is considered important because of the sway that “persuadable” moms wielded in 2008 and 2012, when they backed Barack Obama for president, but supported congressional Republicans in 2010, when the GOP took control of the House of Representatives. In this presidential cycle, Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and nonpartisan polling firm Purple Strategies teamed up to continue the focus group conversations for sponsor Wal-Mart. The enthusiasm for Clinton among the women gathered together Tuesday was muted, evidenced by repeated descriptions of the former secretary of state as “cold,” a “liar,” and “untrustworthy.” “I don’t know what she can do,” said Dana, a single, 29-year-old African-American mother of two from Columbus. “I know she can lie.” Linda, 56, a widowed African-American business owner from Phoenix, gave this advice to Clinton on her email troubles: “Don’t just sweep it under the carpet, because there’s so much stuff under there, you can’t even lay the carpet down flat now.” The Arizona group burst into laughter. Focus group participants said Clinton’s vulnerabilities included events dating to the 1990s, when she was first lady, as well as the current revelations about her personal email server while serving as secretary of state. A number of the women described Clinton as a typical politician who has trouble “owning her mistakes,” who “says what people want to hear.” Clinton, the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major political party, was also described as experienced, diplomatic, educated, an accomplished speaker, powerful, and “more presidential” than Trump. The women who indicated they are leaning toward supporting Trump said they appreciated his ability to say what many Americans are thinking when it comes to the country’s problems, even when they conceded his rhetoric has repeatedly proven distracting, offensive, or both. “I think Trump understands where the American people are coming from better [than Clinton],” said Amy, a Phoenix massage therapist who described herself as “a Christian woman.” But in the dog days of August, the focus groups largely agreed they felt dispirited about the presidential race. They described themselves as economically better off than they were four years ago, but clearly were not steeped in distinctions between Trump and Clinton when it comes to most major economic policies. A number of the women in the two cities said they might watch some or all of the presidential debates (the first of three is scheduled Sept. 26). The 2016 election may be a vote in opposition to one or the other presidential nominee, many of the women suggested, rather than a vote for an inspiring choice. One woman predicted a single term would be all either candidate would get from voters. At least half the Columbus group weighed the option of voting for a third party candidate, particularly the Libertarian ticket represented by former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, as a fallback. “There’s a sense that people are looking for something else,” said Public Opinion Strategies pollster Neil Newhouse as the Ohio women wrapped up their conversation.  Alexis Simendinger covers the White House for RealClearPolitics.

Black Friday shopping is awesome. But back-to-school shopping? Yuck. That’s just work.” My friend sipped her ice coffee and turned back to her laptop — on which browser tabs for Staples, OfficeMax, Walmart, Amazon and several other retailers were open. A long list with a school logo on top lay threateningly on her desk. But she wasn’t clicking Buy Now just yet: her state’s sales tax holiday was due to run for two days later that week and meanwhile, she was biding her time and comparing prices. My friend is far from alone in her exhaustive — yet down-to-the-wire — online quest. The National Retail Federation (NRF) projects that almost half of the nearly $76 billion spent in 2016 by parents during the July-August back-to-school shopping season will be online. The Market Is Massive — and Growing Even more important, the NRF-sponsored survey found that nearly a quarter of cost-conscious back-to-school and back-to-college shoppers — 22 percent to be exact — wait until the last minute to make their purchases, in effect counting on closeout sales and sales tax holidays to lower their overall spend. In a season that’s shaping up to bring in 10 percent more revenues than last year, this is huge news for online retailers. It means that even relatively late in the back-to-school game, retailers still have the unique opportunity to tweak key user experience parameters that can have an immediate impact on sales. 10 Ways to Nurture and Nab the Online Sale So, quick, before it’s all over, here are ten factors to keep in mind and double-check. Some are simple and some are more complex, but all of them can help you ensure that the parents of the world choose your tab on the browser when it comes to outfitting their little darlings for the school year to come. 1. Realize that nobody’s in a very good mood Unlike holiday shopping that brings with it some sense of warmth and good cheer, back-to-school shopping really is a thankless grind. And for most parents, it’s the final hurdle to clear after a long, hot, tiring summer home with the kiddos. So first treat yourself to a viewing of Staples’ classic 2013 back-to-school commercial.  Then remember: To keep Mom and/or Dad happy, make their every online purchase decision simple, straightforward and crystal clear.  2. Accept the reality that returns will happen Just as in the bricks-and-mortar world, returns will happen. Don’t fight them. Make sure your return policy is easily accessible and clearly worded. Linking to information about returns right from the digital shopping cart doesn’t encourage returns — it raises purchase confidence and conversions. The same thing is true for spelling out your price guarantee policy. 3. Be crystal clear about your shipping schedule The clearer you can be about exact delivery dates — and the earlier in the funnel you provide this information to purchasers, the better. Since you know time is tight, tell your shoppers right upfront what it will cost them to get their order there on time. How can you know if time is especially tight? If you geolocate unregistered users and already know the location of your registered users, you can predict with some certainty when school will start. Impress them and show that you’ve got your finger on the community pulse by synching delivery options to their local back-to-school timeframes. 4. Clearly display your promotions We recently discovered that one of our Fortune 100 clients was advertising its promotions via banners and direct mail but nowhere was there a link on its website. Make sure that your promotions are clearly integrated into your site’s information hierarchy and menus — including from the shopping cart — because now is when your customers most want to know about and act on them. 5. Align your promotions with your inventory Make sure your promotions are aligned with up-to-date stock data to avoid sending out promotions for items that are nearly out of stock. Tired summer Mom will not be amused when the juicily discounted backpack/laptop/graphing calculator she needs is out of stock three minutes after your promotional email lands in her inbox. At the same time, if you know you have only 50 units of a popular product left, don’t be afraid to create urgency. Keep in mind that the issue isn’t availability; it’s expectations. 6. Make it easy (and worthwhile) to buy more Bundle, bundle and bundle again. Then discount the bundles, and make the price difference really clear. For example, if buying items separately costs $5 more, don’t make customers guess: boldly label the bundle “a $5 savings!” Even if the benefits of add-on purchases aren’t line item related, they still need to be crystal-clear. Amazon does this masterfully with its free shipping threshold alerts such as “ten more dollars and you’re eligible for free shipping.” 7. Give your “Very Important Parents” the VIP treatment Returning customers should be treated like the VIPs they are. You know they’re under back-to-school deadlines, so offer them incentives that make their lives easier, especially on shipping costs and delivery dates. Back-to-school season provides an ideal opportunity to be seen as a trusted friend who will deliver the goods — literally and figuratively — time and time again. 8. Make redeeming coupons fun Deep in their hearts, consumers know that coupons are just a promotional gimmick but they work really well and the easier they are to use, the more effective they are. Don’t make your customers copy and paste long promotional codes or write anything down to get discounts. Keep your coupons simple, feature them prominently and don’t take the fun away by adding too many restrictions. 9. Keep promotions focused Even the most valuable offering will be ignored if there’s too much background noise. So don’t overwhelm your customers with more than one promotional email each day. Show them the value of your offering and make it worthwhile for them to come visit but don’t add to the pressure by flooding their inboxes. 10. Maximize your site performance As with any high-traffic season, back-to-school is not the time for poor site performance. Even if you’re under a code freeze, keep checking your website performance, VOC (voice of customer) insights and conversion funnels. If something is wrong, you need to be able to fix it on the spot. Walk in Their Shoes Any offline retailer will tell you that knowing your customers’ state of mind is key to closing the sale. In back-to-school season, Mom and Dad’s state of minds is hassled. Put yourself in their shoes and evaluate your site’s user experience through eyes that are simultaneously shopping for the best deals on a tight budget and watching a five-year-old with a red Popsicle jumping on a white couch. Don’t mess with Mom or Dad this back-to-school season and your tab on the browser is more likely to come out on top.

(Lisa Dunlap Photo)   (Note: According to relatives, the youth involved in the alleged shootings are related and share a last name but only three are brothers. The 15-year-old is a cousin to the other three, they said. Also, the three older brothers did go to jail for charges related to the incidents.)   Three juvenile brothers have been issued criminal arrest citations for their alleged involvement in causing thousands of dollars worth of criminal damage by shooting at store and car windows along Main Street Tuesday night before their vehicle crashed near Wal-Mart when they became aware of police in their proximity. Their 10-year-old brother, whom Roswell Police Department spokesman Ryan Posey said was in the silver Chrysler 300 with his siblings, was released without being charged. “Basically it was a bad idea,” said Posey. “The boys were all juveniles, juveniles going around shooting BB guns and they wrecked their car.” The names of the youth were not provided given their ages. The three older boys, ages 15, 14 and 13, received criminal arrest citations but were not incarcerated. They are charged with at least 15 misdemeanor counts of criminal damage and evading police. They also were charged with at least one felony count of aggravated fleeing. According to police damage reports and statements, the youths drove north on Main Street at about 7 p.m. and allegedly began shooting at cars and store fronts. Bullet dents were observed in the glass store windows and doors of Barringer’s Blossom Shop at 314 N. Main St., Bows & Britches Boutique at 320 N. Main St. and the Law Office of Thomas Lilley at 330 N. Main St. Police reports also indicate that a Dodge Caravan parked near Bank of Southwest at 226 N. Main sustained damage to the driver’s side window and a sliding door window. The boys also allegedly shot at least five vehicles at Roswell Mall at 4501 N. Main St. and Sam’s Club at 4400 N. Main St. By about 8 p.m., police officers near Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart were checking out damage reports when they saw the Chrysler and decided to intercept it. Shortly afterward, the vehicle crashed in a vacant lot north of Wal-Mart at Pine Lodge Road and Main Street. “They weren’t even chasing it yet, they had just turned on their lights,” said Posey. “His desire ran away from his skill and he crashed himself. The police officer really didn’t have much time to get anything out on the radio.” Posey stated that three black BB guns were found with the boys along with many BB pellets. Most property owners declined to comment. Samantha Wagoner, owner of Bows and Britches Boutique, expressed disappointment with the culprits. “We work hard for what we have and they totally disrespected it,” she said. She estimated the damage of bullet dents in her windows at $1,500 or more. Anita Eoff, the owner of the Dodge Caravan, said she was parked on Third Street Tuesday night while working inside the Bank of Southwest on Main Street. She said that she didn’t hear anything while working inside the building but, upon leaving work shortly after 7 p.m., she had discovered that two of her vehicles’ windows had been shot out. She then called police. “You are disappointed when you come out and find this type of damage,” she said. She added that she is not sure of the total cost of damages. Officer Posey said that the Juvenile Probation Office and the District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to proceed with criminal cases related to the incidents.

Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica , also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about $247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about $6.93 billion.

The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new U.S. e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online. – Reuters Tags: Amazon | More Retail & Wholesale Stories The Big Boys Toys kicks off in Abu Dhabi TTM completes post-tensioning job for Qatari mall iPhady announces ‘White Friday’ sale Big Boys Toys returns bigger this year 15 win Middle East jewellery awards Dazzling Jewellery Arabia opens in Bahrain Cityland Mall signs up Carrefour as hypermarket operator Entertainer Bahrain 2017 now available at discounted price Huawei Mate 9 now available in UAE Dubai to host Olympus regional HQ Breitling launches Chronomat 44 Blacksteel Special Edition in Bahrain Bahrain mall project on track for 2017 launch Majid Al Futtaim unveils city centre revamp plan Souq.com to launch White Friday sale across GCC Dunkin’ Donuts opens new outlet in Dubai First Avenue signs up Carrefour as anchor tenant City Centre Deira re-launches ‘Break Time’ Marka Q3 revenue hits $17.9 million Juma Al Majid launches top European brand Samsung to buy connected tech firm Harman for $8bn Reem Mall inks partnership with Dubai Holding Group Alabbar, PIF to launch $1bn e-commerce venture UAE tops in consumer confidence in region Smartphones driving global power bank market Porsche Design, KEF launch hi-fi audio systems Huawei MateBook now available in UAE Dubai Watch Week to see largest coordinated watch launch Majid Al Futtaim starts work on flagship Oman mall Emaar Malls nine-month net profit up 16pc Graff unveils stunning heart shape diamond Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Since March, land owner and Florida businessman Chad Henderson has been working to get residents on board. “We are taking their ideas into consideration, things like elevation, how the store would look and feel, things such as green space within the parking lot, landscape buffering between the store and the residential community next door,” Henderson said.  Henderson has met with members of the Canebrake Home Owners Association and held a pair of meetings in the neighborhood on Monday.  A private Facebook page, “Say no to Big Box Walmart West Hattiesburg on Cole Road” has gained over 1,400 members and even gives residents an avenue to sign a petition against the Walmart store. “This is nothing that has been recent, this has been an ongoing process,” Henderson said.  Henderson added that Walmart has been in a contract for roughly three years and has been working to be a fit in the community. Potential mayor of the proposed city of Bellevue, John Adcock, said he is opposed to the store. MOBILE USERS: View the Walmart plans here. “I am against having an 180,000 square feet big box directly next door to me, as I think most anybody would be,” Adcock said. “It has its place, but right next door to a neighborhood, and the most populated neighborhood in the community at that, it just does not go there.” Henderson added that changes to store hours, lighting in the parking lot, truck delivery times along with other things have been addressed with Walmart officials. “They have agreed to delivery times, agreed to increase landscaping, and landscape buffering, things that are well above the code,” Henderson said. “We are not looking to put tattoo shops, and bait shops, pawn shops, things like that." Chick-Fil-A and Starbucks are the types of stores that are being targeted to accompany Walmart, according to Henderson. Adcock added this one of the reasons that he and other citizens are pushing the city of Bellevue. “Right now that property is not zoned for an 180,000 square foot big box retailer, it is zoned the way that it is for a reason,” Adcock said. "You don’t go straight from big box type commercial to a neighborhood.” Henderson said they have missed the date to file any paperwork for the September Lamar County Planning Commission meeting, but added there is no set timeline. “This is something we are going to continue to work at and try to get people on board,” Henderson said.  Copyright 2016 WDAM.

The acquisition of Jet.com by Walmart for $3 billion in cash appears to have made the founder of IdeaDash an "accidental millionaire." Fortune reports: "Martin, who is the founder of a startup called IdeaDash, won Jet.com's nationwide marketing competition -- Jet Insider -- in early 2015. The contest offered a reward of 100,000 shares of Jet stock to the contestant who got the most people to sign up for 6-month free trial 'insider' memberships to the membership shopping site, a sort of online Costco or Sam's Club. According to his company's website, Martin took first place out of the 350,000 people who participated, getting over 8,000 people to sign up. Martin spent $18,000 on online ads, Bloomberg reports, and now has a stake in Jet that is reportedly worth millions. Although Martin told Bloomberg that he is not sure exactly what his stake is worth, Fusion reported in February 2015 that his piece could be valued between $10 million and $20 million." internet money news ← Related Links → Samsung Pay Hack Lets Attackers Make Fraudulent Payments Walmart Buys Jet For $3 Billion, Hopes To Turbo Charge Ecommerce Walmart Is Cutting 7,000 Jobs Due To Automation Linux Trojan Mines For Cryptocurrency Using Misconfigured Redis Servers This discussion has been archived.

Fair or not, the Walmart brand has a permanent stink attached to it. A history of treating employees poorly, working them just short of enough hours to qualify for health insurance and offloading that cost to taxpayers, pricing strategies that have put suppliers out of business and sent jobs overseas, selling "special model number" items that are made of lower quality materials, it goes on and on.

Walmart De Mexico y Centroamerica, also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a time frame for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico’s department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Walmart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Walmart’s strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Walmart’s international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company’s total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about $247 million. Walmart acquired Suburbia’s parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico’s top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 per cent to Walmex’s overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico’s biggest private sector employer and the country’s largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company’s shareholder’s meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Walmart’s overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Walmart’s largest number of stores outside the United States. Walmart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 per cent to about $6.93 billion.   Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Current Affairs Bracing for Brexit, UK ramps up borrowing and cuts growth forecasts Big banks' relationship with Dodd-Frank - it's complicated U.S. factory, consumer sentiment data brighten economic outlook Dow hits record; U.S. yields, dollar at multi-year highs Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower [ more ] Top Stories Zee acquires 2 TV channels of Reliance Group; 49% in FM channels business ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim [ more ] Markets Sensex rises 91 pts, closes above 26,000 ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Sesame output likely to fall 40% due to unfavourable climate [ more ] Companies Sun Pharma's sharpens emerging market focus with $60 mn acquisition in Russia Zee acquires 2 TV channels of Reliance Group; 49% in FM channels business Start-ups gear up to raise fresh funds under liberalised ECB regime Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar [ more ] Opinion Gujarat Gas results set off downgrades Expect lower growth at Eicher Reliance Industries valuation at 10-yr low Don't revive inspector raj Resolving a disagreement [ more ] Latest News Donald Trump moderates views but defies conventions Sensex rises 91 pts, closes above 26,000 Sun Pharma's sharpens emerging market focus with $60 mn acquisition in Russia Zee acquires 2 TV channels of Reliance Group; 49% in FM channels business MoD's blacklisting policy for arms vendors has few of the promised changes [ more ] Today's Paper Sun Pharma's sharpens emerging market focus with $60 mn acquisition in Russia Zee acquires 2 TV channels of Reliance Group; 49% in FM channels business Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster Zara's recipe for success: More data, fewer bosses Debit card charges dropped, farmers to get easier cash access [ more ] News you can use Demonetisation: Stricter norms for NRIs Spread equity investments over three-four months Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh: Don't panic if you receive the I-T notice Expect your household budget to shoot up: Going cashless comes at a cost Opportunities amid chaos New Balance created its PR crisis.

(Photo: Brian Cahn /Zuma Press/Newscom) The decision by the seniors group AARP to drop its membership in an influential legislative reform coalition is the latest example of the left’s successful pressure on corporations and other organizations to disown the group. “People should be concerned when any group believes solutions come from intimidation rather than discussion,” @ALEC_states says. As of December, according to the liberal website SourceWatch.org, “at least 108 corporations and 19 nonprofits” announced cutting ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council in the previous five years. Among those listed as parting ways with ALEC: Coca-Cola Co., Blue Cross Blue Shield, Johnson & Johnson, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, and Hewlett-Packard Co. “A great silencing is taking place across America,” ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling told The Daily Signal. “All people should be deeply concerned when any group believes solutions come from intimidation rather than discussion.” Of all the organizations in the conservative movement that have antagonized the left during the Obama presidency, this one stands out. The American Legislative Exchange Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan network of state lawmakers, policy analysts, and private sector leaders that advances model legislation with an eye toward free market policy solutions. The organization that became known as ALEC grew out of informal meetings of conservative activists in Chicago during autumn 1973. Forty-three years later, the exchange council includes “nearly one-quarter of the country’s state legislators and stakeholders from across the policy spectrum,” according to its website. ALEC now has a long history of successfully promoting local and state legislation built on the constitutional principles of limited government, the free market, and federalism. While the exchange council has attracted both positive attention and negative scrutiny since its founding, well-funded, well-organized opponents on the left have made a concerted effort over the past five years to marginalize, discredit, and defund it. As previously reported by The Daily Signal, eight of the Senate’s most liberal Democrats also targeted ALEC last month in a letter to national and state-based think tanks and policy organizations demanding to know the names of donors. Conservative policy analysts and think tank leaders who are familiar with the assault on ALEC have some insight. A critical turning point came after the 2010 midterm elections, they say, when left-leaning lawmakers lost ground in statehouses across the country, making it possible for ALEC’s proposals to become policy at an accelerated pace. Matthew Vadum is a senior vice president at Capital Research Center, which investigates the “aims and activities of left-liberal special interest groups.” Vadum said he suspects that because ALEC worked successfully to “frame the debate” during the Obama presidency, it aroused the ire of liberal groups such as Common Cause. Those groups now see some of their most prized policy achievements in danger of losing their grip at the local and state levels, he said. Protesters march through a residential neighborhood in Phoenix on Nov. 30, 2011, on their way to picket the American Legislative Exchange Council during ALEC’s meeting at the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa. (Photo: Jack Kurtz/ZumaPress/Newscom) Obamacare and Voter ID After President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, into law in March 2010, ALEC “sprang into action” and “drafted model legislation aimed at blocking states from enforcing the new health insurance monstrosity,” Vadum noted in a research paper. In November 2011, ALEC published its “State Lawmakers Guide to Repealing Obamacare.” At least 10 states took up ALEC’s model proposal to block the federal health care law by 2013, Vadum wrote. But what rankled the left above all else is the exchange council’s commitment to passing voter identification laws as a safeguard against voter fraud, he says. Two opponents, The Nation magazine and the Center for Media and Democracy, have led the charge against ALEC for the past five years. Founded in 1865, The Nation describes itself as providing a progressive outlook on political and cultural questions. Its print circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006; by 2010 it had dropped to 145,000. The Center for Media and Democracy is a left-leaning investigative journalism outfit based in Madison, Wisconsin, that describes itself as a watchdog on the use of public relations by corporations and political figures. The center, founded in 1993 by progressive Wisconsin writer John Stauber, publishes SourceWatch, PR Watch, and BanksterUSA. In July 2011, the magazine and the center partnered on a series of articles highlighting ALEC’s model bills and emphasizing its connections with the Koch brothers and their companies, organizations, and foundations. Charles and David Koch, wealthy entrepreneurs and philanthropists, drew the left’s ire by organizing contributions to libertarian and conservative causes and candidates. The Nation’s first article on ALEC called the Koch brothers the exchange council’s “billionaire benefactors.” The left’s opposition to laws requiring voters to produce photo identification figures prominently in the articles. One, for example, says ALEC is “peddling ‘Voter ID’ laws to disenfranchise voters.” The Center for Media and Democracy operates a website called ALEC Exposed, also dating to July 2011, that focuses on ALEC’s funding sources and policy proposals. The site criticizes corporations and nonprofits that support ALEC. Mark Holden, senior vice president and general counsel of Koch Industries Inc., shakes that off. “We support ALEC and the work it is doing on criminal justice reform legislation, protecting free speech, and promoting policies that remove barriers to opportunity for all Americans, especially the least advantaged,” Holden said in an email to The Daily Signal. ‘Seek to Silence’ The pressure tactics appear to have met with considerable success. As of December, according to the Center for Media and Democracy’s SourceWatch.org, “at least 108 corporations and 19 nonprofits—for a total of 127 private sector members—have publicly announced that they cut ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council.” Four of the 127 returned to ALEC, according to the website, but the left continues to claim new scalps such as AARP. ALEC declined to comment on membership details or the exchange council’s success rate in state legislatures, saying opponents exploit the information. Kevin Kane, president of Pelican Institute for Public Policy, a free market think tank based in New Orleans, said the anti-ALEC campaign is undermining free speech and the free exchange of ideas. “There has been an important tactical shift in the campaign against ALEC and other organizations that do not toe the line on certain policy issues,” Kane told The Daily Signal. “Many organizations on the left are no longer content to engage in a debate over the issues, instead they seek to silence opponents by convincing donors and sponsors that certain policy positions are beyond the pale and therefore unworthy of consideration.” In an email, Kane added: This creates an environment where policymakers and citizens are less likely to be exposed to a wide range of arguments over important policy questions. Organizations like Pelican Institute do not benefit from this development, but the real losers in this campaign are policymakers and their constituents, who are denied the many benefits that flow from robust and open debate over important policy questions. Pelican Institute, part of the State Policy Network, a coalition of state-based think tanks, sometimes partners with ALEC on legislative proposals.

(Photo: Javier Rojas/ZumaPress/Newscom) AARP ‘Decides Not to Renew‘ Most recently, liberal advocacy groups succeeded in pressuring AARP, the nation’s most powerful organization of older Americans, to drop its affiliation with ALEC. AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, announced Aug. 4 it would not continue membership. In a letter that same day to Jo Ann Jenkins, chief executive officer of AARP, liberal groups accused the exchange council of pushing for policy changes that harm senior citizens. “AARP’s support of ALEC is antithetical to your mission to fight for the issues that matter most to families—such as health care, employment, and income security,” the letter to Jenkins said. The letter, which called on the seniors organization to withdraw from the exchange council, was signed by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the Center for Media and Democracy; Social Security Works; and ClimateTruth.org, among other groups. “After hearing from many of you, we’ve decided not to renew our membership to ALEC,” AARP said in a post that evening on its Facebook page. Politico broke the news. The liberal organizations’ letter to AARP’s Jenkins said in part: By partnering with ALEC, you have allowed it to use the powerful AARP brand to lend credibility to legislation harmful to seniors that is introduced in statehouses across the country. ALEC has been at the forefront of protecting drug companies and their ability to charge unreasonable prices, has been a strong advocate against the Affordable Care Act and has opposed Medicaid expansion, forcing lower-income retirees to make terrible choices between paying medical bills and buying groceries. … ALEC also blocks action on climate change, causing irreparable harm to the world we will leave our children and grandchildren. ALEC has spearheaded calls for a dangerous Article V convention to enact a federal balanced budget amendment that would ultimately gut critical programs for seniors like Social Security, Medicare and the Older Americans Act. ALEC has also spent years pushing the dismantling of retirement security for older Americans by promoting the elimination of defined benefit pensions and the privatization of Social Security, at least in part, in favor of risky investment accounts. ‘Contemptible Betrayal’ “AARP should be ashamed and embarrassed at its action in withdrawing from ALEC,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. He added: This is another sign of how much the progressive left wants to silence anyone who disagrees with them on matters of public policy. Their basic betrayal of the tenets of the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment is disgraceful—and AARP’s going along with this censorship is contemptible. Meierling, vice president of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, told The Daily Signal that left-leaning activist groups are working to silence organizations such as ALEC that hold alternative views on public policy. “ALEC members represent many millions of retired Americans and work on issues such as health care, employment, and income security—key AARP issues,” Meierling said, adding: All seniors benefit when their issues are discussed openly and with as many decision makers and stakeholders as possible. It is a shame that under the banner of good government, activists groups such as the Center for Media and Democracy would pressure any organization out of the free exchange of ideas. “The left succeeded in pressuring AARP to disassociate itself from ALEC by using the same smears and pressure tactics it has long used in its jihad against ALEC,” Capital Research Center’s Vadum said in an email to The Daily Signal. “Here the left claimed ALEC hates minorities and elderly people because it backed electoral integrity laws like photo ID requirements that combat election fraud,” he said. “It’s an absurd argument but it’s been quite effective in hitting ALEC in the pocketbook.” Vadum also argues that ALEC receives relatively little support from foundations and no government grants, according to tax filings. That contrasts with the National Conference of State Legislatures, its “left-wing counterpart,” he said, which “relies heavily on taxpayer funding.” Ken McIntyre contributed to this report.  It has been modified to correct the period during which SourceWatch counted organizations that left ALEC.

Walmex, a publicly traded unit of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant, announced last week that July sales rose 12.1 percent from a year ago at stores open at least a year, almost double the 6.8 percent rise in the previous month. “We are totally focused on our main business and our target is to double our total sales by 2024,” Walmex Chief Executive Officer Guilherme Loureiro said in the statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange. This is the second purchase this year by Mexico City-based Liverpool, a high-end department store chain that’s seeking to diversify. The company agreed last month to buy a stake in Chile’s Ripley Corp SA, sending its stock plunging, as disappointed investors were hoping the company would expand domestically. The deal was announced after trading closed Wednesday. Walmex shares are little changed this year, while Liverpool has dropped 9.7 percent. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

That would mark a major turning point for an ecommerce firm that’s only been around for two years. Interestingly, it only opened its doors to customers in the US last July, and did so with a $49 membership fee. If the deal goes through, it’ll be the largest ecommerce acquisition in the country, ousting QVC’s $2.4 billion purchase of Zulily last year from the top spot. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Jet.com launched in the US a little over a year ago with scores of products on offer, ranging from TVs to apparel to household essentials. Last October – just three months after it opened for business – it dropped its $49 membership fee in a bid to woo more customers. And in May, it began trialing grocery delivery services across the country. According to Recode’s sources, Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore will continue to oversee the site’s operations and also take over the reins of Walmart’s online store. It’ll be interesting to see if this helps Walmart take the fight to Amazon in the ecommerce space; it currently makes only $14 billion a year through online sales, which is a pittance compared to Amazon’s annual revenue of $99 billion.

REUTERS/Tomas Bravo By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) Mexican unit said on Wednesday it has agreed to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool (LIVEPOLC1.MX) for about $852 million as the world's largest retailer streamlines operations in its largest non-U.S. market. Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica (WALMEX.MX), also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB (ALSEA.MX) for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa (GFINBURO.MX) for about $247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about $6.93 billion.

Somewhere Donald Trump is jotting down "Note to Self, WALL CANNOT BE MADE OF GLASS!!!" Get The Lid straight to your inbox each afternoon -- click here to sign up. '16 from 30,000 Nauseating. Painful. Screwed. Those were the words "Walmart moms" used to describe the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in two focus groups observed by NBC News. The overall feeling of 20 middle-class mothers who participated in the Phoenix, Arizona, and Columbus, Ohio, panels could be described as...well...depression over the state of the presidential race. Multiple women called it a choice between the "lesser of two evils." One equated the choice to "choosing which arm to cut off." The descriptions of both candidates, which ranged from harsh to downright brutal, mirror polling that shows the two hold historically low favorability ratings. "Walmart moms" have supported the winning candidate or party in every election since 2008, except in 2014 when the broke for Democrats in the midterms. And though only seven of the 20 said they were leaning towards supporting Clinton (with eight either undecided or looking at third party candidates), nearly all of them said they think Clinton will win. But the overall disdain shown by these women towards this year's election has us wondering if they are going to show up to the polls at all come November. As a participant in Phoenix said, "I morally, in good conscience, could not vote for either one of them." POPPING ON NBC POLITICS Alex Seitz-Wald reports on the conspiracy theories fueled by WikiLeaks regarding a DNC staffer's death. You can read more from one of us(!) about the Wal-Mart moms focus group here. If you live in - say - Florida, it ain't going to be fun to watch TV for the next few months unless you really like political ads. Here's why. There are still a lot of registered Republicans who still doubt Barack Obama's citizenship. "An aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a colleague that their boss lied at a 2013 press conference during which he told reporters that top staffers knew nothing of a scheme to punish a political opponent with lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, court documents released Wednesday alleged," Jon Schuppe writes. How likeable is Melania Trump? FOR THE RECORD… "He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old, I see the similarities," Deanna, a mother of four in Phoenix who participated in a "Wal-Mart Moms" focus group Tuesday night.

Kroger has a new plan that should terrify Walmart and Target Hayley Peterson Aug. 10, 2016, 7:00 PM 4,115,822 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Kroger is going after Target and Walmart by expanding a new type of store featuring home goods, clothing, and kitchen appliances. The store, called Kroger Marketplace, features nearly everything you would find in a Target or Walmart store, but with a greater focus on groceries, alcohol, and prepared foods. The company says Marketplace is one of its "primary growth formats of the future" — in other words, it's expanding rapidly. Kroger has nearly 3,000 stores, more than 120 of which are Marketplace stores. We went to three Marketplace stores in the Richmond, Virginia, area to check them out. Here's what we found.

FOXSPORTS You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing Join us on our voyage navigating the choppy seas of sailing at the Summer Games By Chris Chase Aug 10, 2016 at 3:45p ET 0 Shares Because the Olympics is the world's greatest viewing buffet, I went back for seconds this morning and sampled some sailing, a sport that doesn't get much coverage on television for reasons that become immediately obvious. To say sailing is confusing is like saying Michael Phelps is comfortable in the water. And it doesn't help that the international feed features no commentators, presumably because everybody who knows how to describe the Mixed Narca 17 (multihull) race I watched today was presumably sailing in it. Thus, I was left to my own devices to try and figure out the most baffling sport in the Summer Games. Join me on my odyssey. 1. This is the start and it seems to have all the order of Black Friday at Walmart or swimming-pool management in Rio. I count at least five different direction those boats are traveling toward. This has all the order of Walmart on Black Friday or check-in at the Rio airport. 2. It looks like the radar for a hurricane. 3. What does the graphic mean? What are the black lines? Why does it look like one of those optical illusions that asks you how many triangles are in the picture? Why is Denmark going all rogue, which seems very anti-Denmark if you'll allow me to stereotype? 4. Okay, I'll buy that Brazil is in first. In this camera shot they're clearing leading what we're to assume is the trio of boats in front of the regatta. (I don't know if this is a proper usage of regatta but as we're flying by the cuts of our jib here I'm going with it.) But wait a second. Brazil first. Got it. Switzerland fourth? In what possible way does this camera shot indicate that Switzerland is fourth? WHERE ARE THE OTHER TWO BOATS? 5. Okay, now this I get. Brazil, Switzerland and Argentina racing on the open water. However, given the confusion, it's entirely possible Brazil was in first, Switzerland was in ninth and the Argentine boat was simply ferrying Juan Martin Del Potro to the tennis venue. 6. What is Italy doing? Here we have Denmark and Brazil again with Italy going away from the buoy and charging at the other two boats like this was rugby sevens, fiberglass division. 7. Speaking of event names, these are the actual names of the sailing competitions in Rio: Laser (dinghy), 470 (dinghy), Laser radial (dinghy), Mixed nacra 17 (multihull), Finn (dinghy), RS:X (windsurfer), 49er (skiff), 49er XF (skiff). Also, we have no idea what 2nd Mark is. It sounds like a Bible chapter. 8. Ahh, digging through the cooler from some cervezas. This is the kind of sport I can ... get on board with. 9. Guys - GUYS - I think that helicopter is about to make a move. 10. Toldja. 11. I imagine this is what Larry Ellison does when he's bored: Sailboat demolition derby. 12. Finally. This one's pretty self-explanatory. The boats, coming in at different angles (because the sea was angry today, like an old man trying to return soup in a deil), are headed toward the finish. But wait. Where are you going?  13. Then, before my stream froze, the United States comes in, finishing 2:07 behind the winner? The U.S. was in 13th place? Shouldn't we be good at sailing? It's called the America's Cup for dinghy's sake! The Kennedy family alone produce enough sailors to win a bronze!   0 Shares View Comments Hide Comments You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing UP NEXT : You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing UP NEXT : FOXSports.com > Contact Us | Press | Jobs | RSS | Site Map | Shop Follow FOX Sports > Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube | Tumblr Other FOX Sites > FS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century Fox | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes Statistical Information provided by: STATS ©2016 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

Firefighters were called upon to douse the flames in a field behind the store. The power line problem caused an electrical outage inside, which prompted store officials to evacuate employees and customers at around 3:10 p.m. 7 News saw between 30 and 40 people in the parking lot after the evacuation. Fire officials say grass fires are generally easy to handle, but departments across the north country have been working together in the dry weather. "They're relatively easy to control and contain," Town of Watertown Assistant Fire Chief John Falge said. "You need resources and manpower and everybody's been rallying across the county and actually into other counties to help one another out during this drought period." Officials say if the weather was not so dry, the utility line would not have caused the fire. Everyone was allowed back inside at around 3:35 p.m. Next Article Man Accused Of Strangling & Hitting Woman Most Popular Feedback: Lewis County Deals With Suspected Heroin Death, Overdoses Watch the video Redfield Digs Out From Nearly 55 Inches Of Snow Watch the video 2 Ogdensburg Men Sentenced In Vicious Beating One Time When Your Taxes Pay YOU Watch the video Judge Rules Homicide Suspect Competent To Stand Trial Wednesday, November 23, 2016 , Watertown, NY On Demand Videos RSS Mobile Twitter Facebook Pinterest CBS Video Player Fox This content requires the latest Adobe Flash Player and a browser with JavaScript enabled.

Politics As voters talk, the collapse of Trump's support becomes clearly audible Trump supporters Evan Vucci / Associated Press Donald Trump supporters wait for his arrival at a rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, N.C. Donald Trump supporters wait for his arrival at a rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, N.C. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) David Lauter Many gauges measure the rapid drop in Donald Trump’s support this summer: Polls show the Republican nominee losing nationally and in most battleground states, prominent Republicans have publicly defected, and GOP elected officials rarely rush to his defense. Twenty women, mostly swing voters, sitting at conference tables in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix on Tuesday night, provide another. “He’s crazy,” says one. "He kind of acts like a 2-year-old," says another. "I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities." Asked to imagine a President Trump, the women in Phoenix call out in a cascade: "doomed," "scary," "hang on" and "are you joking?"

Hillary Clinton: Donald... (Michael Finnegan) The women, participants in focus groups convened by pollsters Neil Newhouse, a Republican, and Margie Omero, a Democrat, talked about the major party candidates as reporters watched from an office in Washington. Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Sign up for the newsletter  The sessions were part of a project sponsored by Wal-Mart that for eight years has examined the attitudes of what the company calls Wal-Mart moms, women who shop at one of the giant retailer’s stores. It’s a group that includes about one in seven American voters and is replete with the swing voters and soft partisans who candidates normally seek to persuade or mobilize precisely because they can decide elections. These were not voters who had much praise for Hillary Clinton, noted Newhouse. Even Democrats in the two groups used words like “deceptive” “lies” and “dishonest” when they were asked to describe the Democratic nominee, although others referred positively to her toughness and experience. To many of these women, Clinton appeared distant, emotionless and closed off. Few had a clear view of what she stands for, Omero noted. He kind of acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities. — Focus group participant Trump’s image appeared far more clearly etched in their minds, Newhouse said. Unfortunately for the GOP and its nominee, that image has become fixed in two tracks: foolish or frightening. To some, Trump appeared as a buffoonish character. To others, he seemed dangerous — a hothead, authoritarian and inexperienced. Those perceptions of the candidates’ character weigh heavily for these voters. Few on either side indicated that specific policies or issues were driving their choices.  Several, however, mentioned race and concerns about racism as a lens through which they were watching the campaign. Asked to name an Olympic sport at which each candidate might excel, Anita M., a 43-year-old married Republican in Phoenix, responded with fencing for Clinton. “She’d stab you in the back,” she explained, eliciting nods from around the table. Don’t count her as a Trump voter, however. “He’s a racist, really,” Anita said, noting later that she probably won’t vote at all. Asked to name an Olympic sport for Trump, several of the women in Phoenix cited diving, ski jumping or similar activities that involve, as one said, a “leap of faith” and an uncertain landing. The focus group reactions add texture to one of the key findings of recent opinion polls, which have shown Trump losing ground among Republican women.

Caption Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Several women in the Phoenix group said men in their lives were backing Trump: One cited her husband, another mentioned her father.  Africa C., a 40-year-old Latina business operations manager, said her son leaned toward Trump because he envisions himself a budding entrepreneur.  The women expressed far less enthusiasm, however. Several Republicans mentioned potential third-party candidates — an option none of the Democrats expressed interest in.  Stephanie C., a 38-year old, white, married Republican, was the most hostile to Clinton of the 10 women in Phoenix. She repeated conspiratorial allegations about mysterious deaths of people close to the former first lady that are staples of right-wing talk radio. Yet even she hesitated about voting for her party’s nominee. “Trump would get us right into World War III,” she said.  In Ohio, Ivania L., a radiation-safety officer who listed her age as between 35 and 44, said choosing Trump would be “like sending a painter to do a doctor’s job.” She listed herself as undecided, but seemed more accurately described as resigned to what she considered a poor choice. “I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now,” she said, but, in the end, Clinton’s  “experience wins me more.” I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now. — Ivania L., focus group member That quality and strength ranked high on the minds of most of the Clinton backers. Clinton won’t take ownership of her mistakes, complained Linda C., a 56-year-old African American business owner in Phoenix. The Democratic nominee tries to sweep scandals under the rug, she said. “There's so much stuffed under there they can’t even lay the carpet down flat now," she said. And yet Clinton had the knowledge to do the job, she added, while Trump was both inexperienced and “disrespectful.” Lukisha H., a married African American teacher sitting across from Linda, expressed similar concern about what she called Clinton’s unwillingness to clearly acknowledge her errors. But she praised the former secretary of State on other grounds. “I think it’s a tough job, and you have to be tough at it,” she said. In Ohio, Mary H., a retired cable television service rep, referred to Clinton as “cold-hearted” and added an expletive. And yet, she said, she too would probably vote for her because of her experience.

Hillary Clinton: Donald... (David Lauter) On all sides, the women were virtually unanimous in calling the campaign stressful to watch, disconcerting and offering a set of bad choices. The decision “is like choosing which arm to cut off," said a participant in the Phoenix group. In the end, though, they had little doubt about how the contest would turn out or why. “I think Donald is going to say something that is going to scare everybody. And they’re just going to go with, ‘Whoa, we better go with Clinton ‘cause he’s off the chain,’” said Gidget B., a white, married customer service representative in Columbus. Asked to predict who will win the election, 18 of the 20 participants made the same call: Hillary Clinton.  David.Lauter@latimes.com For more on Politics and Policy, follow me @DavidLauter ALSO Trump's call for ‘2nd Amendment people’ to stop Clinton isn't helping his dropping poll numbers What do you think of Hillary Clinton?

The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) handled the following incidents in Arlington during June, plus three incidents in the first few days of July. Editor’s note: All suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and values are estimated for stolen/damaged items. These are brief summaries of detailed SCSO reports. June 1 Zellner Street (theft from motor vehicle) An overnight burglary netted someone about $330 of property from a vehicle parked on the 5900 block of Zellner Street. The owner said he parked his Ford Fusion on the street in front of his home around 5 p.m. May 31 and returned around 3:45 a.m. June 1. He drove to a medical office on Spicer Cove and noticed some items were missing from his center console when he got back to his car around 5 a.m. He believes the theft happened overnight. Stolen items included audio/visual recordings and CDs ($300) and prescription drugs ($30). Officers saw no signs of forced entry on the car, and he said he might have forgotten to lock the doors. Longleaf Oak Trail (theft from motor vehicle) A woman on the 12300 block of Longleaf Oak Trail reported June 1 that someone stole valuable from her unlocked SUV almost a week earlier. She got in her 2008 Chevy Tahoe around 10 a.m. May 27 and realized these items were missing: Black Oakley sunglasses in a white case, black Coach purse and white gold diamond ring. She said a nearby neighbor has a security system and can provide photos of suspects in the area around 2:10 a.m. May 26. June 2 Village Center Street (theft of vehicle parts/accessories) The owner of a Dodge Ram 1500 pickup said June 2 that someone stole his trailer hitch while the truck was parked in his driveway. He noticed the theft around 7:15 p.m. that night and said it must have happened between noon June 1 and nearly 9 p.m. June 2. He lives on the 11700 block of Village Center Street. He didn’t have any suspect information or a serial number for the trailer hitch. June 3 Brooks River Drive (simple assault/domestic violence) Click to enlarge. A punishment turned into a fight that landed a daughter in juvie court, a family reported on June 3. A mom restricted her adopted daughter to the house after the child returned from a recent runaway episode. She said the daughter became irate and combative. They were upstairs in the daughter’s bedroom when she began striking the mother’s arms and kicking her legs. They went downstairs to the mother’s bedroom, where she kept up the assault. The responding officers couldn’t see any marks on the victim, who refused medical treatment. The child’s adoptive father said their daughter is upset about living under rules. Officers transported her to juvenile court. The incident happened between 11:45 p.m. June 2 and about 12:15 a.m. June 3. Quintard Street (other larceny/access device) When a store declined his debit card on June 2 was when one Arlington man learned he was the victim of fraud. First Tennessee told him that someone had spent $254.94 on his account at Walmart in Knoxville. He also learned that someone tried to use the number a second time for the same amount at that Walmart and for $7.23 at the Four Queens Hotel in Goodley, Texas. The bank refused those charge attempts. The victim, a resident on the 6000 block of Quintard Street, said he wants to prosecute. June 4 Goat Valley Cove (misdemeanor vandalism) A young witness solved the mystery about what shattered a woman’s bathroom window ($300) in early June. The woman spotted a small hole in the broken window the morning of June 4 and asked a neighborhood boy if he’d seen anything suspicious. He told her he saw a group of eight boys shooting cans on the left side of her home a couple of days earlier, and a light-skinned boy with a big BB gun shot the window. He didn’t know the suspect’s name. The victim, a resident on the 11000 block of Goat Valley Cove, said she has video surveillance around the home. She estimated the damages at $300. June 6 Gulf Stream Road (simple assault) An employee at Maines Paper & Food Service (11420 Gulf Stream Road) said a co-worker assaulted him on June 6. The victim said he was working alone in the freezer section when the suspect walked up and punched him several times on the face. Then the victim grabbed his attacker and they fell to the ground. He said the suspect kept hitting him and might also have used an object to hit the top of his head. The victim said he also landed on his right elbow, abrading it and making it swell. The victim got on top of the suspect, held him and kept asking, “You finished?” Eventually the suspect quit struggling and said, “I’m good, I’m good.” The pummeled man said he wasn’t sure why the co-worker attacked him but it might be related to an incident right before the attack: The suspect was arguing with a different man when the victim walked nearby to pick up some work supplies. That drew the suspect’s suspicion, who reportedly asked the other man in the argument if he “sent this little b____ over here to back you up.” The victim objected, saying he was trying to work and wasn’t in the argument, and he told the suspect to keep his name out of his mouth. The victim said he walked back to the freezer area and continued working through his scheduled break until the assault. Afterward, the victim walked out of the freezer and was seeing black-and-white spots, but he doesn’t think he lost consciousness. The suspect left the scene. The victim notified his supervisor and then drove himself to Saint Francis Hospital in Bartlett for treatment of the swollen elbow, abrasions to his face and small cut to the top of his head. There were no witnesses but the company might have video footage of the fight. Logan Circle (intimidation) One woman said another swore at her, threatened bodily harm and brandished an electroshock weapon on June 6. The victim was visiting a friend on the 5700 block of Logan Circle when the suspect pulled up in a gold Mercedes, cursed and threatened her, turned around in the cove, and pulled over again. Next, the suspect got out of the car, entered the friend’s front yard and continued the verbal assault, the victim reported. The suspect also pulled out an electroshock weapon (such as the Taser brand) and continued to threaten bodily harm before eventually getting back in her car and driving off, the victim said. A male witness was sitting in his truck nearby during the altercation but said he didn’t see a weapon. Deputies followed up with the suspect, who said the victim started it by yelling insults at her. She admitted to having words with the victim but denied making threats. The deputies told both the suspect and victim to stay away from each other and for the suspect to stay away from the homeowner’s property. Click to enlarge. June 7 Leewood Drive (other theft/non-specific) An unattended lawn mower was too tempting for a thief on the 11600 block of Leewood Drive. The owner said he cut the front yard on June 7 and left the mower in the driveway to go to the back yard briefly. He returned about five minutes later, and the mower was gone. He had no suspect information or witnesses, and there are no known security cameras in the area. He also didn’t have a serial number for the mower, so it wasn’t added to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. He estimated the value of the red Craftsman push mower at $300. June 13 Milton Wilson Drive (misdemeanor vandalism) A man on the 5500 block of Milton Wilson Drive reported June 13 that someone damaged his mailbox. He bent it back into shape and reattached it to its post before the officer arrived. June 15 Doctor Logan Road (simple assault/domestic violence) One woman elevated sisterly tensions into a chemical fight on June 15. The victim was at a home on the 11800 block of Doctor Logan Road when her sister brought their elderly mother home. After getting the mother into the house, the suspect grabbed a can of Raid insecticide, sprayed the victim’s eyes and fled the scene, the injured sister reported. The victim said her sister currently has an order of protection against her. Personnel at the SCSO fire department treated the victim at the substation. The responding deputy documented injuries where the woman was sprayed in the face. June 17 U.S. 70 (counterfeiting/forgery) An employee at an unspecified Arlington store (10996 U.S. 70) said on June 17 that one customer tried to pass two fake $100 bills. The second bill initially passed the test of a counterfeit money detection pen, but then the employee realized the bill was fake and returned it. When the employee checked the man’s other $100 bill he had spent previously, the employee realized it was counterfeit too. June 20 Greenlee Street/U.S. 70 (theft from motor vehicle) A woman learned how opportunistic thieves are on June 19 when she left her purse unattended. She got gasoline around 7:30 that night from a store at U.S. 70 and Greenlee Street. She left her purse on the passenger seat of her unlocked car when she went inside to pay. When she returned, she saw a black man getting into an older model car with large rims and speeding off. She didn’t realize her purse was missing until she entered her car. She didn’t know what to do at the time, so she went home and reported the crime the next morning after talking to her mother. Click to enlarge. June 22 Jackson Street (intimidation/domestic violence) A woman reported June 22 that her former boyfriend has been threatening her for several days. He showed up at her home on the 6000 block of Jackson Street around 2 a.m. June 21. He called and said if she didn’t come outside that he would hit her sister in the head with a bat, she reported. (The sister was not outside at the time.) The victim was afraid and met him outside, staying with him until 9 a.m. She said he popped up again later: Around 5 p.m., she was leaving a meeting with her probation officer when her ex met her and said, “I will beat you with a bat if you do not come to my house.” She followed him home because she was afraid, she said. She stayed for about three hours. Although he didn’t assault her, she said these incidents placed her in fear for her personal safety. Evening Ridge Drive (misdemeanor vandalism) A landlord suspects an evicted tenant of breaking the window of his property on the 11600 block of Evening Ridge Drive. He evicted her on June 21 and found the home’s rear window broken around 3 p.m. the next day. He didn’t observe that anything was missing from the house. Brooks River Drive (simple assault/domestic violence) An irate wife punched her husband on suspicions of cheating, he reported on June 22. They were at their home on the 12100 block of Brooks River Drive when a co-worker texted him around 7 a.m. He said his wife started an argument, got very upset and punched him on the ear while he was holding their four-year-old daughter. He believes the child may have been struck too. He said there were no injuries and refused medical attention. June 24 Dusty Field Road (felony vandalism) Someone damaged a man’s truck while trying unsuccessfully to break into it, he reported on June 24. He said he bought the green Ford F150 for his son on June 17 and had been parking it on the street in front of his home. On June 24, he noticed damage to the driver’s and passenger’s doors ($500). He suspects that someone tried to pry open the window on the driver’s door and then tried prying the passenger door. He lives on the 12300 block of Dusty Field Road. June 26 Logan Circle (theft from building) A woman suspects a guest of stealing her cell phone during a gathering at her home on the 5700 block of Logan Circle. She hosted about 20 friends and family members the night of June 25 and last saw her Samsung Note 5 cell phone ($500) at 11 p.m. Around 4 a.m. the next morning she realized her phone was missing. She suspects a cousin with a history of thefts. She couldn’t immediately provide a serial number at the time of the report. She advised that she has an app on her phone that can reveal the general area where the stolen phone is. June 30 U.S. 70 (felony vandalism) A man reported June 30 that he found his vehicle damaged when he returned from a grocery store trip earlier in the month. The victim said he went to Kroger (11635 U.S. 70) June 10. Back at home, he noticed gray paint on the driver’s side fender of his Chevrolet Silverado. He was able to remove it but found more damage. There was a gray mark on the driver’s door near the handle and another gray indentation at a lower angle on the left passenger door. He walked around the truck and also found a dent on the passenger side bumper. He said there was no one nearby or parked near his truck at the time. July 1 U.S. 70 (other theft/non-specific) A woman made the mistake of leaving her wallet on top of her vehicle when leaving the Kroger parking lot (11635 U.S. 70) on July 1. She returned but couldn’t find it. The wallet contained her credit cards, $600 in cash and a Galaxy S3 cell phone. The incident happened between 12:15 p.m. and about 2 p.m. Walker Street (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game) A father reported July 1 that a caller swindled his daughter out of money around noon that day. He said the caller identified himself as David Smith and told her she was eligible for a $9,000 Pell Grant. All she had to do was get an iTunes gift card from Kroger at 11635 U.S. 70 and send him the card’s information, and then she could get the grant check from Kroger. She followed his instructions and sent him the information online. But Kroger does not give out Pell Grant checks. July 3 Knob Creek Trail (misdemeanor vandalism) A woman found her car damaged in her driveway around 2 p.m. July 3. The victim, who lives on the 4900 block of Knob Creek Trail, said the front driver’s side door of her Chevrolet Cruze was damaged. She had no suspect information.

Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town's shops, according to local news reports. "I was completely astounded," Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. "It's like, are you kidding me? It's just not something you run across. I'm sure it can happen. "Anywhere at any time somewhere where there's the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new." Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a "preventive patrol," according to CBS affiliate WIVB. "Routine patrol, that's what we do every day," Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: "We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good." Crews in HAZMAT suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine." But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. "We'll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that's not accessible anymore," Chamberlin told the station. "We were shocked when we found out about this," Erica Jones, a Walmart spokesperson, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. "It's upsetting and unacceptable. We're glad the police have responded and we'll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police." Investigators plan to see whether Walmart's surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York state Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York state, has released warnings about such "clandestine laboratories." It states: "A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present." Erie County District Attorney's Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are "highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties" and that the chemicals used in them are "extremely toxic." "A Meth lab can be located anywhere," it states. "The house next door, hotels, motels, RV's, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests." According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. "It's a concern; I mean it's unbelievable in this area, this isn't a bad area," Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: "This isn't the kind of thing you'd expect in a place like this, that's the bottom line." Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers travelled some 800 feet from the culvert's opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. "They did have a working surface. They just weren't playing in the water, basically," Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: "They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it's dark." Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. "It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous," Lucey told the Buffalo News. "Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation." "Certainly, they weren't thinking," he added.

(Tribune file photo) Wine for sale at a state liquor store. State’s first new store since 2010 will be in Wal-Mart lot. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Utah may not allow wine and spirits to be sold inside grocery stores, but West Valley City's new wine and liquor store will be conveniently located in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 5675 W. 6200 South. The Division of Facilities Construction and Management (DCFM) recently bought property on the commercial site and is accepting bids to build the 13,500-square-foot building, which will include retail space, storage, a shipping area and offices. Officials hope to break ground in September and have construction completed within eight months, said division spokeswoman Marilee Richins. The project is expected to cost $2.3 million. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Once completed, the store will be the state's 45th liquor store and the first one built since 2010. Before any new stores are built, the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control must win approval from the state building board and secure funding from the Legislature. The DABC also must get approval from the cities affected. West Valley City is Utah's second most-populous municipality, with more than 136,000 residents, but has only one liquor store, in the northeast part of the city at 3381 S. Redwood Road. The new wine and liquor store will be in the southwest part of the city, where population growth has exploded in recent years, said Mark Nord, director of West Valley City's Redevelopment Agency. "With all the growth and development going on in west Salt Lake County, we were due for another store." The new store will be in a commercial area and shouldn't create any proximity issues for schools, churches or neighborhoods, he added. Resident James Bunnell said he didn't think the location was the most convenient for residents. "I don't understand why they're putting the new store so far south, and a mere three miles from the Kearns-Taylorsville store," he said. "It would have been much more convenient to have a store on 3500 or 4100 South." It's taken nearly two years to get the West Valley City project rolling. In 2014, lawmakers earmarked $4.4 million to buy the land and build the store. Earlier this year, another $557,000 was set aside to hire staff for it. Even when the project is completed, it won't make a dent in Utah's liquor store needs. According to a study conducted by the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah, the state needs 12 more liquor stores along the Wasatch Front — including six on the west side of Salt Lake County — to keep up with liquor sales and a growing population. While the DABC and lawmakers have said they would like to add one new liquor store a year, state officials have had trouble finding cities willing to host new outlets. Officials in Syracuse have said they are willing to have a liquor store, and the DABC and DCFM are looking for land in that north Davis County community. kathys@sltrib.com   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 2 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | Utah lawmaker accuses charter school of skirting procurement law President Obama honors Robert Redford with America's top civilian award Historic Bear Lake ranch to be spared from development Kirby: Plenty to be thankful for when pie goes awry After unusual election, lawmakers draft pile of bills seeking to make changes ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Home White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Calendar About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here Channels Featured Products White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Channels Customer Experience Digital Experience DAM Digital Workplace SharePoint & Office 365 Web CMS Mobile Document Mgt How Customer Experience Drives Business Strategy By Dave Angelow | Aug 10, 2016 CHANNEL: Customer Experience Planning season is upon us, when businesses start outlining the projects, staffing and budgets for the next fiscal year's projects. While every company's goals are unique, the one goal they have in common is the desire to improve on the prior year's performance. The challenge lies in identifying and prioritizing the changes needed to deliver improved results. Future business goals act as the foundation of the rubric used to select and prioritize project investments. The greatest improvement in business capabilities come when executive management not only support the initiative, but also provide necessary staffing and funding.  And survey after survey of CEO priorities shows goals like “be customer-centric” or “improve customer experience” consistently rank the highest.   Align Customer Experience with Business Strategy Identifying improved customer outcomes as a key goal for an organization establishes a clear link between business strategy and customer experience (CX). So how can CX impact business strategy? Differentiation, focus and cost leadership are the three core business strategies. Every organization develops their own unique blend to appeal to selected segments of the overall market. For example, Walmart and Nordstrom are both in the retail industry yet have very different business strategies: Walmart is of course known for low-cost while Nordstrom focuses on differentiation. Prioritizing and ensuring CX projects are included in future business plans requires alignment.  Regardless of your company’s strategy, CX projects will be part of your organization's future, provided the projects align with stated business goals. Projects that align with business goals will always be prioritized over initiatives that don’t align with executive management’s future vision.  With each industry and company being unique, there are no magic answers, silver bullets or cookbook recommendations to produce results. You'll need brainstorming, creativity and design-thinking to architect a well-aligned solution.   Business Strategy, Through a CX Lens The most effective CX solutions align with the desired image of the company, are consistently delivered, and frictionless for the customer. Depending on what business strategy your organization competes on, looking at that strategy through a CX lens can help shape your future plans. Here are a few ideas to get you in the CX mindset:  Differentiation Conduct a Competitor Analysis (a la Porter's 5 Forces) to understand the buying journey customers face with competitors and define opportunities to deliver a better experience Evaluate the post-sale customer experience — the customer experience does not end with the sale and may be an area unaddressed by others Cost Leadership Develop a costed journey-map for the entire customer lifecycle.  Rank the activity costs for customer acquisition and customer retention, and identify cost reduction opportunities Adopt a Lean CX approach to improve customer experience by utilizing tools like business model canvas and lean canvas to improve customer experience. Develop experiments and conduct A/B testing to understand customer behaviors and optimize outputs (tools like Inspectlet can help visualize interactions)  Focus Optimize Personas: Know your most profitable customers and those that drive the most revenue, identify and develop experiences that align to unique elements of these personas Because every business has a customer to serve, no strategy can exist without considering the impact to the customer. The challenge lies in creating a positive customer impact that your company can consistently deliver and that your customers perceive as valuable. The time is now. Are you up to the challenge of defining a CX initiative that will both improve your customer’s experience and set you apart from your competitors? If you succeed, you'll have a winning strategy for years in the future.

Jae C. Hong/AP hide caption toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Pollsters identify "Wal-Mart moms" as a swing voting bloc. Jae C. Hong/AP NPR was invited to observe two focus groups of swing voters from Ohio and Arizona on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. "Wal-Mart Moms" are identified by pollsters as women predominantly between the ages of 18 and 44, who have kids under 18 living at home and who shop at Wal-Mart stores at least once a month. In these groups, the women were identified only by their first names. The research was funded by Wal-Mart Corp. (The Walton Family Foundation, which Wal-Mart's creators established, meanwhile, supports NPR's education coverage.) The sessions are anecdotal and unscientific. Here are some key takeaways: 1. Social media is a powerful — and divisive — force Frustration and exhaustion from social media, particularly Facebook, was a common theme. Social media has given them a constant stream of information about the election, but almost everyone says their interactions online are negative and exhausting. "I don't talk about [politics] as much as I have in the past because it's stressful," says Stephanie, a married mom of two kids from Phoenix. Stephanie quit Facebook for a week just to get a break from the news. Article continues after sponsorship Amy, a married mom of two kids who is also from Phoenix, said her family is sharply divided on political lines. She and her husband are leaning Trump, and she admits sometimes they post stories supporting Trump online "just to get people riled up." Nearly everyone said the election has strained ties with family and friends. In the Columbus group, Mary says she recently attended her 40th high school reunion and was dismayed by how much politics dominated the conversation. "That's not what I went there to do. I went there to have a good time," she says. That said, nearly all of the women identified Facebook and Twitter as a leading source of election information, even if it's a downer. 2. There's a lot of interest in "other" options on the ballot Another striking theme was how eager and interested the moms were in finding out more about third-party candidates, particularly the Libertarian Gary Johnson/Bill Weld ticket. In the Columbus group, five of the 10 moms said they were open to learning more about third-party candidates. "I need to know who the other parties are. I don't know who Gary Johnson is, but I'm willing to get to know who he is," said Dana, an African-American mother of two from Columbus. In Phoenix, two of the 10 said they were leaning toward voting for a third-party candidate. Some expressed a concern that a third-party vote was a "wasted vote," but on the whole, there was a welcome attitude about third-party candidates this cycle. There was also no voiced opposition to having Johnson participate in the presidential debates. 3. The conventions didn't matter; the debates will Very little information about either the Republican convention in Cleveland or the Democratic convention in Philadelphia broke through to the moms. Most said they watched some speeches and saw "snippets" on social media, but there were almost no lasting impressions voiced from either group. However, nearly all of the moms said the upcoming presidential debates will play a major role in helping them finalize their vote. "She has more facts and experience and knowledge about the inner workings of government, and that is where it's going to show exactly how little he knows," said Julie, a white, married mother of two from Columbus. There was a consensus that Clinton will "win" the debates but that Trump "will be talked about the most." 4. The first female presidential candidate is NBD Clinton made history this year to become the first woman nominated by a major party to run for president. But the moms overwhelmingly said that wouldn't affect how they vote. Nearly all agreed that the historic candidacy of Barack Obama, the first black man nominated, felt much bigger and more urgent. "It was more exciting, it was more history-making. He had so much he envisioned. He had real issues he was fighting for," said Dana from Columbus. Ivania, a Hispanic mother of two from Columbus, said she is disappointed voters don't seem to care much about Clinton's milestone. "It was almost kind of skipped over, and it was sad," she said. 5. Trump is not a Republican — and that's OK Trump won the Republican primary "fair and square," in one mom's words, but that does not mean any of them view him as a Republican. "The Republican Party is not behind him," said Amy from Phoenix, who is leaning Trump. "It doesn't matter to me," she adds. "I don't like the two-party system." In fact, the Trump brand and the GOP brand are very distinct in their minds. "He's himself. He's just Donald Trump," says one. Maria, a Hispanic mother of two from Columbus, said she was more frustrated that the party wasn't doing more to support Trump. "I think they are trying to sabotage him. I wish there was more unity." Trump's disassociation with the GOP brand could also be a benefit for down-ballot Republicans. Incumbent Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and John McCain of Arizona both got higher marks than Trump, and many moms said they'd be willing to split their tickets to support them. 6. Clinton is fundamentally untrustworthy Without a doubt the biggest criticism of Clinton is that these women — even those inclined to support her — think she can't be trusted. It was a theme revisited over and over again throughout the evening. "You don't know what's the truth and what's the lie," says Donna, a married mother of one child from Columbus. Asked what their biggest hesitation was about Clinton, "trustworthiness" came up repeatedly. "The whole email thing. I mean, c'mon," says Amy of Phoenix. The women were all aware of Clinton's controversy over hosting her emails on a private server while she served as secretary of state. None of them believed she told the truth, or handled the fallout well. 7. That said, no one thinks Trump can win Of the 20 women, five were leaning Trump, seven were leaning Clinton, and eight were undecided or leaning third party. But asked who they thought would win, regardless of their leaning, the answer was unanimous: Clinton. But none of the women were that excited about it. Most of them described it as a "lesser of two evils" vote or an "anti-Trump" vote more than a "pro-Hillary" vote. 8. It doesn't matter anyway Maybe the most depressing takeaway is how poorly the women view the country's ability to govern itself. Many believe it doesn't really matter who wins because the gridlock in Washington is unlikely to change. There was almost a resignation to the fact that government just doesn't work well anymore, and that politicians are all deeply disconnected from the challenges of their everyday lives. The women largely rejected Trump's assertion that the system is "rigged," but they largely agreed that their interests were poorly represented in government. "I think the system is corrupt. I wouldn't say rigged," says Stephanie of Phoenix. "I think it's broken," added Joanna, a young mother of four children from the Phoenix group. "I don't think the power is with the voters anymore." GOP pollster Neil Newhouse and Democratic pollster Margie Omero sat in on the sessions with the 20 voters who took part in the panels via video conference from Phoenix and Columbus. They have been conducting research on Wal-Mart moms since 2008. They estimate these moms make up about 14 percent and 17 percent of the electorate, and they are fairly evenly split between Republican and Democratic affiliations.

By Philip RuckerThe Washington Post To these 20 middle-class mothers in the electoral battlegrounds of Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, the looming choice for president between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inspires a mixture of fear, pain and disappointment. "Nauseated," said one woman. "It's like choosing which arm to cut off," said another. "I kind of wish we could start all over," said a third. Such is the mood of America's undecided voters, just 89 days until Election Day. Two focus groups of "Wal-Mart moms" -- most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate -- were convened Tuesday night in Ohio and Arizona by two polling firms and observed by reporters. They showed extraordinary resistance to the two major-party presidential nominees. The women, whose surnames were withheld for privacy reasons, described Clinton as deceptive, inconsistent and out of touch with the lives of regular people like themselves. When the 10 moms in Ohio were asked their biggest hesitation with voting for Clinton, eight said she is "untrustworthy." Many of the 10 moms in Phoenix gave similar responses. "I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot," said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. Linda, a business owner in Phoenix, said she is tired of watching Clinton sweep scandals under the rug: "There's so much stuffed under there they can't even lay the carpet down flat now." Only a few of them said the historic nature of Clinton's candidacy inspired them. "I have daughters," said Dana, a food service worker in Columbus. "It would be a big step for women. But that's the only - only - positive I see coming from Hillary." The women's views of Trump were just as harsh, if not worse. They see the business mogul as an inexperienced, impulsive hothead who is unwilling to listen and learn and lacking in humility. Ivania, a radiation safety officer in Columbus, said electing Trump president would be "kind of like sending a painter to do a doctor's job." Africa, a single mom and businesswoman in Phoenix, said Trump is too authoritarian. "Kind of like a dictator," she said. "If we were looking for a Noriega, he'd be great." "He's a racist, really," said Anita, who works in sales in Phoenix. Added Deanna, a Phoenix homemaker with four small children, "He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities." In Columbus, three women said they were leaning towards voting for Trump, two for Clinton and five were undecided and open to a third-party candidate, such as Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. In Phoenix, five leaned towards Clinton, two towards Trump and three undecided. Nearly all of the 20 women said they expected Clinton to win, however. "He's going to do something between now and November to really shoot himself in the foot," predicted Connie, who is unemployed in Phoenix. "He's just going to self implode." Tuesday's sessions - convened jointly by Penn Schoen Berland, a Democratic polling firm, and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm - were the latest in a series of "Wal-Mart moms" focus groups studying the political beliefs of a key swing voter group that tipped the scale for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 but backed Republicans in the 2010 congressional midterms. In both Ohio and Arizona, incumbent Republican senators fared better than Trump with these women. In Columbus, six of the 10 said they planned to vote to reelect Sen. Rob Portman, R, and four for his Democratic challenger, Ted Strickland, while in Phoenix, four women said they were backing Sen. John McCain, R, and three his Democratic opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick. The women in both groups universally felt the candidates were in a downward spiral of attacking and belittling one another and not focused enough on important issues, like health care and the economy. They said they feel the country is on a better track economically than a few years ago, but that the political system is broken, and they fear the rise of terrorism. Stephanie, who works in sales and customer service in Phoenix, said, "I don't trust that [Clinton] would protect our country, but I also think that Trump would get us right into World War 3." If they were ready to cede the presidency to Clinton, these women still saw a lot to like in Trump. Asked who they would rather invite over to their home for a backyard cook-out with family and friends, they overwhelmingly chose Trump. "I feel like personally he would be more fun and outgoing than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me," said Donna, a pain clinic manager in Columbus. Clinton is "emotionless" and "has an extremely hard shell around her," said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. "Cold" is how Mary, a retired cable television salesperson in Columbus, described Clinton. "She's a cold-hearted [expletive]." In a revealing moment of levity, the women were asked which Olympic sport they could picture each candidate competing in. They imagined Trump swimming ("his mouth needs a rest"), playing tennis ("back and forth with everybody"), archery ("I just can picture him completely nailing it") and rowing as the boat's coxswain ("yell at them to keep going"). For Clinton, the women suggested golf ("boring"), archery ("shoot to kill"), fencing ("she'll stab you in the back") and gymnastics ("she has to stay balanced - tries to please as many people as possible"). As they contemplated the November election, the women sighed. They said they were disgusted by the tone of it all - the name-calling, the attacks, the partisanship. They wish there were other options than Clinton and Trump. "I'd [rather] pick Minnie Mouse right now," Ivania said. "In politics, nobody's ever great, but these two are just blah," Deanna said. "They make me sick. With their integrity and moral values, it's kind of gross." Gidget, a customer service manager in Columbus, summed up the choice: "I feel like no matter which way we chose we're going to lose." The women paused to think of the first word that first comes to mind when they hear "President Hillary Clinton." "I cringe," said Maria, a homemaker and lunch aide in Columbus. "Deal with it and pray," said Nicole, a mail carrier in Phoenix. What about when they hear "President Donald Trump"? "A joke," said Anita. "A buffoon," said Deanna. Added Amy, a massage therapist in Phoenix, "Hang on."

Accidents are on the rise in Charlotte, but ambiguous data makes it hard to place the blame  Crunching the numbers By Madeline Lemieux Tools del.icio.us Facebook Twitter Email Print Add to favorites Saving… Add to Custom List Loading… Comments I don't have a will. How will anybody know what Tears for Fears songs to play at my funeral? These are the thoughts going through my head as I idle behind a Chevy Malibu at the intersection of the East 3rd-4th Street Connector and North Kings Drive. It's rush hour and I'm stuck in the far left lane, which could easily tie with Black Friday at Walmart in a 'Worst Fucking Place on Earth' contest. I rev the engine and lock eyes on my destination: the Interstate 277 on-ramp ahead on the right side of the road. To reach I-277, I'll have to speed out of the intersection (a pathetic median of white plastic barrier poles prevents me from merging before crossing North Kings), then cross four lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic and swing a sharp right turn onto the on-ramp. According to Google Maps, I'll have exactly 528 feet to accomplish this. If the engineer that designed this stretch of road intended for drivers like me to have a 'life flashing before my eyes' moment, mission accomplished. Recently released crash statistics rank that intersection the 10th most dangerous intersection in Charlotte. It joins a list of 98 intersections across the city designated by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) as 'high-accident locations.' Though these 98 intersections represent a mere 0.51 percent of Charlotte's 19,242 intersections, they account for 8.5 percent of all non-highway collisions recorded in 2015. click to enlarge An overlook of the locations of 98 intersections deemed as “high-accident locations" by the CDOT. CDOT released its annual Traffic Collision Data (TCD) report last month, and the numbers paint a startling picture for our ever-growing city: 27,648 non-highway collisions were documented in 2015, a more than 20-percent hike from the year prior. During that time period, the population grew by just over 2 percent. Charlotte residents now have a 1 in 30 chance of being involved in a collision on surface streets over the course of a year. The data follows an assessment that came earlier this year from Allstate Insurance Company's annual Best Drivers Report, which ranked Charlotte 150th out of 200 major US cities for driver safety. With a crash rate 23.8 percent above the national average, we're worse than New York City. Let that sink in. While comment section pundits were quick to blame the unfavorable stats on lead-footed northerners or distracted driving, CDOT's numbers tell a different story. Of the 27,648 non-highway collisions recorded in 2015, speed was determined to be a contributing factor in 13 percent, down from 18 percent in 2014. Inattention and distractions like cell phone use accounted for 18 percent of accidents; an improvement from 2014's 22 percent. Those aren't the only categories where Charlotte drivers improved. The 2015 reports attributes alcohol use in 1 percent (or 278) of collisions — that's down from 317 collisions (1.38 percent) in 2014. We even got better at respecting fellow drivers — failure to yield to right of way contributed to 10 percent of accidents in 2015, down from nearly 12.5 percent in 2014. So what's the problem? What factors are actually responsible for the increase in collisions? That answer might lie in a pile of discarded data. It's up to CMPD officers to determine what caused a crash, using an official DMV 349 form to categorize contributing circumstances in every collision. The list is basically a smorgasbord of everything that can go wrong, like drug use, ignoring a stop sign, driving a lemon, passing a stopped school bus, etc. The list offers nearly 40 different crash factors to choose from, and most categories account for less than 1 percent of total collisions. If we bundle together all the data from this very specific list of categories, we have an explanation for about 60 percent of total collisions. With those factors like alcohol use and texting out of the way, a whopping 10,999 crashes remain, dumped into ambiguous categories like "undetermined," "no contributing circumstances indicated," "unable to determine," and, my personal favorite, "unknown." The above graph shows a comparison of official crash causes reported by CMPD between 2014 and 2015. As a recent college graduate and author of countless term papers, I can appreciate CDOT's knack for saying the same thing four different ways. What's troubling, though, is that this leaves the contributing circumstances of 40 percent of the collisions on Charlotte streets in 2015 as completely unaccounted for, their official causes basically labeled as "Who the hell knows?" CDOT Traffic Safety Manager Angela Berry attributes this year's spike in 'cause unknown' crashes to a software glitch that prevented coding for 6,000 crashes, but comparing reports from previous years shows that ambiguous data is nothing new in the TCD report. In recent years, the amount of crashes with no real cause has grown, making it harder to find solutions or prioritize how to educate drivers. "We understand that it can be difficult to get all the answers," Berry concedes when pressed about the gaping hole in the data. While 2015 saw an improvement in accidents caused by distraction or inattention, Berry says those issues remain a priority for her department. "Distracted driving continues to be a primary focus for CDOT," she says. "We believe those statistics are underreported in the crash data." Though the TCD report finds nearly 40 different ways to place the blame on Charlotte drivers, some alarming stats seem to suggest that it's time we look for answers outside of the driver's seat. According to the 2015 stats, 68 percent of collisions occurred in broad daylight and 78 percent occurred on dry roads. Half of the fatal wrecks to occur in Charlotte last year occurred at speeds at or below the posted speed limit. We know that Charlotte drivers have improved in multiple categories on the 'contributing circumstances' list, so when the total number of accidents still increases by nearly 21 percent, maybe the problem isn't the drivers or the weather or the time of day ... it may be the roads. click to enlarge We already know that 8.5 percent of accidents occur at high-accident locations. Why aren't we looking more critically at these intersections? Same shit traffic, different day: I find myself parked on the Interstate 277 off-ramp, waiting to merge into the far left lane of East 12th Street. The problem here is that drivers have about 125 feet to cross over three lanes of traffic before making a right turn onto North Davidson Street. This is exacerbated by the fact that drivers in the right lanes are often desperately trying to merge into the left lanes to access the I-277 on-ramp after the light. It's not uncommon to see cars completely sideways on 12th Street, waiting for a spot to open up in the right lane. Often, a line of cars is backed up onto I-277, blocked by the one car at the end of the ramp waiting to merge right. This junction (technical term: clusterfuck) is the eighth most dangerous intersection in Charlotte. Or consider sitting in traffic on N. College Street at the 7th Street light, with the Levine Museum of the New South on your right. That intersection is the sixth most dangerous in Charlotte, and if you plan on exiting the city by that street, you'll pass three more of the city's 10 most dangerous intersections in the next four blocks. Ryan Pitkin Beginning at this intersection with 7th Street, northbound drivers will pass four of the eight worst intersections in Charlotte in a five-block stretch of N. College Street. This begs the question: What is the problem with College Street? The road seems benign enough. It's probable that the overhwelming numbers of those working Uptown looking for a way out every day at 5 p.m. have become too much for the skinny, one-way street. While documenting traffic trends in high accident locations is a good start, we can't get the full story without finding a way to consider what role road design plays in a collision. Berry says finding this connection is easier said than done. "CMPD officers are not engineers and should not be making qualitative assessments that are outside their specific area of expertise," Berry explains. "Roadway design is broad and complex and takes into account many factors." Fair enough; road engineering is a tough gig, but it doesn't take an expert to recognize that Charlotte is outgrowing its roads. "The state and the city have a long history of funding transportation improvements, but the past level of investment has not kept pace with the relentless growth our region has experienced over the last several decades," Berry says. According to Berry, Charlotte is projected to welcome about 400,000 new residents between now and 2040. These new residents will likely bring around 250,000 more vehicles with them. "But, they will not be bringing additional streets, travel lanes, traffic signals, bike facilities, sidewalks or any of the other infrastructure required to keep people and goods moving throughout Charlotte," Berry says. "Keeping pace with growth will require consistent and continued investment by the state, region and Charlotte." As the future of the already outgrown roads remains unclear, I'd like to make a suggestion to those 400,000 incoming residents: Bring your bikes.

Such is the mood of America’s undecided voters, just 89 days until Election Day. The number of influential Republican officials saying that they can't vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is growing as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) pledges she won't vote for Trump. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Two focus groups of “Walmart moms” — most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate — were convened Tuesday night in Ohio and Arizona by two polling firms and observed by reporters. They showed extraordinary resistance to the two major-party presidential nominees. The women, whose surnames were withheld for privacy reasons, described Clinton as deceptive, inconsistent and out of touch with the lives of regular people like themselves. When the 10 moms in Ohio were asked their biggest hesi­ta­tion with voting for Clinton, eight said she is “untrustworthy.” Many of the 10 moms in Phoenix gave similar responses. “I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot,” said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. Linda, a business owner in Phoenix, said she is tired of watching Clinton sweep scandals under the rug: “There’s so much stuffed under there they can’t even lay the carpet down flat now.” Only a few of them said the historic nature of Clinton’s candidacy inspired them. “I have daughters,” said Dana, a food service worker in Columbus. “It would be a big step for women. But that’s the only — only — positive I see coming from Hillary.” [New poll after conventions finds Clinton leads Trump by 8 points] The women’s views of Trump were just as harsh, if not worse. They see the business mogul as an inexperienced, impulsive hothead who is unwilling to listen and learn and lacking in humility. Ivania, a radiation safety officer in Columbus, said electing Trump president would be “kind of like sending a painter to do a doctor’s job.” Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton on the issues Africa, a single mom and businesswoman in Phoenix, said Trump is too authoritarian. “Kind of like a dictator,” she said. “If we were looking for a Noriega, he’d be great.” “He’s a racist, really,” said Anita, who works in sales in Phoenix. Added Deanna, a Phoenix homemaker with four small children, “He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities.” In Columbus, three women said they were leaning toward voting for Trump, two for Clinton, and five were undecided and open to a third-party candidate, such as Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. In Phoenix, five leaned toward Clinton, two toward Trump and three were undecided. Nearly all of the 20 women said they expected Clinton to win, however. “He’s going to do something between now and November to really shoot himself in the foot,” predicted Connie, who is unemployed in Phoenix. “He’s just going to self-implode.” Tuesday’s sessions — convened jointly by Penn Schoen Berland, a Democratic polling firm, and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm — were the latest in a series of “Walmart moms” focus groups studying the political beliefs of a key swing voter group that tipped the scale for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 but backed Republicans in the 2010 congressional midterms. In both Ohio and Arizona, incumbent Republican senators fared better than Trump with these women. In Columbus, six of the 10 said they planned to vote to reelect Sen. Rob Portman (R) and four for his Democratic challenger, Ted Strickland. In Phoenix, four women said they were backing Sen. John McCain (R) and three his Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. The women in both groups felt the candidates were in a downward spiral of attacking and belittling each other and not focused enough on important issues such as health care and the economy. They said they feel the country is on a better track economically than a few years ago but that the political system is broken, and they fear the rise of terrorism. Stephanie, who works in sales and customer service in Phoenix, said, “I don’t trust that [Clinton] would protect our country, but I also think that Trump would get us right into World War III.” [From Trump’s controversial words, a pattern: Outrage, headlines and then denial] If they were ready to cede the presidency to Clinton, these women still saw a lot to like in Trump. Asked who they would rather invite over to their home for a backyard cookout with family and friends, they overwhelmingly chose Trump. “I feel like personally he would be more fun and outgoing than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me,” said Donna, a pain clinic manager in Columbus. Clinton is “emotionless” and “has an extremely hard shell around her,” said Julie, the Columbus office administrator. “Cold” is how Mary, a retired cable television saleswoman in Columbus, described Clinton. “She’s a cold-hearted [expletive].” In a revealing moment of levity, the women were asked which Olympic sport they could picture each candidate competing in. They imagined Trump swimming (“his mouth needs a rest”), playing tennis (“back and forth with everybody”), archery (“I just can picture him completely nailing it”) and rowing as the boat’s coxswain (“yell at them to keep going”). For Clinton, the women suggested golf (“boring”), archery (“shoot to kill”), fencing (“she’ll stab you in the back”) and gymnastics (“she has to stay balanced — tries to please as many people as possible”). As they contemplated the November election, the women sighed. They said they were disgusted by the tone of it all — the name-calling, the attacks, the partisanship. They wish there were other options than Clinton and Trump. “I’d [rather] pick Minnie Mouse right now,” Ivania said. “In politics, nobody’s ever great, but these two are just blah,” Deanna said. “They make me sick. With their integrity and moral values, it’s kind of gross.” Gidget, a customer service manager in Columbus, summed up the choice: “I feel like no matter which way we chose, we’re going to lose.” The women paused to think of the first word that first comes to mind when they hear “President Hillary Clinton.” “I cringe,” said Maria, a homemaker and lunch aide in Columbus. “Deal with it, and pray,” said Nicole, a mail carrier in Phoenix. What about when they hear “President Donald Trump”? “A joke,” said Anita. “A buffoon,” said Deanna.

Several credit cards and $35 were stolen. Monday, Aug. 1 Deputies responded to a report of shoplifters at the Bon-Ton on Transit Road. When deputies arrived, four subjects were getting into a vehicle in the parking lot. A large number of un-bagged new clothing items were observed in plain view, and none of the people could provide receipts for the items. Arrested were two 19-year-old men, a 30-year-old woman and a 37-year-old woman. All of the subjects were charged with petit larceny, possession of burglar tools and conspiracy in the sixth degree.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen TORONTO – For 55 years, Giant Tiger’s smiling feline mascot has beckoned shoppers in small towns and those driving up to the cottage. But after years of operating under the radar amid intense competition against rivals like Walmart and the now defunct Target Canada, the company is setting its sights on becoming a household name. The Ottawa-based retailer, with its trademark yellow branding, currently operates 220 stores and has a goal of opening 10 to 15 new stores every year for the next three to five years. Story continues below The company also has plans to revamp the design of its locations and increase its product offerings in order to build a better shopping experience. Growing its e-commerce business has also been a top priority. Selling everything from groceries to big-screen TVs, the national discount chain credits the key to its survival and more importantly, its success over the last half-century, to delivering value to shoppers in the know. READ MORE: 5 things to know about Canada’s ‘stagnant’ economy right now “Giant Tiger is Canada’s best-kept secret,” touts Thomas Haig, president and chief operating officer at the privately-owned company. But in growing its footprint, Haig says it will not lose sight of what has kept it sitting pretty: its local franchise owners who know their customers and knows what works for their specific community. “These store managers live in the area, (have) lived there for several years and understand the clientele and understand the needs and wants of the community,” he said. For instance, some locations carry hunting and cottage supplies if they’re serving rural areas, while others may sell medical uniforms if they’re close to a hospital. As part of its expansion, the company says it’s looking for sites between 18,000 to 25,000 square feet in communities where there’s demand for Giant Tiger – including areas where there’s already a location. Recent openings have included stores in Bathurst, N.B., Sudbury, Ont., and Wetaskiwin, Alta. The company also recently announced a new store in Peterborough, Ont., scheduled to open next April. READ MORE: Retailers just endured their ‘worst year’ – but will this one be any better? For the past few years, Giant Tiger has been working on transforming its sleepy image in order to stay relevant to customers who want one-stop shopping for household items and groceries. One of the biggest priorities the company has is the task of reorganizing store layouts so customers can navigate faster and easier as opposed to rivals who operate warehouse-sized locations that force customers to walk around aimlessly. “(Our customers) are looking for a simplified shopping experience,” says Karen Sterling, vice-president of marketing at Giant Tiger. Their target customer continues to be women between 30 to 55 years old, with two kids, who are the “CFO (chief financial officer)” of their families and looking for value from their purchases. READ MORE: Loblaw to invest $1B in major store expansion, create 20,000 new jobs Sterling says their customers’ time constraints have also motivated the company to include more product selection, so a weekly shop for toilet paper, frozen pizza, workout clothes or back-to-school supplies can all be done under one roof. “The smaller store size is a competitive advantage,” she said. Along with updating its store look, the company has also been increasing its e-commerce presence. It currently has about 6,000 products online, with the option of shipping some of them to home or a local store for pickup. Retail analyst Sandy Silva, who is with market research firm NPD Group, says part of Giant Tiger’s success comes from customers who like the idea of supporting a Canadian business. READ MORE: Farm Boy grocery chain expands footprint in Southern Ontario But where the company can really make its mark is how it proceeds with online shopping. Silva noted that some challenges for the retailer will be meeting expectations when it comes to home delivery times and product availability because the majority of their customers live in rural areas. “E-commerce is going to be crucial to them,” she said.

At the time I thought the event was a rarity in our community however I again have witnessed the low moral fabric of some individuals who have the privilege of driving a motor vehicle. Hit and run incidents are becoming an all too common event many of which involve personal injury and death. There could be many reasons why a person elects to run including the following:  Fearful about what they have done and the potential consequences  Eluding financial responsibility and penalties  Driving without a license or with an expired license  Driving without proper registration  Driving without insurance  Driving while intoxicated and the fear of being charged with a DUI  Driving under the influence of drugs or having illegal drugs or alcohol in the vehicle  Driving a stolen vehicle On July 15th in the parking lot of Gateway Safeway or the nearby Superstore someone struck the front bumper of my car resulting in an approximate $2,400 repair bill. Again there was no note under the windshield wiper as required by law  just the pungent air of another individual who failed to take responsibility of their actions. A week earlier someone backed into my wifes car  luckily my wife witnessed the accident and the individual admitted her responsibility. Yes three accidents in less than a month, two of which I have to bear the cost for. All three incidents require the inconvenience of having them repaired. I would like to send this message to all drivers: Dont compound a mistake. Even if you think you can get away with scraping that parked car at the mall and leaving the scene, dont. You are not only being a bad neighbour and citizen, in this day when nearly everyone carries a camera on their phone, you are likely to be eventually caught and face dire consequences. The term hit and run implies a conscious intent to abandon the scene. If you hit a parked car it is somewhat impractical to wait until the owner returns. However it is your duty within the law to leave a note detailing who you are and your full contact information. If you have nothing with which to write, leave behind an identifier, such as your registration trapped under a wiper, or something else that indicates an effort to reveal intent to claim responsibility. Alternatively memorize the licence plate number or take a picture of the plate and report the incident to the police. They will be able to contact the registered owner informing them who damaged their vehicle. In conclusion, every driver should do their best to drive calmly and minimize distractions in order to reduce the risk of accidents to begin with. I realize that accidents can happen even under the utmost care. However, when they do take full responsibility  do the right thing!

Good morning, it’s Thursday, August 11, 2016.  Sixty-seven years ago today, Harry Truman fielded a funky question from a reporter. It wasn’t the first time that had happened at the White House, and it sure wouldn’t be the last. But it’s a nice snapshot in time, as well as a reminder that BS is slung from both sides of the presidential podium, so I’ll set the stage in a moment. First, I’d point you to our front page where we aggregate videos, news stories, editorials and columns spanning the ideological spectrum, while showcasing RealClearPolitics’ polling averages. We also offer a daily complement of original material from our own reporters and contributors, including the following: *          *          * Trump’s Crisis Playbook: Admit No Wrong.

Nitzkin argues that new regulations will eliminate more than 99 percent of e-cigarettes and related nicotine vapor products, thus removing a successful smoking substitute. California Is Moving in the Wrong Energy Direction. In RealClearMarkets, Carson Bruno points a finger at “energy security” shortcomings. *          *          * August 11, 1949 was also a Thursday and President Truman had a lot to discuss because of legislation he’d signed the day before, so he invited the White House press corps into the Oval Office about 4 p.m. The bill signed on August 10 was officially called the National Security Act Amendments of 1949, the statute formally creating the Department of Defense, and requiring the military service secretaries to report to an overall chief. In a brief signing statement released by the White House, the president complained about “new and cumbersome restrictions” imposed by Congress regarding appointments to the National Security Council. That night, Truman penned a grudging letter of thanks to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower for serving on an interim basis as the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At his news conference the following day, Truman announced that Gen. Omar Bradley would be the first permanent JCS chairman. The crabbiness evident in the previous day’s signing statement was still in evidence. Nine months earlier, Truman had engineered a dramatic come-from-behind win against Thomas Dewey, largely on the strength of his spirited campaign against the “Do-Nothing” Republican Congress. Although Harry Truman could be as partisan as the next man -- and often more so -- his campaign trail attacks didn’t make it easier to deal with his old chums from his Senate days on Capitol Hill. For one thing, that characterization of the 80th Congress was a crock, as both Truman and his targets knew. Those lawmakers created the Air Force, the CIA, and the cabinet-level position of secretary of defense, and funded every element of the Truman Doctrine, including the Marshall Plan, and also passed Taft-Hartley, which Truman denounced but used readily to curb strikes in the steel industry and other sectors. The defense structure Congress set up in 1947, like the Affordable Care Act that Congress would approve six decades later, had some glitches. Then, unlike now, the congressional leaders and the president could put aside their bad blood to tweak the law -- those tweaks were what Truman signed on August 10, 1949. A day later, however, the president didn’t seem too pleased with it. He seemed especially irritated at having to thank Dwight Eisenhower for his help in getting it done. Truman did, however, seem to appreciate the comic relief provided by one off-the-wall inquiry from a reporter whose name is lost to posterity. This scribe suggested in his question that the president’s heavy-handed approach to the steel strikes portended Soviet-style economics in the United States. Here is the brief exchange, which induced chuckles from the other reporters: Q: “Mr. President, do you think we are on the last mile on the back road to collectivism?” TRUMAN: “What’s that? Say that again. It sounded funny to me.” Q: “Do you think that we are on the last mile on the back road to collectivism?” TRUMAN: “I don’t know what that is, but I don’t think so.” Carl M.

Available from Walmart, the pickle chap stick was made by Accoutrements. This lets wearers keep their lips moisturized while tasting a hint of dill pickle at the same time. Made in the United States, the hydrating cosmetic is allegedly inspired by people in the old days rubbing pickles on their puckers when dryness occurred. While flavored lip balms are hardly a new concept, with many opting for fruity, sweet or dessert-themed flavors, this far-reaching product is certainly strange but also an intriguing option. This would speak to consumers who prefer novelty items as well as those who simply adore the dill flavor. The chap stick will likely have a divisive effect on people, as pickles are.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says it's received a report from a Walmart in Kanata about someone tampering with infant formula. The CFIA said the formula's outer container appeared intact but the product inside had been substituted. There has been no illness associated with this report. The inspection agency said this type of tampering is not usually from the manufacturing process but can happen occasionally when someone returns altered products to the store for a refund. The CFIA says people using infant formulas should examine the packaging material to ensure that the security seal is intact and has not been altered or substituted. Anyone who finds a product that looks like it's been altered should not consume it and should contact their local law enforcement authority or the CFIA, the agency urged.

(Dana Melius/Waseca County News) spotlight An interview with John LaDue: Stepping back, moving forward By DANA MELIUS Waseca County News Dana Melius Aug 11, 2016 (…) Dana Melius John LaDue at one of his favorite spots in downtown Waseca, fascinated by the large wasps attracted to bushes atop a wall. (Dana Melius/Waseca County News) John LaDue’s hope for “greatness” has radically changed. Over two years since law enforcement discovered LaDue’s stockpile of bomb-making supplies in a Waseca storage shed, the teenager who told investigators of his plans to kill his parents and hundreds at school simply wants to move forward. He’s not certain whether the residents of Waseca will accept those steps. “I’m just trying to fit in schooling and trying to get work,” LaDue said last week in an interview with the Waseca County News. Schooling means welding classes. Future work, LaDue hopes, will be as a pipe-fitter in St. Paul. But LaDue has deeply reflected on his past decisions. “That was a very bad decision,” he said of his warehousing of bomb-making materials. At the time, he saw carrying out an elaborate plot to first kill his family, starting a fire as a distraction for first responders then setting off bombs and shooting students at Waseca Junior-Senior High School as a path to “greatness.” It’s a view he now rejects. Today, LaDue agrees with the most recent therapists’ evaluation: the 19-year-old suffers from a major depression disorder, is “narcissistic” and has an “unspecified” obsessive, compulsive disorder. But while agreeing with the assessment, LaDue disagrees with recommendations. He is on no medication. Still, LaDue respects those who have talked to him, evaluated him, tried to discover what was inside his head as that 17-year-old was moved from facility to facility, through jail cells and courtrooms. “Every therapist I’ve met has been a very agreeable person,” said LaDue, but he’s decided to discontinue seeking professional help. “I don’t doubt their credentials at all, but I think they’re wrong. I think I know what’s in my best interests.” While LaDue understands how initial assessments claimed he suffered from a rare form of late onset autism with a fixation on violence, he now agrees his depression is a “genetic disorder.” Evaluators changed LaDue’s diagnosis when he was taken to a state facility last fall after sentencing on one count of possessing explosives. That led to LaDue’s release to his family on probation and ultimately his rejection of probation last month as he had served his full 21-month sentence, either in a juvenile treatment facility or the Waseca County Jail. Writing about his current state, LaDue stressed the importance of community and how individual traits fit into it. And he concluded he was gravely wrong and “irresponsible,” saying that “at the time, I was pretty naive on the issue of mental illness.” “It boils down to two factors,” LaDue wrote. “Intellect and community. I had intellect, but I was incorrect in believing that having a sense of community, such as caring for others, was a bad thing.” LaDue also understands the Waseca community’s reaction to the discovery of his “plan.” Fear gripped Waseca when the plot was revealed. LaDue had been a secretive and meticulous planner, stockpiling materials and testing small explosives in areas around town, including on a Hartley Elementary School playground. LaDue now claims he doesn't remember some of those early comments during conversations with police investigators. That fear has, in some cases, turned to anger, especially at news of LaDue serving probation at home and then his full release based on time served. “I don’t really criticize people ‘cuz they have the right to their opinions,” he said. “And maybe I go overboard sometimes in my thoughts. I’m not trying to win the hearts of everyone.” Nor is LaDue focused on it. “That’s more of their burden,” he said. ‘I’m sure there are plenty of people who would disagree with that. But I’m not too worried about that. I don’t really know people here so I don’t give a crap whether they like me or not. “I don’t know them. I don’t.” ‘Bad decision’ thwarted by tip, police LaDue’s behavior and struggle to enter that warehouse unit in April 2014 prompted a tip to law enforcement, which responded and found the Waseca teenager and his bomb-making supplies, and quickly learned of his plan. It was LaDue’s own words within minutes of sitting down with investigators which caused tremendous alarm, with law enforcement and the public. LaDue said he had spent upward of $4,000 on materials, some from a local hardware store, most from online purchases. He was 17 at the time of his April 29, 2014 arrest. “That was my work space, you could call it,” LaDue said of the storage unit. And while he wouldn’t say how close he might have been to putting together his plan, he noted he was $300 to $400 short of buying the remaining supplies. “There were still things that I needed to get.” It wasn’t difficult finding or purchasing materials needed for bomb-making. Two pressure cooker bombs had been a part of LaDue’s plan, he had told police investigators. “I got a lot of it on the internet, the stuff you could find at Wal-Mart and the little (hardware) store,” recalled LaDue. He told investigators at the time he wasn’t going to be a “wimp” like other mass murderers, that he wanted to be killed by police. Officer Tim Schroeder asked LaDue, “Why is this place so bad?” “I don’t know,” LaDue replied, almost emotionless. “I just don’t care for it.” He had picked April, then his favorite month of the year, because it was the month when “all the bad tragedies happen: Titanic, Columbine, Oklahoma City bombing, Boston (Marathon) bombing.” LaDue says he’s in a much different mental state of mind today. He’s confident of that, hoping to move forward, gain more schooling and find employment. LaDue, who would have graduated in 2015 at Waseca High School, earned his diploma within months of being jailed. While he said he had minor problems during his days in the Waseca school district, “I wasn’t one of the drug users or going to Wal-Mart and stealing things.” Father’s support David LaDue, John’s father, has remained a staunch supporter of his son throughout the past two plus years. Growing up in south Minneapolis before moving to Waseca, he commutes into the metropolitan area for work. David LaDue has not shied away from commenting on his son’s case, the criminal justice process and how it has changed his son and family. But he stressed news of his son’s arrest and potential plans were “extremely shocking” and he was “very disappointed.” “But also I was proud to note that he completely owned up to everything,” David stressed, adding his son was “completely honest and truthful” throughout the entire ordeal. “John said, ‘There’s no excuse for what I’ve done.’” David LaDue watched his son grow and change little, calling him “pragmatic” and said “he seems to be processing things all the time.” “John has always been this way,” David said. “It’s always who he’s been. That’s why it was so hard for me to hear of John’s potential plans.” But despite the struggles and LaDue’s journey through the judicial system, therapy, almost two years in confinement and conflicting assessments, “he’s kind of glad he’s gone through this.” “He’s matured a lot,” David said. “It kind of forced him out of his shell. It’s not all bad.” But the LaDue family has not denied “what was a very ugly state of affairs.” David LaDue says “we’re now doing great,” although his wife, a regional drug dependency counselor, has had a more difficult time with all the news. His daughter, then a WHS senior, “went back to school two days after this happened.” For him, David LaDue believes speaking up, and being honest about his son’s incident and current journey are important. “I wanted people to learn from this,” he stressed. Return to better state of being John LaDue said his time in a cell and particularly his time in a Red Wing juvenile detention facility changed him. It was “gradual,” but a definite change. His only brief break of emotion during an interview last week was when asked about the possibility of him carrying through with the bombing of the Waseca school building, the possibility his sister might have been among the fatalities. Today, even back when he was in a Waseca classroom, the thought of carrying through his plan was “nerve-wracking.” He’s bounced into former teachers during his infrequent times out and about in the Waseca community. Those who’ve greeted him have been cordial, and it means a great deal to him, he acknowledged. “I don’t have any resentment toward the community,” said LaDue. “I can’t think of any incidents that I’ve been wronged by people. “The whole thing is gradual,” LaDue said of his journey back. “You can’t point to one thing or another and wish it was different. It was, of course, ridiculous and unpleasant. Yup, I’ve wasted a lot of time and money. And yes, if I had my options to do it over, I would not have it happen.” But it did. And LaDue says he’s taken full responsibility for his actions. In his eyes, he’s a better person today and he’s on a simple path. “My main priority is to just get on and have a successful future,” he said. For the Waseca community, LaDue understands, it may not be so simple. “Forgiveness is generally a good thing to do,” said LaDue.

Fortunately, Dennis Abbott was without a bicycle for only a few days. Abbott, a longtime fixture of downtown Lawrence, reported on Sunday morning that his bicycle was stolen in front of Jefferson's Restaurant, 743 Massachusetts St. Since that initial report, there has been an outpouring of support for Abbott. Tim Barnes, a manager at Jefferson's, said Abbott has worked there and other downtown establishments for many years and folks around these parts are quite fond of him. "He's super nice," Barnes said. "I mean, he gets grumpy and grouchy, but he's walking around in the heat all day, I'd be grumpy too. He's a loveable guy and definitely a fixture in this town." Tuesday night Barnes said he received a phone call from a manager of the Wal-Mart near Sixth and Wakarusa streets. They said the store would like to give Abbott a brand new bicycle. Dennis Abbott by Conrad Swanson "Our store manager knew of Dennis and was like 'this is pretty disgusting that somebody would do that to him,'" said Angie Meyer, assistant manager at the Wal-Mart. "He said 'go ahead and we'll get him a bike and a lock.'" So, Wednesday, Abbott caught a ride to the store and began to snoop around for some new wheels. And that's when he noticed a shiny green Huffy, Meyer said. As if it were meant to be. The woman he was with asked Abbott if he wanted to keep looking, Meyer said. "And he said 'no, this is it, this is the one,'" Meyer said. Now, Abbott is back in action and as mobile as he ever was, Barnes said. "As long as he continues to lock his bike this won't happen again," Barnes said with a laugh.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz August 11, 2016: 12:14 PM ET America's top retailers in trouble These are tough times for people working at department stores and other big mall-based retailers. Macy's (M) announced on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores. The company didn't give any details about how many people would lose their jobs. But more and more department stores that are mall stalwarts, companies like Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Sears (SHLD) and Kohl's (KSS), are losing customers -- and laying off workers. According to figures from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, more than 43,600 layoffs have been announced in the retail sector so far this year. The only two sectors to cut more jobs in 2016 are energy -- due to the massive drop in oil prices over the past two years -- and computers, largely a reflection of layoffs at Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Intel (INTC, Tech30) and other old school tech giants. Retail's biggest problem is the shift in how -- and where -- people shop. More consumers are shopping online as opposed to at brick and mortar stores. Related: Macy's closing another 100 stores "The traditional retail industry in some respects is facing Armageddon. There were far too many stores built," said Mark Cohen, professor and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. Macy's set to close 100 stores It's no secret that department stores have lost ground to online retail king Amazon. The success of Amazon is a big reason why Walmart just bought hot e-commerce startup Jet.com for more than $3 billion. Shopping online is an international phenomenon, too. China's Alibaba just reported strong results on Thursday. But Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) aren't the only reason that Macy's and other traditional retailers are closing up shop and letting employees go -- or going bankrupt, like Sports Authority, Aeropostale and Pacific Sunwear. Consumers are increasingly interested in bargain hunting. It makes sense given how sluggish the overall economy is. Discount retailers like TJX (TJX) -- which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls -- Ross Stores (ROST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) are doing well. And Walmart (WMT) is rebounding after a miserable 2015. Related: More trouble at the mall. Gap sales sink again Cohen said that more and more retailers are racing to the bottom -- and are being forced to slash prices to attract customers. "Black Friday starts at Labor Day now," Cohen quipped. The rise of so-called fast fashion is also eating into sales at department stores, as well as once hot clothing retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Gap (GPS). Meanwhile, H&M, Zara and Forever 21 are all doing extremely well. So it may be a mistake to say that all malls are dying -- and that consumers have stopped spending. Yes, many malls are in trouble, especially in big cities. But malls in the more affluent suburbs are merely evolving. Think of all the malls that now have Apple (AAPL, Tech30) Stores as big tenants instead of Macy's. Other retailers outside of the bargain basement realm are still doing extremely well, too. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are thriving as consumers invest more in sprucing up their home or apartment instead of buying new clothes, toys or handbags. That's why it's important to take a look at the bigger picture in retail. Even though the loss of nearly 44,000 traditional retail jobs is bad news for the U.S. economy, other retailers are still in hiring mode. According to the official jobs figures from the government, retailers have added nearly 200,000 jobs this year. This category includes the struggling department stores, but also auto dealers, home improvement chains, supermarkets and "non-store retailers" -- a sub sector that includes Amazon and other e-commerce players. The non-store retailers have added nearly 15,000 jobs this year. Furniture and home furnishing stores have added almost 17,000 jobs. Electronics stores have added more than 4,500 jobs. Related: Why Americans are no longer shopping til they drop The overall retail business isn't going the way of the dinosaur or dodo. But some retailers are. "The retail business is not dead, but some legacy retailers are dying," Columbia's Cohen said.

It's the Moment of Truth For Fitbit, Whole Foods and Twitter U.S. News & World Report - Money 8/11/2016 Lou Carlozo © (iStockPhoto) When companies like Fitbit hit that defining moment, "they have to radically change quickly, they have to pivot." Not many companies can claim a substantial edge to Apple (AAPL) in the digital consumer products realm – except, perhaps, for Fitbit (FIT), which got into the wearable tech game in 2007, well before anyone. Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.89 -8.10 -10.66% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.04 -0.76 -0.68% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 777.75 -7.58 -0.97% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 34.89 -4.12 -10.56% And while the Apple Watch foundered on the sidelines, Fitbit's pantheon of products – which track data including steps walked, sleep quality and heart rate – helped the company go public in June 2015. And then 2016 came – and this one-time stock to watch saw its watch stop. So far this year, FIT has tumbled 48 percent, and is down more than two thirds from its peak just a year ago. With its stock trading in a trough at less than $16 per share, Fitbit now must ask itself what, if anything, it can do to live up to its product named the Surge. [See: Car Companies and the Race to Profits.] Fitbit marks a textbook case of a company at the crossroads – the kind that, despite its technical innovation and marketplace domination, fails to convert those bona fides into boisterous profits. It's a moment of truth many businesses face, and how they regroup and react speaks volumes about their long-term prospects. "The challenge of pivoting is not unique to Fitbit," says marketer Randal C. Moss, co-author of "IGNITE: Setting Your Organization's Culture on Fire With Innovation." When companies hit that defining moment, "they have to radically change quickly, they have to pivot," Moss says. "They must look at their assets, core value and then reimagine the business model. Sometimes pivots work – like CVS (CVS) reimagining itself and moving from a drug store to a health store. And sometimes pivots fail, such as Netflix (NFLX) launching Quickster." One example of a company running up against consumer fatigue is Whole Foods Market (WFM). Trading at $30 per share, WFM stock is down almost 50 percent from February 2015, a scenario where shareholders would gladly trade places with shoppers. This is, after all, the organic supermarket chain often derided as "Whole Paycheck." And in turn, Whole Foods has been hurt – badly – by competition from outlets selling similar items with much lower prices, from Trader Joe's to Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST). Even decidedly non-tony places such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) have gotten into the organic act. Whole Foods' challenge is to reinvent itself after inventing its market niche, says Keith Daniels, partner and restructuring advisory expert with Carl Marks Advisors, headquartered in New York. "Whole Foods at one time pioneered and then dominated the organic industry and now is experiencing headwinds as organic has gone mainstream," Daniels says. But after growing at an average of 8 percent annually just a few years ago, "Whole Foods is now seeing decreases in same store sales." The slump isn't just about prices, either. Trader Joe's, for example has won over many millennials with its kitschy, nautical atmosphere and chatty, helpful staff. As a response, "Whole Foods is now rolling out their '365 by Whole Foods' concept, which is targeted at the more value-conscious consumer," Daniels says. It's not just smaller, "but also more of an experience rather than just a place to buy groceries." Whole Foods is taking a risk by borrowing, to an extent, from the Trader Joe's playbook rather than creating something new to grab shoppers by the lapels. But for many companies trying to skate past the crisis marker, getting on stable footing takes precedence over market (or supermarket) disruption. A critical way to get that process started, experts contend, is not so much for companies to look at the competition outside, but the leadership inside. "Good management understands what caused the crises, identifies the best way forward and focuses on executing the turnaround plan," says Andrew Lobo, vice president of talent strategy at Talent Growth Advisors. "This is Twitter's (TWTR) issue," Lobo says. "Management cannot figure out real growth options or ways to monetize its platform." Result: Twitter has frittered away a third of its share price over the last 12 months; it now trades just above $18 per share. Yet the companies confronted by a fork in the road in 2016 aren't unique: In fact, it's potentially going to happen to every public company at some point at least once – or more. See: A struggling Apple inviting Steve Jobs back onto its board in 1997, and struggling to recover its mojo as an innovator after Jobs' passing in 2011. "These crises are predictable," says Chris Zook, co-head of global strategy at Bain & Co. and author of "The Founder's Mentality: How to Overcome the Predictable Crises of Growth." Citing Bain research, "85 percent of the reasons for failure – for hitting the skids – are traceable to deep internal root causes, not external phenomena like a saturated market, a competitor with a capability that cannot be matched, or economic market slowdown. We found this over and over in the research we did." The No. 1 cause for a crisis, Zook says, is stall out. Looking at a 15-year period, "we find that about two-thirds of established companies will stall out totally in revenues and profits – as have companies like Ericsson (ERIC), or Sony (SNE), or Fiat-Chrysler (FCAU), or Sears (SHLD) or even younger companies like Yahoo (YHOO) and Twitter. " Here's the unfortunate news for shareholders and management: Only about one in eight of those companies will regain their prior momentum. "Stall out happens when organizations become complex and lose touch with what made them special in the first place," Zook says. "Or, they begin to defend the status quo as opposed to constantly pushing out the boundaries as a young insurgent, founder-led company typically does when the company is at its best." That's true today at Apple, where in 1983 Jobs infamously said at a company retreat, "It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy." Soon after that remark, a homemade pirate flag was hoisted over Apple's headquarters – and stayed there for more than a year. In April, Apple flew a replica pirate flag as a tribute to Jobs' swashbuckling spirit. But for a company that hasn't spawned an exciting new product for some time, it seems more a token gesture of a well-heeled shipping magnate.

Retail Giant To Shut Down 100 Locations By Alexandra Suarez On 08/11/16 AT 12:37 PM Close Macy’s announcement that it will be shuttering 100 of its department stores failed to mention one crucial piece of information — which locations will be axed. The major retail chain, which is suffering from declining sales, has 728 stores to choose from. However, at least two things are known for certain: the stores will close in 2017 and the closings will reportedly result in Macy’s losing about $1 billion in volume. The retail chain struggled with sales and profit declines in the last several quarters. Women's Wear Daily reported that the company’s net income fell to $9 million from $217 million – largely due to costs surrounding the pending store closings and retirement plan settlement charges. Much of the brand’s losses have largely been attributed to customers opting to spend online in favor of buying product in-stores. Related Stories Macy’s To Cut Jobs, Close Stores Walmart Looks To Centralize Back-Office Jobs “We operate in a fast changing world,” Macy’s chairman and chief executive, Terry Lundgren, stated in a  press release issued on Thursday. “And our company is moving forward decisively to build further on Macy’s heritage as a preferred shopping destination for fashion, quality, value and convenience. This involves doing things differently and making tough decisions as we position ourselves to serve customers who have high expectations of their favorite stores, online sites and apps.” Store closings are not an uncommon trend in retail nowadays. Earlier this year in February, CNN reported that sales for major brick-and-mortar stores all fell – this included Goliath retailers like Best Buy’s, Kohl’s and Sear’s. Many have attributed the steady decline to consumers' reigning in their spending and shifting to online shopping. WWD did also report that Macy’s was strongly encouraged to “monetize its real estate assets,” which might have led it to sell off some of its underperforming store locations. This likely means that the New York City Herald Square location — which spans a city block and has been a Manhattan institution since it opened in 1902 — will stick around. But only time, and a significant increase in sales, will tell. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Published Aug 11th, 2016 11:22 am aric.mitchell@gmail.com / @tbarkansas A former Fayetteville police chief and candidates from Chicago, New Mexico and Texas are among finalists for the open Fort Smith police chief job, and utility director candidate finalists are from Minnesota, Texas and Puerto Rico. Fort Smith City Administrator Carl Geffken announced the 13 finalists for chief of police, utilities director and human resources director on Tuesday (Aug. 9). Now attention turns toward forming interview committees for each of the positions, though the final hiring decisions will be made by Geffken. Geffken is aiming to have all three positions filled by early October. Today Talk Business & Politics was able to obtain biographical information for each of the finalists. Details on each have been included below along with some background on the position vacancies. POLICE CHIEF Fort Smith Police Chief Kevin Lindsey stepped down in March after a racially charged remark was overheard and reported to IT Department Head Russell Gibson. Lindsey faced frustration over the low representation of minorities in his department. To date, the department has not promoted a black officer since 1988 and has not hired a black officer since 1995. In an early December interview, Lindsey said the department should have a percentage much closer to the 9%, which is the percentage of blacks in the city of Fort Smith population. Wendall Sampson Jr. — the city’s lone black officer — has filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination in employment and promotion. Sampson was hired by the department on Sept. 25, 1995, and is only the 10th black officer hired by the department in its history. According to various sources close to the situation, Lindsey said the only way more minorities would be part of the police force would be for white officers “to wear black face.” The city used Strategic Government Resources (SGR) out of Dallas to source candidates for chief of police and received 33 applications in all. The six finalist candidates announced for his position are as follows. Nathaniel Clark Clark is a graduate of the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff (UAPB). He served as Pine Bluff Police Chief and left after 20 years with the department for a position with the U.S. Department of Treasury. Since 2012, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau in Albany, Ga. His employment history ends in March 2016. Mark Hallum Hallum has worked for the Fort Smith Police Department since 1991 in a number of capacities. He started as a patrol officer and has risen through the ranks as a Sergeant, Captain, and Major. He serves as major-criminal investigation division commander, a position he has held since 2009. Frank Johnson Johnson has more than 25 years in law enforcement, all of which he spent with the Fayetteville Police Department where he served as Chief from 2004-2006. He was also an adjunct professor in the department of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Arkansas from 1993-2006. Since 2006, he has worked for Walmart Stores in a number of roles. His current job title is senior director of the company’s Global Investigations Training Academy. Philip Kwasinski Kwasinski has been a part of the Chicago Police Department since 1986. He has served in six roles, starting as a patrol officer and advancing to patrol sergeant in 1996. He serves as executive officer/captain. He attained his master’s degree in criminal/social justice from Lewis University in Romeoville, Ill. Jeff Matthews Matthews is a Sam Houston State University graduate with a bachelor’s degree in law enforcement police science. He has worked as a police officer for 31 years in numerous capacities, starting as an officer in field operations in 1985 and progressing through the ranks to achieve deputy police chief status with the Arlington Police Department in Texas in 2012. Keith McPheeters McPheeters is the deputy chief of police with the Farmington Police Department in New Mexico. He has been with the department for 25 years. His education credentials include Northwestern University, the FBI National Academy, and Excelsior College. He holds a bachelor’ss degree in criminal justice and a number of other law enforcement certifications. HR DIRECTOR Former Fort Smith Human Resources Director Richard Jones left his post for another position last September after 14 years with the city. Jones’ resignation was part of a wave of high-profile vacancies in city government that began with the abrupt resignation of former City Administrator Ray Gosack in July 2015. In the search for candidates, SGR received the most applications for this position (39). Bios on the final four are as follows. Evan Breedlove Breedlove is the executive director of the Good Samaritan Clinic in Fort Smith. He has served in the role since 2010. Before that, he was the human resources director for Tamko Building Products in Joplin, Mo. His HR career began in Fort Smith at Riverside Furniture, a position he held for 28 years. Breedlove earned his masters degree in business administration from the University of Arkansas. Don Jenkins Jenkins works in Modesto, Ca., as the senior consultant and HR advisor for HR Professional Resources, LLC. It’s a role he has filled since 2014. He got his start in Mountainburg, Ark., as a labor and employment attorney. He graduated from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1994. Jim Lowery Lowery lives and works in Jefferson City, Mo., as the human resources director for Cole County Residential Services, Inc. He got his start in HR as the director of the Marshall Habilitation Center of the Missouri Department of Mental Health. He graduated with a master’s degree in public administration from the University of Missouri in Columbia. Naomi Roundtree Roundtree is the human resources manager of American SportWorks, a manufacturing and fabrication company in Roseland, La. Her first position in HR was at OPTIONS, Inc., in Hammond, La., in 2002. A U.S. Army veteran, Roundtree graduated from Arizona State University in 2017 with a master’s degree in legal studies. UTILITIES DIRECTOR Former Utilities Director Steve Parke retired on April 1 after several decades with the city. As the utilities director, Parke came under heavy scrutiny from the Fort Smith Board of Directors for his handling of the $480 million consent decree between the city and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Justice. The job is now being handled by Bob Roddy of Burns & McDonnell until the city can find a suitable replacement. SGR received the least amount of applications for this post (10). Only three finalists were named on Tuesday. Their bios are as follows. Carol Blommel Johnson Johnson has been the public works superintendent of utilities for Apple Valley, Minn., since 1987. She earned her master’s degree in public administration in 2010 and holds two specialty licenses — Class A Water Operators and Class SA Collection System Operators. Francisco Martinez Martinez works for Puerto Rico’s Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, where he has served as vice president of operations since 2013. He was a machinist mate for the U.S. Navy from 1987 to 1993, where he was involved in power plant operations. He has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Puerto Rico and a master’s in management from Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. David Terrill Terrill graduated in 1980 with a bachelors degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, where he would also earn his master’s degree seven years later. From 2004 to 2015, he was the manager of development engineering with the Trinity River Authority.

(TYRONE SIU/REUTERS) People play Pokemon Go in Hong Kong on Aug. 6, 2016. (TYRONE SIU/REUTERS) Pokemon Go frenzy boosts real-life merchandise sales Add to ... KAREN K. HO The Globe and Mail (includes correction) Published Thursday, Aug. 11, 2016 1:10PM EDT Last updated Friday, Aug. 12, 2016 11:37AM EDT Comments Print / License AA The Pokemon Go excitement may be dying down a little, but that hasn’t stopped sales of merchandise from passing through registers. Retailers and industry analysts are reporting sales of Pokemon-related merchandise, be it plush characters, clothing, movies or console video games, have all risen significantly since the game’s initial launch on July 8. “Looking at our toy database, in games, Pokemon is actually the number-one brand,” said Michelle Liem, toy industry analyst and the NPD Group’s director of client development. “They basically have 25 per cent share of all games right now. It’s a big number.” The popularity of Pokemon Go has increased sales of Pokemon merchandise and other games at stores such as EB Games, Best Buy, Walmart and HMV. Ms. Liem said six of the top 10 items in games are Pokemon trading cards, a category that includes popular brands Uno, Monopoly and even Rubik’s Cubes. “In many cases, Pokemon is outselling them or at least selling as many,” she said. According to Ms. Liem, the best-selling Pokemon trading card item is a Breakpoint Booster Box, which retails for approximately $100 (U.S.) on Amazon. HMV spokeswoman Elyssa Macri said Pokemon apparel sales are up 64 per cent, gifts and collectibles sales (such as toys, plush and blankets) are up 150 per cent and Pokemon series and movie sales (DVDs and Blu-ray discs) are up 100 per cent since the game’s launch. Other popular items include Pokeball-themed glassware and Pikachu coin banks. “As long as there is demand for these products we will continue to stock them in stores and online,” Ms. Macri wrote in an e-mail. GameStop, the parent company of Canadian games retailer EB Games, saw sales double the week after the release of Pokemon Go in the United States. In an interview with CNBC, chief executive J. Paul Raines said more than 460 stores are designated as PokeGyms where players can pick up supplies. Mr. Raines also said sales of Pokemon merchandise at Gamestop were up “significantly across the board” during what is “traditionally a slower time of the year for video gaming.” At Best Buy Canada, players have been stocking up on power and battery packs in droves. “We heard the demand loud and clear that charging on the go is really key to playing the game,” spokeswoman Christine said. She said the surge in demand for chargers was quickly apparent to Best Buy staff: players had begun asking questions about battery packs and charging their phones in stores, comments on social media were flagging the need and, of course, it was obvious even from their own playing experiences. The company has set up a special webpage, called a “Hunting Kit Hub” featuring “catcher’s essentials”: items such as backpacks, chargers, cellphone accessories, USB cables, iTunes gift cards (for buying Pokecoins), water bottles, fitness trackers, trading cards and even Pokemon branded hats. However, Best Buy’s inventory of the Pokemon Go Plus wearable device and all of its Pokemon character plushes are currently sold out. “The hype has been insane for them,” said Christine Tam, a Best Buy spokesperson. The company has ordered 80,000 more power chargers and power banks to the 30,000 currently available in store and online, but Ms. Tam could not confirm how many more this is compared with normal volumes. “We are definitely committed to the Pokemon Go craze,” she said. As for the future, Ms. Liem said for Pokemon to be a successful, long-term trend in toys, games, apparel and other merchandise like Frozen, Star Wars or Angry Birds, it will need to do a lot of things right. This includes continuing the level of engagement with players and sales of items such as trading cards, and the strategy the Pokemon Company takes to roll out collectibles and higher-price point objects aimed at adults. “With Star Wars there was huge interest in the $50-and-up price point,” she said, noting the popularity of the Kylo Ren Lightsaber by Hasbro and the Millennium Falcon Lego set, both retailing in the $200 range. If Pokemon becomes as successful as Frozen or even Star Wars, there’s money to be made even outside of the app. Ms. Liem pointed to Frozen as a great example of a new brand being enormously successful in the country’s $2-billion toy industry even two years after the movie’s release. “Nobody knew it was going to be that big,” she said. According to Ms. Liem, Star Wars sold almost $100-million in toys and other merchandise in Canada last year following the release of the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And the film increased sales by 115 per cent. By comparison, Frozen sold about half that in 2015 and sales were up 13 per cent year over year. “They still had good growth,” she said.

Macy's announced the closures Thursday. They represents about 15 percent of all Macy's department stores. The iconic retailer did not disclose the locations of stores, but said most of them will be shut down in early 2017. The Macy's move is the latest in a wave of store closures amid the rise and success of Amazon and other online shopping options. For instance, Walmart announced plans in January to shut down 269 stores this year and just this week, inked a $3.3 billion deal to acquire Amazon rival Jet.com. Sports Authority, once the nation's largest sporting goods retailer, is shutting all 450 of its stores after filing for bankruptcy. Other traditional retailers such as Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl's have also pulled the plug on hundreds of stores in recent months. It's a grim picture for retail store workers -- there have been 47,000 retail layoffs announced so far this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data. Wal-Mart's closures alone impacted 16,000 workers. Macy's closures come amid a sixth-straight quarterly decline in sales. However, sales fell less than feared and the company said it's "encouraged" by recent sales trends. Wall Street applauded the dramatic store closures, sending the stock surging 16 percent, on track for its best day since 2008. Macy's said its new strategy is to concentrate its financial firepower and talent on its best-performing locations. The department store plans to invest in strong stores by highlighting new vendors, increasing the size and quality of its staff and investing in new technology. "We operate in a fast-changing world, and our company is moving forward decisively to build further on Macy's heritage," Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said in a statement. Macy's said the store closures could result in the loss of about $1 billion in sales, even after accounting for shoppers who would go online and to other Macy's locations. The company plans to offset that loss in sales by cutting costs, even beyond shutting down these stores. It's not clear how many jobs will be impacted by these moves. Macy's said it won't detail layoffs until it finalizes its store closure list. Macy's said employees at stores slated for closure may be offered positions in nearby stores "where possible," Macy's said. Workers who are laid off will be offered severance benefits. "Macy's is committed to treating associates affected by store closings with respect and openness," the company said. Karen Hoguet, Macy's chief financial officer, said most of the stores being closed are "underperformers, or are in weak locations." The Macy's move is the latest blow to malls, many of which rely on the iconic department store to serve as an "anchor" tenant. Those malls impacted risk losing a major source of revenue and a suffering a traffic slowdown in traffic that is likely to hurt other stores. Struggles for other department stores make filling the hole left by Macy's even more challenging. Shares of major mall owners General Growth Properties and Simon Property Group slumped 3 percent and 2 percent on Thursday. Even some premiere Macy's locations could eventually be scaled back. The company said it continues to "analyze possibilities" of bringing in alternative tenants into its flagship Herald Square location in Manhattan as well as the downtown stores in Chicago and Minneapolis. Macy's revealed it's also in talks to sell its Men's Store on Union Square in San Francisco for redevelopment. Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said the Macy's store closures are "sensible," but largely the result of a "self-inflicted defeat." "Macy's has simply not bothered with a large rump of stores for many years: they have lacked investment, been devoid of management attention, and now look distressed and dispirited," Saunders wrote in a report. The key will be whether Macy's is truly committed to rejuvenating its remaining stores in a way that gives consumers a reason to shop in person rather than online.

Restaurant reporter Kyle Arnold and food writer Lauren Delgado discuss the latest food news: Lazy Moon, Fooduku, North Quarter Market opening and Smiling Bison, Gardell Bros. Pizza and Artichoke Red market closing. Kyle ArnoldContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Winner, Winner Chicken Dinner: PDQ putting three new fast casual tenders restaurants in Central Florida Chicken tenders chain PDQ is expanding in Central Florida. The fast-casual chicken-tender-focused chain based out of Tampa signed a lease to locate at the Lake Nona Landing shopping center, joining anchors Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. It's just one of a few new PDQ restaurants opening in Central Florida, with restaurants also coming in Clermont and the Hunter's Creek neighborhood. PDQ, which stands for People Dedicated to Quality, opened its first Central Florida restaurant in Sanford in 2015. The chain sells chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, sides and desserts. "We know it's a great area and we wanted to get the Sanford location open and running before we really expanded," said PDQ spokesman Jeffrey Kamis. The Clermont store is supposed to open in the second quarter of next year, with the Lake Nona location coming a few months later. The Hunter's Creek restaurant on John Young Parkway is expected to open at the end of 2017.

PDQ was started in Tampa in 2011 by Outback Steakhouse co-founder Bob Basham and former Tampa Bay Buccaneers executive Nick Reader. The restaurants also have drive throughs, Kamis said. North Quarter Market Orlando's north downtown district is getting a new shared retail space called North Quarter Market with a small grocery, café and a gourmet ice pop shop. The 2,300 square foot space is on the ground level of the Nora Apartments at 899 North Orange Ave., near the corner of Orange and Marks St. Winter Garden organic produce and meat seller The Farmacy will locate there along with Downtown Credo coffee and The Pop Parlour. "Basically it's a mini-grocery store," said Cathy Lee, co-owner of The Farmacy in Winter Garden. It should open by the end of September, Lee said. North Quarter Market is a smaller version of some shared retail spaces such as Market on South and East End Market. Lee said her shop will have organic produce, meats and some other groceries. Eventually she hopes to get some grab and go items such as sandwiches and wraps. The spot was formerly occupied by Coffee Culture, a café that closed in March. Pop Parlour is a gourmet ice pop shop south of Lake Eola with flavors such as peanut butter, pineapple cilantro and coconut rum. Some do have an alcoholic element. Plans also call for Pop Parlour to serve wine and other drinks. Credo is a non-profit coffee seller that partners with growers in Guatemala. Bulla Winter Park South Florida Spanish restaurant Bulla Gastrobar is set to open this fall in Winter Park. The tapas-style restaurant is headed to the Lakeside Crossing development on U.S. 17-92 just across from Trader Joe's. That property also includes restaurants such as Chuy's Tex-Mex and Kona Grill. They have restaurants in Doral and Coral Gables. "Bulla is a family-style neighborhood restaurant utilizing only the best ingredients," said Juan Carlos Marchan, vice president of owner Centurion Restaurant Group. The menu features items such as croquetas de jamón and a seafood dish called arroz a banda. The restaurant has not set an exact opening date. karnold@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5664; on Twitter @kylelarnold Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel Central Florida restaurants that have failed health inspections Pictures: Made or invented in Florida Open for business: Orlando-area retail and restaurant openings All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 78°

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. August 11 Follow @CleveWootson Nakeisha Hall masterminded an “outrageous” scheme to get phony tax refunds from the IRS. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News)   For Nakeisha Hall, the IRS might as well have been the family business. The daughter of a longtime employee of the federal tax collection agency, Hall started working for the IRS in 2000. A large chunk of her career was spent in Taxpayer Advocate Service offices in four states, where she assisted people who had been victims of identity theft. But as Hall was helping taxpayers, she was also using them to steal from the government, federal authorities said. Now, she is going to federal prison: The 40-year-old former federal worker was sentenced Wednesday to more than nine years after pleading guilty in an identity theft and tax fraud scheme that affected hundreds of taxpayers and netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent tax refunds, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of Alabama, in Birmingham. In all, Hall attempted to steal more than $1 million, the government said. She successfully claimed more than $400,000. “This defendant abused her position of trust as an IRS employee,” U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance said in a statement. “Hall victimized United States taxpayers and jeopardized the reputation of the IRS.” Hall’s sentence “reflects the outrageous and serious nature of her crime,” Vance added. The scheme went on from 2008 to 2011 as Hall used her access to IRS computers to get people’s names, birth dates and Social Security numbers, according to federal prosecutors. She then used that information to submit bogus tax returns, often tweaking or making up income and employment information to inflate the returns. She requested that the IRS put the refunds onto debit cards that would be mailed to addresses that she or her co-conspirators controlled, according to government prosecutors. Her accomplices would activate the cards using the stolen identity information, then withdraw the money from ATMs or use the cards in stores. Sometimes, they forged signatures on refund checks to cash them. [IRS: A new phone scam threatens college students] One identity-theft victim was a 77-year-old Alabama man whose information Hall accessed without “a legitimate business reason,” according to Hall’s plea agreement. In 2010, Hall filed a federal tax return in the man’s name, using a fictitious address and falsely stating that the man had been employed at Walmart — and that he was owed an IRS refund. One of Hall’s co-conspirators picked up a debit card in the victim’s name for nearly $1,400. That October, the debit card was used on and near the street where the co-conspirator, Jimmie Goodman, lived. The plea agreement states that Goodman had previously “used the same ATMs and gas stations to retrieve money from his own tax refund card.” Three co-conspirators, all of whom live in Birmingham, pleaded guilty in the case, according to the IRS: Goodman, 37, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and bank fraud. He was sentenced to three years and five months in prison. Lashon Roberson, 36, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud affecting a financial institution and mail fraud affecting a financial institution. Roberson, who worked for years in the financial services industry, was sentenced to three years in prison. Abdulla Coleman, 40, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud affecting a financial institution and bank fraud. He is scheduled for sentencing Sept. 14. But the harshest sentence was reserved for Hall, who “came up with the idea for the scheme” and recruited her co-conspirators, according to government. [If the U.S. Government Grants Department calls you, hang up quickly. It’s a scam.] “Misusing her position with the Internal Revenue Service, Ms. Hall stole the identities of American taxpayers and filed false tax returns in their names,” Karl A. Stiften of the IRS Criminal Investigations division said in a statement, adding: “Refund fraud and identity theft of this magnitude and with this degree of dishonesty and deceit, deserves to be punished to the fullest extent of the law.” The IRS offices where Hall worked work as advocates for taxpayers, especially those who are struggling to meet their obligations. “The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is your voice at the IRS,” the agency’s website says. “We ensure you are treated fairly, and know and understand your rights. If you are having tax problems and have not been able to resolve them with the IRS, you may be eligible for free TAS assistance. We know this process can be confusing, but the worst thing you can do is nothing at all!” Tax scams are an ongoing concern for the IRS, which compiles an annual “Dirty Dozen” list of “common scams taxpayers may encounter any time during the year.” “The IRS continues working to warn taxpayers about phone scams and other schemes,” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in February. Earlier this year, authorities arrested five people in Miami who had tricked 1,500 victims into paying them $2 million in “taxes” they didn’t owe. As The Post’s Lisa Rein wrote: The suspects, all Cuban nationals who were arrested Monday, were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They falsely impersonated IRS agents, Treasury Department authorities said, demanding money from their victims and telling them they would be arrested if they didn’t wire payments immediately. In recent months, the scammers demanded that their victims pay them using iTunes gift cards. Hall entered a guilty plea in February on charges of theft of government funds; aggravated identity theft; unauthorized access to a protected computer; and conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud affecting a financial institution. She was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre. Said Ruben Florez, special agent in charge of the Treasury and inspector general for tax administration, mid-states field division: “Violations of federal law, particularly those committed by IRS employees who are entrusted to protect taxpayers’ sensitive information, will not be tolerated.” Read more:  Dozens of dead horses ‘left to rot where they fell’ found on former Olympian’s ranch She loved the river.

(NYSE: WMT) According to Bloomberg, Martin entered a contest sponsored by Jet.com to see who can get the most people to sign up for a membership to the ecommerce platform. He spent $18,000 on online ads and won the grand prize of 100,000 shares of the company. Some estimates peg his holdings to be worth anywhere from $10 million to $20 million. He told Bloomberg he isn't at liberty to disclose the dollar amount, but did say in an interview with a huge smile that he's "very excited."

Schaefer Arrow icon A York Township man and his family are set for life after an $18,000 gamble in a marketing campaign turned into a multi-million payout thanks to Walmart's purchase of Jet.com.  Entering a contest by Jet.com, Eric Martin, a 30-year-old IT worker, invested $18,000 in a marketing campaign aimed at encouraging people to sign up for membership in the online shopping venture and would-be rival of Amazon.com, last year.  The campaign resulted in 8,000 referrals to Jet.com, and Martin won the top prize of $100,000 in Jet.com stock options, according to PennLive.com. When Walmart stepped in to buy Jet.com recently, Martin's gamble paid off - big time. His stock could now be worth between $10 and $20 million, news outlets speculated. "I'm really excited," Martin told Business Insider. "I'm taking time to process it. I haven't really had a chance to really feel what it means yet. But I'm very, very happy." Other than celebrating with snow crab legs for dinner and making plans to take his family to Thailand for a visit when his children are older, Martin said he doesn't know what he will do with the money. This York man invested $18,000 in a contest and is now likely to gain millions in return. https://t.co/5NyoWttcni — Lindsey Blest (@LindseyBlestLNP) August 9, 2016 Published: August 11, 2016 — 10:11 AM EDT | Updated: August 11, 2016 — 4:51 PM EDT Continue Reading More in news Real Time › Could a proposed recount in Pa., 2 other states help Clinton?
