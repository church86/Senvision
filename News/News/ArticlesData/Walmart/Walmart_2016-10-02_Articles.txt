Android TV gives the device access to apps from some usual suspects from the OTT world, including Netflix, Sling TV, HBO, Showtime and VUDU, among others.   To help prime the pump, Xiaomi is tossing in some perks such as a $50 credit toward a subscription to Sling TV, a three-month free trial to Pandora, and a $5 credit toward a rental or purchase via VUDU.   Xiaomi  said the device packs a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali 450 GPU, as well as 2GB DDR3 RAM and 8GB eMMC flash. Users can also add additional storage to Mi Box using its USB port.   The MiBox joins a mix of other Android TV devices, including connected TVs from Sharp and Sony, the Nvidia Shield, and Razer Forge TV. Google stopped selling the first Android TV-based device, the Nexus Player, earlier this year.   Want to read more stories like this? Get our Free Newsletter Here!

(OTCQB: NROM), the Indianapolis based franchisor and licensor of Noble Roman’s Pizza, today announced that it had signed an agreement with TMC Franchise Corporation (“TMC”) to become a Preferred Supplier for their system of franchised Circle K&#174;, Kangaroo Express&#174; and On the Run&#174; convenience store brands in the United States, which today totals approximately 800 locations. TMC is part of the Alimentation Couche-Tard, Inc. group, one of the largest operators and franchisors of convenience stores in North America. Pursuant to the agreement, TMC will communicate Noble Roman’s preferred status for pizza-focused foodservice to its existing franchisees as well as to all new franchise prospects. Noble Roman’s will conduct presentations and demonstrations for TMC franchisees at special meetings to be held during the October 2016 convention of the National Association of Convenience Stores (“NACS”) in Atlanta, where Noble Roman’s will be exhibiting for all NACS attendees. Noble Roman’s also announced that it had signed three more franchise agreements for non-traditional units to be located in Walmarts, and expects to sign an additional three agreements later this year through the same master franchisee. The first non-traditional Noble Roman’s location inside a Walmart opened earlier this year in Myrtle Beach. According to Scott Mobley, president of Noble Roman’s, “We are enthused about the long-term opportunity for growth Walmart locations might represent for the company. Interior construction at the Walmart locations permitting, we anticipate all three of the new units recently signed to potentially be opened and operating yet this year, with the others on the slate for the first quarter of 2017. We believe there are other opportunities for partnered growth within this segment as well.” In total, the company has signed twenty-one new non-traditional franchise/license agreements in the first three quarters of 2016, compared to twelve during the same period in 2015. Sixteen non-traditional franchised/licensed locations have been opened thus far in 2016, compared to eight new non-traditional locations opened during the same period in 2015. Noble Roman’s also announced that it had signed agreements with two new grocery distributors to carry the ingredients for its deli take-n-bake pizza program. One of the distributors was stocked with products the last week of September; the other distributor has issued purchase orders to be stocked this week. Said Mobley, “Our team headed by Troy Branson, Executive Vice President, has done an excellent job pre-selling a number of groceries within each of the two new distributors, so we are able to get those programs up and running relatively quickly after they stock. We will continue to aggressively pursue additional grocers for our program within their two systems as well as others.” In total, the company has signed agreements for approximately 400 new grocery locations so far in 2016, and approximately 210 locations have been trained and opened. About Noble Roman’s Noble Roman’s, Inc. sells and services franchises and licenses for non-traditional foodservice operations under the trade names “Noble Roman’s Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Take-n-Bake,” “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs,” and now “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza &amp; Pub.” The company has awarded franchise and/or license agreements in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Italy, Canada and the Dominican Republic.

NEW DELHI: Flipkart signed a non-disclosure agreement with Walmart before a team from the US arrived in India for talks last week aimed at taking forward discussions about a strategic alliance, said a person aware of the development. Executives of the world’s largest retailer also held meetings with Snapdeal and logistics companies during their trip as part of an exercise to gain a thorough understanding of India’s ecommerce market ahead of striking any deals, said two other persons. "Walmart is studying all parts of the ecommerce value chain in India," said one of the two. "They want a first-hand, deep understanding of what the market looks like, though they don’t have any immediate plans." Neil M Ashe, president and CEO, global ecommerce, Walmart, led the team, which spent "considerable time" at Snapdeal, the person added. Walmart and Snapdeal declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the talks with Flipkart, discussions are at an early stage and it will take a few months of negotiations to arrive at any conclusion, said the person cited above. Flipkart declined to comment. When contacted, Walmart said "We’re not commenting on the rumours.’’ ET was the first to report, on September 27, that Walmart was exploring an equity partnership with Flipkart. It said "the two companies are engaged in early talks, and a meeting is scheduled this week, that will include discussions on Walmart picking up a minority stake in India’s largest ecommerce company." "Walmart could be exploring India," said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, ecommerce, KPMG India. "Walmart is not a big online player, but is known for exceptional strategic sourcing, which is a weak point for e-tailers in India. So a strategic partnership in India could make sense for Walmart." As more Indians take to ecommerce, "that’s an opportunity Walmart wouldn’t like to miss." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

New York developer Tom Valenti confirmed that Wal-Mart was no longer the key anchor in the 16-acre development on Johnson Drive and Shawnee Mission Parkway. The retailer never received a warm welcome from the public, nor from a Mission City Council that shot down Valenti’s latest plan in August. “I can only discern they didn’t want a Wal-Mart as part of this project,” he said. Valenti said that Wal-Mart officials attended the Aug. 14 meeting where the Mission City Council turned down a preliminary site plan for a development concept that included apartments on top of the 24-hour retailer. Valenti said he was told last week of Wal-Mart’s decison. Wal-Mart plans to remain in its nearby Roeland Park location and has pledged to remodel the store. “While we were excited to be a part of the vision for the multiuse Mission Gateway development, we understand the developer’s current proposal is not moving forward and have made a business decision to no longer pursue a new store at this location,” said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Delia Garcia. She said Wal-Mart “remains committed to finding ways to better serve our area customers and, as we continue to innovate our services and invest in improving our stores, we anticipate launching an extensive remodel of the existing store in Roeland Park in early 2017. The Roeland Park Wal-Mart has proudly served the community for 20 years, and we look forward to making investments in this store that will greatly enhance the customer experience.” Roeland Park Mayor Joel Marquardt said Wal-Mart’s decision to stick around will help the city’s finances. Wal-Mart and the shopping center it anchors at Roe Avenue and 51st Street was one of the city’s biggest sales tax generators. “It’s obviously good news for our budget,” Marquardt said. “I think it will help.” Valenti said he plans to stick with the Mission Gateway development, perhaps substituting the Wal-Mart store with several smaller retailers. He plans to be in Mission on Oct. 13 and 14 to get community input for the plan. It’s the latest in a long list of setbacks for the Mission Gateway project, which was supposed to be a grand entrance to the suburb from the west once the Mission Center Mall was torn down more than 10 years ago. But various proposals — condos, apartment projects, an aquarium, restaurants and retailers of various types and so on — fell by the wayside. Eventually in 2011, Valenti proposed a Wal-Mart for the site, the same retailer that years before had been rejected by city leaders in Mission. “We now have the rocket fuel to get the project off the ground,” Valenti told The Star in 2011. Instead of a source of ignition for the project’s future, the retailer became a target of derision. Roeland Park officials complained that the Mission Wal-Mart would cost its neighboring city their own store, which accounted for $500,000 of that city’s sales tax income. Mission residents complained about the Wal-Mart, airing concerns about how poorly the retailer had kept up its Roeland Park location and whether the city needed another Wal-Mart in perhaps the city’s most visible and valuable undeveloped piece of commercial property. A slate of candidates, many of them political newcomers, ran for Mission City Council on a plank of opposing Wal-Mart for Mission Gateway. They all won, which appeared to shift the balance of the city’s governing body against the Wal-Mart-anchored development plan. Kristin Inman, one of those newly minted council members, said she welcomed the news. “I’m pleased the Wal-Mart won’t be part of the development, but I’m excited about the rest of it with the hotel and replacement retailers,” Inman said. “It’s hopefully going to be an outstanding development.” A Mission Gateway without Wal-Mart may be more palatable to Mission residents and leaders. Debbie Kring, a Mission councilwoman for 17 years who has seen virtually all the interactions of Mission Gateway, shared those sentiments.

ET Share this article NEW YORK, Oct. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading consumer technology company Xiaomi announced today that it is bringing Mi Box — its 4K Ultra HD streaming media player powered by Google's Android TV — to the U.S. market for $69. Mi Box will be available on Mi.com starting today at 12 p.m. ET, and in Walmart stores as well as Walmart.com in early October.  With Xiaomi's commitment to bringing innovation to everyone, the $69 price tag of Mi Box is set to disrupt the U.S. market for products that deliver a richer television experience. Mi Box offers 4K support at 60 frames per second, support for the latest HDR10 standard, Google voice search and Google Cast. Thanks to Android TV, Mi Box comes with thousands of movies and shows from popular streaming apps including Netflix, HBO, Showtime and VUDU, as well as games from Google Play. As live streaming TV grows in popularity among U.S. consumers, Mi Box is also offering users easy access to live TV channels including ESPN, CNN and Disney without a cable subscription through Sling TV. Hugo Barra, Vice President, Xiaomi Global said: "We are thrilled to bring Mi Box to our fans in the U.S. in collaboration with Google. This is a significant milestone for Xiaomi, as it is our first opportunity to demonstrate to consumers here in America the power of what makes Xiaomi extraordinary: our promise of innovation for everyone. We believe everyone is entitled to benefit from technological breakthroughs, and Mi Box is a reflection of that belief: an incredible entertainment experience at an unprecedented price of $69, less than the cost of a single night out for two." Sascha Prueter, Google's head of Android TV, said: "The Android TV team is excited to partner with Xiaomi to deliver the Mi Box to the U.S. With features like voice search and HDR support, the Mi Box takes advantage of the latest Android TV platform innovations." Smooth video playback in 4K Ultra HD and HDR Mi Box supports 4K Ultra HD video content playback at 60 frames per second, for the sharpest image quality and smoothest video playback. In addition, Mi Box supports the latest HDR10 standard (to be enabled from Android N onwards), which promises improvements in color and contrast for a significant leap in picture quality when used with compatible TVs. Mi Box supports Microsoft's hardware-based DRM technology PlayReady 3.0, which protects 4K and HDR content and enables a rich viewing experience for 4K Ultra HD video content. Equipped with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali 450 GPU, as well as 2GB DDR3 RAM and 8GB eMMC flash, Mi Box provides powerful performance for a smooth streaming and gaming experience. Users can also add additional storage to Mi Box via USB. Mi Box also delivers rich and vibrant audio with Dolby Digital Plus and DTS Surround Sound, creating a cinema-like experience right within the living room. Mi Box offers an exciting range of content from live TV, Netflix, YouTube and more Mi Box arrives in the U.S. on the heels of Xiaomi's success in the TV market in China, where it has already sold over 15 million smart TVs and set-top boxes since 2013. In the U.S., Mi Box is also set to shake up the home entertainment market, as several major content companies have joined Xiaomi to make their content available to a massive new audience. Thanks to Android TV, Mi Box comes with a rich library of content with thousands of movies, shows and games from Google Play, YouTube and other apps. Users have no lack of entertainment options with pre-installed popular streaming apps including Netflix, Pandora, VUDU, Pluto TV and Red Bull TV. Images come to life on TV screens when viewing the wide range of 4K content available from YouTube, Netflix and others. Live streaming TV is poised to explode as a new generation brings its viewing habits into the living room, and Mi Box brings the best available experience for viewing live TV channels including ESPN, CNN and Disney — all without a cable subscription. Special perks (total of $76 value) offered by content partners include: Sling TV: sign up to watch your favorite live channels and get $50 credit towards your subscription Pandora: listen to your favorite music with a 3-month free trial VUDU: rent, buy or watch your favorite movie or TV show on demand with $5 credit Roger Lynch, CEO, Sling TV, said: "Since its founding, Xiaomi has been a disruptor overseas, and we expect the launch of Mi Box in the U.S. to be no different. Our goal has always been to expand Sling TV to the most popular consumer devices, and we believe Mi Box's revolutionary technology and accessible price point paired with the Sling TV experience will be a winning combination among American consumers." Google Cast and Google voice search Mi Box also has built-in Google Cast technology that lets users easily share their small screens, casting TV shows, movies, music and games from their mobile device to the big screen with just a single tap. Mi Box comes with a Bluetooth remote control that supports voice search and commands. Users can simply speak into the remote to search for content by description — try "Leonardo Dicaprio's Oscar movie" to find exactly the right movie, or ask "who played Aragorn in Lord of the Rings" for search results. Users can also change channels, go directly to a TV show or movie, do Web searches, and launch apps by just speaking into the remote. The Bluetooth remote can also be used as a controller for the huge catalog of games available for Android TV. Images of Mi Box can be downloaded here.

Xiaomi says that the Mi Box will be available today, October 3, from the company’s online store, and orders will begin going out on October 6. It’ll hit Walmart stores and Walmart’s website in “early October.” Pricing for the Mi Box is set at $69. The Xiaomi Mi Box is a 101 x 101 x 19.5mm set-top box that can output at up to 4K 60fps and offers one HDMI 2.0a port, one USB 2.0 port, and SPDIF out/3.5mm out. It’s also got DTS 2.0+ digital out, Dolby Digital Plus, up to 7.1 passthrough, Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, and Bluetooth. The Mi Box’s raw specs include a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, and 8GB of flash storage. Each Mi Box includes a Bluetooth remote control that supports voice search. A Mi Game Controller will be sold separately. While we still aren’t getting any Xiaomi phones in the US, it’s good to see that Xiaomi’s Mi Box is available to US consumers. Not only does it mean that we’re getting another Xiaomi product in the US, the Mi Box’s launch gives us another Android TV option in a market where there aren’t a ton of choices, and it’s a fairly affordable option, too. Now that the Mi Box is officially launching in the US, will you be buying one?

Walmart has pulled out of the proposed Mission Gateway project, ending nearly five years of controversy over the plan to use the mega-retailer as the anchor for the mixed-use development. Developer Tom Valenti said Monday the decision for Walmart to quit the $190 million project was mutual. Its future involvement, however, already was doubtful after the Mission City Council rejected a project plan containing Walmart in August by a 6-2 vote. FROM OUR SPONSORS: “We’re fully committed to completing this mixed-use project like we were before. We’re in the process of working with other retailers, probably three, that would take the Walmart space.” — Tom Valenti Valenti, whose development firm, the Cameron Group of Syracuse, N.Y., has been pursuing the Mission Gateway project since 2005, vowed he would continue to pursue new tenants to replace Walmart. “We’re fully committed to completing this mixed-use project like we were before,” he said. “We’re in the process of working with other retailers, probably three, that would take the Walmart space.” When Valenti first proposed his redevelopment plan for the 16-acres at the corner of Shawnee Mission Road and Roe Avenue, it included a New Urbanism-style blend of uses: hotel, retail, residential and office served by a central parking garage. But the 2007 recession hampered his search for retailers to make the project, which relied on tax-increment financing and other incentives, work financially. In 2011, he believed he had his answer when Walmart agreed to include a 155,000 square-foot store in the project. The Walmart would be the sales tax “rocket fuel” that would help the other elements of the development come together, he said at the time. But it proved a hard sell in Mission, which had rejected an earlier Walmart proposal for the same location. Valenti attempted to design a Walmart that would blend in with the mixed-used vision for the property. One variation called for a park to be built on top of the store, another included apartments above it. But with a new group of city council members in Mission, some elected specifically because of opposition to Walmart, the August vote apparently was the last gasp for the idea of using the big-box discount chain as the anchor. A site plan had been approved in January after a 4-4 ties was broken by Mayor Steve Schowengerdt. That plan was not likely to get public financing support with the Walmart still part of the mix. Valenti said he will not seek another “super-discount department store” to take Walmart’s place in the development plan. “I’m looking for smaller retailers in the space where Walmart was going,” he said. “All the same uses are planned, retail, residential, hotel and potentially office if we can get a tenant. “The goal would be to use the site plan approved by Mission in January 2016.” Valenti said he informed Mission city officials of his decision last week. “They want to be cooperative and want to see the project move forward and do whatever they can to help,” he said. “For the six who opposed Walmart, they thought it was good.” The developer said he plans to hold community meetings at the Sylvester Powell Community Center the evening of Oct. 13 and the morning of Oct. 14 to get citizen feedback on what comes next. As for his timetable, Valenti said it depends on his success lining up replacement retail tenants. “I don’t want to come back to the city until we have commitments, not necessarily signed leases, but when I feel comfortable,” he said. The developer still believes Walmart would have been a good anchor for his project, but added he understands people’s misgivings about potential security problems and other issues. “I believe Walmart is a great retailer, the number one in the world, and they produce an incredible amount of sales,” he said. “We would have been able to handle well the concerns about security and cleanliness.” Mission Councilmember Debbie Kring, who has been on the council throughout the period the Mission Gateway has been discussed, said she is confident a new plan will move forward. “I have nothing against Walmart, but based on what’s good for the city, the potential for an alternative to Walmart looks very promising,” she said. “That’s prime real estate between Southern Johnson County and the Plaza, I think our community deserves the best and I’m optimistic.” FROM OUR SPONSORS: Comment Categories : Mission Gateway Previous Post Next Post Comments Comments Related Mission Gateway developer gets earful of suggestions at public meeting Walmart plans ‘significant’ investment in Roeland Park store after scrapping Mission Gateway plan Protest period passes for Mission city council’s rejection of Gateway plan Spotlight on Local The Gail G.

(Press Register) By  Christopher Harress | charress@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on October 03, 2016 at 10:08 AM, updated October 03, 2016 at 9:44 PM Print Email A prominent South Alabama attorney who represents the Mobile County Commission is set to receive upwards of $6 million dollars as part of a land deal that will enable retail colossus Walmart to build a distribution center in Alabama.  James Earl Atchison, 72, who owns and runs a law firm bearing his name, will ultimately receive funds put up by the State of Alabama, the City of Mobile, and the Mobile County Commission. Atchison represents the Mobile County Sheriff's Department and his firm does regular work for the county.   During negotiations to get the deal complete, Atchison dealt directly with President of the County Commission Jerry Carl, whose district encompasses the land in question. In an email to AL.com, Atchison said there was no conflict of interest in receiving funds from the county because of the way the deal was structured. Similarly, Commissioner Carl and the county commission's lawyer, Jay Ross, also told AL.com that there was no conflict of interest. "Atchison was just in the right place at the right time," said Ross, who acknowledged that on the surface the deal might raise some concerns. "But if you peel back the layers, you'll see that there is no wrong doing." Christopher Harress  Carl said the deal to buy Atchison's land is part of a $9 million incentive package to attract Walmart to the county, creating 550 jobs in the process and opening up Mobile's port to an increase in shipping traffic and creating further business opportunities. While Atchison, a private attorney, first began representing the commission around 15 years ago, he is not considered a public employee and doesn't fall under the strict criteria contained in the Alabama Ethics laws. Ordinarily, a public official would have to follow strict criteria to take part in such a deal. Atchison personally represents the Mobile County Sheriff's Department and his firm has performed condemnation work inside Carl's district in the past. Condemnation involves seizing private property for public use. Since 2012, Atchison's firm has been paid more than $170,000 for his and his firm's work with the county, according to county finances. Atchison also made two separate donations totaling $1000 in November to Commissioner Carl's recent reelection campaign, according to state campaign disclosures. Atchison also contributed $1000 to County Sheriff Samuel Martin Cochrane's reelection in May 2014. He did not donate to other commissioner's campaigns. The 400 acres near to Theodore was originally bought at auction by Atchison and his brother Leon in 1988. The land previously belonged to the Frito-Lay snack company, and has since been rented out to a local farmer who grows cotton and peanuts. Once the land deal is complete, the property will first be conveyed from Atchison to the privately-held Chamber of Commerce, which can assign its option to buy to City of Mobile's Industrial Development Board (IDB) and then to Walmart, a transfer that will happen within 10 minutes of one another, according to Ross. Ordinarily, the county commission's Industrial Development Association (IDA) would make such deals, but because Atchison receives monthly payments from the county, the city board was asked to step in. "Normally, since it's in the county, it would have been IDA, just based on the pure location, but we changed it to the IDB to avoid the potential for conflict," said Ross. Conveying the land from Atchison to the Chamber of Commerce and then city board also fulfils criteria set forth by Walmart that insists that the company would not buy land from a private entity for tax reasons, said Ross. As part of Walmart's search to build a distribution center in the South, representatives for the company looked at sites in Georgia, Baldwin County, New Orleans and Mississippi, among others, but were attracted to Mobile, said Carl, because of its port and train routes east and north. "I wanted it in my district," said Carl, who added that he personally knows Atchison and held private negotiations with him to obtain the land. "I knew the caliber of jobs available and I knew had people in my district that could benefit the most." Walmart had initially looked at and rejected around 200 acres of Mobile School Board land because it was too small. It was at this point late last year that Atchison's land came into play. After Walmart representatives told Carl they required a larger parcel of land, he told them "Now, I got the place for you," before pulling out the plans and pointing directly at Atchison's 400 acres of land at the intersection of McDonald Road and I-10, which is also located directly inside Carl's district. However, a representative from Atchison's firm wrote in the email that they believe Walmart found the land independently using Google maps before contacting the Mobile Chamber of Commerce to take the deal forward. The Mobile Chamber of Commerce did not respond to calls from AL.com. As part of the negotiations to convince Atchison to part with the land, Carl said that he told him privately that he could command as much as $21,000 an acre. Atchison eventually settled for $15,000 an acre. He said he did not have a conversation with Carl about the price of the land, but told AL.com in the email that he would "certainly entertain an offer for that amount if the current option is not exercised." A tax assessment conducted by the Mobile County Revenue Commission in 2016 lists the fair market value of Atchison's land at around $1.6 million, or $4,000 an acre, significantly less than the price agreed. But it's well known that the county's Revenue Commission has historically undervalued the true value of land in its records. In addition to Atchison's 400 acres, the deal will include less than half an acre of Mobile School Board land, which will be leased for a period of 99 years and a thin section of land adjacent to where Walmart will build, which was gifted to the project for free by the Archer family. The family agreed to give up the land as they will gain access to a new road that the county will build for Walmart, immediately increasing its value and development potential. Walmart has until Oct. 20 to exercise the option on the land, but Carl believes the deal is as good as done given that Walmart has already paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the crops that currently sit on the land. A quirk in Alabama land law states that land cannot be bought while a farmer's crops occupy it.

One after the other, men in shirtsleeves pulled up in Chevy Suburbans and GMC Yukon XLs and gleaming Lexus RS 300s with leather-trimmed seats, got out, then made their way across the marble lobby and up a flight of stairs. A brightly smiling woman approached them as they congregated around a registration desk. “How are you?” she asked each one. “What’s your first name?” She jotted the letters onto a yellow sticky note and worked her way down the line. “Do you have an appointment? Awesome!” The men were black-car drivers, currently working for the ride-summoning companies Uber or Lyft, or both, and they were there, in all likelihood, because another driver had told them that they could get more money, and better treatment, if they signed up to drive for a new rival, Juno. New York City—which has no shortage of ways to get around, from pedicabs to one of the largest public-transportation systems in the world—is just one stage upon which a handful of companies are fighting to dominate the future of personal transportation. Juno has decided that the most effective way to do that is by being extra-nice to the drivers. After the men registered, they were ushered into a waiting room, where draped café tables had been set up with brochures: “How to Be a 5 Star Juno Driver.” Club music was playing. A handful of young Juno employees glided around, speaking in soothing tones. The drivers were soon called by name—“Khaleed?” “Mamadou?” “Julio?”—and brought into another room, where a Juno manager, Lucas Smith, was waiting for them with a laptop and an overhead projector. “Drive Your Future,” the slogan on the screen urged. A pink-skinned forty-year-old in jeans with a bushy red beard and an intense gaze, Smith joined Juno last January. Like several of his colleagues, he was recruited from Apple’s retail division, where he conducted training sessions for Apple-store employees, based on Apple’s carefully designed protocols. In fact, many details of the drivers’ experience had been modelled on the interactions that customers have when they enter an Apple store, from the “concierges” who greeted them to the low driver-to-employee ratio. At first, Smith was put off by the whiff of exploitation that he detected around rising Silicon Valley enterprises such as Instacart, where people buy your groceries for you, and TaskRabbit, where freelancers can underbid one another to take on errands and other jobs. In middle school, Smith told me, he was assigned a book by Ayn Rand. “I remember finishing it, and realizing that I wanted to be the opposite of everything that was in that book,” he said. “Everything about the celebration of selfishness was just anathema.” So he was initially skeptical about Juno. “I’m a super-progressive, and I have incredibly mixed feelings about the ‘sharing economy’ and companies like Uber,” he said. “Rather than creating wealth, they felt extractive. The kind of thing that happens when there’s a bad job market and people don’t have good choices. I try not to talk about our competitors, particularly, but the contrast for all these drivers is a powerful thing. They feel like they helped build other companies in New York, and, you know, as a reward for that, their rates kept getting lower.” The reference to “other companies in New York”—a.k.a. Uber—isn’t incidental. Juno’s business model is to take what Uber has created and appropriate it. Most of what Juno does is predicated on the fact that many drivers feel mistreated by Uber. (Lyft, for various reasons, seems to be less of a target of driver resentment, and is also a less powerful competitor.) If Uber seems cold and impersonal, Juno will smother its drivers with attention. If Uber has raised its commission—the part of each fare that the company keeps—Juno will set a much lower one. From Uber’s perspective, Juno must seem like a hermit crab, taking up residence in a home built by others. In many cases, Uber paid drivers a thousand-dollar bonus to sign up, and gave a thousand-dollar bounty to the driver who referred them. It helped the drivers get their taxi licenses. It built an app, trained consumers to download and use it, and battled regulators across the country. All Juno has had to do is come up with an app that looks and functions just like Uber’s, and hire people like Lucas Smith to persuade those drivers to defect. It was shortly after 3 P.M., and five men entered the room and sat down in a semicircle. Their cell phones were tucked away in their pockets; Smith had their full attention. “The fact that you’re in this room, well, means that you’re a professional,” Smith said. To have been invited, in fact, all of them had to have an Uber rating higher than 4.65 (or a Lyft rating higher than 4.7). “So I don’t need to talk about the basics. When it comes to what makes Juno different, the biggest thing is our focus. That’s behind everything we do. And that’s that Juno is for drivers.” He paused to fiddle with the lights. “We built this company with the idea that listening to the drivers and building a business that puts drivers first isn’t just the right thing to do—although we think it is—and it doesn’t just mean that we’re nice, although I think we are, but that it’s also good business.” Smith moved through his slides and his talking points. The drivers learned that Juno’s commission was ten per cent, “guaranteed for our first twenty-four months.” (Uber typically charges twenty-five per cent or more.) On a slide titled “Example Fare,” a bar chart showed a comparison between an Uber driver and a Juno driver on a thirty-dollar ride: the Uber driver, after commission and taxes and fees, would keep $19.11, while the Juno driver would get $23.61. “For literally the same amount of work, you’re taking home four dollars more,” Smith said. “And that’s on one ride. Think about it on ten, over twenty.” Juno was also offering twenty-four-hour support for its drivers, with a promise that you could always reach a real person on the phone, “not a robot.” Finally, Juno drivers could earn an ownership stake in the company, in the form of restricted stock units. “I think this is a huge deal,” Smith said. “And it’s totally unique.” To qualify, a driver had to drive for at least a hundred and twenty hours a month—approximately thirty hours a week—for twenty-four months out of thirty. The twist was that Juno was offering to count toward this goal the hours that its drivers were working for Uber and other companies, all of it clocked on their dashboard phones. Half of the two billion founding shares of the company had been set aside for this purpose, although they weren’t going to be worth anything unless Juno was bought out by a larger company or had an I.P.O. Smith went on, “Now, once Juno goes public? And is traded on the stock exchange? You’re an owner. You profit from that. You can sell your shares, you can hang on to them. But you’ll profit from the growth of this company.” There were some murmurs of approval among the drivers. “I’ve got those ‘Don’t worry about me, I’ll just be here, all alone’ blues.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon After the presentation, the drivers stood up and looked around. In a few moments, they would be collected by Juno staff members and given new Android phones with the Juno app, and then escorted to their cars, prepared to take Juno rides right away. One of the drivers, a man with gray hair and glasses, told me that he was already driving for Juno. His name was Salim Sarder, and he was there with a friend who was hearing the pitch for the first time. Sarder said that Juno was more attractive on a ride-by-ride basis, but Uber had a lot more volume to offer. It was hard to toggle back and forth between the two while you were driving around, because if you turned down an Uber pickup to take one from Juno your Uber rating might take a hit. One of the many tyrannies of the sharing economy is the need to always keep your rating up.“That’s the thing right now,” Sarder continued. “You get Juno fare, but Uber gets closer—more people available there, you know?” Successful new technology companies are expected to grow quickly, even as they lose money, and Juno’s expansion is almost entirely dependent on how swiftly it can poach drivers from the competition. The more drivers it has online, the shorter the wait times will be for passengers using the service. The shorter the wait times are—the more “liquidity” there is in the system—the more people will be willing to use it. According to Juno, the company has signed up more than fourteen thousand drivers since December. When I spoke to Juno employees in August, they said that they were getting around a hundred and fifty new drivers ready every day. Later, I asked Smith if he could tell what the biggest attraction was for the new drivers they were seeing. The higher commission was a draw, for sure, but he thought that the stock grants were also a big factor. “Hearing drivers talk about the ownership piece completely changes the equation,” Smith said. “I had one guy say—and this might sound made up—but he said he’s been in this country, I think it was, for thirty-two years, and this was the first time he felt like an American. Now, that was super powerful, but it also made me feel a little bit sad. Because I would hope that there’s more to feeling American than just owning the company.” Juno came about when its four co-founders realized that they had a lot of money and not a lot to do. It was October, 2014, and they had just sold their previous company, Viber, which was a competitor to Skype that allowed people to make calls and send texts by mobile phone for free, to a Japanese Internet company for nine hundred million dollars. The only question was what to embark on next. They were obviously “too young to retire,” in the words of Talmon Marco, Juno’s C.E.O. “It’s going to be really boring,” he said to himself at the time, contemplating a future of leisure at the age of forty-one. “We’re gonna sit by the beach all day?” A slender, soft-spoken Israeli with deep-set eyes and thick eyebrows, Marco serves as the public face of Juno, while his three partners run most of the company’s operations from Tel Aviv. As he described how Juno was conceived, Marco was sitting in the company’s U.S. headquarters, an open-plan space on the forty-seventh floor of 1 World Trade Center, with dazzling views of lower Manhattan and a telescope pointed in the direction of the building next door. Although Polaroids of the staff were pinned up on a wall, implying a goofy, collegial office culture, the place was eerily quiet, which was perhaps appropriate for a company that doesn’t actually make anything and has relatively few employees; the drivers are independent contractors. The only real action took place at one end of the room on a large screen. It showed a map of Manhattan and Brooklyn, on which little car icons crawled around the grid like black carpet beetles. The Juno founders knew that they wanted their new venture to serve consumers directly rather than provide a possibly more urgent but less glamorous behind-the-scenes product. “There’s something fun about building something that real people use,” Marco said. “Building something that you can talk to a regular person about and they will understand what it is that you do. If you do a resource-management-optimization algorithm for the back end of some sort of storage, O.K., fine. Great. Go explain that. ‘Hey, babe, how’s it going? I do research optimization.’ ” They briefly considered the online-lending business, but there was no obvious hole for them to fill. There was a lot of negative press at the time about Uber. There had been accusations of several hit-and-run accidents involving its drivers; lawsuits had been filed over the company’s privacy standards; and Uber and its C.E.O., Travis Kalanick, were fighting with regulators around the world over the company’s aggressive approach to entering new markets. There were complaints about Uber’s “surge” policy of charging more when demand was higher. What really stood out to Marco and his colleagues, though, was how disaffected the company’s drivers seemed to be. After launching, in 2010, and wooing drivers to use its network, Uber started cutting the prices it charged riders in some markets and increasing the commission the company took on each ride. In January, 2014, Uber announced that it was reducing fares in sixteen cities, in some places by as much as thirty-four per cent. Partly, this was an attempt to put taxi companies out of business; even public transportation seemed to be under threat when Uber argued that it could be cheaper for a couple of friends to share an Uber than to ride the bus. The company was also engaged in a price war with Lyft. Many people driving for Uber had acquired new cars and were making car payments out of their Uber earnings; suddenly, their incomes were going down. Uber was increasingly popular, but there was still a sense that the company was at war with its own workforce. None of this put off Silicon Valley venture capitalists and other investors, who viewed the company as the transportation equivalent of Amazon. By 2014, investors were valuing Uber at seventeen billion dollars. Meanwhile, the company was solidifying its reputation as an uncaring employer that was hastening the decline of job security—the downside of the “gig” economy. “Do we have an angle?” Marco and his partners kept asking themselves as they read story after story featuring complaints from Uber’s drivers. “Uber drivers are not happy. Uber drivers are not happy. . . . It was like, hey, you know, there might be an opportunity here. Maybe you can get the drivers to switch to you. At the end of the day, this is a service that’s powered by drivers.” Marco and his partners—Igor Magazinik, the company’s chief technology officer; Ofer Samocha, who runs the company’s servers and infrastructure; and Sunny Marueli, the “chief anarchist” and “super-brilliant guy who can do anything” (Marco’s description)—started surveying the driving-people-around market more closely. Most of the drivers working for Uber were also working for Lyft, as well as for any number of smaller competitors. The drivers seemed to have little loyalty to any one company, and the companies—which weren’t offering them health insurance, or even the promise of work beyond what they were doing for the next ten minutes—had no leverage to demand exclusivity. Marco suggests that Juno was an opportunity to counter an injustice in the world: “As the mantra goes, ‘I was young and I needed the money.’ Well, we weren’t as young, and we did not need the money. We were not struggling to make it happen at any cost. We did not struggle to put food on the table. So we had the luxury of choosing to do something that was socially responsible.” From another perspective, though, Juno was simply targeting what the partners reckoned was Uber’s one vulnerability—what a hacker would call an “exploit.” “Uber has two things,” Marco said. “It treats its employees poorly, that’s not that unique. I’m sure there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies, and on their Web sites you’ll read, ‘Our employees are our asset, yada yada,’ but they still go on food stamps. But here’s the thing. Walmart does not let you build, free of charge, or virtually free of charge, a Walmart next to every one of its Walmarts, and then, as its customers slowly show up, you can start taking Walmart’s employees. Walmart still has to pay their salaries. But over time, when you’re looking at the independent-contractor model, you can independently take joint custody over these workers. That’s a unique, if you wish, weakness, in the sharing economy.” He went on, “Look, the sharing economy is fascinating on one end, but, at the same time, without the proper checks and balances, we’re going back to fifteen-year-old textile workers in Brooklyn working eighteen hours a day. The platform controls you, and there’s always going to be somebody willing to do the same work for a penny less. And that model just squeezes everything out of you, out of the lower class. At least until the point in time when they come with the pitchforks.” The social mission had its limits. As Marco and his colleagues had done with their previous company, they were saving money by situating the bulk of their operations, or at least most of the white-collar jobs, in the repressive post-Soviet state of Belarus. It’s much cheaper to hire computer engineers there than it is in the United States. When I asked Magazinik about this, during a video call to Juno’s seventy-person office in Minsk, he was reluctant to say that lower salaries were the reason they were there. He and the other co-founders are based in Tel Aviv, where they all grew up, he said. “In Israel, it’s much harder to create such a big tech team in such a small time—the competition for talent is really hard,” Magazinik told me. But he also acknowledged that they could hire five engineers in Belarus for the price of one in America. The tech stuff wasn’t Juno’s strategic advantage, anyway. “If I was going to compete with Google, I would compete on privacy,” Arun Sundararajan, a professor at N.Y.U.’s business school and the author of the book “The Sharing Economy,” says. “I can’t compete with them on search-engine quality, because they’ve got all the best algorithms. So I compete on something that they can’t respond to easily. With Uber, it’s not quite as clear-cut, but if you look at all the different dimensions of their execution the driver relationship is the weakest, and it’s not one that they can easily correct.” Driver recruitment, which started last December, proved surprisingly easy. Many drivers congregated online in driver forums and WhatsApp chat rooms, and word of the new company quickly spread. The service launched in April as a “closed beta,” which meant that it was still in a controlled-trial stage. In a few weeks, the volume of drivers interested in joining shot up. “We had bookings months out,” Jonathan McPhee, who runs Juno’s recruitment efforts, said. (He likes the title “people leader.”) “We could barely open up enough bookings to satisfy the demand.” Initially, the company was paying the drivers two hundred dollars to come in and listen to Juno’s presentation, and then fifty dollars a week to keep the app running in their cars. Even though there weren’t really any passengers to pick up yet, Juno was able to gather data about the drivers’ traffic patterns through the Juno mobile devices that tracked their zigs and zags around the city. In May, the company moved into “open beta,” meaning that anyone could download the app and start using it if he or she had been invited by a driver. Since then, the company claims that its wait times in Manhattan have become competitive with Uber’s. McPhee says that a driver will often tell him, “I have so much activity, I don’t even need to turn on my Uber app.” The question, then, is how long Juno can sustain its driver-defection strategy against a competitor as well fortified as Uber. When I spoke with Uber’s head of North American operations, Rachel Holt, she told me that the company’s vision is to be “as reliable as running water everywhere and for everyone.” As it pursues that goal, Uber is watching Juno with defensiveness and skepticism. “I’d be very surprised if a ten-per-cent commission is going to continue for a long time, if ultimately a business is there to be sustainable,” Holt told me, sitting with her arms crossed on a couch in Uber’s sleek, fifty-five-thousand-square-foot offices in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The company had thought about the commission a lot, she said, and the economics just didn’t work. She added that Uber had tried to get permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to give stock options to its drivers, and was told that, as long as the drivers were independent contractors rather than employees, it wasn’t allowed. Indeed, one legal expert I spoke with said that giving restricted stock options to thousands of contractors might pose regulatory problems. “Look, if there’s something we can learn around a different way to approach that, we would love to assess how that works,” Holt said. “If there’s something very compelling in what they’re offering to drivers, we want to continue to learn from that.” Several venture capitalists suggested to me that Uber was now so big and so rich—its estimated worth is close to sixty-eight billion dollars—that it was basically impossible for any new company to dislodge it. In an industry where size and brand recognition are crucial factors, Uber has become a cultural buzzword, conjured by other entrepreneurs pitching their own ideas: the Uber of toothbrush heads, the Uber of car parking, the Uber of pets. Uber is the thing that everyone else wants to emulate, which makes it enormously successful at raising money. The service is available in seventy-two countries, and has raised more than fifteen billion dollars; it is branching out into auto-lending, food-delivery, and courier services. I was repeatedly told that consumers summoning Ubers want their cars to come quickly, and that they don’t really care about the fine print of the drivers’ compensation. Uber had created a kind of moat around itself, and that moat was made of a seemingly limitless supply of investor dollars. Money shielded it from many of the pressures and compromises that a business operating under more normal conditions would face. “It’s a smaller, less destructive nuclear weapon, but it’s also a hat.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon In the first six months of 2016, Uber sustained $1.2 billion in losses, a stunning amount. (Even Amazon never lost as much in so short a time.) In total, according to Bloomberg, the company has lost four billion dollars, almost a quarter of what it has raised from investors. A good chunk of it went into a costly effort to establish itself in China—an effort it recently abandoned. But the company’s ongoing costs are significant. One major expense is bringing drivers into its network, and replacing them when they leave; driving is a “high churn” career. Each time the company goes out to ask for more money, though, investors fight for the opportunity. “With Uber, their disruption was, they really weaponized money,” said Simon Rothman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners, who founded eBay Motors and was an early adviser to Lyft. “Now someone else has to do something equally disruptive, and I don’t know if being nicer and more fair financially with drivers is enough.” Given Uber’s wealth and its backers’ patience, it can subsidize its rides indefinitely. Marco has been meeting with investors—in March, TechCrunch reported that Juno was attempting to raise thirty million dollars—but the funders I spoke with told me that they would not give Juno their money, because its challenges sounded too daunting. By the time the far-off future arrives when investors demand that Uber show an over-all profit, its competitors are likely to have gone out of business. The search for instructive precedents quickly leads to a company called Sidecar, which started in 2011, in San Francisco, as one of the first ride-sharing businesses. Sidecar introduced a number of innovations that were quickly copied by its competitors: having drivers use their own cars; the term “ride-sharing”; giving drivers directions on their smartphones. The company’s co-founder, Sunil Paul, has a patent dating back to 2002 for a technology that seems to underpin the whole industry: a method of sending a signal from a passenger’s cell phone to a central server and then to the closest available driver for a pickup, and of tracking the subsequent ride. Sidecar raised and burned through thirty-nine million dollars, and shut down in 2015; whatever was left was bought by General Motors. “We were the inventors and the innovators,” Paul told me, ruefully. “But it wasn’t enough to overcome the money.” The only companies that could possibly compete with Uber now, he thought, were giants such as Apple and Google. “We got run over by the Uber money truck, in lots of different ways,” Paul said. “I don’t see much hope for a company like Juno, just to be perfectly blunt about it.” After Lucas Smith’s presentation, I joined a Juno specialist named Farhan Noor, who was helping a driver complete the on-boarding process. “This is the driver agreement,” Noor said. “Before we do that, I want to verify your car. We’re driving a 2015?” “It’s a Nissan Pathfinder,” the driver, Jaime Bitar, said. “A Pathfinder, that’s a nice car,” Noor said. Bitar was dressed in a black suit and a patterned tie. He stood in front of a white curtain while Noor took his picture with his iPad. “You should see my Uber photo,” Bitar joked. “I took it in the car.” Noor then pulled accessories out of the kind of black velvet sachet that one might expect to contain a pearl necklace: a ZTE phone, a charging cable, and a dashboard mount. The phone was programmed to display a promotional ad to the passengers in the back of the car: “Save 25% on your next ride. Ask your driver.” This way, while the driver was working for Uber, a customer might ask about the ad, and the driver could send the customer a text message with a link to download the Juno app. (It’s against Taxi & Limousine Commission rules for drivers to solicit their passengers.) Once a new customer took his or her first Juno ride, the driver got a fifteen-dollar bonus. At some point in the future, the likes of Bitar and his Pathfinder may be out of the picture anyway. In 2011, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of the Google X lab, announced at the annual TED conference that self-driving cars would usher in a new world, one where there were no automobile accidents, parking lots, or car-insurance premiums. Since then, a number of major corporations have made serious investments in autonomous vehicles. Nobody knows when such a future might arrive. (Five years? Fifty years? You hear different things.) But everyone in the personal-transportation business is preoccupied with it. In August, Uber revealed that it was going to introduce a small group of self-driving Volvo XC90 S.U.V.s onto the streets of Pittsburgh, although they will still have drivers in the front seat. “I think the opportunity to totally transform the way people transport themselves and goods is just a massive opportunity,” a banking executive who follows Uber closely assured me. “It’s a huge segment of the economy, which is very inefficient. That is why Uber has grown so large so quickly.” He pointed out that Dublin, California, east of Oakland, would be offering taxpayer-subsidized vouchers to its citizens to use on Uber or Lyft rather than spending government money on maintaining some of its public bus lines. “It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when,” Marco said of the driverless era. “With Juno or without Juno, this is going to happen.” He added that with Uber the drivers would just be “deactivated, and thrown away like a used whatever.” Juno might not need them anymore, either, but they’d still have stock ownership in the company. “This is the first time since the industrial revolution when there was a class of workers who are going to have a piece of the future rather than just being laid off,” Marco said. He didn’t mention the prospect that the piece of the future may have no value. A world of driverless cars could pose a far greater threat to Uber than Juno’s kinder-copycat strategy. It could take any number of forms, from a subscription model, where consumers pay an annual fee to have access to an autonomous car whenever they need it, to a system more like Zipcar, where people pay on a per-use basis. Car sharing or fractional ownership could become widespread. Considering the number of possible arrangements, there’s no reason to assume that any of today’s ride-summoning firms will be dominant forces in an era without drivers. There was a time when AOL, the leading service provider in the dial-up era, was expected to own the future of the Internet, just as Blockbuster was expected to dominate video rentals for years to come. When I asked Marco why he was so sure that Juno would still be around, he said, half jokingly, that he had acquired all the wisdom he needed by reading “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” by Douglas Adams. “Oh, my God,” he said. “It’s the Bible. Everything is there.” In the novel, the main character reflects at one point that the earth was pretty much ruined by all the cars. His name is Arthur Dent. One of his non-terrestrial sidekicks calls himself Ford Prefect, having concluded, after visiting earth, that cars were the planet’s dominant life form. But Adams’s unflattering view of automotive transport didn’t seem to be what Marco had in mind. I asked Marco to share what he had learned from the book, and he hesitated. “Now you’re putting me on the spot,” he said. After thinking for a few seconds, he went on, “It claims that the math never works in a restaurant, which explains why the bill never adds up.” He wasn’t sure if that was still true, because, he said, he stopped looking at restaurant checks a long time ago—preëmptively handing your credit card to the server saves the five minutes it takes to get the bill, look at it, and send it back with the payment. “It was a very popular book, especially when I was growing up, among geeks in the eighties and nineties,” Marco went on. “You have to ask the founders of Snapchat.” ♦ Sheelah Kolhatkar joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2016.

That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company’s $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership.

Tony Gutierrez/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Walmart's Black Friday ad is the hottest of the hot. Every year, when Black Friday season starts to heat up, we get comment after comment, email after email, begging for information about Walmart's elusive Black Friday ad. While this frenzy can be fun, the truth is that you don't need the Black Friday circular to plan for your holiday shopping at Walmart. Why? Because the old ads tell us everything we need to know.  When will we see the 2016 Walmart Black Friday ad? I get it, you wanna see what exciting new deals are on sale this year. To figure out when, exactly we're going to see the 2016 ads, let's take a look at Walmart's publication dates from the last few years: 2013: Monday, November 11 2014: Tuesday, November 11 2015: Wednesday, November 11 Walmart is super into 11/11 as an ideal ad release day, but the 11th has been earlier in the week these past few years, not on a Friday as it will be in 2016. The ad probably won't drop on Tuesday the 8th, which is Election Day, but we could see it coming out as early as Wednesday, November 9. If it's not out by then, Friday, November 11th will likely be our lucky day. Make a wish for crazy savings! Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Once the Walmart ad arrives, you'll find it in our  2016 Black Friday Shopping Guide. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 What will Walmart's Black Friday hours be? Walmart has been opening its doors at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day for the past three years, and we expect it to hold with this pattern in 2016. It's interesting to note that, while Black Friday sale start times have been steadily increasing from 2007 on, last year, a few stores, like Staples and Gamestop made a statement by reversing their stance on Thanksgiving Day hours and reverting back to early morning Black Friday bonanza sales. While we don't expect Walmart to do anything this drastic, if they DID, it would be a game changer for the Black Friday industry. We can dream, but the reality is likely going to be a 6 p.m. Thanksgiving sale start time. If you're not feeling the idea of ditching your loving family on Thanksgiving Day and dealing with frantic crowds of deal chasers, you probably won't have to. Last year marked the first time that most of the big box store's doorbuster deals were available online, starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day. We expect to see a similar online sale happening this year, so stay up late while you're marinating the turkey, and hop onto Walmart.com to skip the lines. What should you expect from Walmart Black Friday Doorbusters? Small kitchen electronics for under $10 Walmart always has small kitchen electronics, like a crockpot, a coffee maker, a toaster and a skillet, on sale for under $10. Last year they were going for $9.72, the year before, $9.77, and in 2013, these items were sold for $9.44. We don't expect to see much of a change in price this year, so you'll likely see same stuff on sale for under $10! Chromecasts for $20 or less Last year, the streaming device was on sale for $20, and it was $25 in 2014. As these plugin devices get more and more mainstream, we're expecting to see them at Walmart for $19 this year, if not a little less. Get ready to turn your regular old television into a Smart TV for less than $20. Beats Pill Speakers for $100 Walmart has offered a deal on Beats Pills for the last four years. While last year's deal was $149.99, 2014's Black Friday sale offered them for $99.95. We're guessing Walmart will chop off the extra $50 they added on last year and go back to the $100 mark in 2016. 24-piece Pyrex set for $19 This has been at $19 for the past two years, so we predict we're going to see it back there come Black Friday. Right now it's going for $26.42, which isn't too much more than the Black Friday price. More encore Black Friday Deals at Walmart These are just a few of the deals we expect to see return for Black Friday at Walmart. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list. We've linked to the last three years of Walmart Black Friday ads at the end of this article so you can compare for yourself.

Announced back at Google I/O 2016, the Mi Box is now available on Xiaomi’s official website for — yes, you guessed it — $69… The Mi Box features Android 6.0 Marshmallow, a quad-core ARM processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of expandable (via USB) storage, and an HDMI port which can output 4K video at 60FPS. The box will ship with a slim remote that includes a microphone for voice commands (a la Apple TV) and Xiaomi will also be selling a controller for gaming. Just a few of weeks ago, a report suggested that the box would be coming at some point in October for a price less than $100, and indeed it has. On the box that we saw on the shelf at Walmart last week, we also learned — besides confirming the $69 price point — that the device comes with $76 in offers and a free HDMI cable. Not a bad deal for twice the price of a Chromecast. You can grab the Mi Box on Xiaomi’s site right now, and it ships out on October 6th. Clearly, though, it’s going to be available at a wide variety of retailers soon, so you might be able to grab one quicker if you go check the shelves at your local brick-and-mortar stores (so far, we only know of Walmart).

The company didn’t confirm pricing and availability information about this device back then but recently a Walmart location actually started selling the set-top box even before it was formally released. Xiaomi has formally released the Mi Box in the United States today at an attractive price point of $69. Xiaomi Mi Box is available for purchase starting today for $69 via Mi.com as well as through Walmart. It’s one of the only truly affordable Android TV set-top boxes that are available for purchase right now. It’s a pretty capable set-top box. The Mi Box has support for content streaming in 4K UHD resolution at 60 frames-per-second as well as HDR and DTS/Dolby surround sound. Internal storage is only 8GB but it can easily be expanded externally. The Mi Box is powered by Android TV which means it can run all of the apps and games that are available on the Google Play Store for Android TV. Customers will never be pressed for content or games on Google’s smart TV platform. Customers will receive several incentives for picking up the new Xiaomi product. They will receive $50 in Sling TV credit, a 3 month subscription to Pandora as well as a $5 Vudu credit. The incentives are worth more than the set-top box itself combined so it’s a pretty good deal.

Again, at times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. These stocks rally as soon as the market enters into a correction mode. Here we have discussed one such stock, Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 3.39% and a VGM Score of “A”. Walmart’s stock price history reveals that the company hasn’t been a disappointment in a long time. This is quite prominent from the 20.3% surge in the company’s shares on a year-to-date basis. We believe that this rally has been driven by Walmart’s impressive earnings history and solid growth strategies. Starting with the company’s past performance, we note that it has recorded positive comps at Walmart U.S. for the past eight quarters, after delivering negative comps since the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Traffic improved for seven consecutive quarters, backed by the company’s efforts to modernize its stores to boost traffic. Traffic was also driven by a moderate improvement in consumer spending. Further, Walmart’s efforts to change its stores to suit consumers’ demand helped it attract some shoppers. In fact, the retailer continues to expect positive comps year over year at Wal-Mart U.S. in fiscal 2017. 7 Make-or-Break Earnings Reports Coming in October During the last reported second-quarter fiscal 2017, both its earnings and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues increased 0.5% owing to an improvement in comps, but earnings declined year over year. WALMART STORES Price and Consensus WALMART STORES Price and Consensus | WALMART STORES Quote Despite posting better-than-expected results, we note that Walmart is facing several challenges. The company is exposed to intense competition on all fronts, from dollar stores to traditional grocery store chains and online business. Its international operations are also under pressure with a stronger dollar eating into sales. Walmart also expects to incur huge eCommerce expenses over the near term, as management continues to invest in its eCommerce business. The company’s focus on eCommerce will in turn lower profit margin potential, given the shipping costs and price competition involved in it. Walmart has also pledged to invest worth $2.7 billion on raising employees’ wages and giving them extra training in fiscal 2017. Under the initiative, the company had increased its minimum wage to $9 an hour in April 2015, and to $10 per hour in February 2016. The initiative of paying higher wages is expected to help reduce turnover and increase retention. The company will also improve its customer service and this should ultimately encourage shoppers to spend more. However, it will further raise the expense burden on the retailer. Higher labor costs, along with the company’s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations, will weigh on earnings. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to note that the company is making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence, and thus boost sales. The decision to close 269 small-format Express outlets in Jan 2016 was one such initiative to streamline the chain. The retail giant also aims to expand its online business through acquisitions. Recently, it completed the acquisition of eCommerce company, Jet.com, Inc., which marked a huge step forward in its quest to dominate e-commerce king, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). The company has updated its fiscal 2017 guidance to reflect the acquisition of Jet.com. Wal-Mart now expects its earnings in the range of $4.15−$4.35 per share, up from $4.00−$4.30 expected earlier. Twitter Inc May Actually Get a Deal Done After All (TWTR) Walmart is also in talks to invest in India’s largest eCommerce firm, Flipkart Online Services Pvt. in order to expand in the fast-growing online retail market and grab market share in the country. Apart from acquisitions, Walmart has also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay. This allows shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app. Last month, Wal-Mart inked an agreement with CommerceHub, a leading distributed commerce network for retailers and brands, to expand its existing partnership. Bentonville, AR-based Walmart is also aggressively trying to get a share of online grocery delivery, a booming industry. The largest grocer in the U.S. is already expanding its online order options to offer grocery deliveries within two days for a $49 minimum annual fee through its ShippingPass eCommerce subscription program. The program competes with Amazon’s Prime service, which costs $99 annually. It has also partnered with ride hailing services, Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, it intends to roll out drones in the near term for product deliveries to Wal-Mart facilities as well as to consumer homes. We expect the aforementioned factors to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait-and-watch story. Stocks that Warrant a Look Some better-ranked stocks in the retail sector include Big Lots, Inc. (BIG) and L Brands Inc (LB), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Tully: Did you hear the one about Trump and Clinton? Matthew Tully 4:24 p.m. EDT October 3, 2016 There’s a lot of humor and laughter to be found in this election season. If you’re open to it, that is. And if you’re willing to laugh at both sides of the political aisle. Buy Photo A one-man show titled "Tales from the Cornstalk Ghetto: A Comedy Celebration of the Midwest" starring Scott Long was staged Saturday, August 16, 2014, at ComedySportz as part of the 10th Annual IndyFringe festival. (Photo: Doug McSchooler/for The Star)Buy Photo 111 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Scott Long's job is to find the humor in everything. He goes shopping and comes home laughing about the differences between Wal-Mart and Target. He's raising a daughter with autism and, so, along with the serious moments that he’s added to his comedy act, he finds humor in the beautiful moments that leave a dad and his audience laughing. That's life for a comedian, finding the smiles and absurdities tucked so often into the routine of daily life. Long, a Fishers father of three who tours nationally, has been doing it for more than two decades. He started shortly after graduating from college with a journalism degree at a time when the broader economy was suffering, but stand-up comedy was booming. "My idols were Mike Royko and George Carlin," he said of the trailblazing newspaper columnist and the legendary comedian. "In the end, I decided I had a better chance of becoming Carlin than Royko. I've become neither by the way." Hey, who has? But Long has done the remarkable, carving out a nearly 25-year career in comedy from his Central Indiana base. He spent years writing for Fox's NFL pregame show and comedian Frank Caliendo. And these days, at a time of reshuffling in the comedy club business, he plays a lot of corporate gigs. Talking to a pro like him is a treat; he tosses out sharp and clever lines that remind you of the differences between funny people and true comedic artists. I called Long this past week after reading so many stories about how depressing Americans have found the 2016 presidential election. Headlines have reported Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to be the most unpopular candidates in recorded history. Magazines have produced stories about people suffering from "election anxiety," and the bitter tone on Facebook has most of us looking forward to this whole thing being over. Amid all of that, I thought, I bet Long has found the bright side in this rather joyless campaign season. He definitely has found the jokes. He realized while cooking one day, for instance, that Trump has "hair and skin the same color as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese." He compares Clinton to Bob Dylan: "All the words are great, but I just don't like the voice." He calls Evan Bayh "a male nipple," because "I never know what he does or what his purpose is but it just seems right to have him there." One of his daughters asked earlier this year why everything wasn't free. He laughed, realizing at that moment that “Bernie Sanders has the same economic policies as my 8-year-old daughter." Long might lean left but he sees humor in the left, the right and the middle, and in the spectacle that is politics. Unfortunately, that's a rarity in these increasingly fractured days. "I think people think they want to hear political comedy," he said. "But with everyone so strident they are not willing to laugh at their own side anymore." During a recent Indy Fringe show, he found an audience that loved hearing jokes about the other side but not about their preferred candidates. That type of reaction, and the threat of losing a crowd that's locked hard into a partisan mindset, has convinced many comedians to just drop politics from their acts. Long hasn't dropped it, but he misses the days when all politics was laughable. "I'm going to hit both sides," he said. "To me, the beauty of comedy used to be that comedians were willing to go into a room and take the crowd on. That doesn't happen as much anymore. Comedians are speaking to their crowds these days." He understands, given the tenor of political talk and the constant barrage of scare tactics used in political messaging. The rhetoric is at such a high level, he said, “that people are almost scared to laugh at these things anymore.” As the country has split apart, he added, “it's pushed things to where we have to pick a side. It's affected what news channel you watch and what website you go to for political news, and it's almost reached that point with comedy. You have to pick your team. “Well,” he continued, “I just happen to like some of the players on this team and some on that team. I think this team runs some good plays, and so does that one. What's wrong with that?" Absolutely nothing. Long's advice? Take these elections seriously but remember that America "has survived bad presidents in the past and it will survive bad presidents in the future." He laughed at those who say they'll move to Canada if the wrong candidate is elected. "The only people who say that are people who have never been to Canada,” he joked. “If you'd been there, you'd pick another country." Long said people should watch the debates but also enjoy the absurdity within them. "Debates are funny!" he said. "They are so inauthentic. I think things that are a Kabuki show are hilarious. These aren't debates. It's pro wrestling." I've long argued that our civic discourse would be a whole lot better if we could agree that we are all a little bit crazy, and that there is absurdity and humor to be mined across the ideological, political and cultural spectrum, and definitely from within the various and specific tents under which we all gather. Is there anything more cathartic than laughing at yourself? I'd argue there is not. (Of course, I am a bald redhead and lifelong Cubs fan from Gary, Ind., who writes a newspaper column and watched C-SPAN for fun. So there's plenty of material in my case.) Long is a serious student of politics; he votes for Democratic presidential candidates but considers Indiana's greatest politicians to be Republicans Mitch Daniels and Richard Lugar. He can talk in detail about specific pieces of legislation and he follows campaigns closely. But he said that having a young daughter with autism "has pulled me into a different way of looking at things." For example, he worries more about how people talk about people with disabilities than how they vote. His comedy act has turned into one infused at times with seriousness. But he still finds life funny. And politics? Well, it's a gold mine of humor even if many aren't as willing to laugh at their own side as they once were. "I'm still going to keep talking about politics in my act," he said. "At least every four years. There's just too much material there." We'd all be wise to follow Long's lead. These are serious times and serious elections. But a little more laughter would help us all. You can reach me at matthew.tully@indystar.com or on Twitter: @matthewltully.

In three, maybe four minute bursts of pop music slathered with down-home folk, the Colorado band entertained a full house at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion on Saturday night. And by full, I mean FULL – the ushers, as they do sometimes for the largest shows at the venue, condensed groups who had already claimed chunks of space on the lawn into tighter areas. There’s always an attempt to squeeze a few more bodies into the space. I don’t think this concert sold out on the day it went on sale. I might be wrong about that, but I seem to remember a few tickets floating around. As the date neared, that certainly changed. Tickets were sold at a premium over face value. Social media posts begged for extra tickets. What happened in the space between? Their songs happened. Or, more specifically, their new album, full of a new crop of potential hits, happened. Next at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion Who: Korn and Breaking Benjamin When: 6 p.m. Oct. 15 Where: Arkansas Music Pavilion, Rogers Cost: Starting at $29.50 Tickets: Call 479-443-5600 or visit arkansasmusicpavilion.com for information. We’ve watched this kind of phenomenon before, even from The Lumineers. Two months after their debut album was released, the original trio performed at the Wakarusa festival (R.I.P., Wakarusa). Their set took place early in the afternoon on the small Backwoods Stage, capacity 500 or so. This was far from a coveted spot on the bill. If you count the people hanging around in hammocks barely paying attention to the proceedings onstage, there were maybe 200 people at the show. Maybe. I suspect there were fewer. I have some insight on this because I was one of those lucky few in attendance. The Lumineers mentioned that set last night during their headlining performance at the AMP. They said they were happy to be back in the area. So what happened after that concert? About the same time, radio found their ear-worm of a future hit, “Ho Hey.” It turned into the surprise hit of the summer. The Lumineers suddenly found themselves a hot commodity. Fast forward four years and the 10,000 or so capacity AMP couldn’t contain their fans. Likewise, the new song “Ophelia” gets played every hour on the hour, more or less, on a wide variety of radio format types. Live, The Lumineers stayed mostly true to their studio recordings, making only subtle changes to the formula they’ve made work on two albums. There was a not-so-thinly veiled addition of the phrase “Vote for her” in the song “Big Parade,” a reference to the current national presidential election. Lead singer Wesley Schultz also made reference to the small crowds that so very recently were the norm for the band. Midway through the set, the band left their post for an auxiliary stage built in the center of the venue. They played three songs there. It certainly was exciting for people in the lawn to get a little better look, but it wasn’t a major departure from what the band offered the rest of the evening. There’s a bit of a formula to a Lumineers song – fast strummed guitar, a flourish of tambourine and cello. Schultz led the proceedings, whether with his guitar, charmingly gruff voice or the interludes where he described the background of a few of the songs. Hearing him open up about the songs added some heft into an otherwise light evening, which also featured the band doing an ultra-uptempo version of the already fast Bob Dylan song “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” They may have waited four years between albums, but they didn’t mess around on stage. The band crammed 20 songs into 90 minutes of stage time, assisted by backing musicians and the glow of large chandeliers. They closed the night with the song “Stubborn Love” from their first album. Through being stubborn, The Lumineers have turned themselves into something sturdy, if not flashy, and big, even when they attempt to be small. A note about the openers: Rock band Borns, which carries the name of frontman Garrett Borns, performed in Northwest Arkansas previously as well. The band came early this year to the Springtime of Youth festival, operated by the University of Arkansas and its student-run Headliner Concerts Committee. Borns drew a sizable crowd itself and offered a cover-heavy set including takes on Elton John’s “Bennie and the Jets,” David Bowie’s “Heroes” and Arcade Fire’s “Rebellion (Lies).” He closed with his two biggest originals, “American Money” and raucous “Electric Love,” which was the first moment of rapture for an audience that looked to have many during the evening. Rayland Baxter, from Nashville, had the honor of kicking things off. Baxter and his band sounded like the AM radio-ready tracks of Wilco filtered through the sensibilities of Baxter’s current town. In other words, I liked it. I’ll spend a little more time with his songs in the future.   Discussion Fayetteville Flyer has specific guidelines for commenting.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 3, 2016 at 9:42AM Soaring healthcare premiums are taxing workers, and skyrocketing drug prices are causing financial insecurity for retirees. Is there anything Americans can do to curb their healthcare spending? In this episode of The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes is joined by contributor Todd Campbell to discuss how employees and retirees can lower their healthcare bills. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 28, 2016.  Kristine Harjes: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Sept. 28. I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and calling in to rainy Fool HQ in Alexandria, Va., is Motley Fool healthcare writer, Todd Campbell. Welcome, Todd! Todd Campbell: Hi! I'm calling in from rainy New Hampshire. It's a gloomy, gray day everywhere. Harjes: It is. Before we get into today's show, I wanted to thank today's episode's sponsor. This podcast is brought to you by Pearl Auto, which makes wireless rearview cameras for your car that retrofit around your license plate and sync with your smartphone so that you can drive more safely. Check it out at pearlauto.com/fool, and get free two-day shipping applied at checkout. This product is basically a set of rearview cameras that fit around your license plate, and it syncs with your smartphone. I got to try it out earlier this week on the Foolmobile, which is actually a thing. It was actually really useful. I felt way safer using it. Soon, rearview cameras are actually going to be mandatory on all new cars. But with Pearl Auto, you don't have to buy a whole new car to drive safely. Today, we want to do a very practical episode about how to save money on healthcare costs. It's somewhat of an intersection between personal finance and healthcare. I figured we would start with some general tips on lowering expenses, and then go into talking about some different insurance strategies, whether you're still working or you're retired. Let's start with the most basic question -- why talk about healthcare expenses and saving money there? Campbell: I'm really excited about this show, because I think, we tend to dive into different drugs and medications and the business end of things on this show, and this is an opportunity for us to reach out to our listeners and say, "Listen, we recognize how expensive healthcare is, in terms of insurance, premiums, the cost of care, drugs, etc. We want to make sure we're offering to you whatever tips we can to help you stretch your dollar further, so you don't face issues of financial security once you've reached your golden years." In preparation for this show, I went back and took a look at basic statistics. They're pretty scary, Kristine. Harjes: I bet. What did you find? Campbell: For one, the average person is running into retirement with just barely over $100,000. But averages can be very misleading, because maybe you have very few people with a lot of money, and maybe that's skewing that number higher. You have to remember that a significant percentage of people are heading into retirement with less than $20,000. That's just simply not going to be enough if you suffer an injury, or you face some sort of healthcare crisis, like cancer, for example. If you look at bankruptcy statistics, 3% of all bankruptcies are from cancer alone. But three of five bankruptcies are caused by medical bills. So, Americans are having to pay more and more money every year for healthcare. How do you prepare for that? Harjes: Exactly. One of the things I saw in my research is that the average couple turning 65 today will spend $250,000 on healthcare in their retirement, which sounds like a lot, and it is, but the statistic that startled me even more is that the average person that's 10 years away from retirement will spend an estimated $464,000 on healthcare in retirement. Campbell: Right. We'll talk about this later on, but that doesn't even include long-term care. Harjes: Exactly, yeah. There are so many different things to consider. And while, as you pointed out earlier, a lot of times on this show we talk about blockbuster drugs bringing in so much revenue, we're kind of putting ourselves on the opposite side of the table today, and saying, as a consumer of these potentially very expensive drugs and insurance plans and everything that goes along with healthcare, how can you save more money and hopefully be able to use that money to invest in some of the companies that come up on this show? Getting into the nitty-gritty, the first thing I want to start with is shopping around. This is so important for every single aspect of healthcare. We'll talk later about shopping around for insurance options, but let's start with shopping around for the medications and drugs you need. Campbell: Yeah. People are probably going to be pretty surprised, but there's a very wide range of prices that you can pay for prescription medicine depending on where you get it filled. The price that you might pay at a CVS might be very different, for example, than the price that you could pay or a Costco or a Wal-Mart, depending upon that drug. So, it's very important for consumers to think about what medications they're regularly getting filled, are they generics or brand-name drugs, and if they're generics, especially, make sure you check out those big-box retail stores. Places like Wal-Mart and Target and even some supermarkets have deals where they offer prescriptions for less than $5 on many generic drugs. So, there's some significant savings that can be accomplished that way. There's a website, actually, called GoodRx, which allows you to search by where you live and find out different prices of medications with in your area. That can be helpful as well. Sometimes they have coupons, too, on that site. Harjes: And if you're not taking a brand name, find out if there is a generic. That's step one. Campbell: Yeah, ask the question. If you've been on a certain brand of medication for a long time, there's a potential that there's going to be a generic out there. Harjes: Right, it could have come off patent. Campbell: Yeah. The price savings alone could be tremendous -- 80% to90% for typical generic drugs. If you take a high-cost biologic medicine, too, you may soon be able to request a biosimilar. They're not exact replicas of those brand-name drugs, but they work very similarly to them. The FDA is getting much more willing to approve those drugs. Those could offer savings, too, I think 30% to 40%. Harjes: Right, that's what they're estimating. You mentioned Costco. Before we totally abandon that name, I just found this out -- apparently Costco's pharmacy is open to non-members. Campbell: Anybody can go. Harjes: That is pretty awesome. I know for a fact that most of my family gets their prescription medications from Costco because it is significantly cheaper. And I always thought, it's because they're members. But no, anybody can go in there. Campbell: Yeah, anybody can go in there. Call around, you can reach the pharmacies and say, "I need to get this filled, how much will it cost me?" They'll tell you. There's other things that you can do to reduce your costs of prescription drugs as well. You can get a 90-day prescriptions instead of 30 day prescriptions, which can sometimes save you money on copays. Also, if you're on a plan like mine that maybe doesn't have the best drug coverage, ask your pharmacy how much the cash price is rather than running it through your insurance. You might find that the cash price is cheaper than it would be if you run it through your insurance. I think that's a good pro tip. Harjes: Another thing you can look into is a mail-order pharmacy -- sometimes offer you three-month supplies for the price of one. That can be a pretty big money saver as well.  The next topic I thought we should bring up is preventative care. There are so many free screenings and vaccine and things that you can get through your health plan or work that are so important toward saving you money in the long run. Campbell: Have you gotten your flu shot yet, Kristine? Harjes: I am scheduled to get one in a few weeks. Campbell: Yeah. You can walk right in to your primary care, or a pharmacy, I go to Rite Aid, I sit there for five minutes, they come over and give me the shot, and it doesn't cost me a dime. For me, that keeps me healthy and I'm able to work more. The other part of this is that you don't want to miss days of work because you're not feeling well. So you have preventative care, you can go to your primary care physician and get a checkup every year, you have these different options. One thing I just did recently that I didn't even know about until I asked my doctor was that the local hospital in my area provides, one day per week, a very big discount on getting ultrasounds for your carotid arteries. I have carotid artery disease in my family history, and I was able to go in and get thousands of dollars' worth of testing for $75. So, it does help to talk very openly and honestly with your primary care physician and just ask different questions, what kind of options are out there that could save me money? Harjes: Another thing to look into is your workplace wellness. Forty percent of large employers offer some sort of discount for participating in a workplace wellness program. And it makes sense from the employer's standpoint. Apparently every $1 of workplace wellness program cost saves approximately $3.27 on medical costs. So, it's quite likely that you can get money back through your employer, or you can find things -- I'm actually getting my flu shot through The Motley Fool's annual Wellness Fair. It's a good thing to look into that sort of benefit, and see what's available to you. Campbell: Larger employers will often times do these kinds of things. It's important to make sure you're checking your human resource newsletter to find out what kind of things are available to you and making the most of them. I also don't want to forget, if an emergency strikes that is not a life-threatening emergency, there are more and more options popping up in local communities rather than the emergency room. We have urgent-care centers all over our area, for example. My son actually just fell off his bike and needed some care, and we were able to go in, and in less than an hour and with a $60 co-pay, and make sure he didn't have any broken bones. Harjes: And that would be way cheaper than the hospital, I'm assuming. Campbell: Absolutely. Harjes: Another thing along that vein is to make sure you know which hospitals are in network in case you need to go to a hospital. It's good to have done that research beforehand. Campbell: It gets so confusing. We're going to talk about insurance, and we're moving that way already. There's so many different moving pieces. Having a little bit of education ahead of time can be very helpful, not only for those emergency situations, but even things like lab work, there could be very drastic difference is in terms of how much you're going to have to pay out of pocket depending on whether or not your insurer has a preferred lab that they'd rather you use, and you end up using something else. Harjes: Right. So, let's talk a little bit more about insurance. One of the things you were hinting at is that there's so many moving parts to consider when you look at what you'll actually pay, even with an insurance plan. It's very easy to focus just on your premiums, but there are so many other costs that end up coming out of your pocket. Campbell: Yeah, it's tremendous. I think, most of us tend to look at our healthcare costs, when we're healthy, as simply, "Oh my god, my premiums, I have to pay these monthly premiums," and that's 100% of your focus, how expensive are your premiums. The problem with focusing too much on your premiums is, how does that saying go? A penny wise, a pound foolish? Is that it? Harjes: Sure. Campbell: Yeah, sure. What happens is, you may be saving money on the premium side of things, but if you do end up requiring healthcare, you could end up getting stung by going to the low-premium health plan that ends up having a higher deductible or higher co-pays or higher co-insurance or higher out-of-pocket maximum. Harjes: Yes, that is absolutely true. You mentioned deductibles. This is the amount of money that you have to pay toward your plan, out of pocket, before the plan starts to kick in. There is one really good option for plans that have high deductibles. This is to set up a health savings account, or an HSA. Todd, do you want to talk a little bit about this? Campbell: This is one of the single best money-saving strategies that anybody who has access to a high-deductible plan should take advantage of. HSAs are wonderful. Can you tell I like them? Harjes: Just a little bit. I do, too. They actually are wonderful.  Campbell: They allow you to take pre-tax dollars and set them aside in an account. Oftentimes, you can invest in that account and earn interest on it. So, set it aside in an account, and then use it -- oftentimes they'll issue you a debit card -- to pay for your co-pays, your co-insurance, your dental visits, your vision care, your kids' braces, healthcare costs that you would otherwise be paying for with after-tax dollars. There are some restrictions. HSAs, as we've already said, are only available with high-deductible health insurance plans, which means a lot of people who have employer-sponsored health insurance won't have access to HSAs. You never know until you ask, though. It's very important to take a look and make sure you qualify for an HSA before setting up. Find out if you can, because if you can, it's a great way to sock away thousands of dollars in pre-tax money that can be used to cover healthcare expenses. Harjes: And all of the details on qualification can be found on the IRS website. The important one to note is the deductible number you have to meet. It has to be $1,300 for an individual, or $2,600 for a family. One of the really great things about HSAs is, it's not use-it-or-lose it. Meaning, you put that money in year and year out, and you don't have to use it in a given year. This is important because it directly contrasts to an FSA, which is a flexible spending account. This is also something that goes through your employer, and it's also a good tax-saving mechanism, it's money you contribute pre-tax. And you can use it throughout the year, but you can only really use it in the year that you contributed it. Sometimes you can carry over $500 from one year to the next, but in general, you need to spend it during that year. Campbell: Right. What's great about FSAs, and I love these just as much as HSAs, is that if you don't qualify for a high-deductible plan, you do qualify for a flex spending account. So, you may not be able to contribute to the HSA because your health insurance doesn't qualify, but if you have very good health insurance and a low deductible, then you can do the FSA. In 2017, you can put $2,550 in pre-tax money into this account. If you have a family of four, you may be spending $1,000 alone on just dentist visits. So, there's a pretty good likelihood of being able to use $2,500 in a given year on out-of-pocket expenses that otherwise would be covered by insurance. Harjes: And yet, surveys show that about 80% of employees that have this available to them ignore the benefit. I can sort of see why. It's kind of daunting to put this money in, and if you don't spend it, you lose it. But, if you look at the list of things that count as a qualified healthcare expenditure, you can spend that money on sunscreen, shoe inserts, first aid kits, there are so many thing that, if you actually make it to the end of the year and have too much yet, you can spend that money on useful things. Campbell: Yeah. Also, you have elective procedures. If you have a lot of extra money kicking around at the end of the year with your FSA, you could pull a procedure forward, and maybe take care of that. FSAs are a great way to lower your taxable income, to get a tax benefit, to get a discount on all the healthcare services that you're buying throughout the year. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, that's an extra $100-500 per year in savings, depending on if we're talking about the FSA or HSA. It could be even more. Harjes: Right. And speaking of taxes, you can use some medical expenses to save on taxes. Want to explain how? Campbell: Before I get to that, I don't think we mentioned the HSA contribution limits. The HSA, you can contribute $3,400 in 2017 if you're an individual, $6,750 if you're a family. There's a lot of money that you can sock away in those HSAs. Harjes: Good to know. Campbell: As far as the tax advantages are concerned, it really only comes into play, as far as your medical costs, if you itemize your deductions on your taxes. Many Motley Fool listeners probably do, but nationwide, I think it's one in three that actually itemize. If you do itemize, then if your medical expenses are more than 10% of your adjusted gross income, then you can take a deduction for those expenses. So, make sure you're keeping very close track of what you're spending throughout the course of the year. At the end of the year, you total everything up. The mileage of driving to the doctor, you name it. Total it all up, and see whether or not you qualify for this deduction. If you do, even if you give up a couple thousand dollars, that's extra money that can end up in your pocket rather than in Uncle Sam's. Harjes: This could be a particularly good tip if you are about to retire in that year. If you end up retiring part of the way through the year, you will have lower income for that year as a whole, so you might be able to deduct more of those medical expenses than you otherwise would have been able to. Campbell: Right, think about thinks like joint replacement. You get into your 50s and early 60s, and maybe you're contemplating whether or not you need to have a knee replacement. Maybe it's late in the year and you want to push it off until the year you retire, so you're only showing your Social Security income, and therefore more of it, theoretically, can be deducted. Harjes: Right. Do we want to move on to saving money on healthcare in retirement? Or is there more to say on employer-type coverage? Campbell: There are a couple things, probably, that everybody should know about HSAs before we totally leave them alone. Harjes: You really do love them. Campbell: I do. There are a lot of ways to stash money into these. If you're over 55 years old, you can do a catch-up contribution and throw an additional $1,000 into this plan. You mentioned earlier that it's not use-it-or-lose-it with HSAs. So, you might want to look at it and say, "If I'm going to max out my retirement plan for work, my 401K, for taxes, then why wouldn't I also max out my contribution to the HSA to further lower my tax bill? And then, consider my HSA contributions as a savings account totally for my healthcare?" Because, as we move later into life, we can then tap all that money that's been rolled over to pay for some of these expenses. Harjes: You can't contribute post-Medicare, but you can still use the money. Campbell: Exactly. You will not be able to continue to contribute to the HSA program. There's another pro tip we'll get to in a second on that. But, yeah, you can still tap into it and use that money. You can even use it to pay your Medicare part B and D premiums. Harjes: What was the pro tip you were about to share? Campbell: If you have a spouse who isn't on Medicare -- let's say you had a high-deductible plan and you've been contributing to your HSA all along. You turn 65 and you now qualify for Medicare. Your employer will not be able to make contributions on your behalf to an HSA. However, your spouse could open up your own HSA, as long as they're still covered by that same insurance plan, can contribute the family about to an HSA that's now in their name. And that HSA, with money, could then be used to cover both you, even though you're on Medicare, and your spouse's expenses. Harjes: Which is pretty awesome. We just did an entire show about Medicare. Something that we missed in that show was MediGap. If you're on Medicare, you can consider getting MediGap coverage, which is supplemental insurance to help you pay for some of the expenses that original Medicare does not cover. This would be your co-pays, co-insurance, deductibles. It pretty much gives you a cap on your out-of-pocket maximum spending, which can be enormously comforting. Campbell: Right. I think a lot of people forget that there is no cap to your Medicare spending. Part A, which will cover hospitalizations, after you reach a certain number of days in the hospital, you're going to be on the hook for the cost. Part B, you have to pay 20% co-insurance for Part B coverage after you've met your deductible. And that also is not capped. MediGap plans are great because they help you better understand how much you're spending in any given year on your healthcare. There are 10 different plan types. The most common of those types is Plan F. Plan F is most common because it covers all of the out-of-pocket costs that you might have otherwise been on the hook for in Part A and Part B. The plans aren't necessarily cheap. They're going to run you between $100 and $300 a month. But they will at least allow you to know what your healthcare spending could be in any given year.  Let me give you a real-time example of why that's important. In 2015, my mother was diagnosed surprisingly with a rare form of lymphoma, a fast-moving rare form of lymphoma. She, fortunately, ended up having Medicare and MediGap. Her out-of-pockets were virtually nil. And because you're getting care from Medicare, you can go to any doctor, wherever you want to go, as long as they accept Medicare. So MediGap can provide a very important safety net for a surprise diagnosis. And with 76 million baby boomers getting older every day, the incidence rates of things like Alzheimer's disease and cancer and those kinds of things, the likelihood of getting a diagnosis like that is increasing. Harjes: I think it's really hard for people approaching retirement age to truly estimate their retirement costs. It's tough to look at the numbers and the incidence rates and plan for that properly. I think one of the things that people forget about the most is the cost of long-term care. Seventy percent of people turning 65 this year will require long-term care. Campbell: Long-term care is another way that you can prepare, or at least know what you're spending in any given year. Unfortunately, you have conditions like Alzheimer's that, because we're living longer, more and more millions and millions of people are suffering from. And while we may think that our families are going to take care of us, we have to ask the question, do we really want them to have to do things like bathe us and take care of our bathroom activities and the things of daily life then maybe we won't be able to take care of on our own. The cost of long-term care is very high. Harjes: It's huge. Campbell: If you have an in-home aid, it's going to cost you $3,000 a month. If you have to go into assisted living, it's going to cost even more than that. If, eventually, you end up in a nursing home, it could cost you $7,000 or $8,000 a month for that care. And with retirement savings being so small, I think a lot of people think that Medicare will take care of the cost for them, or that Medicaid will take care of that cost for them. The reality is that Medicare has a very limited amount of care that they will take care of for you, and that Medicaid will force you to draw down all of your assets to about $2,000 -- some states are little bit different -- before you qualify for coverage. And even if you qualify for coverage, Medicaid can go out and attach a lien to your house to recoup the money after you pass away. Harjes: So, you're still worrying about your medical care and your expenses at that point. That's crazy. Campbell: Right. Long-term care is expensive, it's going to cost a few thousand dollars. A pro tip here is to apply for it when you're in your 50s. Very few people, percentage wise, get rejected when they apply for this in their 50s. And once you have it, you can continue to have it. But if you wait until you're 70 and your health isn't good, there's a good likelihood that they won't even underwrite you. Harjes: Right. This has already been a longer episode, so I'm going to close us out soon. Is there anything else we may have missed along the way? Campbell: I'm sure there are. Harjes: That's true. I'll phrase it differently. What's the most important thing we missed? Campbell: I'm hoping that maybe our listeners will reach out to us and maybe tell us some of their money-saving tips for healthcare, and we can put that out there at a later date. I think everybody should always be asking questions about their healthcare. Are these tests necessary? Is this lab work necessary? They should be considering unique provider options. Does it make sense to go to a minute clinic if you're having flu symptoms, rather than my primary care doctor? Should you consider a telehealth visit offered through my insurance company, where my doctor can discuss flu symptoms with me, and maybe you can save some money that way? There are a lot of different considerations and a lot of different tips. I'm sure we've barely scratched the surface. Harjes: Last question for you, Todd, and it might seem like a kind of random one. When's your birthday? Campbell: Dec. 8. Harjes: All right. Listeners, if your birthday is also on Dec. 8, it is a sign that you should review us. Please leave us a rating on iTunes or wherever it is that you listen. It'll take just a few minutes, and it's super helpful. It helps us get some feedback on the show, and it also allows us to reach more and more Foolish investors who can hopefully get tips on saving on their medical bills and all of the other things that we talked about on this show.  One last fun tidbit before we sign off -- if you're interested in punching "Pharma Bro" Martin Shkreli, remember that name, in the face, here is your opportunity. Martin Shkreli tweeted earlier this week that he is auctioning one slap or punch in the face to benefit the surviving family of his former public-relations consultant, who recently passed away. Check out his Twitter page; there's a link on there. This is an actual thing, as far as I can tell. While you're on Twitter, you can follow us, @MFIndustryFocus. As usual, you can email us at industryfocus@fool.com if you have any health pro tips we may have missed. Maybe we can share them on a future show. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

The incident occurred about 2:15 p.m. Sunday outside the Walmart at 3001 N. State Road 7 in Lauderdale Lakes, Broward Sheriff's Ofice spokeswoman Gina Carter said. The shooter drove away from the Walmart parking lot, just south of Oakland Park Boulevard, she said. Police are looking for the shooter, but didn't release any information about the shooter's vehicle. "This is a very shocking incident" where people were doing their shopping, Carter said. Some shoppers whose cars were in the area of the shooting were unable to leave the parking lot. Lee was taken to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale and died about 3 p.m., Carter said. Investigators are piecing together why Lee was shot, whether there a fight and whether the shooter and victim knew each other.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Amy Dickinson October 3 Follow @askingamy Dear Amy: I was sexually assaulted by a man at a party when I was 17. I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-through at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? Stuck at 17 Stuck at 17: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (Rainn.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at (800) 656-4673; they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. Dear Amy: My son recently got married, and although I hosted a nice reception dinner and was appropriately dressed for the wedding, I was not invited to participate in any of the wedding photos. Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests, and it was only afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn’t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom, and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride’s family prior to the wedding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am I wrong? Mother of the Groom Mother of the Groom: Whether your son and his wife were deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless when it came to photos, your reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely justified. They owe you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one, you would accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing to receive this album (an understandable, but not really generous reaction), a gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. Dear Amy: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It worked only for a while but caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper, but better yet: Run! Siri Siri: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis. © 2016 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

(WSVN) - The busy parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Lauderdale Lakes turned into a crime scene after, authorities said, a man was fatally shot, Sunday afternoon. Broward Sheriff’s Office deputies responded to the scene of the shooting, outside the Wal-Mart Supercenter off West Commercial Boulevard and State Road 441, at around 2:15 p.m. Monday morning, homicide detectives identified the victim as 50-year-old Kennedy Lee. Witness Orga Espady said Lee was shot in the head. “I had never seen nothing like that. It was really horrifying,” he said. Lee was transported as a trauma alert to Broward Health Medical Center. Officials said he succumbed to his injuries at around 3 p.m. “Everybody was crying and stuff,” said Espady. Homicide and crime scene detectives interviewed witnesses and searched for clues as they continued to investigate. People simply buying groceries found themselves in the aftermath of the deadly shooting. “I wasn’t expecting anything at this Wal-Mart,” said area resident James Walker. “Very surprising, very shocking.” Officials said Lee’s relationship to the shooter is unknown at this time. “We’re not sure why this man was shot. We’re not sure if they had an altercation, or if they even knew each other,” said BSO spokesperson Gina Carter. “Right now, it really is a bit of a mystery, and detectives are working hard to unravel it.” It is unclear whether there is surveillance video of the shooting. No one has been apprehended. If you have any information on this shooting, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward. Copyright 2016 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

Photo: Mint Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. lost $4.4 billion in market capitalization after it disclosed a corruption probe and the resignation of one of its senior-most executives. “The company is conducting an internal investigation into whether certain payments relating to facilities in India were made improperly and in possible violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other applicable laws,” it said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cognizant also announced the resignation of Gordon Coburn, who was effectively the second-in-command at the company. The two announcements coming together was clearly too much for investors to handle. Cognizant’s shares fell as much as 13.3% on the back of fears that Coburn’s resignation could be because the scale of the improper payments was significant. According to an analyst, the uncertainty and the lack of clarity is making investors jittery. If government agencies find wrongdoing, there could be a fine in store. Besides, the company may lose business because of reputational issues. About a year ago, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the US government found Wal-Mart Stores Inc. paid bribes worth millions of dollars to local officials in India. Click here for enlarge The US agencies probing the company haven’t announced a fine or a settlement yet, but Wal-Mart has spent hundreds of millions of dollars so far investigating the possible payment of foreign bribes. The largest FCPA enforcement action, so far, was in the case of Siemens AG, which paid $350 million in disgorgement to settle SEC’s charges, and a $450 million fine to the US department of justice (DoJ) to settle criminal charges. In 2014, Alstom SA pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $772 million to end an investigation by DoJ. Of course, the eventual fine or settlement fees will depend on the quantum of improper payments, if any, made by Cognizant, and the extent to which it profited from these payments. Thanks to Coburn’s resignation, speculation about how severe the hit can be are running wild. Cognizant is already grappling with a slowdown in growth rates; it brought down its revenue growth guidance for 2016 in August, and now expects revenue growth to be in single digits. Since then, commentary by other IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd suggests things have deteriorated. As such, the timing of the corruption probe couldn’t be worse. Cognizant shares have fallen nearly 25% from end-March levels, owing to the twin impact of the business slowdown and legal uncertainty.

Once they “adopt” their platoon they will begin collecting items to send to them. The collection drive will be Saturday, Oct. 8, and Sunday, Oct. 9, at various locations, including Henry Dollar General, Princeton Walmart and Chillicothe Kroger. They will be accepting items as well as cash donations. A grocery list of items requested by the platoon will be available at each location to make shopping easier. The cash donations will go toward shipping the items which currently costs $16.75 for a large flat rate box. The goal is to ship as many boxes and there are members in the “adopted” troop. So if there are 50 members in the troop the goal is to ship 50 boxes. The boxes will be shipped by Monday, Oct. 17; as a result all donations must be received by Friday, Oct. 14. The public is invited to join HSHS FBLA in showing gratitude to the deployed men and women by making a donation at one of the above locations or by contacting Rita Self at 309-364-2829. If a group or organization would also like to adopt a platoon contact Amanda Kerns at kerns101@gmail.com for more information.

Just consider the breakout success of Pokémon Go, a virtual reality game that requires users to turn on location services to play. Nothing more clearly shows how important location can be to app user engagement. Critical Need for Accurate Location Services Pokémon Go players walk around real-life neighborhoods to hunt down virtual Pokémon characters on their smartphone screens —even helping local shops and restaurants attract new customers off the street with certain in-app features. The requirement for this level of precision makes it clear that accurate location services are critical to the success of today’s apps. According to my own company's research, 83 percent of app users say location is crucial to their app experiences. And yet users have failed to activate location services for more than half of location-dependent app they say they use, including weather and navigation. This may be largely due to a few persistent myths that cause users to avoid turning location services on, even though it reduces the effectiveness of apps that rely on accurate location data. 4 Common Myths & Misconceptions So why the resistance to location services? The reluctance can be traced to four common myths and misconceptions. 1. Location data is unhelpful App publishers need to do a better job of using location data and proving the value of location services. Location-based context can enhance app user experience (UX) with in-app modes to anticipate what users will need at a time and specific location. These sort of dynamic experiences go beyond just Pokémon Go — retail apps like Walmart, low gas price finding app Gasbuddy and even Snapchat all make use of location-based features to benefit their users. In addition to informing several other user engagement aspects, such as sending coupons when a user is near a certain coffee shop or clothing store, location data can help inform user experience design. When it comes to app design, developers must keep in mind what users will be doing in specific use cases — which means product visionaries need in-depth insight into where users go and why they go to those places. Being able to analyze and categorize the frequency in which their user base goes to a place or types of places allows designers and developers to better anticipate the needs of each user. Accurate location data can help make experiences super relevant in all aspects of usage. 2. Location services are always on Many smartphones users believe that their devices are tracking their location without their consent or knowledge. The truth is that no matter what operating system is being used, both iOS and Android systems prompt users repeatedly about allowing the device to use their location — and both platforms allow users to turn off location services entirely. When users turn off location services, they lose the benefit of adding contextual understanding to their experience. 3. Location data infringes on user privacy Many users turn off location services because they are concerned about their privacy. Many see the sharing of their location data as a way for advertisers to get a hold of their personal data. The truth is that publishers don’t need to violate consumers’ privacy or give away user information to increase the value of ad inventory and deliver relevant content. Publishers have the ability to build contextual, anonymous personas of their audience based on their real-world activities, all using location data that’s been volunteered by users. These personas can combine demographic data — like income level, education, gender, age and ethnicity — with behavioral patterns based on where users go and when. 4. Location services cause severe battery drainage Our research shows more than half of the nearly 20 percent of app users who turn off location services do so because of battery consumption concerns. Pokémon Go is one such game that’s come under fire for draining batteries due to the nearly constant requests to GPS hardware. Companies are experimenting with new ways of minimizing battery drain without sacrificing the location-based functionality they need. Basic battery-minimizing tactics include leveraging signal strength and other sensor information to determine when a device is stationary, helping to limit unnecessary location requests. More complex approaches include calculating the approximate distance to an area of interest to adjust the frequency of location requests, caching data locally to limit network transmission costs, or manually adjusting the appropriate location manager(s) (and thus hardware) based on a given use case.  Balancing Power Consumption, Location Accuracy The best location services combine many different techniques to provide the appropriate level of precision and power consumption for the use case. Whatever the use may be, being clear about what the app needs to accomplish at a given moment should drive location providers to give the best functionality for battery efficiency. Location services are becoming essential to both consumers and app publishers, and these myths should not stop users from turning location services on. With this data, apps become much more useful, as they can utilize location to send out reminders, share deals or pull up relevant app features. In addition, app publishers need to ensure that they are pushing relevant and targeted information to users so they better understand the value location adds to their experience.

Arturo Garcia Oct 03, 2016 Share - - Claim: A law student named John J. Wall penned a "divorce letter" to the U.S. UNPROVEN Example: [Collected via Facebook, October 2016] Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists, Obama supporters, et al: We have stuck together since the late 1950's, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has run its course. Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile, slate it up to irreconcilable differences, and go on our own ways. Here is a model dissolution agreement: Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes. We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them. You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military. You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell. We'll keep the capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street. You can have your beloved homeless, homeboys, hippies, and illegal aliens. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's, and rednecks. We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood . You can make nice with Iran , Palestine , and France and we'll retain the right t o invade and hammer places that threaten us. You can have the peaceniks and war protestors. When our allies or way of life are under assault, we'll provide them job security. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian Values. You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, and Shirley McClain. You can have the U.N. But we will no longer be paying the bill. We'll keep the SUV's, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. You can give everyone healthcare, if you can find any practicing doctors (that is practicing, Howard Dean) who will follow to your turf (sic). We'll continue to believe healthcare is a luxury and not a right. We'll keep The Battle Hymn of the Republic and The National Anthem. I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute Imagine, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing, Kum Ba Ya or We Are the World. We'll practice trickle down economics and you can give trickle up poverty its best shot. Since it often so offends you we'll keep our History, our Name, and our Flag. Would you agree to this? If so please pass it along to other likeminded patriots and if you do not agree just hit delete and hang on. In the spirit of friendly parting, I'll bet you ANWAR on who will need whose help in 15 years. Sincerely, John J. Wall Law Student and an American P.S. Please take Barbra Streisand too. Origin:In February 2009, a "Minuteman message board" operated by the right-wing website Renew America published what it called a "Letter from a Law Student" proposing a "model dissolution agreement" between — as it said — "American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists, Obama supporters" and the rest of the country. The "agreement" was also partially reposted at the Patriot Action Network, dated 30 November 1999 (which, of course, predates President Barack Obama's election by nine years). There is also a version posted on Scribd calling Wall's proposal a "separation proposal letter." A month after its 2009 appearance, conservative radio host Neal Boortz featured Wall's letter on his web site, but the end of the op-ed was changed to: "You can also have Barbara Streisand and Jane Fonda." The letter has also generated attention from liberal websites: In June 2009, Democratic Underground featured it in a thread, calling it a "piece of shit."  A year later, liberal blogger Rich Merritt posted what he called a "Patriotic Rebuttal" to the piece, which reads in part: Listen, you are the one who married up, my dear. We are California, the Pacific Northwest, Hawai’i, most of the Midwest, Florida, the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Without us you are Mexico’s ugly step-sister to the north.

(Courtesy of NJSP) HOWELL — Police are asking the public to help them identify two suspects who allegedly purchased more than $1,000 worth of candy bars, Gatorade and fast food with gift cards bought with stolen identities.

Now, a few residents have come up with a plan they call Market Boxx. It would not only bring fresh produce to more people, but also create entrepreneurs, starting in the Sherman Park neighborhood. The project has gotten new energy, since the police killing there of Sylville Smith and the subsequent protests. Naurice Fitzgerald never thought he’d find himself laying a vinyl floor. But on the day we met, that’s exactly what he was doing. The 21-year old is part of a team building a Market Boxx Community store. Naurice Fitzgerald says he sees himself owning several Market Boxx Community Stores in the future Credit LaToya Dennis Picture a small shed on wheels with windows and vinyl siding. Inside there’s not much space to move around, but when it’s done, the small mobile store will sell deli items along with fresh fruit and vegetables. Right now, Fitzgerald says he has a new level of respect for people in the building trades. “It’s easier said and done with a blueprint, you wouldn’t think that. But once you get to doing it yourself, it’s way harder,” he says. Market Boxx Community Stores have been in the works for years, but Fitzgerald is new to the team. “I want to be able to say I helped build this and I had a part in this because it’s going to go somewhere,” he says. Now before we go any further, I should offer up the back story on Fitzgerald. After talking with him for a while, he mentioned that he was good friends with Sylville Smith, the black man a Milwaukee officer shot and killed in August, sparking two days of unrest. It happened less than a half mile from here. “I was really close to him. I was with him the day before he got killed and the day before that because it was my birthday,” Fitzgerald says. Fitzgerald had also been looking for work, but couldn’t find it. “Like just all types of jobs. Temp services, Walmart, pizza places, all types of places but you know, sometimes they don’t call back. Even when they say they hiring so bad, they still don’t call back,” he says. But since his friend died, Fitzgerald says he’s been taking a more active role in his life starting with Market Boxx. “When I came into this and just started putting my all into it, I see progress in it, and I see like I can build something like this and then from it and experience it and end up owing my own, in a couple months probably. It’s a lot of [independence] and it’s worth it,” he says. Jay Holmes is one of the founders of Market Boxx Community Stores. “Entrepreneurs aren’t limited by anything but their own talent and tenacity. Even at the best job, there tends to be these glass ceilings,” he says. Holmes is helping build this facility, while teaching the others. "We want to catch our young adults at that age and give them a chance to do anything." “We have designs and blue prints for carts in different businesses that we need in our community. And we work with community organizations and entrepreneurs to build those carts. Some will qualify for grants, some will have the skill to build their own cart. We help facilitate that and we connect you with your suppliers, and that’s how Market Boxx works,” he says. Holmes and Fitzgerald met while out protesting Sylville Smith’s death. Holmes says he’s been targeting adults between the ages of 18 and 24 to help build the first small store and teach them about business ownership. “It’s an age where most people still understand that they can do anything. And we want to catch our young adults at that age and give them a chance to do anything,” Holmes says. Holmes says Market Boxx is about building all-around stronger and healthier communities. “People need better access to fresh affordable food and because we can focus the communities earning power and dollars into things that help make us healthy and also help create jobs in our own community,” he says. Holmes says that while the team is still working to get its first store up and running, people around the city have expressed an interest in bringing Market Boxx to their neighborhoods. For volunteer Naurice Fitzgerald, he says the possibilities have changed the way he sees his life unfolding. “You know, I thought I’d just be working a job, get a family. You know being a solo person, not really talking to people. Now I look at it like I’ll be an aspect in the community like bro helped build something. Or bro really loved black people, he cares, he cares for the community,” Fitzgerald says. Organizers hope to launch the first Market Boxx store in Sherman Park within the next few weeks.

Does Etsy's artificial intelligence acquisition make sense? It might actually make a great deal of sense, considering what Etsy is trying to accomplish. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Oct 3, 2016 at 12:46PM On Sept. 19, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) announced it had acquired private analytics and AI company Blackbird Technologies to enhance its search capabilities. Since Etsy is an online retailer of rare products and handmade crafts, though, some might question the prudence of its purchase. Details of the transaction Etsy bought Blackbird Technologies for an undisclosed sum of money. What we do know is what the company gets in the exchange: Blackbird's analytics engine that analyzes shoppers' behavior to predict and suggest personalized search results, image recognition and cataloguing to enhance user searches, and spelling correction and predictive type to speed up the search process. In addition to the technology, the techie team at Blackbird will also be joining Etsy, including the two company co-founders. Etsy believes that the team and the technology they have developed will eventually be used in other areas of business outside of search. For example, the AI could be applied to Etsy's seller services program, which at last report accounted for 58% of the online marketplace's revenue. Image source: Etsy. How the deal complements Etsy's strategy Etsy's buyer and seller community has grown to have 40 million unique item listings for sale. On the buyer side, the company says users go to the site to find products that they can't find anywhere else. This unique market gives the online merchant a leg up on competition that competes on lowest price and fastest shipping. The company hopes this personalized and more human approach helps Etsy -- and the sellers who use the service -- stand out from other online sellers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and traditional retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). While the Etsy strategy in the past has been helping small craftworkers and vintage collectors connect with consumers, the company has transitioned into making the shopping experience as simple as possible. One of the ways they've done this is by optimizing the site for both desktop and mobile users. They've seen better sale conversion rates as a result. As the company's community has grown, though, searching for that unique item or artist who can make it has become a more daunting task. The marketplace has also expanded beyond the borders of the U.S., making the search that much more cumbersome. This is where the Blackbird AI comes in. For example, during the last conference call before the Blackbird Technology announcement, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson talked about enhancements around search capabilities to drive growth. These enhancements were aimed at raising awareness of the site as a go-to destination for consumer needs, helping active buyers filter through the millions of unique listings, and encouraging the 53% of buyers who made only one purchase during 2015 to come back to the site again. Viewed in this light, the purchase of Blackbird Technologies makes sense. With Etsy's goal of helping people rethink global commerce and emphasis on selling unique items to help people express their individuality, the artificial intelligence capabilities complement what the boutique vendor is aiming for. Was the purchase worth it? Even though we don't know the specifics on how the buyout was made, Etsy's AI addition looks like it could be worth it. The online marketplace's revenue is up 39% year to date over 2015, totaling $167.2 million. And while the company is not yet profitable, it is nearing that mark, with year-to-date losses slimming down to $6.1 million at last report. Helping a growing base of users search through a massive library of products is a logical step to continued sales and bottom-line growth. Deal specifics unknown, one could still argue that Etsy didn't splurge or try to go too big. Blackbird is a new start-up, with the company's LinkedIn page claiming 11 to 50 employees and only eight employee profiles showing up in search. The ultimate test, though, will be to see if the addition helps the company convert "window shoppers" into new paying customers in the quarters ahead. Given the Etsy strategy, it probably will help.

Oliver said that Trump really displayed his "winning temperament" by insisting he won when he didn't. "The clear problem with online polls is that you can vote anonymously as many times as you want," said the Last Week Tonight host. He pointed out that it's how "Boaty McBoatface" won in a British "Name Our Ship" poll and how Pitbull ended up performing at an Alaskan Walmart. "Yet, Trump kept citing these nonsense polls," Oliver added. The host then turned to Trump's treatment of Machado, who he has continued to attack since Clinton brought her up at the debate. He characterized the flurry of tweets Trump sent early Friday morning, including calling for people to look at an alleged sex tape of Machado's, as an "online meltdown." "That is a candidate for President of the United States urging America to check out a sex tape," said Oliver. Read more: Donald Trump Goes on Twitter Rant Against Alicia Machado: "Check Out Sex Tape" "Just do me a favor, look up into the sky right now. Higher, no, higher still. Do you see that? Way up there? Way up above the clouds? That's rock bottom. And we are currently way down here," he said. Oliver then aired old footage of Trump and Machado doing an interview at the end of her reign, in which Trump asked people to vote on an online poll on whether a beauty pageant winner should be required to stay the same weight. "It seems you have a choice," said Oliver, addressing Trump. "Either admit unscientific polling is bullshit or that your views on women's bodies are horrifying."

(NASDAQ: AMZN), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Regan placed an order at all three retailers for an identical set of eight different goods. Among the products ordered included diapers, toilet paper, pillow cases and other basic household goods. All the orders were shipped through a standard delivery method and no special or tiered membership (such as Amazon Prime) was used. The orders were then shipped to four different cities across the US, including Dayton, Ohio; Rockville, Maryland; Lincoln, Nebraska and San Francisco, California. Speed The first criteria observed as speed of delivery. In this case, Target was the "clear winner" having delivered nearly half of all items by day two. By day seven, Target had delivered 100 percent of the items compared to Amazon and Wal-Mart who lagged behind at just 75 percent. Related Link: Amazon Is Taking Over The Market, One Sector At A Time Cost The second criteria being evaluated was cost, excluding taxes which varies by state. Wal-Mart was the "clear winner" as its orders were the least expensive in all four cities and came with free shipping since each order was more than $50. Accuracy Third criteria was accuracy and Target came ahead over its other peers yet again. There were zero mistakes in any of the orders placed with Target while orders placed elsewhere were delivered with errors. Finally, Walmart took the top spot in communication and tracking from order placement through delivery. Wal-Mart's email confirmation and delivery notice was the "clearest" and easiest to read. Bottom line, Reagan ranked Amazon third, Wal-Mart second and Target first although "by a hair."

Over the last two decades, support of this ideology has gained little for citizens of Senate District 28, as well as unremarkable political tenures or sadly blackened legacies for our elected officials. Five regional editorial boards cast dark aspersions on Senator and Representative Whitsett for their election maneuverings that included collusion with political aspirants Dennis Linthicum and E. Werner Reschke. Winston Churchill said, “ If you have character, nothing else matters. If you don’t have character, nothing else matters.” Todd Kepple is a man of character. Let’s send him to Salem.

Exclusive: Cowboys Dez Bryant Blasts ESPN's Schefter, Denies Absenteeism Charge - Full Audio Mike Fisher 10/03/2016 / Originally published onCowboysHQ Exclusive: Cowboys Dez Bryant Blasts ESPN's Schefter, Denies Absenteeism Charge - Full Audio SAN JOSE - Dallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant is putting ESPN and reporter Adam Schefter on blast after a weekend report that suggests Bryant is so "irresponsible" that he may have missed 40 meetings during his time with the team. "When I heard that," Bryant said to me in a lengthy one-on-one interview following Sunday's 24-17 Cowboys win at San Francisco, "I was like, 'C'mon, what are you taking about? When I first got here? ... I mean, '40 meetings'? "Certain people in the media want to make me look bad. 'We've got to find something to make him look horrible.' "It's total (BS). ... it's like I'm 'America's Most Hated.'" Bryant didn't play in Sunday's 24-17 win at San Francisco due to a knee injury that he feared at the start of the week was so severe that, out of frustration, he missed a handful of appointments and meetings. (Courtesy of 105.3 The Fan, the full NSFW audio of my visit with Bryant -- again, unfiltered and unedited -- is here.) "I did the wrong thing, and I accepted my punishment (from the team) like a man," he said. (See extensive coverage of Dez' week, featuring more 1-on-1's with him, here.) "This was a poor-ass decision. And I've had my issues before ... But) I'm talking  (about the charge of rampant absenteeism) in general. No. that's not true. ... I give my life to this. I give my heart to this. This is my everything. "I know these younger guys look at me. I like to come to work just because of them. My teammates love me, and I love them. We have fun each and every day. That's what we do." But Bryant does not consider it "fun" to be -- in his view -- targeted this way by media members who do not know or understand him. He made a point to me to note his difficult upbringing and what he's overcome to become an NFL star. It still bothers him that some critics thought the seven-year vet and two-time Pro Bowler would "wash out of the league in three years" and it still bothers him that Schefter is among the media members who insisted in 2014 that there was a violent Wal-Mart parking lot video featuring Bryant.  Schefter actually said "yeah'' when asked if he knew what was shown on the video, a follow-up to Mike Florio triggering the controversy in February 2015 by irresponsibly telling "Shan & RJ'' on 105.3 The Fan that it was "five times worse'' than the horrific Ray Rice video. Here at CowboysHQ.com it came to be known as "The Dez Wal-Mart Unicorn Video" because of the mythically unproven tales about it. Schefter (who we have attempted to reach for comment) is similarly cloudy in this report already being labeled the  "40 missed meetings" story. Schefter seemingly mashes together every time in the last seven years Bryant has missed a team meeting, missed an appointment (such as the MRI he skipped last week) and maybe missed any other scheduled event, while also counting (with the same weight) any time Bryant has allegedly been in attendance but tardy for a meeting, an appointment and an event. The accusation is further muddled by Schefter suggesting that it might be 40 slip-ups ... or an alleged "20 to 40" such occurrences. Bryant, always brutally honest in my dealings with him, denies everything about this volume of numbers. He denies the general allegations. And while Cowboys owner Jerry Jones last night noted that Dez "is a team player ... enough to give him the (five-year, $70-million) contract I gave him'' while conceding that "since the beginning of time, meetings and the timeliness of his meetings have been his No. 1 issues," Bryant does not think what I call "Dez Time" is a headline-worthy issue. "I'm going to stay being true and I'm going to stay being me," Bryant told me. "I give my whole heart to this team. I refuse to let any of the noise really get into my brain. To me, it's just bullshit."   null   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Lawson Chasing Auburn Sack Record Vikings near full participation at practice HD ONLY: WHAT'S NEEDED TO SAVE STRONG'S JOB?

Road plan is too big and costly To the editor: I have lived on Dalton Division Road for 30 years. My wife and I raised three children living on this road. When we first moved here the street was for the most part a rural country road with a combination of nicely kept homes and farmland. The traffic consisted of a half hour of South County GE commuters in the morning and then again in the late afternoon, other than that there was little traffic. As time marches on and development happens, traffic began to increase , Walmart, Home Depot, BJ'S, Silver Maple Farms all added to the burden of increased traffic for those of us that have our homes on the street. It became more difficult to get out of our driveway so we coped and installed a turnaround off our driveway. As the traffic increased and now our grandchildren come to visit my wife and I had often commented that it would be great to have a sidewalk in front of the house, so when we heard there was a plan in the works to add sidewalks we were intrigued. I attended the public meeting in Dalton anticipating supporting this initiative, but upon arriving I was handed a packet of the proposed conceptual design options and almost fell over. The design options that were presented are driven by federal and state regulations because federal regulations must be followed to receive this "free money." (The grant is still taxpayer money.) We were told that the grant was for $10 million and that the project will likely be between five years and as many as 15 years in the future. We were told that the only cost to Dalton taxpayers would be the cost of the design, $700,000. The conceptual designs would make Dalton Division Road more closely resemble Dalton Avenue than the residential street that it has always been. This is a prime example of what happens when government is driving the bus. Bigger is better. If a sidewalk is needed require it on both sides of the road. Simply ridiculous! Add bicycle lanes in both directions because a tiny portion of the population want to ride their bikes on the road, adding millions of dollars in cost to the project. Ridiculous! To the taxpayers of Dalton, beware, as this project will not cost $10 million it will cost $15 million or more. Will the grant money cover the increased cost? Not likely — the taxpayers will pick up the tab. You are already on the hook for the design cost of $700,000, and mark my words, this will balloon to 1.5 million or more that you will have to pay. This project needs to be scaled back. Rebuild the road, install granite curbing and a sidewalk on one side of the road with several crosswalks, and enforce speed limits. The only solace I will have if this project goes through is that it will be the poor Dalton taxpayers on the hook paying for this equivalent of an $800.00 hammer. James A.

However, given Japan’s aging population and lackluster economy, Rakuten needs to expand outside Japan, says Hiroshi Mikitani, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. In a bid to become a global tech giant on the scale of Amazon.com Inc. or China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the company has bought a series of U.S. startups, including shopping-rewards company Ebates, and has invested in others, such as Lyft and Pinterest. But to expand globally, Rakuten will need to internationalize its internal culture. So in 2011, Rakuten instituted English as the company’s official language, requiring all employees to use it in all conversations and written communications. Last year the company opened a sprawling Tokyo headquarters with amenities to rival a large Silicon Valley tech campus.

Mr. Mikitani spoke with The Wall Street Journal about changes the company has adopted to make Rakuten more attractive to foreign job candidates. Here are edited excerpts: WSJ: In 2011 you began a process to make English Rakuten’s official language. Why was this important? MR. MIKITANI: The Japanese consumer market is definitely not going to grow exponentially, because of the aging population. To grow, we need to go outside Japan. To do that, we need talented, non-Japanese people, and we need to have a standard of communication, which is spoken English. Therefore, the Japanese staff needs to be able to communicate in English so that we don't alienate non-Japanese speakers. And it is working extremely well. Already, close to 40% of our engineers in Japan are non-Japanese. We are hiring from all over the world. Now our e-commerce team can speak with our Ebates team without any trouble. Five years ago, it was almost impossible. We needed to have a translator. WSJ: What was most difficult about the process? MR. MIKITANI: Well, we are talking about suddenly forcing 8,000 Japanese people to study English. They are not students. Some people are close to the age of 60. But I respect that they worked really, really hard. I didn’t want to have a line running through the company dividing the English speakers from the non-English speakers, saying, here are the people who can do business in Japanese, and here are the people who can do business in English. And this isn't just for Rakuten: If we can successfully implement this, we will be able to influence Japanese society. WSJ: Was there any attrition among employees unable to meet the requirement? MR. MIKITANI: Our vision was to extend our hands and try to help as much as we can. So, to some employees, we said: “OK, you don’t need to work in the morning. You can study English in the morning and start working at noon.” There was a very small fraction of people who couldn’t make it and gave up. WSJ: You’ve said that you want to turn Tokyo into the Silicon Valley of Asia, and you’ve built a headquarters outside the city in the style of a Silicon Valley campus. Why was that important? Previously in C-Suite Strategies Make Pay Transparency Work Dress for Success, Be a Success? The Price Assertive Women Pay Avoid Common Merger Mistakes How Not to Flunk at Failure MR. MIKITANI: I did not really imitate the campus of Google or Facebook. I just wanted to make it very open, and make it really comfortable for our staff to be there and be creative. Of course, I took some ideas from the offices of internet companies over here. Our office is probably more open than any of the offices [of other Japanese internet companies] here, and we try to be as nice to our employees as possible. We built a day-care center, an acupuncture center. We offer breakfast, lunch, dinner free. This is the way to attract people. One thing we did a little bit differently from other internet companies in Japan is we selected a location that isn't too distant from the center of Tokyo, but is still residential, so that our staff can live close by. WSJ: You’ve made investments and acquisitions in companies ranging from Lyft to Pinterest to messaging app Vibercq to news platform Ripple. What guides your strategy? MR. MIKITANI: It’s all about data. Lyft is just one of our investments in ride-sharing. We have a big investment in a company called Cabify, which is the biggest ride-sharing company in most of the Spanish-language countries. And we own part of Go-Jek, which is the biggest ride-sharing company in Indonesia. So it is just not about owning it and operating it. We are trying to form a global coalition of ride-sharing companies. Also, this isn’t really based on our strategic initiatives. This is based on the data we have. We knew how fast Lyft was growing at the time through our various data intelligence, and now we are thinking about using data to expand our business.

Strait, 64, was in Dallas touting premium tequila label Codigo 1530 and spoke to Pappalardo in the middle of a tequila tasting event. Though no longer touring, Strait has started a sporadic residency at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, playing a handful of weekend gigs this year and next year. RELATED: The most unartful bro-country songs we could find Strait hasn’t stopped recording music, either, releasing a new album last year at around this time. Just last week it was announced he's releasing a second box set of greatest hits and other nuggets next month exclusively for Walmart. “Strait Out of the Box: Part 2” hits store shelves Nov. 18. Among other things, Pappalardo asked Strait about the state of country music. “I don't see a lot of my influence out there in country music today, out there being played on the radio,” Strait said. “The country music scene is always changing, and the music is always changing. I've seen the pendulum swing this way and back this way. It's very country, and then not so country.” RELATED: Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson and the other greatest classic country artists left on the planet  So yeah, even Strait is a little weirded out by the boys in bedazzled jeans and ball caps singing about drinking by the river on the bed of a pickup truck while a honey shakes it nearby. But at the same time, he’s not a hater. “I can't put anybody down for having success in the business, which is just tough. And for someone to go out and have some success in the music business, more power to 'em,” Strait said. “I'm not saying I have to like it, but I just know how tough it is.” RELATED: Texas country mainstay Kevin Fowler takes aim at pop-country Strait, though, did sound hopeful noting that traditional country music is trending to make a return. He noted that even when he first hit it big in 1981 people in the industry said that he was a blast of traditional fresh air. “The thing was to get a crossover hit, and that would sell more records. They wanted a pop sounding country song to get the pop music lovers and country music people to buy it,” Strait said. And I never was into any of that. But I came around at the right time."  RELATED: RodeoHouston in 2018 might look a bit different "Traditional country music kind of came back and there were a lot of artists who started doing it, like me, Alan Jackson, Randy Travis.” Strait and the others were known as "hat acts" for a time.  There was a glimmer of hope for new music in the offing from Strait. He told Pappalardo that he recorded a song with new-school outlaw country artist Jamey Johnson. Strait was soon pulled back to the tequila party to mingle with guests, closing out Pappalardo’ s brief interview.    Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW This Is Your Life Poster for $10 + free shipping That Daily DealPosted 2 hr 44 min ago SHOP NOW Xbox One S 500GB Console Bundle for $299 + free shipping WalmartPosted 1 day 17 hr ago SHOP NOW Jockey Men's Slim-Fit Crew T-Shirt 3-Pack for $8 + free shipping eBayPosted 1 day 3 hr ago SHOP NOW Goggles4U Prescription Eyeglasses for $1 + $6 s&h Goggles4uPosted 3 hr 13 min ago More Entertainment News Donald Trump Rape Accuser’s Lawyer Claims Anonymous Hacked...

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 3, 2016 at 9:42AM Soaring healthcare premiums are taxing workers, and skyrocketing drug prices are causing financial insecurity for retirees. Is there anything Americans can do to curb their healthcare spending? In this episode of The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes is joined by contributor Todd Campbell to discuss how employees and retirees can lower their healthcare bills. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 28, 2016.  Kristine Harjes: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Sept. 28. I'm your host, Kristine Harjes, and calling in to rainy Fool HQ in Alexandria, Va., is Motley Fool healthcare writer, Todd Campbell. Welcome, Todd! Todd Campbell: Hi! I'm calling in from rainy New Hampshire. It's a gloomy, gray day everywhere. Harjes: It is. Before we get into today's show, I wanted to thank today's episode's sponsor. This podcast is brought to you by Pearl Auto, which makes wireless rearview cameras for your car that retrofit around your license plate and sync with your smartphone so that you can drive more safely. Check it out at pearlauto.com/fool, and get free two-day shipping applied at checkout. This product is basically a set of rearview cameras that fit around your license plate, and it syncs with your smartphone. I got to try it out earlier this week on the Foolmobile, which is actually a thing. It was actually really useful. I felt way safer using it. Soon, rearview cameras are actually going to be mandatory on all new cars. But with Pearl Auto, you don't have to buy a whole new car to drive safely. Today, we want to do a very practical episode about how to save money on healthcare costs. It's somewhat of an intersection between personal finance and healthcare. I figured we would start with some general tips on lowering expenses, and then go into talking about some different insurance strategies, whether you're still working or you're retired. Let's start with the most basic question -- why talk about healthcare expenses and saving money there? Campbell: I'm really excited about this show, because I think, we tend to dive into different drugs and medications and the business end of things on this show, and this is an opportunity for us to reach out to our listeners and say, "Listen, we recognize how expensive healthcare is, in terms of insurance, premiums, the cost of care, drugs, etc. We want to make sure we're offering to you whatever tips we can to help you stretch your dollar further, so you don't face issues of financial security once you've reached your golden years." In preparation for this show, I went back and took a look at basic statistics. They're pretty scary, Kristine. Harjes: I bet. What did you find? Campbell: For one, the average person is running into retirement with just barely over $100,000. But averages can be very misleading, because maybe you have very few people with a lot of money, and maybe that's skewing that number higher. You have to remember that a significant percentage of people are heading into retirement with less than $20,000. That's just simply not going to be enough if you suffer an injury, or you face some sort of healthcare crisis, like cancer, for example. If you look at bankruptcy statistics, 3% of all bankruptcies are from cancer alone. But three of five bankruptcies are caused by medical bills. So, Americans are having to pay more and more money every year for healthcare. How do you prepare for that? Harjes: Exactly. One of the things I saw in my research is that the average couple turning 65 today will spend $250,000 on healthcare in their retirement, which sounds like a lot, and it is, but the statistic that startled me even more is that the average person that's 10 years away from retirement will spend an estimated $464,000 on healthcare in retirement. Campbell: Right. We'll talk about this later on, but that doesn't even include long-term care. Harjes: Exactly, yeah. There are so many different things to consider. And while, as you pointed out earlier, a lot of times on this show we talk about blockbuster drugs bringing in so much revenue, we're kind of putting ourselves on the opposite side of the table today, and saying, as a consumer of these potentially very expensive drugs and insurance plans and everything that goes along with healthcare, how can you save more money and hopefully be able to use that money to invest in some of the companies that come up on this show? Getting into the nitty-gritty, the first thing I want to start with is shopping around. This is so important for every single aspect of healthcare. We'll talk later about shopping around for insurance options, but let's start with shopping around for the medications and drugs you need. Campbell: Yeah. People are probably going to be pretty surprised, but there's a very wide range of prices that you can pay for prescription medicine depending on where you get it filled. The price that you might pay at a CVS might be very different, for example, than the price that you could pay or a Costco or a Wal-Mart, depending upon that drug. So, it's very important for consumers to think about what medications they're regularly getting filled, are they generics or brand-name drugs, and if they're generics, especially, make sure you check out those big-box retail stores. Places like Wal-Mart and Target and even some supermarkets have deals where they offer prescriptions for less than $5 on many generic drugs. So, there's some significant savings that can be accomplished that way. There's a website, actually, called GoodRx, which allows you to search by where you live and find out different prices of medications with in your area. That can be helpful as well. Sometimes they have coupons, too, on that site. Harjes: And if you're not taking a brand name, find out if there is a generic. That's step one. Campbell: Yeah, ask the question. If you've been on a certain brand of medication for a long time, there's a potential that there's going to be a generic out there. Harjes: Right, it could have come off patent. Campbell: Yeah. The price savings alone could be tremendous -- 80% to90% for typical generic drugs. If you take a high-cost biologic medicine, too, you may soon be able to request a biosimilar. They're not exact replicas of those brand-name drugs, but they work very similarly to them. The FDA is getting much more willing to approve those drugs. Those could offer savings, too, I think 30% to 40%. Harjes: Right, that's what they're estimating. You mentioned Costco. Before we totally abandon that name, I just found this out -- apparently Costco's pharmacy is open to non-members. Campbell: Anybody can go. Harjes: That is pretty awesome. I know for a fact that most of my family gets their prescription medications from Costco because it is significantly cheaper. And I always thought, it's because they're members. But no, anybody can go in there. Campbell: Yeah, anybody can go in there. Call around, you can reach the pharmacies and say, "I need to get this filled, how much will it cost me?" They'll tell you. There's other things that you can do to reduce your costs of prescription drugs as well. You can get a 90-day prescriptions instead of 30 day prescriptions, which can sometimes save you money on copays. Also, if you're on a plan like mine that maybe doesn't have the best drug coverage, ask your pharmacy how much the cash price is rather than running it through your insurance. You might find that the cash price is cheaper than it would be if you run it through your insurance. I think that's a good pro tip. Harjes: Another thing you can look into is a mail-order pharmacy -- sometimes offer you three-month supplies for the price of one. That can be a pretty big money saver as well.  The next topic I thought we should bring up is preventative care. There are so many free screenings and vaccine and things that you can get through your health plan or work that are so important toward saving you money in the long run. Campbell: Have you gotten your flu shot yet, Kristine? Harjes: I am scheduled to get one in a few weeks. Campbell: Yeah. You can walk right in to your primary care, or a pharmacy, I go to Rite Aid, I sit there for five minutes, they come over and give me the shot, and it doesn't cost me a dime. For me, that keeps me healthy and I'm able to work more. The other part of this is that you don't want to miss days of work because you're not feeling well. So you have preventative care, you can go to your primary care physician and get a checkup every year, you have these different options. One thing I just did recently that I didn't even know about until I asked my doctor was that the local hospital in my area provides, one day per week, a very big discount on getting ultrasounds for your carotid arteries. I have carotid artery disease in my family history, and I was able to go in and get thousands of dollars' worth of testing for $75. So, it does help to talk very openly and honestly with your primary care physician and just ask different questions, what kind of options are out there that could save me money? Harjes: Another thing to look into is your workplace wellness. Forty percent of large employers offer some sort of discount for participating in a workplace wellness program. And it makes sense from the employer's standpoint. Apparently every $1 of workplace wellness program cost saves approximately $3.27 on medical costs. So, it's quite likely that you can get money back through your employer, or you can find things -- I'm actually getting my flu shot through The Motley Fool's annual Wellness Fair. It's a good thing to look into that sort of benefit, and see what's available to you. Campbell: Larger employers will often times do these kinds of things. It's important to make sure you're checking your human resource newsletter to find out what kind of things are available to you and making the most of them. I also don't want to forget, if an emergency strikes that is not a life-threatening emergency, there are more and more options popping up in local communities rather than the emergency room. We have urgent-care centers all over our area, for example. My son actually just fell off his bike and needed some care, and we were able to go in, and in less than an hour and with a $60 co-pay, and make sure he didn't have any broken bones. Harjes: And that would be way cheaper than the hospital, I'm assuming. Campbell: Absolutely. Harjes: Another thing along that vein is to make sure you know which hospitals are in network in case you need to go to a hospital. It's good to have done that research beforehand. Campbell: It gets so confusing. We're going to talk about insurance, and we're moving that way already. There's so many different moving pieces. Having a little bit of education ahead of time can be very helpful, not only for those emergency situations, but even things like lab work, there could be very drastic difference is in terms of how much you're going to have to pay out of pocket depending on whether or not your insurer has a preferred lab that they'd rather you use, and you end up using something else. Harjes: Right. So, let's talk a little bit more about insurance. One of the things you were hinting at is that there's so many moving parts to consider when you look at what you'll actually pay, even with an insurance plan. It's very easy to focus just on your premiums, but there are so many other costs that end up coming out of your pocket. Campbell: Yeah, it's tremendous. I think, most of us tend to look at our healthcare costs, when we're healthy, as simply, "Oh my god, my premiums, I have to pay these monthly premiums," and that's 100% of your focus, how expensive are your premiums. The problem with focusing too much on your premiums is, how does that saying go? A penny wise, a pound foolish? Is that it? Harjes: Sure. Campbell: Yeah, sure. What happens is, you may be saving money on the premium side of things, but if you do end up requiring healthcare, you could end up getting stung by going to the low-premium health plan that ends up having a higher deductible or higher co-pays or higher co-insurance or higher out-of-pocket maximum. Harjes: Yes, that is absolutely true. You mentioned deductibles. This is the amount of money that you have to pay toward your plan, out of pocket, before the plan starts to kick in. There is one really good option for plans that have high deductibles. This is to set up a health savings account, or an HSA. Todd, do you want to talk a little bit about this? Campbell: This is one of the single best money-saving strategies that anybody who has access to a high-deductible plan should take advantage of. HSAs are wonderful. Can you tell I like them? Harjes: Just a little bit. I do, too. They actually are wonderful.  Campbell: They allow you to take pre-tax dollars and set them aside in an account. Oftentimes, you can invest in that account and earn interest on it. So, set it aside in an account, and then use it -- oftentimes they'll issue you a debit card -- to pay for your co-pays, your co-insurance, your dental visits, your vision care, your kids' braces, healthcare costs that you would otherwise be paying for with after-tax dollars. There are some restrictions. HSAs, as we've already said, are only available with high-deductible health insurance plans, which means a lot of people who have employer-sponsored health insurance won't have access to HSAs. You never know until you ask, though. It's very important to take a look and make sure you qualify for an HSA before setting up. Find out if you can, because if you can, it's a great way to sock away thousands of dollars in pre-tax money that can be used to cover healthcare expenses. Harjes: And all of the details on qualification can be found on the IRS website. The important one to note is the deductible number you have to meet. It has to be $1,300 for an individual, or $2,600 for a family. One of the really great things about HSAs is, it's not use-it-or-lose it. Meaning, you put that money in year and year out, and you don't have to use it in a given year. This is important because it directly contrasts to an FSA, which is a flexible spending account. This is also something that goes through your employer, and it's also a good tax-saving mechanism, it's money you contribute pre-tax. And you can use it throughout the year, but you can only really use it in the year that you contributed it. Sometimes you can carry over $500 from one year to the next, but in general, you need to spend it during that year. Campbell: Right. What's great about FSAs, and I love these just as much as HSAs, is that if you don't qualify for a high-deductible plan, you do qualify for a flex spending account. So, you may not be able to contribute to the HSA because your health insurance doesn't qualify, but if you have very good health insurance and a low deductible, then you can do the FSA. In 2017, you can put $2,550 in pre-tax money into this account. If you have a family of four, you may be spending $1,000 alone on just dentist visits. So, there's a pretty good likelihood of being able to use $2,500 in a given year on out-of-pocket expenses that otherwise would be covered by insurance. Harjes: And yet, surveys show that about 80% of employees that have this available to them ignore the benefit. I can sort of see why. It's kind of daunting to put this money in, and if you don't spend it, you lose it. But, if you look at the list of things that count as a qualified healthcare expenditure, you can spend that money on sunscreen, shoe inserts, first aid kits, there are so many thing that, if you actually make it to the end of the year and have too much yet, you can spend that money on useful things. Campbell: Yeah. Also, you have elective procedures. If you have a lot of extra money kicking around at the end of the year with your FSA, you could pull a procedure forward, and maybe take care of that. FSAs are a great way to lower your taxable income, to get a tax benefit, to get a discount on all the healthcare services that you're buying throughout the year. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, that's an extra $100-500 per year in savings, depending on if we're talking about the FSA or HSA. It could be even more. Harjes: Right. And speaking of taxes, you can use some medical expenses to save on taxes. Want to explain how? Campbell: Before I get to that, I don't think we mentioned the HSA contribution limits. The HSA, you can contribute $3,400 in 2017 if you're an individual, $6,750 if you're a family. There's a lot of money that you can sock away in those HSAs. Harjes: Good to know. Campbell: As far as the tax advantages are concerned, it really only comes into play, as far as your medical costs, if you itemize your deductions on your taxes. Many Motley Fool listeners probably do, but nationwide, I think it's one in three that actually itemize. If you do itemize, then if your medical expenses are more than 10% of your adjusted gross income, then you can take a deduction for those expenses. So, make sure you're keeping very close track of what you're spending throughout the course of the year. At the end of the year, you total everything up. The mileage of driving to the doctor, you name it. Total it all up, and see whether or not you qualify for this deduction. If you do, even if you give up a couple thousand dollars, that's extra money that can end up in your pocket rather than in Uncle Sam's. Harjes: This could be a particularly good tip if you are about to retire in that year. If you end up retiring part of the way through the year, you will have lower income for that year as a whole, so you might be able to deduct more of those medical expenses than you otherwise would have been able to. Campbell: Right, think about thinks like joint replacement. You get into your 50s and early 60s, and maybe you're contemplating whether or not you need to have a knee replacement. Maybe it's late in the year and you want to push it off until the year you retire, so you're only showing your Social Security income, and therefore more of it, theoretically, can be deducted. Harjes: Right. Do we want to move on to saving money on healthcare in retirement? Or is there more to say on employer-type coverage? Campbell: There are a couple things, probably, that everybody should know about HSAs before we totally leave them alone. Harjes: You really do love them. Campbell: I do. There are a lot of ways to stash money into these. If you're over 55 years old, you can do a catch-up contribution and throw an additional $1,000 into this plan. You mentioned earlier that it's not use-it-or-lose-it with HSAs. So, you might want to look at it and say, "If I'm going to max out my retirement plan for work, my 401K, for taxes, then why wouldn't I also max out my contribution to the HSA to further lower my tax bill? And then, consider my HSA contributions as a savings account totally for my healthcare?" Because, as we move later into life, we can then tap all that money that's been rolled over to pay for some of these expenses. Harjes: You can't contribute post-Medicare, but you can still use the money. Campbell: Exactly. You will not be able to continue to contribute to the HSA program. There's another pro tip we'll get to in a second on that. But, yeah, you can still tap into it and use that money. You can even use it to pay your Medicare part B and D premiums. Harjes: What was the pro tip you were about to share? Campbell: If you have a spouse who isn't on Medicare -- let's say you had a high-deductible plan and you've been contributing to your HSA all along. You turn 65 and you now qualify for Medicare. Your employer will not be able to make contributions on your behalf to an HSA. However, your spouse could open up your own HSA, as long as they're still covered by that same insurance plan, can contribute the family about to an HSA that's now in their name. And that HSA, with money, could then be used to cover both you, even though you're on Medicare, and your spouse's expenses. Harjes: Which is pretty awesome. We just did an entire show about Medicare. Something that we missed in that show was MediGap. If you're on Medicare, you can consider getting MediGap coverage, which is supplemental insurance to help you pay for some of the expenses that original Medicare does not cover. This would be your co-pays, co-insurance, deductibles. It pretty much gives you a cap on your out-of-pocket maximum spending, which can be enormously comforting. Campbell: Right. I think a lot of people forget that there is no cap to your Medicare spending. Part A, which will cover hospitalizations, after you reach a certain number of days in the hospital, you're going to be on the hook for the cost. Part B, you have to pay 20% co-insurance for Part B coverage after you've met your deductible. And that also is not capped. MediGap plans are great because they help you better understand how much you're spending in any given year on your healthcare. There are 10 different plan types. The most common of those types is Plan F. Plan F is most common because it covers all of the out-of-pocket costs that you might have otherwise been on the hook for in Part A and Part B. The plans aren't necessarily cheap. They're going to run you between $100 and $300 a month. But they will at least allow you to know what your healthcare spending could be in any given year.  Let me give you a real-time example of why that's important. In 2015, my mother was diagnosed surprisingly with a rare form of lymphoma, a fast-moving rare form of lymphoma. She, fortunately, ended up having Medicare and MediGap. Her out-of-pockets were virtually nil. And because you're getting care from Medicare, you can go to any doctor, wherever you want to go, as long as they accept Medicare. So MediGap can provide a very important safety net for a surprise diagnosis. And with 76 million baby boomers getting older every day, the incidence rates of things like Alzheimer's disease and cancer and those kinds of things, the likelihood of getting a diagnosis like that is increasing. Harjes: I think it's really hard for people approaching retirement age to truly estimate their retirement costs. It's tough to look at the numbers and the incidence rates and plan for that properly. I think one of the things that people forget about the most is the cost of long-term care. Seventy percent of people turning 65 this year will require long-term care. Campbell: Long-term care is another way that you can prepare, or at least know what you're spending in any given year. Unfortunately, you have conditions like Alzheimer's that, because we're living longer, more and more millions and millions of people are suffering from. And while we may think that our families are going to take care of us, we have to ask the question, do we really want them to have to do things like bathe us and take care of our bathroom activities and the things of daily life then maybe we won't be able to take care of on our own. The cost of long-term care is very high. Harjes: It's huge. Campbell: If you have an in-home aid, it's going to cost you $3,000 a month. If you have to go into assisted living, it's going to cost even more than that. If, eventually, you end up in a nursing home, it could cost you $7,000 or $8,000 a month for that care. And with retirement savings being so small, I think a lot of people think that Medicare will take care of the cost for them, or that Medicaid will take care of that cost for them. The reality is that Medicare has a very limited amount of care that they will take care of for you, and that Medicaid will force you to draw down all of your assets to about $2,000 -- some states are little bit different -- before you qualify for coverage. And even if you qualify for coverage, Medicaid can go out and attach a lien to your house to recoup the money after you pass away. Harjes: So, you're still worrying about your medical care and your expenses at that point. That's crazy. Campbell: Right. Long-term care is expensive, it's going to cost a few thousand dollars. A pro tip here is to apply for it when you're in your 50s. Very few people, percentage wise, get rejected when they apply for this in their 50s. And once you have it, you can continue to have it. But if you wait until you're 70 and your health isn't good, there's a good likelihood that they won't even underwrite you. Harjes: Right. This has already been a longer episode, so I'm going to close us out soon. Is there anything else we may have missed along the way? Campbell: I'm sure there are. Harjes: That's true. I'll phrase it differently. What's the most important thing we missed? Campbell: I'm hoping that maybe our listeners will reach out to us and maybe tell us some of their money-saving tips for healthcare, and we can put that out there at a later date. I think everybody should always be asking questions about their healthcare. Are these tests necessary? Is this lab work necessary? They should be considering unique provider options. Does it make sense to go to a minute clinic if you're having flu symptoms, rather than my primary care doctor? Should you consider a telehealth visit offered through my insurance company, where my doctor can discuss flu symptoms with me, and maybe you can save some money that way? There are a lot of different considerations and a lot of different tips. I'm sure we've barely scratched the surface. Harjes: Last question for you, Todd, and it might seem like a kind of random one. When's your birthday? Campbell: Dec. 8. Harjes: All right. Listeners, if your birthday is also on Dec. 8, it is a sign that you should review us. Please leave us a rating on iTunes or wherever it is that you listen. It'll take just a few minutes, and it's super helpful.

CEO Dan Cathy (Photo credit: Sistarazzi for Steed Media Service) Next July, Bruce Deel will celebrate 20 years since he came to Atlanta to assist with the closing of a church. Located in one of Atlanta’s most impoverished and crime-filled neighborhoods, where nearly 40 percent of the residents live below the federal poverty level, the City of Refuge today has transformed the lives of 20,000 people. The sprawling campus encompasses 200,000-square-foot. warehouse in the heart of the troubled 30314 neighborhood on Joseph E. Boone Boulevard in northwest Atlanta, which was formerly Simpson Road. The 20th anniversary is just the beginning of the accomplishments for the City of Refuge. On Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2016, the city of Atlanta, Coca-Cola and Chick-fil-A pledged $7.5 million to the City of Refuge to help transform Westside Atlanta through a vocational training and entrepreneurial program. Many of the people who will benefit are residents of Westside neighborhoods, which have been devastatingly impacted by the recession and recently became the focus of development programs. The grant will be used to construct and operate a Workforce Innovation Hub to teach people skills to prepare for careers in auto tech and retail, the culinary arts, landscaping, security services and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) installation and repair. A computer-coding academy will also be created for young adults along with a small business incubator and accelerator for aspiring entrepreneurs. Planning for the Workforce Innovation Hub is underway, with construction anticipated to commence in the coming months and conclude September 2019. Coca-Cola’s portion of the gift, $1.25 million, will support City of Refuge’s provision of vocational training, job readiness and entrepreneurial skills development for approximately 400 women through the 180º Kitchen Culinary Arts Academy, NAPA Auto Training Center, and the development of a Women’s Business Incubator and Accelerator Program. The grant will also support training for more than 150 men, and help them find employment in food service or automotive maintenance and repair, and provide education and training for entrepreneurs. “We’re proud that our Foundation is partnering with other passionate members of the Atlanta community to support this new vocational training effort that will improve the lives of men and women, young people, parents and families throughout our Westside neighborhood,” Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company, said in a statement to press. “There is no better time than now for progressive initiatives like this, which will help us strengthen our communities.” The Chick-fil-A Foundation will donate $5 million over the next five years to the City of Refuge. The remaining portion of $1.25 million is being given by the city of Atlanta. In October 2015, when Chick-fil-A unveiled plans to open a new restaurant in Vine City, Cathy said in a statement to the press, “We made a promise to the city of Atlanta to do everything we could to do our part in helping revitalize the Westside neighborhood. “This restaurant is just one measure of our overall commitment to the effort. It is our hope that the restaurant will help foster community within the neighborhood and offer an environment where families will share meals, business people can meet, and neighbors experience genuine heartfelt hospitality.” The restaurant will be adjacent to Wal-Mart and located at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and Lowery Boulevard. While the restaurant is still in the early planning stages, Chick-fil-A anticipates the 4,000-square-foot location to open in early 2017 and create a minimum of 50-60 new job opportunities for area residents. The combined investment lays a solid foundation for the launch of City of Refuge’s capital campaign, “Shining the Light,” with a goal to raise $25 million by 2018 to support organization programs.

The Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative wrote to food titans like Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, and Walmart to make the case that switching to vegetable proteins serves shareholder interests, Reuters reports. But it’s not just about risk: The group of investors, which has over $1 trillion under management, is also motivated by environmental and social concerns. The financial argument is that the demand for meat is going to increase dramatically, driving up prices, as incomes rise and a new middle class starts eating its scrumptious flesh rations. Skyrocketing prices would be bad for companies that buy animal protein as an ingredient. It could even create what I like to call an exploding meat bubble, where meat prices spike and then crash as people switch to alternatives. Nestle responded to the Reuters story to say the company was moving in that direction: “Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet.” There’s a lot to consider when it comes to meat. We consider it in-depth, here. Nathanael Johnson Sep 28, 2016 Get Briefly in your inbox Privacy Policy Standing Rock Watch people on the frontlines of the Dakota Access fight defend their water and their rights. Mni Wiconi: The Stand at Standing Rock takes us to the scene of the standoff over the pipeline, where gathered protesters face police violence. The phrase Mni Wiconi, which means “water is life” in Lakota, has been used to rally support for the movement. The pipeline’s original route was rejected because it was a threat to Bismarck’s water supply, but it now poses that same risk to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux. Despite recent developments that make approval for the pipeline likely, Winona LaDuke, founder of Honor the Earth, warns against despair in the short film: “Don’t operate out of fear; operate out of hope. Because with hope, everything is possible.” Abigail Bechtel 4 hours ago Vanishing Act NSIDC Um, where did all of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice just go? Into the ocean, it seems. New satellite data show the total area of global sea ice dipping wayyy below the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s record for this time of year. In fact, Arctic sea ice has dropped well below the next-lowest seasonal extent ever observed (which was in 2012). That year’s all-time record low was narrowly avoided in September, the month when Arctic sea ice levels typically are at their lowest. But the fact that ice levels are lower now than they were this same time in 2012 is part of what makes this latest data so alarming. Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice is also much lower than usual at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Both the #Antarctic and #Arctic #seaice extents are abnormally small. That's the story. pic.twitter.com/nObJ4WqsUl — Aarne Granlund (@granlund_aarne) November 17, 2016 We’ve gotten somewhat used to broken records here, but watching sea ice levels flatten out when they should be peaking is well beyond normal understanding of record lows and highs. Meanwhile, the temperature at the North Pole right now is a not-cool 36 degrees F above average. Is this what the Upside Down feels like? Amelia Urry 19 hours ago path of lease resistance Pete Souza A woman who fought predatory oil and gas leasing on Native lands got the Presidential Medal of Honor. It’s not often that the highest civilian honor in America goes to an accountant, but Elouise Cobell was no ordinary accountant. Cobell grew up on a reservation in Montana in the 1950s, a time when America was flush with cash. But Cobell’s home, like many, didn’t have a telephone, running water, or electricity, even though the Blackfeet Tribe owned acres of valuable land. The Blackfeet knew what was up. The land was being leased out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, and the money never made it back to the reservation. Cobell learned accounting and banking, which ultimately led her to file a landmark, 15-year-long lawsuit. When it was over, the Department of the Interior agreed to pay $3.4 billion to compensate for decades of lost revenue and to purchase land that had been split up so that it could be returned whole to the tribes. The process of freeing Blackfeet land from oil and gas leases continues today. The Department of the Interior announced a settlement with one of the last companies holding a lease to Badger-Two Medicine, the site of many Blackfeet creation stories. Cobell died in 2011, but the ideals that motivated her live on, most visibly at Standing Rock. Heather Smith 19 hours ago What A Time To Be Alive Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is a bad idea. Even Bill O’Reilly knows that. Many have agreed that President-elect Donald Trump has some questionable ideas when it comes to climate policy. Today, we get to add anthropomorphized gym sock O’Reilly and known cup goblin Starbucks to that list! On Wednesday’s episode of The O’Reilly Factor, he advised Trump on a number of items to consider as he prepares to take office. On this list: “Finally, President-Elect Trump should accept the Paris treaty on climate to buy some goodwill overseas. It doesn’t really amount to much anyway, let it go.” Well, the thing is, it does actually amount to a lot. Here’s a confusing screenshot, because this action item appears under the heading “What President Obama Failed to Do,” when President Obama did, in fact, succeed in accepting the Paris Agreement. On Thursday morning, a coalition of 365 major companies and investors submitted a plea to Trump to please, come on, just support the goddamn Paris Agreement, because to do otherwise would be a disastrous blow to the United States’ economic competitiveness. The list includes Starbucks (the nerve!!!!), eBay, Kellogg, and Virgin. Anyway, Trump’s whole “refusing to acknowledge climate change” thing seems like a bad look. Eve Andrews 19 hours ago deeds not words Lisa Bynum If this Republican donor loves clean energy, then why did he back fossil-fuel friendly candidates? Last year, Jay Faison announced that he was going to spend $175 million promoting conservative solutions to climate change and backing Republican candidates who supported clean energy. Faison has been showered with loads of positive press ever since. The problem is, Faison opposes actual strategies to mitigate global warming such as carbon pricing or regulation of carbon pollution. He supports policies, like more fracking, that are sure to make it worse. Faison spent money on behalf of Republican members of Congress in crucial swing states and districts. Faison’s ClearPath Action political action committee backed 15 candidates for Congress, and 13 won last Tuesday. Some of the winning candidates, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, have consistently sided with the fossil-fuel industry and against environmental protection. If Portman and Burr had lost, Democrats would have had two more climate-friendly Senators to fight the GOP’s plans to repeal every Obama-era climate regulation, approve every oil and gas pipeline, and eviscerate the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s tempting to say Faison’s work has proved counter-productive, but the results suggest ClearPath’s goal was to help Republicans, not the Earth. Ben Adler 20 hours ago flint water crisis Shutterstock Flint still doesn’t have safe drinking water. More than two and a half years since Flint’s water crisis started, Mayor Karen Weaver has extended the city’s state of emergency, which was set to expire on Monday. Both the state and federal states of emergency expired in mid-August. “The fact of the matter is we still cannot drink our water without a filter,” Weaver said Tuesday in a statement. “That is why I have signed a declaration to renew the state of emergency in the City of Flint until the lingering issues have been resolved and the water is deemed safe to drink.” The crisis started after the city’s emergency manager switched the municipal water supply to the Flint River in April 2014, exposing thousands of Flint residents and 6,000-12,000 children to lead-contaminated water. Even small amounts of lead exposure can lead to serious health consequences for children. By extending the city’s state of emergency, Weaver hopes to renew attention on the city’s water crisis. In September, the Senate authorized $220 million and the House authorized $170 million in federal aid for Flint and other cities dealing with lead contamination, but there are mixed signals on the fate of the funding.

Apple Pay at two years: Not much to celebrate (yet) The CVS go-it-alone app suffers from the pharma payment pain Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware For years, retail has clumsily struggled with various merged channel strategies. No changes in commission structure or bonus requirements have proved effective at getting chains to not prioritize in-store compared with e-commerce sales. There is simply too much bad history here. But what is odd is watching retailers adding barriers in an attempt to differentiate mobile sales versus laptop/desktop sales — although they would probably label the differences as between mobile and e-commerce, as though mobile isn't part of e-commerce. That's the real problem. I'm half-expecting chains to start separating purchases that came through Android devices versus iOS. For that matter, why not separate Samsung Android purchases versus Motorola Android? It makes just about as much sense. For example, a search marketing firm called NetElixir has issued a report that has "mobile projected to account for about 30 percent of holiday season sales [so] it's likely to cut into the growth of other forms of e-commerce [because of] the tendency of consumers to spend less on mobile purchases than they spend via desktop," according to a story in Mobile Commerce Daily. Other than making sure that their site pages all looked good on today's most popular mobile devices — which they should have known without being told — what's the point of differentiating the entry points? Mobile devices are at the heart of merged channel because those handheld computers — and, yes, mobile phones are computers — make any other compensation approach ridiculous. How, for example, is a Macy's in-store-versus-online mentality supposed to deal with someone scanning a barcode in-store with a mobile device and then purchasing it from Macys.com? No need to worry about which division gets what percentage of the sale. It's a Macy's purchase and that's that. The point is to look at purchases from the shopper's perspective. That is what retailers tell their shareholders, right? That they are so customer-centric? Shoppers see it as a Kohl's transaction or a Walmart purchase. They see as much meaningful distinction between mobile, laptop, desktop and in-store as they do entering the South entrance versus the West entrance. How they get to the products is irrelevant. This is why policies that treat these various channels as different entities — with their own return policies and which coupons or payment cards are accepted policies — are ridiculous. Consider what Walmart did a few years ago when it debuted a pay-with-cash-online program. It carefully programmed it so that online purchases didn't morph into in-store purchases, even when it made sense for both the customer and the store to do just that. Besides, even if it were desirable, there is no meaningful way to count mobile activities versus laptop/desktop or in-store ones. Let's say a customer is riding home on the train and uses his/her phone to spend 40 minutes on your site comparing various items and then looking up reviews, comments and demos. The customer chooses something and then goes to a physical store and spends one minute grabbing the item from the shelf and purchasing it. Who gets the credit? Does that go to the mobile team? The e-commerce team? Is there a valid argument that it deserves to go to that store's revenue because the customer chose to not purchase it online, which is a testimonial to the wonderful store management? Or perhaps the customer simply wanted the item immediately and knew he/she was driving by that store on the way home anyway? Merged channel is something that retailers love to talk about. I just wished it truly colored their day-to-day decisions more. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Now, a few residents have come up with a plan they call Market Boxx. It would not only bring fresh produce to more people, but also create entrepreneurs, starting in the Sherman Park neighborhood. The project has gotten new energy, since the police killing there of Sylville Smith and the subsequent protests. Naurice Fitzgerald never thought he’d find himself laying a vinyl floor. But on the day we met, that’s exactly what he was doing. The 21-year old is part of a team building a Market Boxx Community store. Naurice Fitzgerald says he sees himself owning several Market Boxx Community Stores in the future Credit LaToya Dennis Picture a small shed on wheels with windows and vinyl siding. Inside there’s not much space to move around, but when it’s done, the small mobile store will sell deli items along with fresh fruit and vegetables. Right now, Fitzgerald says he has a new level of respect for people in the building trades. “It’s easier said and done with a blueprint, you wouldn’t think that. But once you get to doing it yourself, it’s way harder,” he says. Market Boxx Community Stores have been in the works for years, but Fitzgerald is new to the team. “I want to be able to say I helped build this and I had a part in this because it’s going to go somewhere,” he says. Now before we go any further, I should offer up the back story on Fitzgerald. After talking with him for a while, he mentioned that he was good friends with Sylville Smith, the black man a Milwaukee officer shot and killed in August, sparking two days of unrest. It happened less than a half mile from here. “I was really close to him. I was with him the day before he got killed and the day before that because it was my birthday,” Fitzgerald says. Fitzgerald had also been looking for work, but couldn’t find it. “Like just all types of jobs. Temp services, Walmart, pizza places, all types of places but you know, sometimes they don’t call back. Even when they say they hiring so bad, they still don’t call back,” he says. But since his friend died, Fitzgerald says he’s been taking a more active role in his life starting with Market Boxx. “When I came into this and just started putting my all into it, I see progress in it, and I see like I can build something like this and then from it and experience it and end up owing my own, in a couple months probably. It’s a lot of [independence] and it’s worth it,” he says. Jay Holmes is one of the founders of Market Boxx Community Stores. “Entrepreneurs aren’t limited by anything but their own talent and tenacity. Even at the best job, there tends to be these glass ceilings,” he says. Holmes is helping build this facility, while teaching the others. "We want to catch our young adults at that age and give them a chance to do anything." “We have designs and blue prints for carts in different businesses that we need in our community. And we work with community organizations and entrepreneurs to build those carts. Some will qualify for grants, some will have the skill to build their own cart. We help facilitate that and we connect you with your suppliers, and that’s how Market Boxx works,” he says. Holmes and Fitzgerald met while out protesting Sylville Smith’s death. Holmes says he’s been targeting adults between the ages of 18 and 24 to help build the first small store and teach them about business ownership. “It’s an age where most people still understand that they can do anything. And we want to catch our young adults at that age and give them a chance to do anything,” Holmes says. Holmes says Market Boxx is about building all-around stronger and healthier communities. “People need better access to fresh affordable food and because we can focus the communities earning power and dollars into things that help make us healthy and also help create jobs in our own community,” he says. Holmes says that while the team is still working to get its first store up and running, people around the city have expressed an interest in bringing Market Boxx to their neighborhoods. For volunteer Naurice Fitzgerald, he says the possibilities have changed the way he sees his life unfolding. “You know, I thought I’d just be working a job, get a family. You know being a solo person, not really talking to people. Now I look at it like I’ll be an aspect in the community like bro helped build something. Or bro really loved black people, he cares, he cares for the community,” Fitzgerald says. Organizers hope to launch the first Market Boxx store in Sherman Park within the next few weeks.

As part of a national trend, retailers are hiring less people inside brick and mortar stores and more people in distribution centers, Feinberg said, and  in general those jobs tend to pay more. “Central Indiana looks pretty good,’ he said. “Because we have a lot of distributions centers. We have the FedEx people, we have the Amazon people, we have a Walmart distribution center and those places hire a lot of people.” UPS plans to hire nearly 900 people this holiday season in central Indiana and more than 100 of those jobs will pay $30 an hour. “There are many cities and areas in the United States that don’t have the luxury of having a strong retailing presence in terms of distribution,” Feinberg said. Other retailers looking to add employees this  holiday season include JC Penny, 350 jobs, and Meijer, 1200 jobs. Macy’s, Kohls and Target also are in the process of hiring seasonal employees. Feinberg said if you’re looking to get a job this holiday season the most important thing to emphasize on your resume and during your job interview is the ability to deliver exceptional customer service. “I would even go so far as to get a book on Amazon on customer service and when you go to the interview flop it down on the interview table and you won’t have to say anything because they will see you’re reading about customer service,” Feinberg said. The ability to multitask, flexibility and a positive personality are all other important traits when it comes to seasonal jobs, he said. Feinberg added added many retailers are hiring right now and said it’s good to be proactive in your job search.

Published on October 03, 2016. Credit: Mobile Marketing Association Marketers should spend more on mobile: Just ask the Mobile Marketing Association. That claim is no surprise coming from the industry's trade group, and might even provoke eye rolls. But there's a key reason to believe the MMA, backed by its cross-device Smart Mobile Cross Marketing Effectiveness (SMoX) research, as the group's CEO, Greg Stuart, sees it: His board is made up of nearly two-thirds marketers -- including executives of Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever -- who have closely supervised and participated in the work. Unilever, whose Magnum ice cream brand is the focus of the latest SMoX study, is putting credence in the results and putting them to use, said Luis Di Como, Unilever senior VP-global media, who sits on the MMA board. "We have advertisers. We have mobile players. We have Facebook as well," said Mr. Di Como. "We have a good industry representation." Related Stories Mobile Data Marketplace Creates Direct Path From App to Dollars Google's Attack on Mobile Interstitials Provokes That Familiar Mix of Applause and Fear 'Campaign' Is a Dirty Word in Mobile Creativity MMA research has been vetted independently by the Advertising Research Foundation, Mr. Stuart noted. And its studies have been conducted with large panels of between 500,000 and 1 million consumers under the supervision of well-regarded marketing analytics firm Marketing Evolution. The eight published SMoX studies to date, conducted since 2014 with such marketers as Walmart, Coca-Cola, Mastercard and AT&T, concluded that all the marketers would have fared better -- either selling more products or converting more customers -- by increasing mobile media's share of their media budgets to the 15%-to-20% range from 5% to 9%, Mr. Stuart said. Somewhat ironically, the one mobile player in that group -- AT&T -- had the lowest mobile share of spending going into its study, he said. "Mobile is priced at half its value," Mr. Stuart said, based on the sales or conversion impact per dollar spent. That's not to say the gains will hold up if marketers pile their whole budgets into mobile. Marketing Evolution CEO Rex Briggs has pointed out in numerous interviews and presentations that optimal spending on mobile tends to top out at much lower levels than other media, because it doesn't take as much frequency to make an impact as other media. Saturation point Mr. Stuart said a mobile video ad only needs to hit its target three times to reach "total saturation," versus a frequency of 12 to 15 for cable TV. While it's not entirely clear why similar video advertising works and wears out faster in mobile than cable, it does raise questions about whether what counts as an impression is really equal between the media, and whether, for all the concern about digital viewability, concern should perhaps be greater about TV viewability. Of course, comparing mobile and TV is also complicated by the relative complexity of mobile. Where TV spending comes largely on 15- and 30-second ads, mobile encompasses display, video, native and search with parameters that include place and time. Part of SMoX has been looking at optimizing budgets not just by total weight, but also by type of mobile creative and targeting variables. Mobile Delivered About Twice the Impact Per Dollar Versus Other Media AT&T: Awareness of Moto X Phone Mobile: 1.9 Average: 1.0 Gold Peak Tea: Awareness of Gold Peak Tea Mobile: 4.8 Average: 1.0 Mastercard: Image: Use of MC when traveling Mobile: 1.7 Average: 1.0 Walmart: Sales in Store at Walmart Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Unilever, Magnum: Sales Mobile: 1.1 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (Brazil): Sales Mobile: 3.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (China): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (U.K.): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Source: SMoX: A Few Key Insights, September 2016. Photos courtesy of Coca-Cola, Unilever, Walmart, Mastercard and AT&T. Optimizing by total mobile weight increased campaign performance -- either sales or other branding and conversion metrics -- by 4% to 12% (not counting a puzzling outlier from Coca-Cola in Brazil where sales rose a whopping 60%). But optimizing around creative type, location or other factors such as weather increased campaign impact 7% to 25%. The impact in one unpublished study from Subway was even higher, Mr. Stuart said. Mobile ads that the fast-feeder ran between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. had a whopping 14 times more sales impact than those run the rest of the day, he said. For Mr. Di Como, the key takeaway from the SMoX study of Unilever's Magnum ice cream brand was that "context boosts content," he said. The study looked at small and large bannerads and 15- and 30-second mobile video displayed mostly in apps from April to September 2015, using weather, location and time-based targeting. The study found increasing mobile's share of the media mix to 15% from the single digits would increase overall campaign profit performance 9%, and optimizing the creative and targeting within mobile would mean 17% of the media budget in mobile, with a 13% increase in profit versus the unoptimized mix. Using weather-based targeting to only serve the ice cream ads when the temperature was 80 degrees or higher increased aided awareness of the ad by 14% and profit ROI on investment by 50%. The study also found larger banners worked better than smaller ones, and that while mobile video was as effective as cable TV per impression, cable TV was 2.5 times more expensive. In video, 15-second ads proved 27% more effective than 30-second ones. Rich-media surprise But the most effective format actually was rich-media display -- a format that's fallen out of favor with many advertisers in recent years as they turned to video, often repurposed from their TV ads. Rich-media ads had four times the ROI of the campaign overall. While weather and location are clearly major factors for ice cream, Mr. Di Como said the study has implications for other brands as well. Hellmann's, for example, has found ads that run from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. are most effective, because that's when people are deciding what recipes they're going to use that evening. Mobile may still not be the biggest piece of most brands' budgets, but it is "at the center of our communication plans," Mr. Di Como said. "Our mantra is no mobile, no meeting," so that any media or creative provider has to include it in the conversation. But is it possible to get too targeted? Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer Marc Pritchard recently said the company had done just that with Facebook and pulled back to more broad-reach plans on the social network. "Facebook provides all different ranges of targeting capabilities, from mass reach to hypertargeting, and we use both," Mr. Di Como said. Despite the power of weather and geolocation, along with personalized ads for Magnum, he said, the brand also has found it needs broader-reach mobile advertising to maximize its results. A recent ARF study found a considerable amount of digital and mobile advertising wasted by overkill -- basically serving the same ad to the same people to the point of diminishing or even negative returns. The relatively low cost and fast wearout makes that risk particularly acute in mobile. But Mr. Di Como believes the ability to use frequency caps in mobile buys in order to prevent oversaturating people -- a capability that Google said at Advertising Week it is introducing across devices -- actually makes it better than TV. "You can use frequency caps in the digital environment," he said, "where you can't do that in the traditional TV environment." Realistically, mobile and digital change so fast that the half-life of any research can be short. Only a few years ago, Unilever was focused on campaigns that were "social by design" to get organic, i.e., unpaid, reach. "We were one of the first ones to find there was a decay on that model," Mr. Di Como said. That came largely because of changes in Facebook's algorithm for serving brands' posts to followers. It puts a lot more emphasis on paying for mobile rather than maximizing free reach. At the same time, as Unilever spends more money on mobile, getting measurement right gets more important. So with Facebook in particular, Mr. Di Como said, "We were the first one to push to have third-party verification." So when Facebook announced recently that its own metrics had overstated average time spent viewing videos in recent years, Unilever wasn't surprised, because it had been getting its own viewership data from Moat, he said. "We have been working with Moat and Facebook in an open and supportive way," Mr. Di Como said, "to understand all of these viewability standards."

Related News/Archive Clearwater bike shop changes name, location 2 Months Ago Volkswagen abruptly parts ways with historian who chronicled its Nazi past 2 Weeks Ago Facebook has a way to beat your ad blocker 3 Months Ago People are wearing sports and athletic apparel more than ever before, spurring record-breaking sales last year for athletic footwear and activewear. But they're not buying them as much from the traditional sporting goods stores. Instead, other retailers have stepped in to soak up the growth. Not only do apparel brands such as Nike and Under Armour now have their own stores, but consumers are turning to e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com, traditional retailers such as Walmart and small but popular niche athletic apparel brands such as Lululemon, Lolë and Athleta. "They're squeezing out the middle," said Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of the Retail Group for Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York City. Meanwhile, there are fewer people actually playing sports, causing a dip in equipment sales that typically make up about half of the floor space in a traditional sporting goods retailer. The former sports gold mine, golf, is quickly shrinking in popularity, and kids are increasingly turning to video games while their parents fear concussions on real sports fields, said Matt Powell, sports industry analyst with the NPD Group in Maine. "The consumer is admitting that while they're buying athletic wear, only a third said they're actually going to use them for athletic activities," he said. Some sporting goods retailers were unable to keep up. The second-biggest company, Sports Authority, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and has since shuttered all of its 450-plus stores, including 12 in Tampa Bay. Recently, the largest golf retailer in the world, Golfsmith International, also filed for bankruptcy. Last year, Boston-based City Sports went out of business, citing an "extremely competitive market." It was followed by Sports Chalet, a 47-store chain based in California, which shut down earlier this year. Each of the retailers that went out of business was deep in debt, which directly resulted in their downfall, Powell said, adding that he is not aware of any other major players remaining that are in that situation now. Matt Carlson, president of the National Sporting Goods Association, said the thinning out of the "hyper-competitive" sporting goods industry is in part due to changes in the overall retail market. "There's an oversupply of brick-and-mortar space for people to shop at in the U.S.," he said. "In many cases, those areas can't support these stores." However, the remaining retailers appear to have found their places in the marketplace, experts say, and many of them are in growth mode. The giant of the industry, Dick's Sporting Goods, has opened nearly 200 stores over the past five years, bringing the nationwide total to about 650. And the retailer continues to grow, with another location planned locally at Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg. Analysts said Dick's has been particularly effective in a mall environment, where a family can find fashionable yoga apparel, popular shoe brands, plus sports and hunting or fishing equipment in the same place. The second-largest sporting goods retailer now is Academy Sports & Outdoors, known for its extensive, affordable line of name-brand equipment, clothing and shoes for competitive sports, fitness training and outdoor recreational activities such as camping, hunting and fishing. While not yet in Tampa Bay, Academy has a handful of locations in the Orlando area. It is aggressively expanding into the Florida market and could be here soon. Representatives with Academy Sports & Outdoors did not respond to requests for comment. Bass Pro Shops, which opened its first Tampa Bay area store in Brandon last year, will also open new stores in Gainesville and Sarasota. Bass Pro's 130,000-square-foot Outdoor World store, which has fishing ponds, taxidermy displays and a restaurant, is the kind of cult favorite lure that makes people drive there from hundreds of miles away and even book a hotel room. While the industry shrinks and evolves, used and secondhand sporting equipment retailer Play It Again Sports is doing exceptionally well, said local franchise owner Sandy Fortin. He has struggled to keep his shelves stocked since Sports Authority shut down. "We're reaping the benefits," he said. Contact Alli Knothe at aknothe@tampabay.com. Follow @KnotheA.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 17:07 03 Oct 2016 According to one City heavyweight, the answer is a resounding yes. Does Tesco offer anything extra to the investor? Is it worth getting out of Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) ahead of its interim results statement? Well according to one City heavyweight, the answer is a resounding yes. The recent run up in the share price - around 25% since June - flatters the grocer. READ - Week Ahead: Food price deflation a concern at Tesco JP Morgan Cazenove, in a note previewing the figures this Wednesday (October 5), said pension worries and an overstretched balance sheet still haunt the group. It also points out that consensus profit forecasts have been progressively pegged back over recent months. This is to reflect a less than stellar performance from the core UK supermarket operation. Remember, Tesco, J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY),  WM Morrison Supermarkets (LON:MRW) and Wal-Mart owned ASDA are under siege from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are making significant market share gains. Sainsbury last week unveiled a 1.1% decline in underlying sales in the last quarter and received a drubbing on the day of the update. Currently changing hands for 183p, JPM reckons the Tesco is worth 135p a share. The broker remains ‘underweight’ on the stock and believes the market has become ‘overexcited’ so   far as Tesco is concerned, particularly given the difficult market backdrop. As the sector’s 800 lb gorilla, Tesco should be better placed to use its muscle to resist erosion of its market share. First quarter figures announced in June, at least showed the core UK business registering year-on-year growth in like-for-like sales. Underlying sales rose 0.3%, with volumes up 2.2% and the number of transactions up 1.7%, which tells us that food price deflation remains a problem for supermarkets. “Fierce price competition and promotions are likely to remain a squeeze on margins for some time and the revised strategy is going to take time to implement. "Investors backing the new management will be hoping that the signs of improvement in the June results will, like the share price, have continued,” suggested analyst Graham Spooner at The Share Centre. Meanwhile, rival Morrisons' recent half-year results showed the floundering chain’s decision to take the fight to the hard discounters was showing signs of working.

I was sexually assaulted by a man at a party when I was 17. I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while. Should I confront him? (Photo: Stockbyte, Getty Images) Dear Amy: I was sexually assaulted by a man at a party when I was 17. I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. DETROIT FREE PRESS Woman creeped-out by family member’s come-on My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? — Stuck at 17 Dear Stuck: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at (800) 656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened.

Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests and it was only afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn’t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom, and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride’s family prior to the wedding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am I wrong? — Mother of the Groom Dear Mother of the Groom: Whether your son and his wife were deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless when it came to photos, your reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely justified. They owe you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one, you would accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing to receive this album (an understandable, but not really generous reaction), a gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. Dear Amy: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a while, but caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper, but better yet: RUN! — Siri Dear Siri: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis. Send questions via e-mail to askamy@amydickinson.com or by mail to Ask Amy, Chicago Tribune, TT500, 435 N.

The cause of their struggles, however, is substantially different in Canada than in the US. Food prices rose 1.1 per cent in Canada in August compared to a year earlier, according to Statistics Canada. In the US, food prices have fallen for nine consecutive months and the country is on track for its longest stretch of food deflation in 50 years, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics. This has taken place in a year when the Canadian dollar exchange rate has been relatively flat. Much of the reason for the difference in the inflation rates is that Canada has dairy marketing boards. Those boards control the cost of milk, eggs and other items to rein in market volatility at the producer level, according to Ben Janzen, who is chairman of the BC Milk Marketing Board. Processors then buy the dairy products at a stable price that is not influenced by supply surges or shortages. “It’s a free market system after that,” Janzen said. In the US, the initial supply from farmers has a much bigger impact on the final retail price. There, the price of a gallon of milk was down 11 per cent to C$3.06 (US$2.33) in July, compared to the same month a year ago, while the price of a dozen large eggs fell 40 per cent to C$1.55 (US$1.18) in the same period, according to the Wall Street Journal. In Canada, dairy product prices increased a modest 0.1 per cent in August, whereas egg prices have risen 0.6 per cent, according to Statistics Canada. Price wars are raging on both sides of the border, although for different reasons. In the more fragmented US grocery sector, price wars stem from grocers aiming to increase or sustain market share while the biggest grocery seller in the nation, Walmart, expands selection and locations. Walmart has yet to open freestanding grocery stores in Canada although Desjardins analyst Keith Howlett wrote in a note to investors in May that he expects those to open within the next three years. In the meantime, price wars in the Canadian grocery sector have been focused mostly on regions such as Alberta, which have been hit hard by the slump in oil prices and the fire in Fort McMurray earlier this year. Empire Co. Ltd. revealed that the “continued negative impact of merchandising and promotional strategies in Western Canada” was among the main reasons why its sales for the quarter that ended on August 6 were down C$62.6 million (US$47.7 million), or 1 per cent. “The decrease was partially offset by food inflation,” Empire noted in its management’s explanation of the company’s operating results. The company’s share price then slumped 6.4 per cent in the next two trading sessions. That pales in comparison to stock price slides for US grocers following their recent earnings. Supervalu, for example, fell 9.5 per cent on September 8 while Sprouts Farmers Market fell 13.7 per cent on September 7. Loblaw Companies Ltd, meanwhile, set off ripples in the grocery sector earlier this year when it sent a notice to suppliers requesting that they reduce prices by 1.45 per cent. United Grocers Inc., which is a buying group for companies such as London Drugs and the Overwaitea Food Group (OFG), then wrote to suppliers to ask for the same rates as those given to Loblaw. Regardless of whether that tactic reverses the trend toward ever-slimmer profit margins, OFG president Darrell Jones said his company has been seeing opportunity in Alberta. That is in part because Empire Co. bought Canada Safeway in 2013, he explained to Business in Vancouver. “There are fewer competitors,” he said of OFG’s push to open new stores in Alberta and as far east as Manitoba. “If you take two competitors, like Safeway and [Empire-owned] Sobey’s and put them into one, that ended up eliminating an entire flyer, or grocery banner, from the marketplace. They now operate as one flyer.” Jones said that discounting and the struggling economy is a challenge because “people are watching their pennies” but that price is only one part of providing value. Having high-quality products and the ability to provide services such as online ordering and either delivery or pick-up areas in the stores are other ways to attract customers, he said.    Most Popular Viewed 1 Trump’s America and Hong Kong’s oath taking crisis: how they are linked 2 Why Hillary Clinton lost the election: the economy, trust and a weak message 3 Hillary Clinton wins ... the popular vote: why her hollow victory may stir calls for reform 4 How China can take advantage of Donald Trump’s U.S. election win 5 What does a Trump presidency mean for China?

The grant, given by the United Way of Western Connecticut, the Meera & Ashok Vasudevan Foundation and WalMart, will help pay for the food bank’s mobile pantry program in Danbury, New Milford and Stamford. The program helps supplement area food pantries by sending a refrigerated truck stocked with 8,000 pounds of fruits, vegetables and frozen meats that are distributed to those in need across the state. “We’re enormously grateful,” said Bernie Beaudreau, CEO of the Connecticut Food Bank. Beaudreau said that many food pantries are trying to provide more produce instead of nonperishable items, but doing so can be difficult because many facilities lack large refrigerators and freezers. “As food donations move toward much more fresh food and produce, which is good on one hand, it’s a challenge to distribute,” Beaudreau said. The mobile food pantry has operated for more than eight years and makes stops in about 30 towns and cities, he said. Among locations it visits are New Hope Baptist Church in Danbury at 9:30 a.m. on the second Wednesday of the month and at Saint Andrew’s Lutheran Church in Ridgefield at 11 a.m. on the second Friday of the month. In Stamford, the truck can be found at the DOMUS human services center at 83 Lockwood Ave. at 11 a.m. on the fourth Monday of the month. Michele Conderino, director of homeless services for the Catholic Charities of Fairfield County, said the demand for fresh produce is so high that people often wait in line for over an hour when the mobile pantry comes. “My understanding is that turnout has been phenomenal,” Conderino said. “It’s a valuable asset to the community. If people are waiting extremely long times in line for this food, that shows you how important they see it.” The shift toward providing healthier food is encouraging, Conderino said. The food provided at many pantries is inexpensive, but fruits, vegetables and fresh meats bought elsewhere are often too pricey, leading to unbalanced and unhealthy diets. “People can afford a box of pasta, but can’t afford a bushel of apples or fresh fruit,” she said. “I think it makes a huge difference in people’s lives to be able to eat healthy, fresh foods. When I eat healthy fresh foods, I think my brain functions better, I sleep better, I have more energy. . . these are things everyone should have.” In addition to the grant for the mobile food pantry, the United Way has also donated $25,000 to the Connecticut Food Bank and Filling the Blanks, an organization based in New Canaan that aims to fight childhood hunger. Those funds will help provide backpacks filled with food to children in the Danbury and Stamford school districts. The money will also pay for two refrigeration units for food pantries in Danbury, according to a press release. Another $20,000 will be given to two food collaborative groups, which help make food more accessible in Danbury and Stamford through various programs such as food rescues and providing refrigeration units to pantries. Cindy Merkle, president of the United Way of Western Connecticut, said the funding will help fulfill the organization’s goal of helping families identified as Asset Limited, Income Constrained and Employed, known as ALICE. “By partnering with the CT Food Bank and Filling in the Blanks to bring more healthy food resources to the community, I know we can alleviate some of the financial struggles of our neighbors,” she said in a press release. awolff@newstimes.com; 203-731-3333; @awolffster Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW iLife V1 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner for $98 + free shipping GearBestPosted 23 hr 18 min ago SHOP NOW Walmart Early Bird Holiday Specials Sale WalmartPosted 1 day 2 hr ago SHOP NOW Air Hogs Helix Sentinel 720p Video Drone for $128 + free shipping WalmartPosted 20 hr 51 min ago SHOP NOW Sta-Bil 32-oz.

Picture: socialistworker.org Take a walk down any street you’ve walked down before and unless you live in an area where a forest fire or flood has transformed the landscape (something all too plausible in 2016), it will likely look more or less the same as it looked a year ago. You will see people going about their business, doing the usual stuff, going to work, buying groceries, getting ready for the new school year. Perhaps trees and shrubs look a little different, but by and large, everything remains the same. Or so it appears. During the last year, there has been a dramatic and rapid change in political consciousness and while the 2016 presidential race gives some sense of what’s different, the change is even more profound than the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump suggests. There’s a way to measure this even if polling by the mainstream media has moved on now that Bernie Sanders is out of the presidential race. An unprecedented number of students and young people are headed to (International Socialist Organisation) ISO meetings at campuses across the US this fall. Sanders’ defeat by Hillary Clinton – and his subsequent decision to endorse her – has created a political vacuum for a huge audience of people energised by his left-wing message and identification with socialism. “Sanders and his use of the term ‘democratic socialism’ started the domino effect that led me to becoming a socialist,” Zakariya Uddin said. In mid-September, Uddin attended a meeting entitled “The fight for a socialist future” sponsored by ISO at the University of Maryland in College Park. It was the first time Uddin had ever attended a socialist meeting. “The controversy surrounding him identifying as a socialist led me to look into what exactly socialism meant,” Uddin said. From there, I discovered socialist publications like Jacobin and Socialist Worker and was able to understand and agree with what socialism actually is.” Consider this, Sanders received 30% more votes from young voters (people under 30) than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined. With his assault on the billionaire class and urgent calls to tax the rich, create jobs and address threats to the environment, Sanders inspired this younger generation in a way no mainstream politician has in decades. But then he did the unthinkable – after spending a year criticising Clinton as the candidate of Walmart, war and Wall Street, Sanders endorsed her. And so, as the mainstream media was consigning the socialist candidacy of Sanders to a quixotic and largely irrelevant footnote of the 2016 election, millions of young people were embarking on a journey to figure out what they should do next. They had believed Sanders when he said the national political debate must be enlarged to include the idea of socialism and now that Sanders had abandoned that project with his endorsement of Clinton, these young people started looking elsewhere. Emma Ward, a sophomore at State University of New York New Paltz, said: “Bernie was the reason I went to the ISO’s kickoff event last year featuring Danny Katch. I knew I liked the idea of socialism, but I didn’t know much about it at all. I learned an incredible amount and realised how progressive my politics were as I spent more time around the group.” Uddin said war has played a big part in his political radicalisation. “A large portion of my interest in socialist ideas stems from my disgust with American imperialism. Having seen that military action in places like Palestine, Syria, Iraq is driven by the profit motive, I find that socialism attacks the very root cause of imperialism. “Additionally, rising economic inequality throughout America and the rest of the world serves as an irrefutable condemnation of capitalism, indicating to me that socialism is the only path to a truly just society,” Uddin said. The contrast between the urgency of the problems facing people and the planet and the business as usual figure of Hillary Clinton is the perfect illustration of what’s wrong with mainstream politics, which explains Kelsey Aaron’s decisions to join the ISO two months ago at the University of Vermont in Burlington. Aaron said: “I’m an environmental studies major and all throughout my first year last year, I was learning how the earth is a distraught and messed-up place. I was getting tired of a system that never created any real change while the state of our world was getting worse by the hour. “I went to a presentation that an ISO member, Sharon Smith, gave and from there, I was hooked. I realised that all of these problems that I was frustrated about would never get better under a capitalist society and that socialism was the only real solution.” The gulf between mainstream politics and the ideas of a new generation are so obvious because the system’s two main representatives are backward. Trump throws out red meat to his reactionary base with the slogan “Make America great again.” Clinton’s response? “America is already great.” So it falls to unlikely figures like San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to courageously say what no politician has the guts to. The national anthem and the US flag are symbols of the racism this country was built on and the epidemic of police murder of black and brown people the political elite are indifferent to. Sure, Kaepernick has attracted some abuse but also an incredible amount of support. Ward said she went to a speech on campus by Michael Moore a few weeks ago and an ISO meeting the following day. “Michael Moore started off pretty radical, speaking about voter suppression and the guilt being thrown onto people who support third parties. “He stressed the importance of voting to us. However, toward the end of his speech, he turned on the Hillary switch and completely contradicted his previous argument, telling us to vote for her even though we might hate her. “One of my comrades, Molly, challenged his position, saying voting is not the most political thing one can do and that real change comes from the bottom. “The fight for a socialist future will ensure every marginalised group under the capitalist system will come together to reclaim their space in this world, which was created by nature without borders and discrimination. “The kickoff event featuring Sherry Wolf was electric and inspiring. We had blitzed the campus and handed out fliers in town for two weeks leading up to the event. The discussion after the talk elicited many questions about the election, such as the varying prospects for a revolution under Trump versus Clinton and how we will organise people on November 9 (the day after the election),” Ward said. Many who are part of this new audience for radical politics have already begun teaching themselves about socialist ideas. Uddin said: “Having radicalised and grown more knowledgeable about socialism over the past couple of years I felt the need to organise and effect change. I’ve lived in an area devoid of any sort of left organisation for most of my life, so when I came to the University of Maryland, I sought out the ISO, knowing it was an organisation that strived for the same ideals I did, and whose members I could learn from.” But it’s not just about the ideas. This new generation wants to take action and the left needs to prepare itself to arm a new generation with the lessons of the past to build the strongest possible fight for a just future. – socialistworker.org -Eric Ruder mboneni RELATED ARTICLES Comments and Analysis Our African Criminal Court Comments and Analysis Rise of state intolerance Comments and Analysis Climate changers must advance to lower temperatures NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Well, she’s right. They’re not. In modern usage, a progressive is someone who fights for progress on issues of social and economic justice and is somewhere to the left of the term “liberal.” Clinton has described her running mate Tim Kaine as “a progressive who likes to get things done.” If Clinton and Kaine are progressives, then the word has become meaningless. The Clinton/Kaine ticket represents a continuation of the Democratic Party’s tradition of paying lip service to progressive causes then abandoning them once in power. Clinton worked as a union-busting corporate lawyer and served on the board of directors of Walmart, yet she would like you to believe that she is a champion for working families. Clinton’s corporatist stance is reflected in her support for the TPP, a position she was forced to flip on when it became clear how unpopular the secretly negotiated trade deal had become. Add to this the millions of dollars that corporations have donated to her campaign and paid her in speech fees, and it becomes difficult to take any pro-worker rhetoric from Clinton seriously. When it comes to foreign policy, Clinton is probably the most hawkish Democratic nominee since Lyndon Johnson. This trend goes back to her support for the Iraq War, but is most disturbingly apparent in her tenure as Secretary of State. At the State Department, Clinton supported a disastrous U.S. intervention in Libya, backed a coup in Honduras that led to a drastic increase in murder and rape and attempted to convince President Obama to intervene militarily in the Syrian civil war. And, of course, she supports targeted assassinations without due process through the use of drone strikes. Clinton falls short of being a progressive when it comes to environmental issues, as well. She supports fracking, and as Secretary of State, promoted the ecologically destructive practice across the globe as a way to undermine Russia’s energy sector. The leader of her transition team, Ken Salazar, also supports fracking, the TPP and the Keystone XL pipeline. Kaine has a disappointing record of his own on the environment, and all three have accepted large donations from the fossil fuel industry. Clinton’s choice of Kaine as her running mate is an obvious attempt to reach out to conservatives who are disgusted with the Republican nominee. Kaine’s record is full of conservative positions on topics like marriage equality, reproductive choice, labor, free trade and finance. During the 2005 race for governor of Virginia, Kaine explicitly described himself in ads as a conservative, saying, “I oppose gay marriage, I support restrictions on abortion – no public funding and parental consent – and I’ve worked to pass a state law banning partial-birth abortion.” Kaine also has a record of supporting corporate interests over those of American workers. He’s vocally supported Virginia’s anti-union right-to-work law and was among a group of senators pushing for fast-track approval of the TPP. This summer, right before being tapped as Clinton’s running mate, Kaine signed two letters to financial regulators urging lax regulation on banks. The message to finance was clear: Tim Kaine will go to bat for you in the White House (oh, and please donate to our campaign). I hope it goes without saying that none of this means that I want to see a crazed racist oligarch like Donald Trump and his homophobic bigot of a running mate in the White House. If you’re LGBT, Muslim or a woman who would like to control your own body, there are very real material differences between the candidates. The question is, should liberals and progressives be willing to accept a Democratic ticket that is better on multicultural and women’s issues if it’s packaged with perpetual war and corporate dominance of our political system? I realize that as a straight, nonreligious man, I have the privilege of not being directly affected by the abortion restrictions or the erosions of LGBT and Muslims’ civil rights that a Trump/Pence administration could put in place. However, anyone planning on voting for Clinton must recognize that they also enjoy certain privileges, like not being an Afghan civilian at risk of being killed by the drone strikes that a Clinton administration will certainly conduct or not living in a country at risk of “regime change” with Clinton as president. The only way to stop the Democratic Party’s steady rightward trend is for Democratic voters to demand that politicians like Clinton uphold progressive values. If the Democratic base wants to reject corporate Trojan horses like the TPP, institute humane foreign policy and get Clinton’s promised debt-free college and paid family leave, they must place sustained critical pressure on her administration. Based on what I’ve seen of Democratic partisans’ willingness to hold their party accountable, I’m not holding my breath.

Areotek, Birch Run Premium Outlets, Independent Bank, Magliner, Morley Companies, Nexteer, Rehmann, Saginaw Bay Underwriters, and Walmart are some of some of the featured employers. While the career fair is somewhat informal, those attending should treat the event as if they are meeting a possible employer. Appropriate attire and behavior at the fair is encouraged. “If students cannot make this fair, Career Services will be hosting several more throughout the year,” said Mike Major, the director of Career Services. “The Cardinal Career Network online job database has opportunities as well. At any given time, there are approximately 800 active postings on the site.” Everyone can attend the employment fair, and it will be held mostly in the banquet rooms on the second floor of Curtiss Hall. “I encourage undecided students to attend the employment fair because speaking with the organizations can give them an idea of what opportunities are available,” Major said. “Also, undecided students can network with the employers and might line up job shadow opportunities or informational interviews to learn more about industries they might be familiar with.” Recruiting trends are changing, so employers are trying to re-shift their recruiting to target interns and graduates. The positions that will be at the fair range from part-time, full-time, interns and volunteers. “Only 20 percent of jobs are found online, and 80 percent of jobs are found through networking,” Major said. “If employers tell you that you have to apply online, they are being honest with you. The employers go to the employment fair to meet you, and then they will look for your name on their database.” Students in the health field may be interested in visiting the booths of Mclaren Bay Region and Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center, along with many others. Communication students should note that representatives from radio stations WSGW AM&FM as well as the television station WSMH/WEYI/WBSF will have a booth. Other companies hosting booths include Bed Bath & Beyond and Chemical Bank. Americorps will also have a booth to check out, as well as Consumers Energy, which will have a booth for interns in fields such as chemical engineering and electrical engineering. “Employers report the reason it is hard to hire people is that potential hires are lacking Interpersonal Communication skills,” Major said. Networking allows students to see what other opportunities are in the job field, and meeting people at the fair is a great way to start one’s network. At the job fair, professional photos will be taken for student’s LinkedIn profiles, which allows you to connect with your family, friends, classmates, and faculty on a professional level.

Look for a new column every day and send your questions to askamy@amydickinson.com. Abuse victim (Photo: iStockphoto) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Dear Amy: I was sexually assaulted by a man at a party when I was 17. I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-through at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? — Stuck at 17 Dear Stuck: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at (800) 656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. ITHACA JOURNAL Ask Amy: STD disclosure places partner at risk Dear Amy: My son recently got married, and although I hosted a nice reception dinner and was appropriately dressed for the wedding, I was not invited to participate in any of the wedding photos. Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests and it was only afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn’t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride’s family prior to the wedding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am I wrong? — Mother of the Groom Dear Mother of the Groom: Whether your son and his wife were deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless when it came to photos, your reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely justified. They owe you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one, you would accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing to receive this album (an understandable, but not really generous reaction), a gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. Dear Amy: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a while, but caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper, but better yet: RUN! — Siri Dear Siri: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis.

Moore resets after mom’s breast cancer battle, scripts film By Yvette Caslin  |  October 2, 2016 1:35 PM EST  |  1 Tangie Black Moore (Photo credit: Tier 2 Films) On Oct. 8, 2016, on BET’s Centric “Hollywood Hearts” premieres at 8 p.m. The romantic drama is the brainchild of award-winning singer and performer Bobby V who leads the cast in this complicated love story. Bobby Wilson is a music artist living the typical rock star lifestyle of flash, too many females and an inflated ego. He is battling internal struggles and finds it difficult to give up for the woman he loves and the life he wants to build. After a tragic turn of events and friend-interventions, he realizes who and what really matter. “Hollywood Hearts” is directed, written and executive produced by Tangie B. Moore of Tier 2 Films. Since co-founding Tier 2 Films, with her husband Ric Atari, Moore has inked several deals and placements with Discovery Studios, WEtv, EOne, Sprite, BET Entertainment/Viacom and Samsung. Here, Moore tells readers how she and Bobby V. met, how her mother’s death in 2008 after a battle with breast cancer has impacted her, and the joys of family and filmmaking. Tell us your backstory. I published Good News magazine for a little over six years, from 1999 to 2006. I am a journalist by trade. I love telling stories. I am a storyteller. The digital revolution happened and news moved to online, print media lost its way for a little while. Good News was a glossy, full color general interest, lifestyle magazine that distributed nationally. We were on the newsstands between Essence and Upscale magazines. With blogs and other online media outlets coming up, the print world took a hit. My mother, Glenda J. Black, was my co-publisher, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. With all that was going on in print media. We printed our last issue with Tyra Banks on the cover in 2006. I was at a cross road. I asked God, what do I do now? This has been my life, my dream, my passion. My husband he said, ‘You are still a storyteller. That doesn’t change. It’s your passion. How will you take it and move forward?’ My answer was television and film. I decided to transition these stories from print to the screen. I wrote and directed my first independent film in 2010, All I Want. I was able to get a really cool distribution deal with Walmart 30 days later. It was better than I thought. The film did well. I kept honing my craft and developed myself as a director and writer. We did “Couples Therapy” which aired on BET last year. The Creator, the Universe has been supporting my steps in everything I set out to do. I am blessed to be able to have a certain amount of success. It has been a journey. Everything that I hoped for I am realizing and it’s coming to pass. Where is your hometown? This is a funny story. I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. We moved to Atlanta in 1991. It’s so funny everything that is going on with the presidential elections. I grew up with Chelsea [Clinton]. Bill Clinton and Hillary were actually good friends of my parents. [Moore’s dad is a prominent Atlanta minister — Rev. Jerry D. Black, pastor of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church.] Your mom was a very, very beautiful spirit. Thank you … she is so missed. She is looking down. I know that she is very supportive. I hear her every day. She is very much still in the picture. [Glenda J. Black’s, B.A., M.Ed., career spanned as a teacher, real estate agent and magazine publisher. The first lady of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church for 16 years founded the Sisters of Faith non-profit organization, which was dedicated to promoting breast cancer awareness and survival. In her obituary, her family described her as a woman who “faced her personal challenges with cancer with tremendous fortitude, poise and grace. Glenda became a strong example of how to endure hardness as a good soldier.” She died on Thursday, July 3, 2008, at her home.] She was my life, she was my rock. It was really a rough time for me when she passed away. My best friend and husband said we are going to get back up, that’s what she’d want for you. And he said, let’s go [all hands on deck] for this film company. What’s the origin of the concept for Hollywood Hearts? “Hollywood Hearts” is Bobby V. and Ben Brown’s concept. They brought it to me. I liked it. I went away and wrote the script. They brought me on to direct the film. It’s lightly based on Bobby’s life in a sense. As he goes through the evolution, he realizes love conquers all and is the last thing standing. The other stuff is an illusion. He gets over himself when he understands his truth. Tell us what “going away to write” means for you? I leave my home. I am a wife and mother of three: Yahliel, 12; Kindred, 9; and Mica, 6. The film company, Tier 2, is busy. I am being courted to be a writer for a show on NBC. I came up with a scripted series and they love it. I am in communication with Dreamworks and NBC about it. We have a show premiering next year on weTV. We have a whole lot going on on the business side in TV and film. We are really making our imprint in the industry. When I say step away, I really hone in. I like to tell stories that are multilayered, to really relate to the characters and to focus on stories that will really move an audience. When I am trying to get it done relatively quickly, I have a special spot that I go to for three to five days to escape and get quiet. How did you and Bobby V. meet? I didn’t know Bobby V. personally. Ben introduced us. Bobby told me what he really wanted to do. I’d only heard about him and I was curious if he could handle acting. We laugh about it today. He has become a really good friend, he’s warmhearted, a good guy and jokester who kept us laughing on set. I was really proud of how well he did in the film especially considering he’s never led a film before. It’s his first lead role.

(Photo: AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Taking our trees In regard to Eric Adams’ Sept. 30 letter about the dying trees in Palm Springs: That is not isolated to Palm Springs and possibly has nothing to do with watering. There is apparently a disease going through the valley and mature trees and even shrubs and ground cover are dying at an alarming rate. Pepper trees and pine trees are being particularly hit hard but the disease is spreading to olive trees, queen palms, other trees, and even shrubs. Just look at The River in Rancho Mirage, the Walmart Neighborhood Center on Highway 111 in Palm Desert, the street trees on Highway 111 in Indian Wells, the pine trees on Haystack Road in Palm Desert, etc. Based on my observations, it is not inconceivalbe that we could lose 30-40 percent of our landscaping in the desert within a few years. I think people haven’t yet noticed the problem because the trees start off with one dead branch and then it slowly spreads to the rest of the tree and slowly kills it over the next year or so. Let’s hope landscapers and others address this issue soon before we lose all our trees and shrubs. Britt W. Wilson, Palm Desert Different ways to cure Hats off to Gov. Brown. This week he signed the “Right to Try” law. This gives doctors the ability to try treatments not approved by the FDA. The lives this will save are legion and I am a perfect example. In 2006, after the doctors at the VA hospital had tried all approved medications. I was sent home and told I had three weeks to three months to live. My wife was unwilling to accept their prognosis and stopped at a local health store. The clerk (whom we view as an angel) opened a large red book (PDR for Herbal Medicines). Under my condition she found a regimen of treatment. Shortly after my recovery, a respectable physician told us the reason they could not prescribe “non-FDA approved” medications is due to their malpractice insurance. Now, 10 years later I have shared my success story with many others and will continue to do so. My advice: Ask medical professionals about possible herbal medicines. Rick Raum, Banning Not a fan of Dzuro Dear Indio voters, I have lived in Thornton, Colorado, for one month now having moved from Sun City Shadow Hills in Indio. When I moved to Shadow Hills 1 1/2 years ago, as a retiree, I thought this would be my forever home where I would enjoy peace the rest of my life. This was not to be. Under the presidency of Joan Dzuro on our board of directors, she implemented such outrageous rules that my days became too unhappy. I, like many others, have moved away to a more flexible lifestyle. Dzuro favored our security patrol hiding on side streets in an effort to fine us $200 for our first offense of any moving violation. This fine doubled within a year for a second offense for anyone living at the same address, be it the same driver or spouse! She installed video and audio cameras at the reception areas at both of our lovely clubhouses to prevent residents from any misbehavior towards employees otherwise fines would be implemented. I suggest you look at other candidates who will bring happiness and peace to Indio.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Water available for Corry-area residents affected by leak Sunday Oct 2, 2016 at 12:48 PM Oct 3, 2016 at 5:51 AM Staff report CORRY  Water for drinking and flushing was being made available to Corry-area residents Sunday while the search continued for a large water main break in the area, authorities said. Also Sunday, the Corry Area School District announced on its website that all district schools and all activities were canceled for Monday due to the water issue. Two locations in Corry  the Salvation Army, 127 W. Washington St., and the Columbus Fire Station on West Main Street  have free bottled drinking water available for area residents, said Lyn Wittmer, the Conelway Regional Emergency Management Agency emergency coordinator. Water can also be purchased at Walmart, 961 E. Columbus Ave., as a new shipment arrived Sunday morning, Wittmer said. Residents can also pick up buckets of water at seven locations in the city of Corry and Columbus Township to use for flushing, said Wittmer. The sites are: a Washington Street parking lot between China Jade Chinese restaurant and Corry Fire Station Number 2; Chord Road; Airport Road Apartments; Snyder Circle Apartments; Shawnee Village Mobile Home Park; Corry Area Primary School parking lot; and the Columbus Fire Department in Columbus Township. Corry Police Cpl. Mark Morrison said that a leak was discovered about four days ago. Authorities on Saturday advised residents in Corry, Concord Township, Wayne Township and Columbus Village to boil their drinking water due to the "serious extensive water leak." The Corry Water Department was out "en masse" looking for the source of the leak, Morrison said. Officials encouraged residents who see any leaks that appear suspicious to call 814-964-8084.

Home Radio Video Audio The Andrew Carrington Hitchcock AFP Show Archives Free Stuff Support Store Subscribe About Login Militarized Cops Shoot Autistic Boy But No One Cares Because He’s White October 02, 2016   chris   3 Comments No one in the mainstream media seems to care about a young Autistic boy, who was shot to death by police while sat peacefully next to his father in the family car, because he doesn’t fit the current narrative that racist white cops are targeting black males. The reality is, police are militarized today and many have become threats to all of us. By Janice Matthews Few Americans know that a six-year-old first-grader, Jeremy David Mardis, was shot to death by two Marksville, La. deputy city marshals on Nov. 3, 2015 when they fired 18 rounds into the car he was sitting in with his father, Christopher Few. Five of those bullets struck Jeremy, killing him instantly, while his father survived being critically wounded, hit twice in the head and chest. Both marshals who fired into the car, Derrick Stafford, 23, and Norris Greenhouse Jr., 32 were black. Both Jeremy and his dad were white. The victims were not brandishing weapons, hadn’t posted incendiary anti-police rhetoric on their social media pages, and were not trying to grab the marshals’ guns or run away from them. In fact, police body-cam footage of the carnage, released this week in an evidentiary hearing in the case against the marshals, who have been charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder and will go to trial in November, show Few had his hands up and clearly visible when the marshals inexplicably opened fire. Little Jeremy, who was autistic, was in the seat next to his dad with his seat belt on. Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More . . . Yet in spite of this video evidence that Few’s hands were up and empty before the shooting began, no “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” protest has ensued. No one is burning local businesses or looting the Walmart. Protestors have not shut down roads or interstate traffic or even burned any cop cars. The media has not devoted round-the-clock coverage to endlessly looping the graphic video punctuated by volatile, incendiary speeches from white church or civic leaders calling for national outrage over whites being shot and killed by racist black cops. Place your ad here Loading… The facts in this case simply don’t fit the currently accepted narrative of what police violence in America looks like. Black men being killed by cops—whether or not they’re involved in a crime or brandishing a weapon at the time of the shooting—is deemed indisputable evidence of institutional racism. White men—and little boys, in this case—being killed by cops is most often mentioned by reports, if it is reported at all, simply as tragic accidents. The calm, measured response to the horrific killing of a little boy by what should be trusted authorities is even more remarkable given the disclosure that Stafford—who emptied his semi-automatic revolver’s clip of hollow-point bullets into Few and Jeremy—“has shown a pattern of using excessive force on other people who didn’t pose a threat, according to Louisiana prosecutors,” wrote AP. The state attorney general’s office argued in court filings that Stafford’s previous “bad acts” show he is “motivated to use excessive violent force against individuals he interacts with …,” according to their recent court filing arguing the jury should be informed of his violent history. They wrote Stafford used a stun gun on a man who was handcuffed as well as on a young mother who had been placed in a police car, and broke the arm of a 16-year-old girl while stopping a fight on a school bus.   There are certainly many good cops in America, who put themselves in the line of fire to protect citizens every day. Yet the militarization of today’s police forces, via both equipment and training, has led to far too many out-of-control “soldiers” who take to the streets with a mentality of ruthlessly going after “the enemy.” All too often, the perceived enemy is the very citizens that pay to be protected and served. To quell the rising surge of police violence, law enforcement personnel who are committing brutality and murder must be held to account just like any other American criminal, as is the case now for Stafford and Greenhouse in Louisiana. On a wider scale, law enforcement training must be de-militarized. Techniques for de-escalating situations must once again be taught and reinforced and military equipment now being used by police departments around the country must be decommissioned, so that police officers begin to truly protect and serve the citizens they now view as the enemy. Janice Matthews is a writer and editor, who lives in Florida.

Not you. You are completely missing the point ;D Its a white genocide plan that works by inducing white guilt instead of informing people that 3rd world nations are RESPONSIBLE for the state of their nations, just as we are responsible for our own – and for our own lives. Thats what he’s talking about. (also, vaccines prob cause autism) Danielle Tate says: October 3, 2016 at 11:13 Excuse me, but plenty of us are pissed about Jeremy’s death. He was autistic; the entire autism community knows his name, just like we know the names of other autistics killed by police (many of which, by the way, are both black and autistic–a deadly combination). Don’t accuse us of not caring just because he was white. He was *six*. He was innocent. He might not fit the profile of the average autistic victim of a trigger-happy policeman, but that doesn’t mean we don’t care when the police shoot one of our own. Many of us have had good cops save our lives, or our autistic kids’ lives, and we wish there were more like that. But we can’t stay deluded into thinking that trigger-happy jerkwads like the people involved in Jeremy Mardis’s murder don’t exist, because they do.

The legendary Tuskegee Airmen have been the subject of a documentary, filmed by two Augusta-area partners, that's still growing in popularity. Bryan Williams and Denton Adkinson are still making history. After debuting their world-class historical documentary about the famed Tuskegee Airmen at the Imperial Theatre in 2009, the two Augusta-area partners in Bryton Entertainment continue to see their work hit the big-time. It hit Walmart stores across the country in late 2011. In early 2012 the two attended the premiere of George Lucas’ Red Tails feature film on the black fighter and bomber units that distinguished themselves and their country in World War II. The cast of Red Tails had viewed Bryton’s documentary during shooting – prompting Lucas himself to write a letter of appreciation to Williams and Adkinson. In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education used a clip from Bryton’s In Their Own Words: The Tuskegee Airmen to inspire departing high school seniors in some 20 states. Last March, the documentary was screened in more than 200 theaters nationwide. Then just recently, on Sept. 18 – the anniversary of the birth of the U.S. Air Force – the film was aired on the worldwide American Forces Network, serving some 1 million members of the armed forces, their families and civilian support staff serving in some 170 countries abroad and at sea. It has, in short, become one of the most-viewed Augusta productions in memory. And it shows no signs of stopping. The documentary – which just happens to have also aired on Atlanta’s WSB-TV last Sunday – is currently being syndicated to television affiliates across the country for airing in early 2017. National sponsors are currently being sought to underwrite the broadcasts. Those advertisers would be wise to jump aboard; In Their Own Words is a vital part not just of African-American history, but of American history. As we wrote last April, the Tuskegee Airmen broke the racial barrier – then helped break the back of the Nazi war machine. One of their missions included a little-heralded Doolittle-style long-range raid on Berlin. Sadly, as you can imagine, they came home to a welcome wholly unbefitting veterans and war heroes. The good news is, they’ve been increasingly cited and honored in recent years, and some have blessedly been here to witness it. And their story lives on in an Augusta-area documentary whose audience continues to grow. Filmmakers Williams and Adkinson ultimately hope to get a form of the documentary into schools across the country, perhaps with accompanying curriculum materials to bring the story alive for generations to come. The two have been neck-deep in other projects as well, including promotions for the new Ronald McDonald House in Augusta. And with Adkinson as director of photography, Bryton had a big hand in the documentary film Happy, about Augusta artist Leonard “Porkchop” Zimmerman, and his emotional “Happy” art project that has seen his minimalist-but-merry robot portrait pop up on streets on several continents. That film, too, is growing in audience and exposure, having been accepted to the Milwaukee Film Festival, Savannah Film Festival and the Chelsea Film Festival in New York. These guys aren’t content to keep making history. They want to change the future too.

That was the story for back-to-school 2016 — a match that, while not exactly made in retail heaven, helped local stores move more merchandise than last year. But because of steep price cuts, a 3.2 percent bump in transactions didn’t result in overall sales growth compared with last year. In fact, sales at stores across New York state slid 0.2 percent from 2015 levels, despite the easy comparisons against disastrously weak results last year, according to payments processing firm First Data. “The number of swipes grew at a robust rate — it’s just that people are shopping more for discounted goods compared to a year ago,” said Rishi Chhabra, First Data vice president of information and analytics. New Yorkers had bargains galore to choose from as stores, including Walmart and Target, relentlessly hyped deep discounts and rolled out new technology to encourage shopping in-store, online on home computers or on mobile devices. While unemployment has declined since the Great Recession, many New Yorkers are still scraping by with too little income. Perhaps that’s why used clothing stores were the big winner in New York in July and August, with a 7.7 percent sales gain. Other standouts were cosmetic retailers, up 7.3 percent, and sports apparel stores, with a 6.6 percent gain. Losers included men’s clothing stores, down 6 percent, and shoe stores, with a 5.9 percent drop, First Data said. Nationwide, back-to-school sales grew 1.1 percent. Continuing to corral market share from brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce sales climbed 10 percent. However, even e-commerce logged a slower growth rate than last year, while the Commerce Department’s core retail sales for August failed to meet economists’ expectations of a slight gain, instead slipping 0.1 percent from July. Ahead of the all-important holiday selling season, savvy local retailers are letting customers choose from an ever-widening array of online and in-store shopping and shipping combinations — while trying to reestablish a trip through the brick-and-mortar doors as a fun alternative to that omnipresent mobile phone screen. Downtown children’s clothing and furniture chain Babesta logged modest back-to-school sales gains, but revenue jumped sharply during a recent “wine and juice boxes” event, complete with black-and-white cookies echoing the palette of gender-neutral clothing collection Nununu. “Retailers have to step up their game and deliver something exceptional,” said owner Jennifer Cattaui.

(KOIN) Related Coverage Brown calls endorsing Measure 97 a “difficult decision” Could corporate tax put Powell’s out of business? PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Supporters of a corporate tax proposal went door-to-door Saturday, urging citizens to vote “yes” on the measure come November. But opponents say they’re also working hard to inform people about negative impacts of the proposed tax. The Yes on 97 campaign told KOIN 6 News their goal is talk with more than 400,000 voters before election day arrives. “The great thing about this ballot measure, you have to do $25 million in sales… and these are the Walmarts and the Chevrons,” Yes on 97 campaign press secretary Katherine Dreissen said. “They already pay more taxes in other parts of the country.” If the measure passes, it would levy a 2.5% tax on the gross sales receipts of businesses with more than $25 million in annual sales. The intention is for the money to fund health care, education and senior services. But some opponents said they’re concerned businesses will end up passing on the increased cost to consumers. They’re also worried it could result in job cuts. “It’s a sales tax in sheep’s clothing,” one voter said. Employees at Gresham Ford said they’re concerned the tax will lead to an increase in car prices, which would make them less competitive with Washington dealerships.

 There's a major flaw with central bank assumptions Patrick Watson, Mauldin Economics Oct. 3, 2016, 4:36 PM 1,504 facebook linkedin twitter email print Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016, before the Senate Banking Committee hearing on: 'The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.' Susan Walsh/AP For the world’s top central banks, “the blind leading the blind” isn’t just a proverb. It’s reality. A European Central Bank official recently said the ECB wants our Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in December. Why is that? In their twisted minds, it will confirm that years of monetary insanity actually worked. ECB policy is far crazier than anything the Fed has done. We don’t have negative nominal interest rates, at least not yet. Ben Bernanke’s three rounds of quantitative easing were smaller (relative to GDP) than the ECB’s asset purchases. But the ECB is on the wrong track whether the Fed raises rates or not. The major flaw with central bank assumptions Central bankers have a much bigger problem. Persistently low and sometimes negative rates are proving that their core assumptions about the economy are wrong. For the last century, the standard response to economic weakness was simple: stimulate activity with lower interest rates. Make it less expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money, and they’ll spend more freely and the economy will grow. That’s the theory. But here's the fatal flaw: Low interest rates motivate people to borrow money only when they are confident they can pay it back. With banks blowing up in 2008–2009, home prices cratered and companies laid off workers. And very few of us felt that kind of confidence. Those memories still persist. Just look at the Great Depression of the 1930s. Those who lived through that time remained cautious their whole lives. Our generation has learned the same hard lesson. It gets worse. The near-zero and now below-zero rates did inspire borrowing… by the very wealthy. People who didn’t need free cash took it anyway. Then they used it to bid up asset prices and create the current real estate and stock market bubbles. QE blew those bubbles even bigger. At the same time, retirees living off their savings responded to zero yields, not by spending more, but by spending less and saving more. As recently as late 2007, anyone could make a 5% or more, no-risk return in plain vanilla bank accounts or Treasury bills. Central banks intentionally killed that opportunity and still haven’t restored it. I doubt they ever will. In fact, they just had a chance to do it and didn’t. The longer the Fed waits to hike rates, the more radical its response will be when the next recession comes. This is why I think we will see negative interest rates and cash controls here in the US. The only question is when. The Fed is out of touch with real life You might wonder why the Fed and other central banks don’t see the folly of their ways. I think it’s because they look inward. They get their advice from academic economists who live in ivory towers. They don’t know what real life is like for average people. So, how can we make them understand? Here’s a simple idea that Congress could pass tomorrow: Require all Federal Reserve governors to spend two weeks a year working in some kind of blue-collar job. They can be Wal-Mart cashiers, airport skycaps, taxi or Uber drivers. They can sling fries at McDonald’s. The point is to show them what economic reality looks like for the people they supposedly serve. Do this and the Fed’s leadership will learn what average Americans—and yes, even older, working Americans like themselves (Yellen is 70, vice chair Stanley Fischer is 72)—must do to make ends meet. I feel confident the experience would improve Fed policy and help the economy. And if not? It will at least deliver a little bit of justice.

 7 once dominant retailers that are now on the verge of bankruptcy Hayley Peterson Oct. 3, 2016, 2:05 PM 25,634 facebook linkedin twitter email print A woman walks by stoves in the appliance section at a Sears store in Schaumburg, Illinois. Thomson Reuters Seven major retailers have a high risk of going bankrupt within the next two years, according to a Fitch Ratings report. The at-risk companies include: Sears Holdings, Claire's Stores, True Religion Apparel, Nine West Holdings, Rue21, 99 Cents Only Stores, and Nebraska Book Company. If and when those companies default, it's likely they will be liquidated, according to the 114-page report. Retailers are almost three times as likely to be liquidated after filing for bankruptcy than companies in other industries, according to the report. For the report, Fitch Ratings analyzed 30 retail bankruptcies — half of which ended in liquidation. In each case, researchers determined that the same pressures were weighing on business: declining shopper traffic to malls; the rise of e-commerce; shifts in consumer spending away from apparel and accessories and more toward experiences like dining out and entertainment; and the rise of pricing competition from discount chains like dollar stores and Walmart. "Most of the retailers at high risk of default are challenged by declining mall traffic, competition from online and other types of retailers, and/or a lack of a compelling product line," researchers wrote. "Highly leveraged capital structures may become unsustainable in the face of these challenges." Here's a list of the high-yield bonds and loans "of concern" to Fitch Ratings: Fitch Ratings SEE ALSO: Kmart is closing 64 more stores and laying off thousands of employees — see if your store is on the list NOW WATCH: How to pick the perfect watch for the office and the weekend Loading video...

Hebron couple fights to end Alzheimer’s disease Sarah Brookbank , sbrookbank@communitypress.com 7:35 p.m. EDT October 3, 2016 Terry Donoghue, 69, and Marge Donoghue, 68, of Hebron, are working to help raise awareness and find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. (Photo: Thanks to Brianne Kistler) HEBRON – More than 2,429 participants and more than $501,500 has been raised for Cincinnati’s Tri-State 2016 Walk to End Alzheimer’s event at Sawyer Point on Oct. 1. Terry Donoghue, 69, and Marge Donoghue, 68, of Hebron, are working to help raise awareness and find a cure for the most common form of dementia. The couple got involved with the Alzheimer’s Association after Marge was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. A neurologist suggested he reached out to help find programs and more information about the disease and caregiving. “We found out about the walk from some people and decided that we needed to participate. I talked it over with my daughters and they said let’s have our own team. My granddaughter came up with name Marge’s Minions and it took off from there,” Terry said. Marge’s Minions raises money by selling chances on Minion items. Minions, from “Despicable Me” and other movies are popular with kids and adults. “I went to some Kroger stores in the area and set up a booth to raise money and awareness on Alzheimer’s. I bought some yellow Minion shirts from Walmart and I had my little minions with me to help raise money,” Terry said. “We were quite successful on both endeavors. At that time we were placed on the planning committee for the walk.” Terry Donoghue said they continue to volunteer so someday a cure will be found for the disease. “Right now Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in America ... and quite possibly the most costly,” Terry Donoghue said. “We know that at our ages we probably won’t be around for the cure but maybe, just maybe, through our efforts and those of others our children, and especially our precious grandchildren, will not have to go through the constant struggle of Alzheimer’s that we are experiencing.” To donate to Marge’s Minions Team visit: http://bit.ly/2cNk7Pj 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dDBMGW TOP VIDEOS Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 More Stories Deters: Tensing jury 'straw poll' unanimous for murder Nov. 17, 2016, 7:39 p.m.

He turned that small business into a chain of nearly 100 Bass Pro Shops megastores with roughly 20,000 workers, and made himself into one of America’s richest men along the way. According to Forbes, he has a net worth of $3.9 billion and ranked 403rd on its list of the world’s billionaires. On Monday, the 68-year-old founder struck a deal to buy rival Cabela’s Inc. CAB, +0.02%   for about $4.5 billion in cash -- essentially doubling his retailing empire. He will remain majority owner of the combined business and hold the title of CEO. He couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. From his headquarters in Springfield, Mo., Morris has competed with giants like Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT, -0.68%   and online rivals by seeking to build a “retail mecca for sportsmen.” Some of his stores are large enough to include waterfalls, saltwater aquariums, ocean-themed bowling alleys and restaurants. At the flagship store in Springfield, Morris, a firearms collector, built the National Rifle Association’s National Sporting Arms Museum in 2013.

Inland Northwest Honor Flight takes wing again, giving vets a chance to remember and, for some, to heal By Eli Francovich elif@spokesman.com(509) 459-5417 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Honor Flight itinerary The tours pack in eight memorials over the course of two days: the World War II Memorial, Air Force Memorial, Arlington National Cemetery, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Korean War Veterans Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, U.S. Navy Memorial and the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial. The mood was mixed at Spokane International Airport early Monday morning: Excitement over the upcoming Honor Flight was for some veterans overshadowed by the memory of those lost in combat. “I feel great,” William Gomez said of his upcoming trip, “but I’m also sad. I think I have more than 10 names on there.” “There” is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. – “the Wall.” Gomez was an infantry soldier in 1967 and 1968, two of the deadliest years in Vietnam. “My kids have been hollering ‘Go to the wall,’ ‘Go to the wall,’ ” he said, pausing. “Maybe to stop me from dreaming.” Gomez was one of 92 veterans from three wars who boarded a flight to the nation’s capital Monday morning. “It’s definitely a time of healing,” said Annie Wilkison, an Honor Flight volunteer who accompanied the group. “And with healing comes a lot of crying.” Wilkison never served in the military, but her husband, who died in 2010, was a Vietnam veteran. Wilkison saw coverage of Honor Flight on TV and decided to start volunteering. “What a great way to honor him and all veterans,” she said of her late husband. She flies with the veterans and accompanies them in Washington, D.C. This is her third trip. Although she doesn’t try to elicit reactions or memories, she’s supportive and attentive if they want to talk. “I let them know it’s OK,” she said. For some of the veterans, particularly those who served during the Vietnam War, the flight serves as a sort of vindication. Wilkison said one veteran told her, “You know I got spit on the last time I got off the airplane.” “It’s critical to do this,” said Jeff Corrick, another volunteer. “They did so much. They didn’t ask, they just went.” Monday’s flight was the 31st hosted by Inland Northwest Honor Flight, said Tony Lamanna director of the nonprofit. So far this year the organization has raised nearly $250,000. Each trip costs about $1,000 per veteran; volunteers pay their own way. Since the program started in 2009, the organization has raised about $2.3 million, Lamanna said. “The money just keeps coming in and we just keep on going,” Lamanna said. “Our funding strictly comes from private donors and civic groups.” One anonymous couple gives the organization $75,000 each year at Christmas, he said. The organization has taken 1,342 veterans to the capital since 2009, Lamanna said. Two charter flights go to Washington, D.C., each year, one in the spring and one in the fall. There’s a waiting list, with priority given to older veterans and those with terminal illnesses. Dick Morris served on a destroyer in the Atlantic Ocean in World War II. He discovered an Honor Flight business card under his windshield at a Wal-Mart in Hayden about six months ago; his car has WWII Veteran license plates, he said. He called and was placed on the next flight. Vietnam veteran Bennie Mazzuca has waited seven years to get a seat on an Honor Flight. While there, the veterans tour war and veteran memorials. The Northwest chapter is part of the larger, national Honor Flight Network. As Gomez lined up to go through security, he called the opportunity “a dream come true.” The retired chef could never afford the trip on his own, he said. And possibly the trip offers something else – a chance to heal. At the airport Gomez is at the end of the line because large crowds scare him. The one football game he’s been to since serving in Vietnam was terrible, he said. He spent the whole time pacing. Now he hopes the trip can bring some peace. “It’s been very hard. Very, very hard. Very hard,” he said of Vietnam’s impact on him. “I just live day to day.” Published: Oct. 3, 2016, 4 p.m.  Tags: Inland Northwest Honor Flight, veterans, Vietnam, Washington DC, World War II Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

People would spurn fossil fuels, convinced that failure to reform would have dire consequences. They would change their habits and willfully incur greater costs, and the markets would accommodate new behavior. This is not happening, however, as many Americans are unconvinced that radical change is necessary or even possible. The majority of American consumers know that fossil fuels created the wealth that gave us the standard of living we enjoy today. Intermittent renewables are not a dependable source of electric power generation available to grid managers in this geographical area. If activists were concerned with clean energy they would have embraced a natural gas pipeline that would lower CO2 emissions compared to fuel oil and make it possible to do better than a Walmart in a space reserved for industry. Political leaders from the attorney general's office to local state representatives appear obsessed with maligning energy companies and less with the profit producing capitalism that creates the wealth they are eager to tax and consume. We can make our voices heard at the polls by supporting the few candidates locally who have created business plans and made payrolls. Worshipping at the altar of global climate change is hurting the New England economy and costing the region needed jobs by denying or delaying energy infrastructure needed for growth.

If the new stuff hasn't been spotted in your area yet, they may be ready to stock the wave following Fracture and Megatronus once they have room. If they got it in. Check the sightings forums and see what people there have to say.

Police on Saturday booked 16-year-old Antonia Lopez into the Douglas County Youth Center, a juvenile detention facility. The charge, treating her as an adult, is expected to be filed this week, according to ABC affiliate KETV7 Omaha. In a press release on Friday, the Omaha Police Department said a pregnant 16-year-old went into labor and then threw the child out of a window after it was delivered. The Police department says officers responded to the Kellom Knolls Apartment Complex near 25th and Cuming Streets Friday morning at 4:12 a.m. Police say that when paramedics arrived, the baby's grandmother was holding the child and administering CPR in the parking lot of the apartment complex. The baby was transported to Creighton University Medical Center where she was formally pronounced dead. Police were able to offer some clarity on what happened early on Friday morning. The teenager apparently went into labor sometime before dawn, but it is still unclear when the infant was born. At 3:40 a.m. Lopez posted a message on her Facebook page, asking if anyone had a car. Antonia Perez According to police, after posting the message, the baby was allegedly thrown out the window and Lopez then told her mother what she had done. The mother ran outside the apartment and found the baby on the grass near the parking lot. She called 911 and began CPR on the infant. Lopez was taken to Creighton for a medical evaluation and then transferred to the detention facility on Saturday, reports the Omaha World-Herald. Lopez's family are in disbelief, saying they didn't know she was even pregnant. “It's caught me by surprise. I just can't believe it. Stunned,” Grandfather to the teen, John Barcelona, said, adding that he had seen her just days before and had no idea she was carrying a baby. “She looked like she was well underweight more than anything else, I would’ve never dreamed that she was pregnant,” Barcelona said. “In my head, I just can’t believe it, I can’t believe it.” Neighbors of the family are having a hard time digesting what happened, says Fox News, most of them saying the family was quiet and kept to themselves, other than to say "Hi" in passing. But Antonia is apparently well-known to juvenile authorities. A year ago, Antonia Lopez and a friend were accused of stealing cell phones from the local Wal-Mart store and concealing them in a pink purse. Both girls denied they had stolen anything when confronted, even refusing to give their real names. Their denials continued even after they were taken to the youth center. But one of the cell phones began ringing in the pink purse, and when a staff member answered the phone, it was the mother of one of the girls who identified both of them. Lopez got six months of probation on charges of "theft by unlawful taking and false information." She has a juvenile review hearing for that case scheduled for Dec. 15, 2016.

She learned that hard work and dedication does pay off. "We do appreciate her for all of her efforts and everything that she has done for Rowan Elementary," Principal Donna Scott said.   "I’m still in shock. I’m shaking!" said Janie Brown. It was not the ordinary day for Brown or the students she’s committed to passing on the power of knowledge to everyday.   "If I miss, it has to be a really good reason," Brown said. Because of that commitment, representatives from the mega-store showed up on Martin Luther King Drive to surprise the deserving teacher with a $490 gift card to supply her classroom..   "I was just asked by a student yesterday, 'Ms. Brown, can I get a tablet?' I said, 'Baby give me a few days to get some money, and I’ll make sure you have tablets," Brown said. Walmart learned from a study that teachers across the country spend $490 of their own money, on average, to prepare their classrooms each year. "I spend maybe two or three hundred and then per week, I’ll probably spend maybe twenty or thirty dollars because I buy other things throughout the week," Brown said. They chipped in to help an instructor known for dedication and going the extra mile for her students.  "You don’t want one child being able to do something the next child can’t do especially when it’s something that you can afford or that’s in your reach," Brown said. Principal Scott was proud of the recognition at Rowan Elementary School.  "It gives them the opportunity to let them know that we care about them and to know that someone appreciates their efforts," Scott said. There were feelings of appreciation from Walmart and pride on the children’s faces who Brown sees as the future.  "They’re the people who will be taking care of me when I can’t take care of myself," Brown said."It lets me know that they believe in their teacher, and they see the good that I do. I think it’s awesome that someone else can see the good that I do." Copyright 2016 WDAM. All rights reserved.

The bonds are expected to sell via negotiation during the week of Oct. 10. Bond proceeds will be used to current and advance refund all or portions of outstanding series 2011B, 2011C, 2011E and 2011F bonds for interest savings, and pay issuance costs. The savings will be taken annually and maturities are expected to match the bonds to be refunded. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are secured by and payable from a senior lien on the net revenues of CEG's water system. KEY RATING DRIVERS SOLID REGULATORY (RATE) ENVIRONMENT: Regulatory oversight over rate-setting has historically presented uncertainty to CEG's financial profile. However, CEG's solid history of obtaining rate case approvals and recently passed legislation provides more timely and consistent rate recovery than was possible previously. STABLE FINANCES TO IMPROVE: The system's all-in annual debt service (ADS) coverage is satisfactory but remains well below Fitch's median for water utilities rated in the 'A' category. However, Fitch expects the most recent rate case coupled with an improved rate recovery environment will likely lead to improved financial results over the next few years. MANAGEABLE CAPITAL NEEDS: Capital plans continue to focus on system reliability and maintenance projects. Annual capital costs have been reduced using enterprise-wide asset management tools that integrate preventative maintenance and better target projects based on needs assessments. ELEVATED DEBT LEVELS: Debt ratios are somewhat high but expected to decline with a mostly pay-as-you-go funded capital plan. FAVORABLE SERVICE TERRITORY: The city of Indianapolis (the city) has a large and well-diversified economy. Consistent employment growth and steady gains in income levels indicate a strengthening ratepayer base. RATING SENSITIVITIES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The 'A' rating on Citizens Energy Group's bonds could be upgraded if improved rate recovery leads to stronger financial metrics and higher free cash flow for capital spending over the next several years. CREDIT PROFILE The system is a largely retail provider of water service to the vast majority of the Indianapolis metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The system has approximately 317,207 customer accounts, including six wholesale customers with volume purchasing contracts. The customer base has remained stable with annual average growth of less than 1% since 2009. SYSTEM ACQUISITION BY CEG On Aug. 26, 2011, CEG acquired the water system from the Indianapolis (the city) Department of Waterworks, assuming all assets and certain liabilities of the system. Organized as a political subdivision of the state of Indiana, CEG is governed by a nine-member board of directors, which is appointed annually by a five-member board of trustees. CEG's board of directors is an executive department of the city and pursuant to statute has exclusive oversight and control of all public utilities acquired by the city. CEG is responsible for the day-to-day operation, maintenance and repair of the water system including management of all utility assets (raw water supply, treatment facilities, etc.) billing and collections, capital planning and other related functions pertinent to providing utility services. CEG has been in operation for over 100 years, providing various utility services to the city and surrounding areas. IMPROVED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT Regulatory oversight, particularly over rate-setting by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), has historically presented uncertainty to CEG's financial profile. The IURC's oversight has hindered timely rate relief in the past, due to a prolonged, two-year period between previous petitions for a permanent rate increase and the IURC's final rate order. During this time, and prior to the acquisition by CEG, the system's ADS coverage remained below 1.0x and reserves were exhausted. However, two significant developments have emerged since then. First, in 2013, the Indiana Legislature passed Senate Enrolled Act 560, which helps to mitigate the effects of regulatory lag by requiring that rate cases take no longer than 300 days from the original filing date. Failure by the IURC to act within the 300-day time frame will result in 50% of the rate request becoming effective immediately, subject to refund if the final order authorizes less than the 50%. In addition, the system is authorized, by law, to petition the IURC for adjustments of basic rates for certain capital costs including water system replacements and upgrades. Secondly, in March 2016, the Indiana Legislature passed Senate Enrolled Act 383 (SEA 383), which enables regulated utilities to adjust rates to recover IURC-approved, but unearned revenue requirements that may result when, for instance, revenues are affected by weather or other factors that can lower demand. SEA 383 is essentially a revenue make-whole mechanism, providing another important offset to previous rate recovery concerns. According to SEA 383, CEG is authorized to add a rider to each residential customer's monthly bill when previous year's collections are less than 98% of total revenue requirements for the year. Properly calculated adjustments shall be approved by the IURC, and once approval is provided, CEG is required to make annual filings for up to four years. After 48 months, a new rate case must be filed. SOLID HISTORY of CEG RATE CASE APPROVAL CEG has a solid track record of filing and receiving approval for periodic rate petitions. The most recent rate case for the water system was filed in mid-2015 and approved by IURC later in 2015 for implementation in 2016. CEG was granted a $27.7 million base revenue increase, which while less than the original rate request still amounted to a 16% overall rate increase. The new rates went into effect on April 22, 2016. Given management's experience effectively managing in the regulated utility space both at CEG and a local investor-owned utility and its favorable history in recent rate petition filings, Fitch is confident future rate cases will be properly managed. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE System financial performance has been stable, albeit below previous expectations over the past three fiscal years. At 1.25x, all-in debt service coverage (DSC) recorded in fiscal 2014 was slightly better than the previous year's 1.19x but did not meet budgeted expectations despite an authorized $15.7 million revenue increase that year. Revenues increased in fiscal 2014 but by only $6 million. Similar results were recorded in fiscal 2015 and, although still satisfactory (at 1.24x all-in) at the current rating level, were lower than expected. The lower actual DSC from the projections was a product of lower billings due to milder weather over the past several years. For fiscal 2016, management projects 1.39x coverage of all debt service, a consequence of higher projected financial margins from the aforementioned rate increase. Margins are expected to improve throughout management's financial forecast with all-in DSC projected to be no less than 1.54x through fiscal 2021. While actual results underperformed projections over the past several years, Fitch believes the projections are attainable and based on reasonable assumptions: the 2016 authorized rate revenues, which are reinforced by SEA 383; modest future rate increases; expected debt service savings related to the 2016B bonds; future debt service from new money bonds (beginning 2019); and manageable increases in operating costs. System liquidity has been adequate, although unrestricted cash has declined over the past few years. Fiscal 2015 ended with roughly $11 million in cash and cash equivalents, which combined with a $30 million working capital line of credit from BMO Harris, brings the system's days liquidity on hand to a solid 160 days. The line of credit is scheduled to expire in 2017 but will likely be extended. MANAGEABLE CAPITAL NEEDS; DEBT LOAD to SLOWLY DECLINE The system's five-year capital improvement plan (CIP) through 2021 totals $236 million, and represents a decline in planned spending over prior CIPs. Management attributes the decline to comprehensive asset management and a paring down of annual spending in light of lower free cash flow relative to expectations over the past two years but especially in fiscal 2016. The focus of the CIP continues to be on system reliability with more than two-thirds of the program dedicated to treatment plant and distribution system improvements, but also addresses water supply and storage. At approximately $149 per customer annually, Fitch considers the capital program manageable. The CIP is expected to be funded primarily on a pay-go basis with a small portion funded from existing bond proceeds and future debt. The system's debt profile remains elevated, with debt per customer at $3,020 and debt per capita at $1,014, but has steadily declined since the system was acquired by CEG in 2011. Debt carrying costs are somewhat high but typical of a utility system with annual debt service comprising roughly 40% of annual system revenues. With CEG's plans to increase the amount of equity funding for capital projects over the next five years, the debt burden is expected to slowly decline. Amortization of existing debt is slow with 35% of principal retired by 2025. Amortization accelerates somewhat over the following 10 years with 86% of outstanding principal maturing within 20 years. LARGE AND DIVERSE SERVICE AREA Fitch rates the city's general obligations bonds 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook, reflecting a well-diversified economy that serves as the economic engine for the surrounding area. The city, which serves as the state's capital and largest city, has a large retail sector as well as a significant manufacturing presence, which includes pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturing. The city's geographic location and interstate highway network make it an ideal trade and transportation hub for the Midwest. The city's economy also includes health services, life sciences, and other business and professional service companies. Major employers include St. Vincent Hospital and Health Service (17,398 employees), Indiana University Health (11,810), Eli Lilly and Company (10,565), Community Health Network (10,402) and WalMart (8,830). The unemployment rate for the entire metropolitan area has dipped to 3.9% in June 2016, which is down from the 5.8% in June 2014 and lower than the unemployment rate of both the state and the nation. Income levels in the county are on the rise and approximately 11% and 18% of state and national levels, respectively.

It was revealed by Xiaomi itself. This Xiaomi Mi Box was shown to the world (again) today by former Google exec and current Global VP of Xiaomi, Hugo Barra. The Mi Box is Xiaomi’s first U.S. product. Their first product that’ll be released and available for sale inside the United States at stores within the United States, that is to say. This device may very well be the first real store-ready competitor to the dominant Android TV product on the market: NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV. Xiaomi’s Mi Box doesn’t compete on the high end that NVIDIA’s device commands. Instead, it aims to take the lower portion of the market with its pricing at $69 USD. Google Pixel details: all about perception (and HTC) This tiny box works with 4K resolution output, HDR features, and all the features that an Android TV device should have. That includes Google voice search, Google cast, and its own physical controller – just in case users want to use a physical controller instead of an app on their smartphone. This device will be available through Mi dot com at first, then at Walmart (both online and in physical stores) in “early October.” So early, it seems, that at least one Walmart already had the device out on shelves, available for purchase. For more information on this device, have a peek at our previous coverage from the past several weeks and months. This device was first shown to the world at Google I/O 2016 earlier this year. Now it’s ready for prime time – just before Google’s event, for whatever odd reason.

For the moment, much of the hype around drones is full of caveats: safety is always the first priority, and nobody quite knows the full extent of what's possible.  Scroll down for videos  Amazon has been busy testing out its new Prime Air initiative at a secret location in the English countryside.  This undated image provided by Amazon.com shows the so-called Prime Air unmanned aircraft project that Amazon is working on in its research and development labs HOW WILL CITIES CHANGE?  A researcher believes drones will one day become normal and form the basis of a new way of living and working. However, in order for this to happen our environment needs to adapt.  The need for airspace will lead to a push towards decluttering of features such as satellite dishes, and the removal of any unnecessary 'sky furniture', such as telecommunications, electricity wires and billboards. Networks of UAV landing pads, recharging hubs and air traffic control stations will be created, sited on top of tall buildings.  There will have to be ways  to map out street lighting and transmitter masts and keep track of other drones. There's still uncertainty about how new services will weave their way through airspace – let alone the inevitable tangle of regulations. Prime Air is likely to take four to five years to become a mainstream service, as public acceptance and demand evolves alongside the business model.  But in the meantime, there is going to be a tidal wave of change in both the technology itself, and the public's attitude towards it. Civilian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are like the first motorised cars: they have started out as a toy – and sometimes a hazardous one at that.  But they will, with time, become normal and form the basis of a new way of living and working. In response, the urban environment will need to adapt.  Perhaps the scale of urban transformation not be as extreme as it was with cars – after all, drones don't require large-scale infrastructure such as roads and bridges.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Brain training games may be a waste of time: Scientists say...

Share this article Share 43 shares But the changes will still be many and far-reaching. For one thing, the need for airspace will lead to a push towards decluttering of features such as satellite dishes, and the removal of any unnecessary 'sky furniture', such as telecommunications, electricity wires and billboards. Drones will  become normal and form the basis of a new way of living and working. In response, the urban environment will need to adapt. Pictured is a illustration of a drone flying over Saint-Cloud near Paris in 2015 AMAZON WILL BEGIN TESTING DELIVERY DRONES IN BRITAIN  Amazon plans to test its delivery drones in Britain, meaning customers in the UK could soon receive their packages from the internet giant by air, rather than post. The move is the result of a deal with the British government and could see customers in the UK trial the new service before those in the US. The partnership aims to understand how drones can be used safely and reliably, and identify the best regulations to put in place. The need for airspace will lead to a decluttering of features such as satellite dishes, and the removal of any unnecessary 'sky furniture', such as telecommunications, electricity wires and billboards. Prime Air is likely to take four to five years to become a mainstream service The plan is for Amazon's PrimeAir service to eventually deliver small packages weighing up to 5lbs (2.27kg) in 30 minutes or less. The world's biggest online retailer, which has laid out plans to start using drones for deliveries by 2017, said a cross-government team supported by the UK Civil Aviation Authority has provided it with the permissions necessary to explore the process. Flights will begin 'imminently,' according to The Mirror. Amazon got British approval for three new types of tests: Flying drones that are no longer within sight of their operators in rural and suburban areas, having one person operate several highly automated drones and testing devices to make the drones able to identify and avoid obstacles. During the test the drones will be only allowed to fly an altitude of 400ft (122m) and kept away from operating near airport flightpaths.  Engineers may also need to find ways to map out street lighting and transmitter masts, as well as keeping track of other drones, in order to simplify the vast quantity and variety of visual data the UAV's sensors and pilots have to deal with.  Networks of UAV landing pads, recharging hubs and air traffic control stations will be created, sited on top of tall buildings. 'UAV-ready' features will become a standard part of homes: not just landing pads with guidance lights (which are already on the market), but also recharging docks and secure trapdoors, to allow for the storage of deliveries.  Engineers may also need to find ways to map out street lighting and transmitter masts, as well as keeping track of other drones, in order to simplify the vast quantity and variety of visual data the UAV's sensors and pilots have to deal with THE US AND UK DRONE RULES  In July, the US Federal Aviation Administration unveiled long-awaited new rules that clear the way for small, commercial drones to operate across US airspace. Under the FAA's rules, drone operators will be allowed to fly commercial craft weighing less than 55 pounds (25kg) during daylight hours, provided they can maintain a clear view of the drone at all times.  While that effectively precludes the sort of robo-delivery services being developed by Amazon and other major vendors, the new rules will nonetheless ensure drones become increasingly commonplace in the skies.  The White House cites industry estimates suggesting drones could generate more than $82 billion (£63 billion) for the US economy over the coming decade, creating some 100,000 jobs.  Wal-Mart Stores said last month it was six to nine months from beginning to use drones to check warehouse inventories in the United States, suggesting drones will soon become part of our everyday lives.  But in the UK, drones are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority.  These rules apply to unmanned vehicles not more than 44 pounds (20kg) without their fuel, and states they can be flown up to 400 feet in the air.  'A person must not recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property,' the regulation says. Some experts say this regulation is not enough.  But Amazon said its UK partnership aims to understand how drones can be used safely and reliably, and identify the best regulations to put in place. Space for straightforward UAV access will provide a new selling point for property, though this could be an issue in areas where space is limited: for example, residents living in flats may need to rely on communal arrangements. There are countless other applications for drones beyond delivery services.  They can also be used to monitor structures such as wind turbines, or to keep a check on the environment – from riverbank and coastal erosion, to rising water levels and flood threats.  Drones could even replace some roles and systems in our cities, such as traffic wardens, speed cameras and some forms of policing. Drones could even replace some roles and systems in our cities, such as traffic wardens, speed cameras and some forms of policing. Drone racing is likely to be another new addition to city spaces In agriculture, drones are already being used to keep an eye on crops and spot any problems.  They are also playing a role in investigating accidents– and, of course, being deployed for security and military uses. Drone racing is likely to be another new addition to city spaces. Just as the motor engine led very quickly to motor sports, the availability of new technology and new skills will inevitably lead to competition. Drone racing is already attracting international interest – there are a number of competing leagues and televised events and the future landscape could include UAV racing courses.  HOW DRONES COULD SOON BE SPEEDING UP DELIVERIES  Impatient shoppers will be pleased to hear that Amazon’s drones could significantly speed up the speed at which deliveries can be made. The plan is for Amazon's PrimeAir service to eventually deliver small packages weighing up to 5lbs (2.27kg) in 30 minutes or less. Amazon got British approval for three new types of tests, including flying drones that are no longer within sight of their operators in rural and suburban areas. The other two are having one person operate several highly automated drones and testing devices to make the drones able to identify and avoid obstacles. During the test the drones will be only allowed to fly an altitude of 400ft (122m) and kept away from operating near airport flight paths. Participants and audiences could be local, or – with the help of an internet connection – based anywhere in the world. All of these rely on highly skilled UAV pilots – perhaps even people capable of operating multiple UAVs at a time.  Linked to pilot training will be the need for formal, accredited education and skills in UAV services management.  Being able to handle a UAV will become a useful life skill for members of the general public. There will be plenty of opportunities for businesses and services relating to UAV provision, maintenance, development and management, as well as communications and safety technologies to meet the need for ultra-reliable and more sophisticated tech such as 'first-person' vision goggles to control UAVs at a distance – not to mention systems for testing and licensing pilots. The local, national and international UAV infrastructure also has real scope to transform the operations for overseas aid and development.  Equipped with cameras, UAVs could enable a greater understanding of changing situations and needs, and pinpoint the delivery of support and supplies. We need high-profile trailblazers such as Prime Air for the technology to realise the drone market's potential. The hard work, though, is going to be behind the scenes, creating the safety mechanisms for each stage of UAV use, and putting in place laws that get the balance right between protecting civilians from harm and allowing this technology the chance to grow.  Antonios Tsourdos, Professor of Autonomous Systems and Control Engineering, Cranfield University This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 03, 2016 12:46pm   Comments Share: Related AMZN Chowdhry: Cisco Is Just Another Victim Of Amazon's Superclouds Comparing The Competition In Home Services: HomeAdvisor, Amazon Home Services And Angie's List Amazon streaming video service potentially set for worldwide expansion (Seeking Alpha) Related GME Game Over For GameStop? 18 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Wednesday Cheap Stocks Vs. Value Traps - November Update And Watchlist (Seeking Alpha) There's nothing to worry about GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) shares as long as the company enjoys loyal "power up" membership base besides its business model. Investors need not have to take too much into Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s Twitch Prime that was recently announced. Baird believes there is bound to be near-term noise on the competitive environment with the biggest online retailer's entry. The firm thinks the latest addition could widen the scope of promoting Amazon Prime to add members. However, the brokerage believes that GameStop continued to expand in fresh categories such as collectibles and tech brands. Analyst Colin Sebastian retained his Outperform rating and $40 price target on shares, implying more than 40 percent upside. Baird pointed out that GameStop has boosted its market share in the American hardware and software sector in the last five years from 25 percent in 2010 to 35 percent in 2015, though Amazon is credited for disrupting several business models. In a note, the analyst said, "We believe the company's "PowerUp" rewards program (46M members globally, 1 in 5 US households) and buy/sell/trade model in particular create a defensible competitive moat for GameStop, and expect only modest, if any, impact from Amazon's new initiative (Walmart and BestBuy probably lose more category share.)" Aside from this, the brokerage pointed out that the online retailer has been offering some of the Twitch Prime benefits in the last one year period. Therefore, its impact on core business of GameStop wouldn't be meaningful. As a result, any pullback should be taken as a buying opportunity.

Hit $1,000 Per Share? Will the e-commerce giant finally become a four-figure stock? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 3, 2016 at 11:31AM Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have soared 60% over the past 12 months, but analysts at J.P. Morgan, RBC Capital Markets, and Evercore ISI all believe that the stock could rise another 20% to $1,000 within the next two years. Is that target realistic, or will Amazon be pulled down by fundamental gravity before that happens? Image source: Amazon.com. What Amazon's valuations tell us Amazon currently trades at 208 times earnings. That sounds lofty, but it's actually lower than its projected earnings growth rate of 366% this year. The stock's P/E has also been declining rapidly compared with previous years, thanks to the growing profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. Source: YCharts If Amazon hits the average earnings estimate of $5.82 per share this fiscal year, a stock price of $1,000 would imply a trailing P/E of 172 -- which looks reasonable compared with Amazon's historical P/E ratios. Amazon currently trades at 80 times forward earnings, which matches the 80% earnings growth analysts expect next year. If Amazon matches the average earnings estimate of $10.50 per share for next year, a stock price of $1,000 would equal a trailing P/E of 95 -- its lowest multiple since late 2011. By these measures, a $1,000 price target could be considered conservative based on Amazon's historical multiples. What's fueling Amazon's growth? Of Amazon's revenue, 90.5% came from its North American and international marketplace businesses last quarter, while the remaining 9.5% came from AWS. But AWS revenue rose 58% annually during the quarter, as revenue at its North American and international marketplaces respectively rose just 28% and 30%. More importantly, AWS operating profit surged 138% and accounted for 56% of Amazon's operating income -- making it the company's most profitable business unit, with an operating margin of 25%. By comparison, the North American marketplace had an operating margin of 4% while the International marketplace posted an operating loss. Therefore, AWS became Amazon's main earnings growth driver over the past 12 months. Source: YCharts AWS is the world's largest cloud computing platform, with an annual run rate of $11.5 billion as of last quarter, and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down. It launched its sixth AWS region in the Asia Pacific region in Mumbai last quarter, bringing its total coverage area to 35 availability zones across 13 technology infrastructure regions, and it plans to add nine new availability zones across four regions next year. It also added 422 new services and features to AWS within the first half of 2016, which represents an acceleration from the 722 services and features it added throughout all of 2015. AWS profits support marketplace growth AWS's growing profitability gives Amazon more financial freedom to expand its Prime ecosystem. The $99-per-year service offers free same-day delivery on select items, discounts, unlimited video streaming, e-books from the lending library, unlimited cloud storage for pictures, and other perks. Amazon sells Kindles, Fire TV set-top boxes, Echo smart speakers, DRS-enabled appliances, and Dash buttons to keep users tethered to that ecosystem. It's also been linking new services such as grocery deliveries, restaurant deliveries, and home services to Prime.  This prisoner-taking strategy works wonders. Back in July, research firm CIRP claimed that Amazon had 63 million Prime members in the U.S., an increase of 19 million from last June. It also estimated that Prime shoppers spent an average of $1,200 last year, versus $500 for non-members. While Prime margins will remain thin, its growth will help Amazon gain market share and further marginalize its rivals with economies of scale. That's why analysts expect Amazon's sales to climb 28% this year and another 22% next year. But mind the headwinds ... Amazon is formidable, but it isn't invincible. Apple, one of Amazon's major AWS customers, recently moved some of its services to Alphabet's Google Cloud to reduce its dependence on AWS. Spotify also moved its infrastructure to Google Cloud instead of AWS or Microsoft's Azure. These moves indicate that AWS's dominance of the cloud platform market isn't absolute, and that competition from Google, Microsoft, and others could still spark fresh pricing wars and reduce the segment's profitability. On the e-commerce front, a resurgent Wal-Mart could hurt Amazon with aggressive price matching, curbside pickups, and subscription-based delivery services. I believe that Amazon could easily rise above $1,000 in the near future since that price is heavily supported by its earnings growth and historical valuations. However, I think investors should still pay close attention to the challenges that its AWS and marketplace businesses could face.

Rowling throughout their writing careers.  But these successful authors weren't content with fame and fortune; they craved influence in the political arena.  So as in Hollywood, they chose to share their political views with their readers, to yank us out of their superbly written fiction and back to the real world. Fortunately, my cappuccino addiction allowed me to ignore Starbucks's political correctness for quite a while.  Even though Starbucks tweeted rainbows over gay marriage and had their baristas chat up customers on left-wing subjects (though that didn't last long), it was background noise, not enough to separate me from my espresso.  But when the Starbucks CEO publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, when the media made that endorsement breaking news, I got the message.  As a result, I'm no longer lulled into euphoria by Starbucks's artsy ambience or caffeine; now I'm burdened by the same oppressive feelings I get when I watch the news or read a paper.  Dark, sad, depressing. Of course, I should be grateful that the CEO killed the buzz – it's going to save me over $1,000 a year.  Yet it's like losing a good friend.  A sad day. I can't even shop in peace these days.  Target was my all-time favorite store – bright, well-lit, with fun displays and great products.  But Target couldn't allow that cheerful joviality in their stores.  Nope – they had to step in and take a stand against 99.7% of their customer base.  They proudly issued a policy that anyone – man, woman, pervert, pedophile – can use the bathroom of his choice.  The result: I don't shop at Target anymore, because the stigma of politics has infected the store and because I'm hesitant to use the bathroom.  But I still had football, right?  Wrong.  Before we could kick off the season, a fading star named Colin Kaepernick had some kind of epiphany that he could change the world by sitting out the National Anthem.  The right vs. left media made Colin's sit-out national headlines for weeks – he has the right, 1st Amendment vs. he's an ungrateful millionaire spitting on the country that made him great, and on and on.  But they miss the point: I don't care.  Whatever these sports icons think, I really and truly don't care.  Just play ball. Once the media gets its hooks in a contentious story, there's no going back.  So I'm treated to more political posturing from those who joined Colin's sit-out or knee-out or whatever.  As with Starbucks, I did my best to move past Colin and enjoy the game, but the political spin soon engulfed football until I had to turn away yet again. So here I am.  No more cappuccinos, very few movies, limited reading, Walmart instead of Target, and now no football.  What's left?  Well, not one to give up, I'm planning a trip to Disney World.  Of course, Disney still has time to ruin my magical plans with political crap, so I have to admit I'm nervous. Will Mickey Mouse boycott his own Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party to make a statement for PETA on rodent rights?  I mean, the trap thing is pretty barbaric.  My worst nightmare is that Cinderella, Belle, Elsa, and other princesses could show up in pantsuits, no makeup or jewelry, and unwashed, limp hair, to show that princesses don't have to be dressed in elegant, sparkling gowns or be ethereal to play the part.  I pray that none of these scenarios will materialize.  I'm looking forward to this trip and would hate to cancel.  No, I wouldn't cancel because I disagree with their politics; I haven't got what it takes to sacrifice something I love to make a statement.  I'd cancel because politics again dumped on my fantasy world and sucked the joy out of my trip.  I'd cancel because the dark, hateful world of news and politics is stalking me, targeting and infecting every enjoyable part of my life.  My only defense is to give up those indulgences and move on.  When it stops being fun, I stop doing it.  Elvis Presley summed it up perfectly when filming the musical Roustabout.  The director, John Rich, wasn't particularly impressed with Elvis's entourage hanging around and playing practical jokes on one another.  When Rich approached Elvis about his traveling companions clowning around and disrupting, Elvis didn't back down from his director.  He told Rich,  "When these damn movies cease to be fun, I'll stop doing them." Cheers, Elvis.  Couldn't have said it better myself.

The Bacon-Tilla for example, is a taco shell made of woven bacon strips and filed with beef, cheese, tomatoes and more bacon.  RELATED: Homecoming tradition of mums becomes Texas-sized mania It was one of the Instagrammable treats revelers raved about online along with others, like deep-fried Jell-O.  And of course, there was a plethora of Big Tex selfies.  Video: Big Tex 4 Prez, Y'all!

By Ivan Castano on October 3, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk L Brands ceo Leslie H. Wexner is trimming down Victoria's Secret to spur growth. Gregory Pace/BEI/Shutterstock MEXICO CITY — Grupo Axo, the fast-growing Mexican apparel franchiser, is considering an initial public offering in or after 2018 to finance expansion, according to investor relations director Raul Villar. “We are analyzing the market and looking at the opportunity to list on the stock market, but there are no firm plans yet,” Villar said, adding that the group that brought Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein to Mexico is becoming well-known with domestic and international investors, following several debt offerings. With its motto of “Moving people closer to the brands they love, in a way nobody has ever imagined,” Axo licenses and distributes nearly 20 foreign lifestyle brands in Mexico and increasingly South America. They include Abercrombie & Fitch, Brooks Brothers, Emporio Armani and, most recently, Crate & Barrel. Fitch expects Axo’s revenues will rise 15 percent annually over the next two years while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins will hover at 14 percent. In the past four years, the company’s annual revenues rose 30 percent, up from a 14 percent average for rivals, Fitch said, adding that rising competition will dent growth. Axo in January sold 800 million pesos, or $41 million, worth of bonds to fund growth calling for 30 to 40 store openings annually, mainly in Mexico, but also in Chile, Peru and other Latin American nations. Axo insiders said U.S. buyout fund Evercore, which owns 20 percent of Axo, could make an exit in the next 12 to 48 months, boosting the case for a share listing on the Mexican Stock Exchange. Restaurant group Alsea owns another 25 percent of Axo, with the rest owned by private investors. Operating roughly 2,800 stores, Axo is currently worth 7.2 billion pesos, or $362 million at current exchange, said José Eduardo Coello, an analyst at Ve por Mas brokerage in Mexico City. The estimate is based on Axo’s 2016 EBITDA forecast of 689.8 million pesos, $35 million, or 10.5 times the EBITDA multiple department-store Liverpool recently paid to purchase Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s clothing division Suburbia for $1.04 billion. Coello said Axo could command a similar valuation, which is slightly above the 10.1 average multiple of companies listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. He added Axo would be better off listing in or after 2018 as investor appetite for stock market listings remains weak due to the peso’s worsening devaluation and uncertainty over the U.S. elections. A senior investment banker at Actinver, one of the banks that helped place Axo’s debt, said investors will buy its stock. “It’s an interesting business with a growing international presence and there are similar companies listed globally,” he said, adding that market sentiment is expected to gradually improve next year. Villar said Axo has “ample” cash to bankroll growth for another two years. However, given its rapid expansion, it will probably need funding after that, observers said. Apart from opening 30 to 40 stores a year, Axo could raise revenues by 25 to 30 percent in 2017 to around $300 million once its recent tie-up with PVH Corp., to boost sales of Calvin Klein, Warners and Arrow gains traction, according to Villar. This year, Axo expects revenues will grow around 15 percent, driven by rising sales of its newly acquired Multibrand Outlets Stores and Victoria’s Secret franchises, for which it just opened its first Mexico and Latin American store. Other labels such as Tommy Hilfiger, Bath & Body Works and Rapsodia are also expected to trade well, Villar said. In 2015, Axo reported a 58 percent jump in operating profit to 234 million pesos, or $12 million, on a 78 percent revenue surge to 4.5 billion pesos, or $230 million at current exchange.

In another development, the company informed that its president had resigned citing no reason. Register with us now for your free membership and blog access at:&nbsp;http://www.activewallst.com/register/. Today, AWS is promoting its blog coverage on CTSH. Get all of our free blog coverage and more by clicking on the link below:&nbsp;http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=CTSH. The tech giant informed on September 30th, 2016 that it has notified the US Department of Justice (the “DoJ”) and Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that is was conducting an internal probe to ascertain if the payments made to facilities in India were made improperly and did not abide by the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In its filling, the company informed that the investigation is being shepherded by the audit committee and is being assisted by an outside counsel. The company stated that it has voluntarily informed the DoJ and the SEC about the investigation and is fully cooperating with both agencies. This development comes after the new program rolled out by the DoJ in April 2016, which provided for deep discounts to the companies that cooperate with government agencies to fight corruption including those on foreign soils and help a crackdown on individuals and uncover bribery violation. Under Radar The company is currently investigating on the certain factions of the company-owned facilities in India, which had popped up during internal checks. Cognizant has 45 facilities in India of which 12 are owned. The spokesperson for Cognizant stated that those laptops of several senior level management personnel, including members’ part of the board, have been seized as the part of investigation. The company’s representative also stated that the investigation was in its initial stage so any further details cannot be revealed; he also emphasized that any comments on rumors and speculation is unwarranted. The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company has about 244,300 employees, in which every four of every five employees based offshore in countries such as India. Eyebrows were also raised after the resignation of the company’s president, Gordon Coburn, at a time when major corruption charges have been leveled against the company. Rajeev Mehta, the head of IT services, will now serve as the new president of the company. Gordon Coburn had been with Cognizant since its inception and had held several positions in the company including the CFO before he took charge as president of the company in 2012. A company’s spokesperson said of the resignation and the interim leadership: “It was Gordon’s decision to resign. Raj is a proven leader with strong client relationships forged over 20 years with the company and has been responsible for leading our market-facing and delivery teams in driving industry-leading growth.” Bad Times The corruption charges against the company come at times when the company is facing headwinds in its business, particularly in its financial services and health care segments. In its previous earnings release, the company had truncated its annual growth forecast for the second time in a row to 8.5% to 9.5% for the ongoing fiscal year, citing cut or cancellations of projects by the customer. Not the First This is not the first time that corruption and bribery charges have been levied against any company. The US government agencies are investigating possible foreign bribery charges against Wal-Mart; however any fine or settlement has not been levied. Siemens AG was found guilty in worldwide bribery charges and was asked to pay $350 million to settle SEC’s charges, and a $450 million fine to the DoJ. Furthermore in 2014, Alstom SA pleaded guilty in foreign bribery charges and was order to pay $772 million as fine to the DoJ to resolve criminal charges levied against it. Stock Performance Last Friday, Cognizant Technology Solutions’ shares was tumbled 13.25%, finishing the day at $47.71 with volume of 53.22 million shares exchanging hands by the close of the trading session, which was above the 3-month average volume of 4.18 million shares. Shares of the company have a PE ratio of 19.28 and market cap of $28.96 billion at the end of September 30th session.

Compiled by the News-Democrat LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Put the brass back A policeman was shot, and it said the bullet hit his brass or metal badge and that is what kept him from being killed. Don’t you think that is cause enough to put the brass or metal back on the St. Clair County law enforcement officers? How much does event cost? Great, love to hear about Art on the Square and the accolades all about how great it is. How about the BND looks at how tax money is being funneled into this extravaganza. I think you will find that 30 million dollars in receipts and economic impact is about the amount the city dumps into this thing every year. Our tax money taken right out of the TIF funds illegally. What is this really costing the taxpayers? Whites aren’t the problem I’m getting fed up reading letters such as Darwin Wince from Cahokia about how the blacks are being mistreated by the police and blaming it on Trump. I’m tired of your black culture. Nothing to do with reoccurrences from the 60s. It is the nature of the beast and the blacks are a lawless society. Watch the news, it’s all black crime. When that changes, you will have less problems with the blacks. Quit blaming everyone else for your screw ups. And that is where the problem is, not with the whites. Vote coal, not Clinton I saw a reason not to vote for Hillary Clinton. The headline about coal mining companies in the US. Obama shut down coal mining operations or is over regulating and forcing them out of business. We have a power plant that is going to be shut down because of the coal mining companies closing up. Clinton said she will continue the pace to shut down all coal mines in the US. We need those jobs. How are we to survive? Trump is the right choice The upcoming presidential election, Donald Trump could turn the country around. Job and home losses and insurance losses. The good life is gone, replaced with struggling. Voting for Hillary will perpetuate this spiral of economic depression. We need new people with good business sense. The US is trending downward. Don’t believe the reports you hear. Trump will save the U.S. Trump can help turn this country around again, I know too many people who were lifting the good life and are now struggling and have been for the last 10 years. Someone who votes for Clinton votes for what Obama has done to this country. Very poor economic decision, trade decisions. People are hurting. It will take someone in business who know how to work with people, and lead those people. Or we are looking at the end of the U.S. Kern didn’t save the levees I’m watching on TV, political advertisement by Mark Kern and he is touting as though he is responsible for protecting businesses and jobs by getting the levees fixed for flood control. If I recall, I believe it was the citizens who had to agree to a sales or property tax increase to get the levees fixed. It wasn’t Kern it was the tax payers who got these fixed. Taking credit for what the taxpayers did, makes you a low life liar. Double standard for blacks As reported on the news, a white woman in Cahokia driving through a fast food restaurant, was attacked in her car by 12 to 15 black youth who surrounded her car, kicking it, spitting on it, threatening her, breaking her car apart, calling her names. Turn that around, if that was 15 white yout doing it to a black woman it would be an automatic hate crime and the FBI would be down there. But when a white person gets attacked by blacks, that’s not a hate crime, that’s reparation for being a slave 200 years ago. Obama’s allegiance to Saudis It’s been extensively documented Saudi Arabia was one culprit in the 9/11 attacks because they gave financial support to the people who did the actual bombing on World Trade Center. Yet Congress just passed a law that would allow 9/11 survivors file suit against Saudi Arabia and President Obama vetoed the bill, what does that tell you about his alliances? That’s why we need Donald Trump, somebody who is going to make America great again. Anyone who participates and supports anyone who attacks us will pay for it. Hillary will do the same as Obama, unlike Trump who will stand up for Americans. We need charity, too Are there charities that donate to rural areas? Every time I donate or see an ad on TV it’s always below the hill. Rural America needs help, too. If they could pint a list, it would be wonderful. College isn’t free I paid for my kids to go to college. Who do you think is going to pay for this FREE College? The parents, grandparents. It’s the Democrats fault Immediately after this train wreck we have Nancy Pelosi leading the charge and blaming it on the Republicans for not putting in the safety devices. How many times have we had Democratic Senates? Didn’t Obama the first two years control the House and the Senate? Passed in the 1990s, how come they didn’t fund it? You can’t blame it all on the Republicans. Hillary has been there for 30 years. What makes you think she will follow up on any ideas? Who will pay for free college? When you go to vote, what is the most upsetting to me is when a candidate can stand up there and say, “If you make less than $125,000 you can go to college free.” I paid for my kid’s college. When they left home they did not have any bills. Who do these young adults think is going to be paying for this? It will come back to them eventually. Somebody is going to be paying the bill. Stop and think about it, maybe their parents should discuss it with them. An 18 year old will tell you he is going to college for free, and he means it. You don’t go to college for FREE. Think before you vote, your future depends on it. Blame the parents I just saw parents walking down Illinois 160 next to Walmart with their toddler, not holding their hand. What if that child gets distracted and runs away out into the street, she will be dead. Come on parents, don’t you know anything about parenting? Apartments won’t help Metro The opinion on the Apartments being of value to the MetroLink, states that these apartments are for low income active seniors who want to use the rail system to go to Cardinals games, and use bike trails. I don’t consider $500 rent for low income people, when social security payment is $800 a month. Don’t think the bike trails and Cardinal games are on their agenda of things to do. Where’s the update? What ever happened to the Scott Union employee that was to be sentenced on Federal charges for embezzlement? Suddenly nothing is there, it would be nice to find out what is taking place. Justice system is broken I’m aggravated after reading the story about the East St. Louis man who threw his gun in the woods and ran from cops. He got 21 months in prison where we all know he will serve 6 months. I don’t want to read a statement in the newspaper again, from police departments, states attorneys, judges, anybody in the Court system about getting tough on felons in the possession of guns. That is not getting tough. That guy was a felon, in possession of a gun and should be doing 20 years, not 6 months. I’m discussed, the justice system is so broken it is pathetic. Go to stupid prison After reading the article about the East St. Louis Township offices, and the supervisor stealing all that money. Does Illinois have a stupid prison, because Oliver Hamilton should be there. Blame the doctor first Have you seen the TV commercials inviting you to sue the manufacturer if you used talcum powder, one of the causes of ovarian cancer. Since your gynecologist should have known this for years, did he ever tell you not to use talcum powder? Hospital isn’t retail Since when does Anderson Hospital private rooms rate a notice in the retail section? Since when has the hospital become a retail clerk place when you really should be putting it on the front page, get a life. Moderator backs Hillary Why am I timing both of these debates, the moderator isn’t doing his job. The moderator isn’t doing anything to help Trump, favoring Hillary. The fact check isn’t even right. Trump is an embarrassment The debate tonight, Donald Trump doesn’t have it to be President. He cut off the moderator many times, interrupted the other candidate. He doesn’t want to pay taxes, otherwise he would reveal his income taxes. Everything is about money, no common sense. He would be an embarrassment to the whole country. Politicians should change There needs to be a change. No attention from any politician except when they want to run for office. Know your candidates, where are they when elderly don’t realize their tax bills are too high and because of tax bills and medical, they lose their home to foreclosures. Focus on this. How can Hillary run? Just turned 86 years. Can’t believe Hillary Clinton who has broken the law for so many years can be allowed to run for the highest office in this country. What is this world coming to?

TV John Oliver slams Donald Trump for 'winning temperament' comment by Christopher Rosen • @chrisjrosen Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Enlarge Photo Close Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (HBO) Posted October 3 2016 — 7:12 AM EDT See also Samantha Bee rips Donald Trump for Miss Universe comments Trevor Noah brands Donald Trump a 'master of sexism' Alicia Machado had eating disorder when Trump called her 'Miss Piggy' John Oliver mocked Donald Trump on Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight for claiming he has a “winning temperament.” Saying Trump’s performance at the first presidential debate last week “consisted mainly of an incoherent jumble of sniffles and nonsense, like a racist toddler coming out of dental surgery,” Oliver focused on the GOP nominee’s assertion that his demeanor is one of a leader. “I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win,” Trump said during the debate. “That is an incredible statement,” Oliver said after playing a clip on Sunday. “If he looked straight into the camera and said, I am a small Korean woman, it would be more believable.” Oliver continued, saying Trump’s “winning temperament” was on full display in the days following the debate, as he cited unscientific online polls as proof he won the battle with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “This week, we then saw what a ‘winning temperament’ actually means: it’s a temperament that allows you to insist that you won something that you demonstrably lost,” Oliver said, explaining why online polls aren’t an arbiter of factual accuracy. “The clear problem with online polls is that you can vote anonymously as many times as you want,” Oliver added. “That is how, when a British government agency held a ‘Name Our Ship’ poll, the people’s overwhelming choice was ‘Boaty McBoatface.’ It’s also how, when there was an internet vote on where Pitbull should perform, he ended up – and this is true – in an Alaska Walmart. And yet, Trump kept citing these nonsense polls.” RELATED: 30 Stars Who Spoke Out Against Donald Trump Oliver then focused on Trump’s battle with Alicia Machado, the 1996 Miss Universe winner Trump attacked after she was brought up by Clinton during the debate. During an interview with Fox News last Monday morning, Trump said, “She was the winner, and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude. We had a real problem with her. Hillary went back into the years, and she found this girl. This was many years ago. She found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa. It wasn’t quite that way. That’s okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” “You can see them thinking, ‘What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Don’t you know it’s wrong to degrade former beauty pageant winners? We at Fox recently learned that due to the circumstances of Roger Ailes’ departure from this very company,’” Oliver joked of the Fox anchors. “But Trump still wasn’t done,” he added, discussing Trump’s early morning tweet on Friday where the candidate wrote, “Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?” (There is no factual evidence that Machado has a sex tape.) “That is a candidate for President of the United States urging America to check out a sex tape,” Oliver said. “Just do me a favor: look up into the sky right now. Higher. No, higher still. Do you see that? Way up there? Way up above the clouds? That’s rock bottom. And we are currently way down here.” Check out some portions of Oliver’s Trump segment below; watch the full episode at HBO Go.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jeff Guo October 3 Follow @_jeffguo The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in the District. The civil rights leader also had a dream that one day there would be economic opportunity and economic justice for all. It's unclear if we've made much progress on that front. (Jewel Samad/Getty Images) We’ve known for a while that black Americans aren’t making economic progress. A recent report from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, shows that the black-white wage gap is now the widest it has been since 1979. What's more interesting, though, is how inequality has been increasing, and for whom. It used to be that low-skilled black workers suffered the greatest disadvantage relative to their white counterparts. But there has been a strange reversal in the past 40 years. EPI finds that the black-white wage gap has become wider — and is widening faster — among those with more education. This chart illustrates the history of the wage gap among men with less than 10 years of job experience. The early years are the most crucial in a person’s career, and also the most sensitive to fluctuations in the job market. In 1980, black men entering the job market with just a high school diploma earned 15 percent less than similar white men on average. In contrast, black men with bachelor’s degrees or more earned only 5 percent less than similar white male college graduates. College, in other words, once seemed a surefire route to something approaching racial equity. Nowadays, the picture is more complicated. While the racial wage gap among less-educated men has held steady at about 15 percent, that gap for men with college diplomas increased significantly in the 1980s, and now hovers between 15 and 20 percent. In 2014, the penalty for being educated-while-black was about 18 percent. The penalty for less-educated black men was 16 percent. A similar pattern exists for women. Among less-educated women with less than 10 years of job experience, the black-white wage gap was 6.2 percent in 2014. But among college-educated women, the wage gap was closer to 12 percent. The authors of the report — Valerie Wilson, director of EPI's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, and William Rodgers III — calculate how different factors have contributed to these changes. Among early-career men, for instance, the earnings disparities between white and black workers have widened by about 3 percent since 1979. These disparities would have been even wider had African Americans not made gains in college attainment during this time. But that educational progress was overshadowed, the researchers say, by two major forces: increasing discrimination and increasing income inequality. “We have minimum wages, but there isn’t a wage ceiling,” Wilson said. “There’s much more room for discrimination and inequality at the top. What’s happened is that the top one percent have really pulled away.” Income growth in recent decades has been limited, more or less, to the highest echelon of earners, a group that is overwhelmingly white. Out of every 1,000 households in the top 1 percent, only two are black, while about 910 are white. And so, as economic forces lifted the incomes of the 1 percent, the blacks on lower rungs of the economic ladder have been largely left behind. Much of those income gains were concentrated among financial-sector workers and corporate executives — occupations where blacks remain highly underrepresented. In part, African Americans  are not given the same opportunities to rise; lawsuits have accused Merrill Lynch, for instance, of systematically discriminating against its black brokers. And in part, black workers simply don’t have the right connections to get ahead. “Finance and management still remain very white-dominated, and those are the occupations that are seeing the highest rates of return,” Harvard sociologist Devah Pager, who was not involved in the study, said in an interview. “And to an extent, those kind of jobs are filled through elite networks that African Americans have been historically excluded from.” These facts help explain why a recent Pew Research Center survey shows that African Americans with more education perceive more economic inequality. Among blacks with four-year college degrees, 81 percent say that blacks today are financially worse off than whites. But among blacks with no college experience, only 46 percent agree with that statement. Pew also finds that college-educated blacks are more likely to report personal experiences with discrimination, and more likely to say that being black makes it harder to get ahead in life. The data suggest an irony: By climbing the economic ladder, African Americans get perspective on the full system of inequality in America. No matter your race, the world can appear fairly egalitarian if you and all your neighbors are working for minimum wage at Walmart. But graduating college introduces people to new dimensions of disadvantage. If you’re a minority on Wall Street or at a corporate law firm, where the rewards are larger but also much more unevenly distributed, you may become more attuned to how discrimination leads to denied promotions and missed opportunities to impress the bosses. The widening black-white wage gap isn't just occurring at the top, Wilson and Rodgers say. In 1979, the median wage for white workers was $16.89 an hour, while the median wage for black workers was $13.89 — a gap of about 18 percent. By 2015, that gap had increased to 26.2 percent. This means that even among middle-class workers, whites have been outpacing blacks. The researchers blame this largely on rising discrimination, which they say may have resulted in part from the increasingly lax enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. That is one of the few explanations left after they controlled for a slew of other factors, including differences in education levels, local labor market conditions, industry structure, unionization rates and years of experience. The EPI report adds to a sense that the economy is biased against black progress. We know that the Great Recession was especially damaging to African American wealth. We know that black people are more sensitive to downturns in the job market; they have a harder time finding a job, and are among the first to be fired when the economy seizes up. We know that for the past 50 years, the black unemployment rate has always been double that of the white unemployment rate. Now, it is undeniably clear that rising income inequality — one of the major economic problems of our time — disproportionately impedes black workers. Perhaps this should have been obvious. But the people who steer the economy, who are trained to think in terms of faceless consumers and anonymous firms, don't always recognize the racial consequences of their decisions. That might change soon. Many politicians have been urging the Fed recently to recognize how its actions would specifically affect African Americans. Because when the economy's rewards are unevenly distributed by race, economic policy implicitly becomes racial policy. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

And I’m not just working for GRS while on my break. I’m posting on social media for six other clients, and writing freelance pieces for two other websites. So when I say I am on vacation, I really mean that I am working in a house that is not my own, with a lovely view of a beach. Since being laid off from my traditional full time job three years ago, I have fashioned a working life that involves working for multiple entities, doing multiple tasks. Staying afloat when prospects are slim My most stable employer provides 25 hours a week (but it’s also the lowest paying). The rest range anywhere from 3 to 10 hours a week, depending on what’s happening and what’s needed. Some of the work is seasonal. Some clients pop up for a few hours’ work and then disappear for months. I’m not complaining. I love what I do, and I have fun doing it. But juggling multiple employers, all with different needs and different temperaments, seven days a week, 365 days a year … Well, let’s just say I hope I’m not still doing this when I’m 65. My income fluctuates, sometimes wildly, from month to month. And I never stop hustling for that next job in order to make sure we have enough coming in to keep the ship afloat. I created this employment scenario because, after I was laid off, it became clear pretty quickly that I was not going to find a comparable full-time job in my area, especially at my age (50 at the time). And I am far from alone. Since The Great Recession began, America’s part-time workforce has grown exponentially. It’s called a ‘gig economy,’ and it means there are millions of Americans who subsist on multiple part-time jobs to get by. Involuntary part-time workers According to the US Department of Labor, in 1968 (when they first started collecting this information), 13.5% of US employees were part-timers. That number peaked at 20.1% in January 2010, a direct result of the massive downsizing that took place during the Great Recession. The latest data point, is 18.2% (last month). In July 2016, there were 5.9 million people categorized as “persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers)”… “These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.” Speculating on cause Some also speculate that the relative stability of that part-time figure since the end of the Great Recession was triggered by the Affordable Care Act, which requires employers of large businesses to offer healthcare coverage for employees who work 30 hours or more per week (as of 2015). Many large companies, including Walmart, Target, Trader Joe’s, and Home Depot lowered the number of hours that employees worked to avoid paying health care. Technically, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment, leaving it up to the employer. Anecdotally, part time is fewer than 35 hours a week. In an article on CNN.com, Chris Tilly, a UCLA economics professor, notes that many part-timers are paid less per hour than full-time workers with the same responsibilities. They’re more likely to lose their jobs than full-time workers and they often have no health benefits or paid time off. What it’s like for people I have lots of friends and relatives who work multiple jobs. My husband works a full-time job and a part-time job. Others work a full-time job and drive Uber, or sell their handicrafts, or pick up occasional freelance work as needed. It seems these scenarios are more the norm than the traditional 9-to-5 job that offers nights and weekends off and two vacations a year. I mean, really? Do you know anyone living that life? We asked our friends on the Get Rich Slowly Facebook page what their employment picture looked like, and received a variety of interesting responses. Many work multiple jobs — although, according to them, it’s by choice. Clear, too, is that ‘full time’ is typically far more than 40 hours a week, with many reporting they work 45 to 60 hours as their regular work week, and then add a part-time gig on top of it. Here’s a sampling: Three jobs: “3 part time. Freelance bookkeeping/taxes. In CA it’s almost impossible to find a good full time position that pays well. I make triple what I used to working 40 for one job. Working 30 hours for 3 companies.” Two jobs: “I left full employment last year. I am trying to set myself up with a few part time jobs. Right now i have 2, and am looking for a 3rd.” Two jobs: “2 Paid, if you count a freelance writing venture I just started (already got and finished my first paid gig writing 2 press releases for an Australian music label). The second one is as a sales assistant (cold calling, up-selling, follow-up, etc) I have also taken over the bookkeeping of the bookkeeper. That’s my mon – fri 9-4.” One job: “I work one very part time job, while my husband works a full-time job. Daycare is ridiculously expensive, so I only work weekends. When i do work weekends I work the overnight shift, sleep until about 11am and spend some time with my family. It works out well.” Three jobs: “I have one full-time salaried job, and two “side-hustles”: teaching piano lessons and selling knitted toys I make. I don’t think I’d ever be able to focus on just a single moneymaking pursuit.” Sometimes I miss the stability (monotony?) of the single, full-time job. I did take an actual vacation back at the end of June, and the amount of work I had to do in advance of taking those seven days actually off almost killed me. It’s actually less stressful to just keep working, in the house that isn’t mine, with a lovely view of a beach. What’s it like for you?

I teach public school, but also work significant hours grading student work for a private company. I do this at night, but still worry that others would think I wasn’t dedicated enough if they knew I spent ~20 hours a week on other work. loading.... Keri I was going to say one full time corporate job and that’s it, but come to think of it, that’s not quite it. Maybe 2 part-time jobs. I own and manage 7 rental units (4 properties) and I airbnb 2 other apartments that my family lives in part time — I rent out when we’re not there which actually takes up alot of my time — as much or more as the other 7 rental units. And I think the rentals/airbnbs don’t pay me, but that’s not true, I take out money from my rentals all the time to pay things like fertility treatments, my upcoming wedding and honeymoon and I’m looking to buy one more rental in the next year, so I guess they are definitely paying me, though its not a salary or hourly. Its just the rents that show up in the bank each month. Thanks! I looked at the above people and was like — I can’t believe how hard those people work, but I guess I’m one of them too. Oh, I also have a 4 year old child and I’m 4 months pregnant with my 2nd! And, of course, my 40 hours a week as a corporate software designer. 🙂 loading.... Anwar Actually I’m a strong believer of entrepreneurship for creative people. However I have to admit that there are pleople liking just to know they have a 8h/d job with a stable income. But we all have seen how it’s life into the corporation world … not so nice isn’t it ? loading.... Donna Freedman I haven’t worked a full-time job since November 2002. While I enjoy the flexibility, people who think “freelance” means “works only when she wants to and makes a ton of money” are, um, MISTAKEN. For me, the flex-time is worth the panic and fatigue of those days when too many things are due all at once. It’s essential to pace yourself or you find yourself working from first thing in the morning until late at night. That way madness lies. (Repetitive strain injuries, too.) loading.... Latoya @ Femme Frugality I’m still full-time employed with a lot of writing gigs on the side. Diversification at it’s best… loading.... Piggybanknomics Latoya, I agree that diversification is the key to success. You never want to put all your eggs into one basket. What ideas have you used to generate success with your “writing gigs?” I am finding that it can be complicated to get started. loading.... Rail From 1988 until 1997 when I took a job with the railroad I always had multiple jobs, at tax time I had a wad of W-2’s to turn in. It wasn’t “extra” money, my full time job paid so badly that I needed the bonus income to survive. Then when I was canned from my full time job in 93 I basically worked seasonal jobs until Fall of 97. It sucked but I made it work. The working poor. Been there and got the T-shirt. Good luck to all of you out there doing it now, I know how you feel. Cheers! loading.... Xyz from Financial Path. I like having a full-time job and working on side-projects here and there. It is great to build passive income that will keep on coming! loading.... lmoot *raises hand* I’ve been working a full time + part time job about 5 out of the last 6 years. And if you count school as a job then I’ve been working 2 jobs since I was 15, since I worked in HS and most of college. I was at my least stress when my jobs were completely different from each other. Fatigue sets in for me when I have to use the same muscles and skill set double time. Since I work full time in an office, seated most of the day at a computer with minimal interaction, I got an active, outdoorsy part time job where I interact a lot with people. I can easily work 20+ hours at my part time job and feel fine. But when I have to work even 10 additional hours of the full time job, I am exhausted; it’s less hours, but I can’t stand doing the same thing so much. It hasn’t been a bad a experience for me though and I’ve never had trouble getting time off. Usually I try to get my days of through the job that offers PTO. When I was going through my savings super hero phase, I would even use PTO to take on more hours at my other job, effectively getting paid twice in one day. I don’t do that anymore. I enjoy it and can see me doing it until I can quit working the higher paying full time job; that is my ultimate goal. If it weren’t for the fact that full time jobs tend to pay more per hour, and offer more benefits, I would gladly work multiple part time job, just for the variety and extra networking opportunities. loading....

Through massive marketing and outreach efforts by the manufacturer, Mylan, EpiPen has become to the go-to device for anyone facing a potentially serious or life-threatening allergic reaction. It is a brand that has “become” the device, like Kleenex has “become” tissues, and Jet Ski has become the catch-all for personal watercraft. The EpiPen price has been raised 17 times in 11 years. When Mylan bought the device from Merck KgAA, a German company, in 2007, it cost $124 for a two-pack. Today, a two-pack costs more than $600. And there is no real competitor in the market, as Auvi-Q, a similar product launched in 2013 by Sanofi, was withdrawn in 2015 because of dosing issues. Mylan controls 94% of this market. Under fire from all sides for the last few weeks, Mylan announced it would rapidly bring to market a generic, but is unclear how much impact this will have. A complicated scenario Here’s what I learned when I was researching this issue: while Mylan does control the price of the product, it does not control the price to consumers — health insurance companies do. According to an article published recently by Ronny Gal, Ph.D., a senior analyst at the investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. (I found it on a fascinating website called drugchannels.net), in the wake of Sanofi pulling its drug, “Mylan was in a position to price up Epipen, which they did – by 15% in November and by another 15% in May. … The (insurance) payors got mad and raised the pain level on patients – raising copays and toughening medical policies (this is important, Mylan does not determine price to consumers, payors do). As Epipen is broadly purchased ahead of the new school year, the pain became acute for many families over the past month. There were lots of posts on mother’s networks, the media caught wind of the story and now we have multiple politicians jumping on the bandwagon.” Let’s keep the conversation going… This got me thinking about the cost of prescriptions in general. Way, way back in the good old days of the mid-1980s, when I first entered the working world, I had a $5 co-pay on my prescriptions. Over the years, as insurance plans have morphed and HMOs were invented and employers began searching for ways to save money, we had a tiered prescription plan that started at $5 for basic generic drugs and ended at $50 for really important stuff. Today, under my husband’s company’s insurance plan, we have a $3,000 annual deductible we have to meet. Until we hit that $3K, we pay out of pocket for EVERYTHING. This has ended up being quite an education, especially since we are at the age now where there are daily medications for things like blood pressure and prostate. Luckily (or unluckily), we have had a run of bad health and met the deductible for the first time, about halfway through the year. It is these broad-deductible types of plans (which I think more and more of us are opting for as a way to save up front on the premiums taken out of the paycheck) that are making many of us painfully aware of the full cost of prescription drugs. As Matthew Herper recently noted in an article on forbes.com, “If a customer is paying a $73 co-payment on a $600 device, this is a good deal. But a lot of consumers no longer simply have a co-pay on their drug purchases. They have a large deductible – an amount of money they must spend before their insurance kicks in. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last September found 24% of consumers had high-deductible plans. ObamaCare is one reason for the rise, but another is that employers are turning to these plans more frequently.” Remember, too, that is the insurers who are determining the costs to the consumers by manipulating copays, discounts and rebates, not Mylan. And in multiple interviews, Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch has made it a point to note that Mylan “only” gets $275 of the $608 list price for two EpiPens. Hunting for affordable medications The high cost of his prescriptions led my husband on a mission to figure out the lowest-cost way we could deal with it. Because even generics — if there are any — aren’t cheap anymore. He discovered a website called GoodRX, which not only showed him the price of his medications at all our area pharmacies, but also offered a big-discount coupon. So my husband now gets his medications at WalMart, which is considerably cheaper than other pharmacies in our area, and uses the coupons. There are other similar websites out there. Another smart strategy is to always ask your doctor for samples and coupons. They have closets FULL of samples. Our son has acne, and when we went to the doctor to have it looked at, he prescribed two medications, one being Epiduo. This is $300-$400 for 1 small tube and it’s not covered by most Medicare and insurance plans (including ours). Now, acne is not life-threatening, but for a 15-year-old boy, it might feel like it. Luckily, our doctor loaded me up with samples and also gave me a one-time coupon. We filled it once, using that coupon (cost to us $45). Since then we have just used the samples. His prescription for clindamycin phosphate was almost as expensive, but I discovered there are over the counter creams that have the same ingredient, and with pharmacy coupons I can get it cheaper than it would be with prescription discounts. Hunting for discounts, rebates and coupons, asking your doctor for as many samples as they will spare, shopping from pharmacy to pharmacy to get the best price (the disparity among stores is shocking as well), and making sure you understand your insurance coverage and are getting the most out of it — these are all keys to helping to manage the cost of your medications. Needless to say, I am not looking forward to those golden years, when our medications increase and our ability to pay goes down. How about you?

If we hand you samples, you’re lucky because we feel bad about the cost of medicine and happen to have a gift. Otherwise, we just hope your insurance covers your medicines. Good Rx is useful, I use it a lot before prescribing to the uninsured. loading.... STop ignoring the obvious The “cure” is insurance companies actually negotiating with pharma, instead of investing in them. Political will, instead of “oh gosh, buy generic!” loading.... Kym I recently read about a site called goodrx.com for ways to save on prescriptions and checked it out. I found coupons for some of my daughter’s meds, including her EpiPen, and saved the cost of my co-pays. The EpiPen coupon is good for three refills, so that one will save me $120 this year. We’ve been fortunate to have access to decent health care plans through my husband’s employer, so I wasn’t aware of the rising cost of the EpiPens until recently. Goodrx.com also shows the cost of the prescriptions at several stores for comparison as well. By the way, is there anyone on earth as well-informed as Donna Freedman? I learn something new every time. Love her. loading.... Michael Maag Here’s another great tool for saving on prescription meds: https://www.blinkhealth.com. They have awesome prices on millions of prescriptions available to everyone with or without insurance. loading.... Donna Freedman Here’s an excerpt from the “Staying Healthy” chapter of my new book, “Your Playbook For Tough Times: Living Large On Small Change, For The Short Term Or The Long Haul”: Maintenance meds and short-term drug regimens alike can take a huge bite out of your healthcare budget. Some insurance plans include mail-order pharmacy privileges, which can save you some money. But not always. When I switched insurance plans I was paying $4 a month for generic maintenance meds, so I sent both prescriptions off to the mail-order pharmacy. One came in at $8 for three months’ worth. The other cost me more than $29 for 90 days. Whoops. Learn from my mistake: Read the generic medications list VERY carefully. Even if you’re not on maintenance meds, the cost of curing even a simple illness can be surprisingly high. Use one or more of the following tips to get the most for your healthcare dollars. — Common meds may be free. Some supermarket pharmacies offer certain antibiotics, generic Lipitor, prenatal and children’s vitamins, the diabetes drug Metformin and other medications without charge. Among the grocery chains providing free medications are Amigos United, Giant Eagle, Meijer, Price Chopper, Publix, Reasor’s, Schnucks, ShopRite and Wegman’s. — Ask for help. A certain number of discounted or even free drugs are available for those on extremely limited incomes. You can apply for assistance through groups like NeedyMeds (http://www.needymeds.org/), the Chronic Disease Fund (http://www.mygooddays.org/) and the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (https://www.pparx.org/). — Go generic. Wal-Mart first offered $4 prescriptions a decade ago and other stores and pharmacies jumped on the bandwagon. Use a site called MedTipster.com to find generic equivalents of the drugs you need, whether maintenance or short-term, and then check the formularies for local stores offering $4 scripts. — Split pills. If you need a 10-mg drug, it could be possible to buy 20-mg pills for about the same price, then use a pill-splitter to halve them. Note: You must ask your provider about this, since not all drugs can be safely divided. About online pharmacies: Even if you don’t have a mail-order pharmacy associated with your insurance plan, it’s still possible to buy online. Due diligence is necessary, however, since some Internet drugstores are bogus. The Mayo Clinic website notes that in some cases prescriptions have “turned out to contain no active ingredient or to contain the wrong medicine.” It is illegal to ship non-FDA-approved drugs into the United States. You should order only from online pharmacies in the U.S. Although some people think it’s safe to use Canadian virtual pharmacies, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy notes that some rogue northerners source their drugs from countries where standards may be lax and counterfeit pills more common. To find an approved source, run the pharmacy’s name through LegitScript.com. (Hope that helps!) loading.... jestjack Thank you for this timely article. Another area of concern is the rising cost of diabetes meds and testing materials. DW was diagnosed a while back and the drugs for her care have went up significantly. In addition our premiums continue to go up annually at 10% or better. Our plan is a “grandfathered” plan that does not comply with all of the ACA requirements but seems to meet our needs. It is a high deductible plan with little coverage for prescription drugs. But like you, for better or worse, it looks like we will hit our deductible by the end of September this year. Then we only pay 20% of costs until we hit our “out of pocket limit”. Then coverage is 100%. My thought is this is only going to get worse and being an informed consumer is one of the few options we have. The ACA plans which were supposed to address this problem actually made the problem worse. I viewed plans with $13K out of pocket caps and $7K deductibles. The answer I got was that folks would be more discerning when seeking treatment as they had “skin in the game”. My thought is, it makes care more expensive….causing some to do without. loading....

My daughter made me breakfast. My husband gave me roses. AARP sent me another membership solicitation. It all adds up to one thing: senior discounts. Like many, when the AARP pitch arrives in the mail, I ditch it. I’M NOT OLD, I say to anyone who is listening (usually just the dog). Just this season on the Netflix series Frankie and Grace, one of the characters — who is in her 70s — noted that she refused to join AARP because  it means admitting she was all done. “There’s an article in the newsletter on how to get over that,” another character rebuts. I mean, what is old? I have some decent longevity in my genetic pool, so let’s figure I make it to 90. That would have made me middle-aged at 45! I appeal that decision! And honestly at 53, I feel pretty good. It’s hard for me to remember how old I am, except for when I see photos of my 25-year-old self and I remember that skin. Act your age? Sometimes Here are some tips on how not to feel older than you are: Don’t use a magnifying mirror in the bathroom. Refuse the ophthalmologist’s repeated suggestion that multi-focal contact lenses are for you. Do not ask the doctor or the police officer their age. Pluck that annoying piece of wire that keeps growing out of your chin. Listen to today’s music. Continue to ask for your mom’s advice. And don’t pay attention to stereotypes! Such as AARP is only for old folks! According to its own media release, “AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of more than 37 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment security and retirement planning. We advocate for consumers in the marketplace by selecting products and services of high quality and value to carry the AARP name as well as help our members obtain discounts on a wide range of products, travel, and services.” AARP has been engaged in a vigorous rebranding campaign for the last three years. They no longer call themselves the American Association of Retired Persons. They have been working to “revitalize and reposition the AARP brand as one that is ‘relevant to me’ by delivering a message of strength and empowerment. The creative shows not only what the face of 50+ looks like today, but more importantly, the new mindset of people entering or already in this life stage.” Membership costs $16 a year. That’s four trips to Starbucks. And according to AARP, you get all kinds of amazing discounts and benefits from that fee, as well as information from their newsletters and publications. But is it worth it? It’s always worth investigating these member-only discount offers. Always do the math Years ago when we were up to our eyeballs in baby formula and diapers, my husband and I thought about joining the local BJ’s, one of those buy-in-bulk discount stores. So we used a guest pass and went through and picked up lots of baby- and toddler-related items — in large quantities. Then we went to the local Wal-Mart and looked at the same products (in smaller, far more storable sizes) and realized that when you broke down the actual cost (and added in the gas used to go to BJ’s, which was considerably farther from our house) and on top of that the storage challenges, it was not a good financial decision to join the bulk club. AARP does offer a car insurance discount, but you should shop around (it’s so easy now online) for the best car insurance rate, and you also want to pay attention to how those insurance companies rank when it comes to actually helping you. It’s all well and good to pay a low rate on your car insurance but when you need them, you want that company to have your back and cover your costs. Related >> How Much Insurance to Buy There are myriad other discounts, ranging from florists to restaurants to your wireless bill. All are worth investigating and comparing to what you pay now. It’s pretty easy to make back a $16 annual fee but think about how you live your life. It’s like my husband always says when I hand him grocery coupons for name-brands: “The generics are much cheaper even without a coupon.” So don’t spend what you wouldn’t normally in order to get that 10 percent off. Eating out more on an AARP discount isn’t better for your waistline or your wallet. So many discounts, so little time Do some more research and see what discounts are out there with no fees attached! There are tons, including lots of great airline discounts that aren’t tied to a membership or miles or anything. You simply have to ask. Some start at 50, lots apply to 55 and older, and there are tons of them for 60 and up. My dad took great joy in getting a free coffee at Dunkin’ Donuts every chance he had. I can get 10 percent off at Krispy Kreme right this minute, and I am only two years away from 10 percent off at Wendy’s! Let’s get this discount party started. I look forward to being carded again! I am thinking that today, armed with the wisdom of my 53 years, I am going to take up AARP on their membership offer, and spend that $16. Partly I am going to do it because I think it is important to embrace who you are, and that includes what stage you’re at. I am deep into middle age, and rapidly approaching being a senior! Bring it on! Related >> Starting to Save for Retirement at 40 How about you? What discounts do you take advantage of because of your age? Any advice? Pitfalls?

When I was 22, I looked about 14. I’m now 58, and pretty fit. I always get asked for ID at a restaurant. Always. I got asked for ID ten years ago when I wanted to get a library card for god’s sake. I’m eligible for some senior discounts, but I’ll be darned if I can actually get one. It’s a pain to always have to show ID. I’ve been doing it since I was 21. (Don’t smoke, avoid tanning in any form, and don’t obsess over cardio…pump some iron to stay in shape instead.) loading.... Jen From Boston My grandfather refused to use the senior citizen discounts. I think he found them demeaning. My grandmother had no such qualms, but she refused to join AARP. She felt that their stand on public policies weren’t good for the country as a whole. (For reference, my grandparents were part of the Greatest Generation.) loading.... Latoya @ Femme Frugality I sure wish there were some discounts for 32-year-olds, I would take advantage of them all. Of course, not to long ago those college student discounts were something to look forward to. Unfortunately (Fortunately…I’m not sure which), I don’t have to take advantage of age related discounts for a while. And Happy Belated Birthday:) loading.... Elisia You do have discounts you can use, from AAA card to city cards (discounts for your city). loading.... stellamarina As soon as I turned 50 I joined AARP just to get the wonderful magazine and bulletin that comes in the mail every month. Best bang for your buck ever….and lots of financial discussion in both papers… Best senior discount ever is the national park pass…get at 62 for $10 and gives you and the people in your car with you free entrance to any national park. I like getting senior rate at the movies too. loading.... Elissa Thanks for reading! The National Park Pass is an AMAZING deal! A $10.00 lifetime pass that provides access to more than 2,000 recreation sites managed by five Federal agencies, with up to 100% of the proceeds being used to improve and enhance visitor recreation services. You have to be 62. http://store.usgs.gov/pass/senior.html loading.... Fred As you get older, one of the most important things to check as you are approaching the ‘senior’ age, is what age qualifies as a senior. Some retailers consider age 50 to qualify and some consider it to be age 55. If you are only in your 50’s and you can get over the ‘stigma’ of being considered a senior, then why not take advantage of any discount you can. For example, some supermarkets offer discounts to those who are over 55 or even over 50. Various locations of Arby’s give discounts of 10% to those who are 55 or older. Same with Chick-Fil-A, Country Kitchen, Del Taco, Dairy Queen, Dunkin Donuts, Denny’s, and many other restaurants. You only need to be age 50 to get a discount at various locations of Famous Daves, Krispy Kreme, and Steak’n Shake. None of these require that you be a member of AARP. loading.... cc Please DON’T JOIN AARP. I made the mistake of joining AARP when I crossed decade 5 on this planet. It is a mistake. AARP is a liberal organization that purports to help seniors but often the opposite happens. Join AMAC instead. Your membership won’t be hijacked for purposes such as gutting health care for working people so that the non-working class (with no intention or desire of ever working) can have health insurance. Yep, AARP supported Obamacare 100%. You pay more and get less now in your healthcare plan because of this, and AARP used your membership number to push it along. Without asking you, they claim just because you belong to them they can say they advocate for you. Bad things have happened in this country as a result. Whether or not you agree with their politics, you will be used as one of their numbers in Washington. (I didn’t care to be counted as an advocate of Obama, thank you.) AMAC is the one to join. They more accurately reflect my views on government and how this country should he heading (Hint: Not the direction it’s going in now). Google AMAC and start reading. -cc loading.... Bethany I agree that AARP is partisan and after being a fellow Lobbyist in DC for many years (Procurement, not politics) I have objected to their stance for decades. I won’t join because of the age stigma, but because they misrepresent themselves. I’m sure they spend more than $16 a year sending me junk mail. loading.... lmoot “gutting health care for working people so that the non-working class (with no intention or desire of ever working) can have health insurance. Yep, AARP supported Obamacare 100%” Yeah, so that we and the providers won’t be on the hook for their medical bills (which is why health insurance and services are so expensive BTW). Either way we would be subsidizing. At least with Obamacare the subsidies are standardized. I for one hope I live to see the day that dental, healthcare and education is free for everyone. So, I guess AARP aligns with my political ideologies. I didn’t realize their political involvement, but you sold me on them. Only 18 more years until I can join AARP woohoo! loading.... cc Quote above ^ “Either way we would be subsidizing. At least with Obamacare the subsidies are standardized. I for one hope I live to see the day that dental, healthcare and education is free for everyone” It already exists. Please move to Denmark or Sweden, where you will pay 60% to 80% of your income into the cradle to grave care you will get. -cc loading.... lmoot I wouldn’t mind since incomes would be higher without employers paying premiums for insurance, and cash flow would increase without paying $1000+ for insurance. Though I love to visit Denmark or Sweden, I’d much rather stick around to support and vote for similar improvements for this country. Because I understand that none of us benefit from having a growing lower class. Anyone who thinks it’s better to live in an “every man for himself” society, has had the fortune to never have lived in an every man for himself society. Anyhow, that’s why we all have the right to vote; we can disagree on many things, but that’s one thing common amongst us. loading.... cc Quote “I wouldn’t mind since incomes would be higher without employers paying premiums for insurance, and cash flow would increase without paying $1000+ for insurance” Yeah, you would mind. Take Denmark, for example (the highest taxed nation in the world): First, incomes are not all higher. A schoolteacher with 5-10 years in makes … $61,000 a year. Sales tax is 25%. A gallon of gas (when computed as a gallon, not a liter) is $10, give or take. Tax on a car is 180%. ( A 20k car here costs 50k there). Oh, the suicide rate there is a spanking 20.8% per 100,000 average. (US = 11.1 per 100,000 over the last 5 decades). Beginning to get the picture? Cradle to grave creates no incentive to work hard. People aren’t happy paying heavy taxes. It is neo-communism. Middle-class Americans don’t want neo-communism. We want a chance to work ourselves up instead of living on Uncle Sam’s plantation. And believe me, we already have plenty living on that plantation. Their commonality: They don’t have any incentive or desire to want to leave. And again, you are wrong about their “higher” incomes. They can’t even buy the house they live in most of the time. They are owned by collectivist banks! With banging high rents, I might add. -cc loading.... getagrip I find it telling that the same people who will cut coupons by the bushel, buy generic vs brand name, spend hour upon hour scrutinizing and cost comparing brands of appliances they need to purchase, can’t drop a Jackson a year for a large set of discounts because they may be perceived as being their actual age. Talk about worrying about what you look like to the Jones’, we are a sorry and vain species. loading.... Louise AARP’s motel/hotel discount shows up on just about every reservation website you will find online; check in at any chain and you can ask for it. The amount is about 10% off, so you can easily recover your annual fee in less than two motel stays, (unless you have a military, government, etc. discount; they don’t stack them). AARP magazines have good general interest articles and items targeted particularly to active and alert people between the ages of 50-90. And one membership fee covers you and your spouse, even if he isn’t old enough yet! loading.... Elissa Bass Thanks for reading Louise! I did not know that the membership applies to spouse as well! My husband is a year older than me and he steadfastly refuses to even think about it. loading....
