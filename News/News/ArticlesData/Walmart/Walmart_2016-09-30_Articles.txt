Sulphur Springs Police Chief Jay Sanders said the motorcycle ridden by Randall Jenkins, 59, of Sulphur Springs was travelling east on Posey Lane when a Jeep pulled out of a driveway and into his path. “There was a vehicle turning in to Walmart, I believe it was a truck and there was a vehicle wanting to come out of the Walmart entrance onto Posey and turning back west,” Sanders said. “According to that driver, he couldn't see but started to pull out. When he did pull out, he saw the motorcycle, but it was too late. I would imagine the motorcycle did not see him and it was too late.” Sanders said there were very few skid marks that would indicate the motorcycle operator could not see the Jeep before colliding with it. “The motorcycle rider was thrown about 30 feet,” Sanders said. “We saw the video of it. It was hard to see but we know what happened.” Jenkins sustained serious head injuries and was first taken to the emergency room to be stabilized before he was airlifted. He was on the way to Dallas Parkland Hospital before the flight was diverted to Baylor Hospital. Sanders said he talked to the man's family this morning. “He is actually showing improvement,” Sanders said. “He is not out of the woods yet, because this is a pretty serious head injury, but he is showing improvement.” Set as favorite Bookmark Email this Hits: 1071 Comments (0) Show/hide comments Write comment Show/hide comment form Email Title Comment smaller | bigger Subscribe via email (registered users only) I have read and agree to the Terms of Usage.

(Bloomberg photo by Sean Proctor) Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago in November. (Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) By Craig Giammona, Bloomberg News Oct 1, 2016 at 11:30 am | Print View Call it the Great Grocery Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat — “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. (The price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, at Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. But almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the United States. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 — with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out, but grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon. In England, Aldi recently offered its prized eight-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 — a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than 10 years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost five percent over the past year. It could get worse He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but recently has noticed the deals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals — that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market — famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” — is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger — the largest grocery store chain in the United States, with nearly 2,800 stores — cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. CEO Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out because it’s fascinating — in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food still can be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 — one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 1, 2016 at 10:43AM $1,000 might not seem like enough money to invest in the stock market. But in a previous article, I noted that well-timed investments of $1,000 in Apple or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would each be worth about half a million dollars now. Today, I'll go a step further and discuss two stocks that turned $1,000 into several million dollars over several decades. Disney Disney (NYSE:DIS) went public in 1957 at $13.88 per share. $1,000 would have been enough to buy 72 shares. After six splits, you would have 27,648 shares today, which would be worth $2.55 million at today's prices. That massive stake would also be paying out $39,260 in dividends every year. Image source: Pixabay. Granted, $1,000 in 1957 is equivalent to about $8,500 in today's dollars. Nonetheless, an $8,500 investment that blossoms into a $2.55 million one reveals the market-crushing potential of investing in well-run companies over the long term. It also demonstrates the value of patience. In the 1960s and 1970s, Disney was one of the "Nifty 50" stocks which were considered solid "buy and hold" investments and fueled the bull market in the early 1970s. But when the bear market hit later that decade, Disney and the rest of the Nifty 50 were aggressively sold off. The House of Mouse then languished for years as theme park attendance waned and the company's family friendly movies saw big box office declines. Disney only recovered after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Paramount, took over as CEO and had the company acquire Touchstone Pictures, Capital Cities ABC, ESPN, and other higher-growth media properties to become a media powerhouse. Eisner also oversaw the "Disney Renaissance" between 1989 and 1999, which saw the House Of Mouse release hit animated films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Eisner's successor, Bob Iger, further expanded Disney's media empire with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Today, Disney faces fresh headwinds, with cord cutters threatening to derail its cable TV business. But Disney continues evolving to face these challenges with new streaming platforms and investments in "new media" companies -- indicating that it could still have room to run. Wal-Mart Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) went public at $16.50 per share in 1970. $1,000, or $6,500 in today's dollars, would have been enough to buy 60 shares. After splitting 11 times, those shares would have multiplied to 122,880 shares -- which would be worth $8.82 million today. You would also be receiving $245,760 in dividends per year. Image source: Wal-Mart. Like Disney, Wal-Mart was a member of the Nifty 50 that initially soared but faced tough challenges during the bear market of the mid-1970s. But as Wal-Mart spread across America and other countries with its superstore format, it drove smaller competitors out of business with economies of scale. As a result, its annual revenues rose from $1.3 billion in 1980 to $165 billion in 2000. Wal-Mart didn't face any significant challenges until Amazon evolved from an online bookseller into an online superstore in the late 1990s. The company failed to keep up in online sales, and its sales growth fell far behind Amazon's. Source: YCharts Amazon aggressively expanded its ecosystem with Amazon Prime, new services like grocery and food deliveries, and (soon) drone deliveries. Wal-Mart fought back by matching Amazon's prices, launching its own subscription-based delivery service, and expanding its digital ecosystem of streaming media and online payments. It also recently agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. CEO Doug McMillon, who took over the top job in 2014, is trying to reinvent the massive retailer with billions of dollars in investments in e-commerce, employee training, and higher wages. The jury's still out on those efforts, and analysts expect Wal-Mart to post just 1% sales growth this year. But if they pay off, Wal-Mart's sales growth might pick up over the next few years. The bottom line The growth of Disney and Wal-Mart over the past few decades reaffirms Benjamin Graham's famed statement: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine; but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Therefore, long-term investors who want to turn thousands into millions should analyze a company's growth potential in decades instead of quarters.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com and Walt Disney.

Chase Down Love in the Bike Lane This Date Night September 30, 2016 11:37 pm by Marjon Carlos|edited by Chelsea Zalopany email Expand Photographed by Phil Oh In full disclosure, I don’t know how to ride a bike. I mean, I do. I must. I’ve heard there’s nothing quite like riding a bike . . . and yet, I have avoided them for several years now. I know, I know—but since balance is all I’ve got in such a fast-paced, nonstop city like New York, the idea of losing it for a second due to a popped tire or oncoming traffic terrifies me. So naturally, when Citi Bike became a phenomenon a couple of years ago, I paid it no mind. While girls in my Brooklyn neighborhood pedaled along atop their blue-and-red two-wheelers, the hems of their sundresses flapping in the wind, I was sidestepping the action altogether, feeling more carefree with both of my well-shod feet planted firmly on the ground. Of course, little did I know that these little bike depots across the city were quickly becoming dating hubs, or, rather, the wiliest of my coworkers (and, apparently, Leonardo DiCaprio) were using them as such. “Hot guys bike!” Vogue.com Fashion News Writer Liana Satenstein boldly declared one afternoon. Considering her often eccentric taste, I was unconvinced, but before I could prod further, Market Editor Anny Choi piped up from over an office wall: “Especially in this FiDi area with all the banks around!” Moments later, the two were buzzing around my desk. “Potentially crashing into your next date is always a viable option,” Choi said. “And it sure beats being wedged between college students in the back of an UberPool,” Satenstein added with a smirk. But seriously: There’s an element of surprise and adventure to biking that’s impressive to potential dates. “It shows that you have somewhat of a dangerous quality about you,” Satenstein continued. And, she pointed out, a bicycle can get you out of any possibly unpleasant date situations: “If you don’t want an awkward cab-splitting with a date or to talk about spending the night, you can just say that you have your bike and book it the hell out of there. And never look back!” And so I found myself lingering over a Citi Bike rack, contemplating getting back on the open road this date night. How irresistible could it be, whizzing past a potential new man atop HBX’s Handsome Wheels, my shearling Sandy Liang Bowery jacket blowing in the wind? A Schwinn Cruiser could send you soaring into the same path of a new beau on his own wheels.

By Steve Hartman CBS News September 30, 2016, 7:04 PM Oregon cowboy lassoes attempted bike thief Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email EAGLE POINT, Ore. -- Twenty-eight-year-old Robert Borba is one of the last of a kind; A real, honest-to-goodness, cow roping cowboy. Robert works at a ranch outside Eagle Point, Oregon. But he recently gained notoriety not for his prowess in the cow corrals, but because of what he did among the cart corrals of a Walmart parking lot. Robert Borba on his horse CBS News This past June, Robert says he moseyed over to the Walmart for some dog food, and on the way out he heard a woman screaming. “’Stop him! Stop him! He stole my bike! He stole my bike!’ And I kind of look around and all of a sudden this guy goes whizzing by me on a bicycle,” Robert said. As security cameras show, there was no way to catch him on foot. So the cowboy did what cowboys do. He saddled up to save the day, armed with little more than a lasso. “A couple swings and then I threw it at him, just like I would a steer,” Robert said.  “He’s like, ‘What are you doing, man? You got a badge?’ And I’m like, ‘No, I ain’t got a badge,’” he said. Robert called 911 himself, describing to the incredulous operator how he was able to detain the suspect. “We got a guy who just stole a bike here at Walmart. I got him roped and tied to a tree,” he said on the call. “What!?” the operator said. “I got him roped from a horse and he’s tied to a tree.” The cavalry arrived moments later, led by Eagle Point police officer Chris Adams. “I looked up and from the horse there was a rope connected to the ankle of a gentleman on the ground holding onto a tree,” Adams said. Robert Borba, right with lassoed suspect Lawns of Medford At the left in the above photo, you can see the suspect on the ground, roped and tied like steer headed for the pen. John Wayne couldn’t have it done better. “I’d take him by my side any day,” Adams said. “I told the cop, I said, ‘Man, you guys ought to pick up a rope and throw that gun away. You might have better luck with it.’ He started laughing,” Robert said. He said taking action to stop a thief was just the right thing to do. “If it was my wife or my little girl, I would hope somebody would help her if I wasn’t around,” he said. Heroes, like cowboys, are getting harder to find, especially modest ones like Robert, who want absolutely nothing in return. When it was, over police say all Robert asked for was his rope back. He coiled it up, tipped his hat, and then rode off into the sunset. To contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Student Voice of MU Since 1955 Friday, November 18, 2016 Campus projects UNews Sports Opinion MOVE Blogs Classifieds Feedback Editorial Staff Work for Us Advertising Information Unlocking his potential: Crockett makes the most out of SEC opportunity Crockett’s mother, Vanessa Keener: “Damarea has always wanted to do this, so for him to have a chance at doing this, it’s just so emotional.” Freshman running back Damarea Crockett, 16, pushes downfield during the second half of the game facing Delaware State. Maneater File Photo By Peter Baugh Sept. 30, 2016 Tags Football Share via Facebook Twitter Google+ When he was 5 years old, Damarea Crockett never let go of his football. The ball was a gift to Crockett from his mother, Vanessa Keener. It had his name written on it, and he kept it by his side day and night. “Kind of like a little girl who has a doll that she likes to sleep with, Damarea slept with his football,” Keener said. One day, Keener drove Crockett to Walmart. When the car was parked, he darted out the door and threw his football in the air. Keener remembers her son scampering around, throwing his precious football in the air, running around parked cars. “Put the football back in the truck,” Keener called out to her son. “You can’t take it in Walmart. They’re going to think you stole it.” As the young boy hurried back to put the ball away, Keener remembers a “little old lady” stopping her. “Let him carry that football,” the woman said to Keener, “because that football may make him some money someday.” Crockett has let football carry him from Walmart parking lots to the Southeastern Conference. Now a freshman at Missouri, he has emerged as a potent running back for the Tigers’ high-flying offense. The coaches see Crockett’s potential, and he sees it too. He’s strong, fast for his size and has good feet. He’s had success in his first four games, rushing for 210 yards and three touchdowns, but he is not done developing. “There’s still a lot more in store,” Crockett said. Damarea Crockett poses for a picture for his youth football league. COURTESY OF VANESSA KEENER Finding the right school Keener received a text from her son earlier in the school year. “This is crazy,” it read. Keener was confused and slightly worried. “What’s wrong?” she typed back. No reply. “DAMAREA, IF YOU DON’T SAY SOMETHING, I’M GOING TO GO CRAZY,” she replied in capital letters. Finally, Keener received an answer. “It’s nothing, Momma. It’s just crazy how my life is changing.” Sometimes Keener thinks about how good of a kid her son is. She thinks of where he is and how well he’s doing. Sometimes these thoughts make her cry. “I’m so happy for him,” she said. Crockett is happy too. He’s playing the game he loves, and he’s thankful for the opportunity Missouri has given him. Crockett took an unorthodox road to Missouri. The summer before his senior year of high school, the Arkansas native committed to Boise State. He had received offers from a number of Division I programs but had relatively little interest from schools in the Power Five conferences. New Missouri coach Barry Odom began recruiting more aggressively in Arkansas as soon as he took the job in December 2015. Offensive coordinator Josh Heupel was key in recruiting Crockett. “He’s got the ability, when he matures physically, to be a physical back as well,” Heupel said. “He’s got great feet in the hole, had good vision … I thought he had the chance to be a real complete back.” Midway through his senior year of high school, Crockett flipped his commitment from Boise State to Missouri. By February, he had signed a letter of intent with the Tigers. Proximity was a factor in Crockett’s decision. In Columbia, his family can watch him play. “Had he gone to Boise, I probably wouldn’t have been able to make a game just yet,” Keener said. “Because a flight ticket is not inexpensive.” Crockett also considered high-level academic schools, including Yale, West Point and the Naval Academy. Those closest to Crockett have taken notice of his intelligence. When he was in ninth grade, he helped his mother do college algebra homework for a course she was taking. Jeff Weaver, Crockett’s high school coach at Little Rock Christian Academy, feels the running back could have done well at the academically rigorous schools he was considering. “Damarea is very smart,” Weaver said. “Our school is a very high academic school … he could certainly go to any of those schools, but I think he wanted to go where the brand of the football is a little bit better as well.” As Crockett was growing up, Keener stressed academics. “Sometimes he doesn’t apply himself as he should, which is where I come in,” she said. Keener tells her son that football is not a guarantee. Grades are important. The message seems to have gotten through to the freshman. “I’m a football player at heart, but I’m a student-athlete at all times … academics is going to take you a far way,” Crockett said after a win against Delaware State. “It’s going to be there when the football isn’t there.” Football abilities Jeff Weaver has seen Crockett take over a game. It was a cool Arkansas night in the fall of 2015. Crockett and the undefeated Little Rock Christian football team was trailing Greenbrier, a rival school, by 21 points entering the fourth quarter. In the final quarter, Weaver and the team relied heavily on their running back. Crockett would take direct snaps and run plays from the wildcat formation, and the Little Rock Christian offense got in a groove. There was nothing Greenbrier could do to stop Crockett. He finished with 295 rushing yards on 51 carries, and a late touchdown cut Greenbrier’s lead to 42-41. Instead of kicking a game-tying extra point, Weaver elected to go for a two-point conversion. “There was no doubt on our sideline that we were going for two and that [Crockett] was going to be the guy making the play …” Weaver said. “He wanted the ball, and we were not shocked at all to see him score.” Little Rock Christian ran a direct snap to Crockett, who scampered over the goal line to give the team a 43-42 lead. Weaver said the crowd was “insane.” Fans screamed as the team held on for what would wind up being the victory that sealed the conference championship. Keener remembers her son after the game. “My son was so beat down,” she said. “He was really tired.” Now, Crockett is going against bigger, faster and stronger defenses, and the transition from high school to college football has been far from seamless. The freshman had a costly fumble against West Virginia in week one, killing a Missouri drive. Crockett said playing in the SEC has been an adjustment. The hits are harder and the opposition is more athletic. “The game’s just much faster,” he said. “The guys are bigger and faster. You’re not the fastest guy on the field anymore at all times. So that’s just a big adjustment, and that’s what it’s like pretty much out there.” Odom said Crockett is still learning. His potential is clear, and he needs to work hard to achieve it. “There’s things in practice you see him do and you know he’s going to have a chance to be a really good player,” Odom said. “But he’s got to work, he’s got to understand that he’s not the fastest guy on the field anymore … he’s continuing to get better.” Against Delaware State, Crockett rushed for a season-high 115 yards and two touchdowns. The Tigers cruised to a 79-0 win. Though he knows it was not against a football powerhouse, Crockett said it was nice to have a big game. He had fun competing and being with his teammates. Though Keener said she was unsure about how much Crockett would see the field as a freshman, the running back said he expected to play immediately. “I try to work hard, do everything to the best of my abilities as hard as I can, do stuff right,” Crockett said. “I just try and follow the right path, so I kind of expected to play.” The freshman’s abilities have not gone unnoticed by his teammates. Sophomore offensive lineman Kevin Pendleton has been impressed by his new teammate. Since he and Crockett are both underclassmen, Pendleton is looking forward to playing with the running back in coming years. “Tough dude, tough guy and tons of energy,” he said. “It’s exciting to see what this kid can do.” Loving the game When Crockett was growing up, he and his mom would fight over the television on Saturdays. Crockett would want to watch SEC football, while Keener preferred her shows on Lifetime. Now, there’s no more fighting. Crockett is out of the house, playing in the games he used to watch. And even though she has the freedom to watch Lifetime on Saturdays, Keener watches football every week. For Keener, it’s special watching her son succeed. “As a mother, you always want your child to be able to have the desires of their heart,” Keener said. “Damarea has always wanted to do this, so for him to have a chance at doing this, it’s just so emotional.” As a 5-year-old in Arkansas, all Crockett wanted was to play with the football his mother got him. His dreams have grown, but his feelings for the game have remained constant. Damarea loved football then, and he loves it now.

Henning  BAY CITY, MI — A Bay City man has pleaded guilty to his latest felony stemming from the theft of some "The Walking Dead" DVDs from Walmart less than a month after he was paroled. David M. Henning, 23, on Thursday, Sept. 22, appeared in Bay County Circuit Court and pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree retail fraud. The charge is a five-year felony. In exchange, the prosecution agreed to dismiss a charge of unarmed robbery, a 15-year offense. Henning's trial was to begin Tuesday, Oct. 11. The charges stem from Bay County sheriff's deputies on the evening of July 21 responding to the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township for a shoplifting complaint. Upon deputies' arrival, Walmart staff told them they observed a man and a woman stealing items. As they attempted to stop the culprits near the building's front doors, the male subject — Henning — shoved a male employee, court records show. The male employee grabbed Henning in a bear hug and another employee reached into a large, leopard-print bag Henning was carrying and retrieved numerous stolen items. The male employee eventually released Henning as Henning continued to struggle, court records show. Bay City man pleads guilty to misdemeanor in Xbox game theft, 15-year felony dismissed Henning then went to his 19-year-old female companion, took her car keys, ran outside, and drove away in her car, court records show. The woman remained at the store and gave a statement to police, saying she only knew her cohort as "John" and that she brought him to Walmart to steal property, court records show. She added her cohort had gone on other recent Walmart shoplifting expeditions — stealing a Nerf gun in one — without getting caught. Among the items the pair stole were bobby pins, five CDs, five "The Walking Dead" DVD sets, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Empire" DVD sets, "Insurgent," "Allegiance," and "Divergent" DVDs and blonde hair dye, all totaling $254.33, court records show. Police later located the woman's vehicle at Henning's Bay City residence and noticed a leopard print bag inside it, court records show. With the property owner's permission, police searched the home and found Henning hiding underneath a pile of clothes, court records show. Police allege Bay City man threatened to blow up food business After being read his Miranda rights, Henning initially declined to speak with police but soon changed his tune. He said he went to Walmart to steal items and struggled with an employee, though he knew he shouldn't have. He further told deputies he has a problem with impulsive stealing and goes to classes for it, court records show. Henning on Monday, July 25, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on one count of unarmed robbery. The charge is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Lengthy criminal history Henning has quite a rap sheet, including other offenses that occurred at Walmart. In January 2015, he stole Xbox games "Grand Theft Auto IV" and "Sniper Ghost Warrior" from the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township. On his way out of the store, he engaged in a scuffle with a loss-prevention officer. He ended up pleading guilty to second-degree retail fraud in exchange for the prosecution's dismissal of an unarmed robbery charge. In February, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail with credit for 52 days served. Two months later, a Bay County judge sentenced Henning to three years probation on a conviction of malicious destruction of a building between $1,000 and $20,000 for a crime he committed on Jan. 5 of that year. In August 2015, Henning called Bay County Central Dispatch and said he was going to blow up T&M Bosco Distributing Co. at 407 11th St. Police searched the area and found no explosive devices. Police believed Henning had called in similar pranks threats the previous year. "I made the call," Henning told police. "I used an old Obama phone that I had before I went to jail. I told the person that I was going to blow up Bosco's. Once I realized it was 911, I hung up the phone. I don't know why I did it." Henning was charged with a four-year felony count of false report or threat of a bomb or harmful device. On Dec. 7, 2015, Henning was sentenced to 16 months to five years in prison on the vandalism conviction for which he previously received probation. The Michigan Department of Corrections paroled him on Tuesday, June 28. Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill is to sentence Henning at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 31 Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

Published Sep 30th, 2016 9:59 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Dustin Serio, a customer service manager at Walmart Store 100 in Bentonville, is happy the hourly bonuses are back. The five-year Walmart employee said it is a morale builder and is a welcome part of the retailer’s focus on better pay and training. As an hourly employee who has been with the company more than six months, Serio is eligible for Walmart’s My Share bonus program that recently doled out $201 million to more than 900,000 store workers like Serio in 99% of the retailer’s U.S. stores. The average second quarterly bonus received was $220, according to the retailer. This came on the heels of more than $200 million bonus pay handed out to 99% of Walmart stores in the first quarter, according to Kory Lundberg, Walmart corporate spokesman. Serio said store workers can check on their “My Share” bonus progress at any time throughout the quarter. He said there are several metrics on which the bonus pay is linked to Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran’s “Clean, Fast and Friendly” scores, and of course meeting overall sales targets. “I remember a few years back when they were opening all the Neighborhood Markets in Bentonville and that really hurt our store sales. We went several quarters without a bonus,” Serio said. “We look forward to the bonus pay and it does help overall morale in the store when we get them. … In my eyes I see Walmart investing more in its biggest asset, its people. I can’t speak for every store but here we take the clean, fast and friendly program seriously. The overall payout is also based on how many hours you work. It could be as little as 10 a week or 40 hours a week.” Serio said he was offered a salary management job, but opted out of that now because he has a young daughter at home he needs to spend time with. Most of the jobs in a Walmart store are hourly. The salary positions, while they pay more, require longer hours. That would be jobs as shift managers or assistant managers. But without a college degree, Serio sees Wal-Mart as a good place to move up when the time is right. He has his sights set on a position at the corporate office across the street from Store 100 in five years or so. Lundberg said the $201 million in quarterly bonus pay was not part of the retailer’s $2.7 billion investment in higher wages and training over last year and this year. When Walmart U.S. announced it would raise the starting pay to $10 per hour in January, the retailer was praised by the media and analysts agreed that getting the store labor counts right and keeping turnover down would be positives for the long term for the retail giant. But not everyone who works at a Walmart store earns a minimum of $10 per hour. Lundberg said it’s only after the worker completes the Pathways training that they become eligible for the $10 hourly rate and the bonus pay. Pathways began in February and workers have 18 months to finish the training. Serio said the training could be finished on average in 3 to 4 weeks time. He likes the training requirement because workers on the floor can’t learn everything they need to know from a supervisor. Lundberg said while store turnover is down, on any given day the retailer still has between 15,000 and 50,000 job openings in the company and there are always newer employees who have not completed the Pathway training and are not eligible for the $10 hourly pay rate or bonus pay. “As we have talked about before our training provides associates with the skills they need to succeed and advance, while creating a better and more consistent customer experience. Skills’ training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth. … Skills developed include core retail knowledge, such as merchandising and understanding product labels and soft skills needed for confidence and success in all workplaces, such as: punctuality, teamwork, communication, customer service and on-the-job problem solving,” Lundberg said. Not everyone is convinced Walmart’s My Share bonus program is a big deal. The union-backed group, Making A Change at Walmart, says it’s not enough. “Walmart is happy to boast when they decide to give workers a very small share of one of the world’s largest company’s earnings, but when it comes down to facts, Walmart continues to mislead,” said Jess Levin, communications director for MCAW. “What Walmart doesn’t tell you is that in order to get this bonus, workers must complete a months’ long training program that is often implemented with buggy and outdated technology. In fact, in order to also receive the $10 an hour minimum wage that Walmart promotes, completion of this tedious program is required. We hear from Walmart workers every day that have been making less than $10 an hour for months. These workers will also be excluded from the quarterly bonus, and we believe they deserve better.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 3shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Holiday giving: How to raise charitable kids amid my own questionable philanthropy Sonja Haller , The Republic | azcentral.com 9:04 a.m. MST September 30, 2016 Giving season is upon us. (Photo: Getty Images) He was super-chipper, a tad pushy. He ambushed everyone walking in or out of Walmart. I couldn't avoid him. He hit me with his pitch. “No,” I told the guy wanting $20 to fill kid backpacks with needed school supplies. “Not today.” Not even for a Tootsie Roll. Halloween soon will be over, and then it’s onto Salvation Army bell ringers, turkey-shortage pleas and stepped-up church and work food drives. The upcoming charitable season has unnerved me, and this Walmart guy is the reason. Not yet out of chipper guy’s earshot, my 10-year-old asked: “Mama, why didn’t you give that guy $20 bucks?” I told her it was the day before pay day. Money was tight. It should be enough, but it’s not for this inquisitive child who once during a family toast exalted me “because I always give people on the freeway money.” (Not even close to being true.) AZCENTRAL Things To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device First, reflection on my generosity  It’s not enough for me, either, because I realize in that moment, I have no giving protocol. Sometimes I give, sometimes I don’t. With the holidays approaching, I’ll be confronted with countless opportunities to give. I should know my giving standards, if not for my three girls, at least for myself. So, thanks, Walmart guy, for nudging me into a hard two weeks of self-reflection on my own generosity, or lack thereof. It's hard to resist giving to someone who looks as if it took every bit of courage they had to approach you. (Even if they refused to get in the photo.)  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I gave to a guy at Fry’s who was fundraising for people with intellectual disabilities because rather than pushy he seemed shy, thus he declined to pose for a picture. More to the point: It was pay day. Takeaway: I give when I feel I have it to give.  I have a soft spot for writers, naturally, especially ones who profess to work for coffee money.  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I gave a bike-riding guy $20 bucks, or coerced my husband to, because he trailed us in a restaurant parking lot hawking his framed, original poems. We chose the one on the virtue of a smile. As a writer, I appreciate the work to craft anything coherent, even if this poem did have a few grammatical errors. Takeaway: I give when I feel moved. Giving feels good.  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I doubled the church offering this past Sunday. It may or may not have to do with the pastor remarking on "The Rich Man and Lazarus" (Luke 16: 19-31). If you don’t know that one, they both die. The rich King, who never gave any food or otherwise to poor Lazarus, goes to Hades. Lazarus, for which "the dogs came and licked his sores,“ went to a more pleasant place after death. It does feel good to give in the moment, no matter what happens later. Takeaway: Giving is good for your soul, at least on some level. 3 reasons to give I can tell my kids The two weeks gave me a better handle on my own giving philosophy. I give when I feel moved, have the resources to give, and am, selfishly perhaps, looking for a little soul boost. Not quite the elevator speech on philathropy I had envisioned for my kids, but it may be enough to get me through this holiday season and spark an interest in their own giving one day. MORE SONJA HALLER: Learning the hard way about working less, Amazon-style | 5 annoying parent types at school drop off And I do want them to be givers, if only for all the times people gave to me. People fed me. A Mesa firehouse did when I was a starving college student interning for the newspaper and happened to drop by as a way of developing reporting sources, and it happened to be fish fry Friday. Actually, I’m fuzzy on what was served, I just recall that if you arrived around dinner, the firefighters fed you. I showed up a lot. Friends donated furniture, utensils and a futon bed for my first apartment. I borrowed money to make rent, make car repairs, keep my electricity from being turned off and to get a soda from the work vending machine. And then there was the time I was a $1.50 short in college to pay the Phoenix Zoo admission, and the man in line behind me offered to make up the difference. (I heart you, generous guy who probably led me to paying it forward far more than anyone else has.) I'm not comparing myself to the truly needy and the organizations that help them. But we might all find ourselves “less fortunate” at times in our lives. Maybe it will be my children. That seems worthy of some self-reflection on generosity. And maybe paying someone's way into the zoo. Reach the reporter at sonja.haller@arizonarepublic.com. Follow at twitter.com/sonjahaller.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Helena Andrews-Dyer September 30 Follow @helena_andrews Singer Patti LaBelle at a tasting for her desserts on Capitol Hill hosted by Walmart. (Dan Swartz) Patti LaBelle is running late. But no one here seems to mind. The crowd of staffers, members, Walmart execs and the lucky legislative aide who happened to get “the email” are too busy rubbernecking the passed trays carrying slices of sweet potato pie to notice that the woman of the hour is missing. The event, “A Reception and Tasting with Patti LaBelle celebrating her featured desserts sold exclusively at Walmart,” was set to start at 3 p.m. on Thursday. By 3:02, the room on the third floor of the Longworth building was packed. “I can’t wait to taste one,” announced one staffer as waiters carrying samples of pie, peach cobbler, vanilla poundcake and chocolate ganache cake are swarmed. Not familiar with the fame trajectory of Patti’s pies? After a hilarious video of a fan named James eating said pie went viral last year, LaBelle’s desserts quickly became the Furby of the bakery aisle. After waiting for about 45 minutes and listening to a steady stream of LaBelle’s solo hits (“On My Own” and “Somebody Loves You Baby”), she arrives with her entourage in tow. The crowd, most with mouthfuls of pie, isn’t too stuffed to cheer, “Hey Patti!” During a brief explanation of the origin of the Grammy-winner’s lucrative relationship with Walmart (apparently the superstore’s bakery division was already in the market for a sweet potato pie when it reached out to the singer and cookbook author), LaBelle made sure to note that her desserts were “selling double before James did his video. People all over had feelings.” After that it’s on to pictures, and the congressmen, of course, get to cut the line. In the house were Reps. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Joe Wilson (R-S.C.). It’s during the selfie cattle call that LaBelle reveals to us that despite performing for the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, she still hasn’t seen the museum, which includes the risque rhinestone costumes worn by her ’70s funk group LaBelle. “I haven’t seen them yet,” she whispered, “but I’m coming back for at least four hours.” No word if she’ll be bringing pies with her on this future trip, which might disappoint the young staffer headed back to his member’s office with not one but two plates in his hands. “Oh my god, this pumpkin pie,” he announced to the elevator. “Sweet potato. It’s sweet potato pie,” corrected this reporter. “Ah,” he said. “Maybe that’s why it’s so good.” lifestyle reliable-source false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

She likened it to a night sky unadulterated by city and street lights — a beautiful, virtually endless expanse that can leave the viewer feeling overwhelmed and tiny as a gnat. "It's mind-boggling. It's really hard to get your head around how much data we're talking about here," Curnutt said. "Data is now constantly coming in from all different sources — dispatch, drivers, devices, sensors, GPS, phones, tablets, check-ins, emails, on and on," she noted. "Every week we've got some new device that's spewing it." "Spewing" might be most accurate: fleets and trucking companies are generating and collecting all manner of data, but may not be doing much more than gathering clutter due to errors and confusion in the information. More data doesn't mean good data "This amount of data creates all new possibilities. It's really a beautiful thing," Curnutt told listeners. "Or is it? Maybe it's not a beautiful thing; maybe it's a rat's nest. Maybe it's a tangled ball of twine." Curnutt used samples from a few TMW customer databases regarding a location she'd expected would be common: a Walmart distribution center. One database had the distribution center "with three different company IDs, three different names, two slightly different addresses and a lat-long that actually doesn't represent physically where the Walmart was," she said. A second TMW customer had the location under different names, non-matching addresses and phone numbers and different — and no more accurate than the first customer's — latitude-longitude GPS coordinates. Taking a larger "scoop" of customer data on this Walmart's location and entering the positions on an ALK Technologies map, Curnutt had to zoom out a ways to show all the red dots in perhaps a 10-mi. spread here, there and everywhere within that radius. "This is a problem," Curnutt stressed. "How are we supposed to get industry-wide business intelligence and do things like trending and aggregates and averages and analyze behavior for things like average time off of ETA if we can't even agree on what this is called and where it is for something as big as a Walmart distribution center?" Consider, now, data for much smaller, less-frequented locations, and the information your drivers may be getting on their way to deliveries. The fix — and a changed world "The good news is that there's a way to resolve all this," Curnutt told the audience, and that is to "create a master list of defined things" or reference data set. "We want to define things like location and turn this messy blob or rat's nest or lump of coal into a gem, into a diamond," she added. The goal is to generate industry-wide analytics and market intelligence from the mass of data commotion. She referenced the launch in July of Niantic's Pokemon GO, the augmented reality game that lets users track down and interact with fictional, animated Pokemon creatures on a smartphone or other camera-equipped mobile device. "How do you think Pokemon GO went from nothing to having more users than Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter in two weeks and didn't go down? You think they did that with their own data center? I don't think so," Curnutt contended. "You call Amazon and say, 'I need more power,' and they give it to you just like that." "The world has changed," she continued. "This is now possible with recent things like scale computing, machine learning, the concept of having a data scientist on staff and scaling up." For trucking, the idea is to create a reference data "de-duping and mapping engine," she said, that wouldn't have to do anything to customers' individual databases. Regardless of what a given customer entered in name, location and so on for something like the Walmart distribution center in her example, this conceptual master data engine could recognize what the correct entries should be. "And there can be more benefits," Curnutt added. "What if when you were onboarding a new location you'd never delivered to and started entering it, the application said, 'Do you mean this,' and if you said yes, it just populated the rest of the data and you didn't have to type anything?" As a future-looking possibility, she described how such a master data engine could provide actionable business intelligence — things like optimizing a delivery to a new customer for least possible dwell time. "You've never delivered there before, you enter it as a new location and something like this could pop up," Curnutt described the concept, showing a mock-up dwell time comparison chart. "You'd be able to know, if you were going to be delivering here on a Saturday between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m., that the average dwell time there is 70 minutes. "Maybe if I came in between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m., the dwell time is 10 minutes," she said. "That'd be an hour savings, and you'd instantly know that without having to have had years of understanding and working with this location." That's the kind of industry intelligence and functionality TMW is working on, according to Curnutt. "You'd spend less time entering data; you'd have more accurate data; you'd have immediate access to powerful, industry-wide analytics; you could make better, well-informed decisions," she said. "So keep that in your thoughts on TMW and the Big Data opportunity before us."     Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Across the country, low-wage workers are protesting, demanding the minimum wage be increased to $15/hour. Currently, for states that have a minimum wage, the rates are between $5.15 and $10.50 an hour. We are seeing the same debate in Canada, although not to the same extent.  It’s not hard to see their motivation, the US economy has seen recessions and a decline in well-paying middle class jobs. We’re seeing more inequality and increasingly, we are seeing college and university-educated employees working at low paying retail and service jobs, without a clear path towards the prosperity they so badly want. This might not be a problem if it weren’t set against the backdrop of large corporate profits.   According to Forbes, the 10 most profitable companies in the US made $210 billion in 2015 alone. Included in that top 10, among Apple and oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, is minimum-wage employer Walmart. It’s hard when you struggle to put food on the table and gas in your car to see your employer post a $19.2 billion profit. To their credit, Walmart has moved to offer better compensation, now paying at least $2.75 over minimum wage. While Walmart is the largest, the Forbes top 500 list is full of employers whose staff aren’t making much over minimum wage. It’s hard not to feel for the little guy. The problem is that while these large businesses do employ a lot of people, the majority of businesses are in fact small.  In the US, the Small Business Administration says that 99.7 per cent of the country’s businesses are small and in Canada, the statistics are the same.  While Walmart, or Home Depot, or McDonald’s may be among the most profitable companies in the US, that’s not the case for most of the smaller businesses paying minimum wage. The challenges facing low-income workers are real and should be addressed, but a higher minimum wage isn’t the answer. No matter how much proponents say it won’t happen, a rise in the minimum wage can only mean one of two things: a rise in prices for all goods, including the necessities purchased by minimum wage earners, or a decrease in the number of jobs.  The decrease in jobs can happen in one of two ways; first, some employees will be let go and the work will be spread among the remaining staff; second, human jobs will be replaced by automation and self serve, something we are already seeing at retailers and fast food restaurants.  The statistics back this up. In 2008, an extensive study of decades worth of minimum wage research found a one to two per cent decrease in employment for teenagers or very low skilled workers for each 10 per cent increase in minimum wage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office did their own calculation and found that an increase in the federal minimum wage, from its current rate of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour, would result in the loss of about 500,000 jobs. The same trends are true in Canada as well. Perhaps we could justify the job losses for these workers if overall, low wage earners would be helped from poverty, but the statistics show that the relationship between minimum wages and poverty is actually quite weak. Work done by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that higher minimum wages can actually increase poverty. In March 2016, Statistics Canada released their own report about minimum wage in Canada and the report noted that there is no consensus about how the minimum wage affects poverty and inequality, but added that the association with employment is well-documented – an increase in the minimum wage seems to be associated with a decrease in employment among teenagers, the group most likely to be paid at this hourly rate. The issue of poverty reduction and the ability of working people to earn a living wage are extremely important to our society, but an across the board raise in minimum wage isn’t the answer. Fewer jobs and further erosion in purchasing power isn’t the answer. Despite this, it’s clear that governments like these policies, they shift the responsibility to private entities and while some of them can absorb the costs, many of them aren’t so fortunate.

We continued to find expired baby formula, sour cream, baby food, supplements and prenatal vitamins at Walmart Supercenters and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties despite the media coverage that revealed the problem at local stores. Dozens of Times readers also wrote and called in with stories and photos about buying expired goods from Walmart stores in Brandon, Brooksville, Wimauma, Clearwater, Ruskin, Sebring and elsewhere. IN A TIGHT RACE, FLORIDA'S THIRD-PARTY VOTERS COULD DECIDE ELECTION — AGAIN Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, is the Libertarian Party nominee. Jill Stein, a Massachusetts physician and activist, represents the Green Party. Neither have much chance of winning the Nov. 8 election, experts say, but both could have an outsized effect on the outcome — especially in Florida. This is a crucial swing state and a near must-win for Republican nominee Donald Trump, and it could come down to who loses the fewest votes to third-party candidates.

The first of five identical grain storage units to be placed at the entrances to the city was installed last week. They are smallish Florida silos — 18 feet high, according to Rick Pearson of Proud Pelican Construction, the general contractor for the project — not the towering concrete cylinders usually associated with the term, but the idea is they'll convey a big message to drivers: That they have arrived at a friendly, tranquil place surrounded by a scenic countryside, a good town to enjoy a relaxing visit and, maybe for some, to live.

Sauter and Thomas C. Frohlich September 30, 2016 1:35 pm EST Print Email Tweet Wal-Mart, the world’s largest company and private employer, recently raised the minimum wage of its employees to $10 an hour. Since the company’s announcement last year, several of the corporate giant’s competitors, including Target and TJX, announced similar base minimum wages for their employees. A $10 per hour wage is $2.75 an hour higher than the federal minimum wage. Wal-Mart and its competitors are often criticized for paying their employees low wages and for treating them poorly. Many claim the wage increases are a public relation move and that these companies can afford to pay much more. Even at $10 an hour, these companies’ workers would still be paid far less than the typical American. The average hourly earnings of all U.S. workers is $23.23. Wal-Mart and Target have raised wages, others in the retail and service industry continue to pay front line workers $9 and $8 an hour. Some often just pay the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the largest American companies paying their workers very low wages. Click here to see the companies paying Americans the least  Millions of workers in the United States are currently earning minimum wage or just a few dollars above. David Cooper, senior analyst at left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute, discussed the difficulties these low-wage workers face with 24/7 Wall St. “At $7.25, a minimum wage worker with one child is going to be below the federal poverty line even if they’re working full-time, year-round,” Cooper said. “There is a federal bill to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. But the reality is that in many parts of the country, you would need more than that minimum wage target in order to have a decent quality of life. In most cities in the U.S., you would probably need at least $15 an hour in order to have a basic decent income.” Cooper explained that because of the nature of the service sector, companies employing these low-paid workers tend to view them as exhaustible resources. This explains the low pay and high turnover that can sometimes reach nearly 100% in a single year. Further, these companies have a high share of part-time workers. Indeed, a massive share of frontline workers in the service industry is employed part time. Of Dollar Tree’s 167,800 employees, about 112,00, or two-thirds, are employed in a part-time capacity. Of the 140,000 workers employed by Kohl’s, 77% are part-time workers. Companies, he explained, do this to be cost-effective, as part-time workers allow for greater flexibility, and also typically do not need to be paid benefits like health care. In addition to missing out on these benefits, Cooper explained, these workers face other problems. Such workers are typically forced to find another job to make ends meet, but if their employer requires them to be flexible, maintaining a second job can be impossible. Cooper added it can also hinder professional development. “if they’re constantly shifting from job to job, they’re also never really focusing on building their skills.” The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour does not apply to tipped employees. While fast food companies on this list, including McDonald’s and Yum! Brands, do not employ tipped workers, fast casual dining companies such as Darden, which is on this list, do. Companies that employ tipped workers are only required to pay them $2.13 an hour if workers earn the federal minimum wage through their tips. The companies paying their workers so little are mostly not struggling — they pay executives very high salaries and often report large and increasing profits. Wal-Mart raised its minimum wage at U.S. stores to $10 an hour, but it would take 952 full-time employees working year round to match the salary of CEO Douglas McMillon. The profits of most of the companies on this list rose last year. Even among the companies that reported lower net income, most still posted hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in profits. Low- and minimum-wage workers involved in last year’s fast food strike point to these figures when demanding an increase in wages. Opponents of raising wages in the service sector explain that asking companies to raise wages is counterproductive for employers and employees alike. allowing companies to set the wages they prefer to pay allows them to hire as many workers as possible. This will likely be more common argument as automation becomes an increasing factor in low-skill work, and employers need to weigh higher salaried employees with potentially cheap and more effective machines. minimum-wage jobs, it has been argued, also create opportunities for young adults or college students entering the workforce for the first time.

Jacob was shot yesterday at Townville Elementary School. pic.twitter.com/qM3Nq2YVwR — Nigel Robertson (@thetopstoryWYFF) September 29, 2016 They gathered in the Walmart parking lot Thursday night, dozens of sniffling and sorrowful believers, calling to God in desperate pleas. “Lamb of God,” one woman cried. “Hallelujah!” said another. “We live in a broken, broken world today,” a pastor told the crowd. “This is why we’re here.” Twenty-four hours before, an armed teenager had driven a pickup truck to Townville Elementary in South Carolina and fired bullets at a door as it was heaved open for recess. One of the three people shot, 6-year-old Jacob Hall, was struck in the leg and carried away. The bullet pierced his femoral artery, his family said in a statement, causing him to bleed and bleed, to require resuscitation twice and to undergo lifesaving surgery. The gunshot wound leeched him of so much blood, his family said, that the boy sustained brain damage. “Jacob is in very critical condition,” the family’s statement said, “and we are hanging on every second.” They asked the community to keep praying. So in the Walmart parking lot, as Jacob fought for his life in a hospital room five miles away, the believers, clumped in a circle, helped in the only way they could. Tim Marcengill, an associate pastor at Townville’s Oakdale Baptist Church, read from the third chapter of Ecclesiastes. “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” Marcengill said. He paused. “Jacob is a beautiful little boy.” The first-grader remained in critical condition late Thursday night, Keith Webb of Greenville Health System’s Children’s Hospital, said in a statement obtained by WYFF 4. Jacob lost so much blood that he went into cardiopulmonary arrest. “He has undergone surgery and a number of procedures to try to stabilize his condition,” the doctor said in the statement. Rep. Alan Clemmons, a state lawmaker, posted a photo of Jacob to Facebook the day of the shooting, calling on the entire state to pray for the boy. It has since been shared more than 9,400 times. Jacob is the nephew of Clemmons’s friends and former neighbors, Dave and Sheila Williams, in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Clemmons wrote that the boy was revived twice, once during medical transport and again during surgery. “PLEASE join me in fervent prayer for little Jacob’s recovery,” the representative wrote. As of early Friday, a GoFundMe page set up for Jacob’s family had raised about $77,000. The two others shot Wednesday — a first-grade teacher and another student — were both released from the hospital. The teacher was shot in the shoulder; the child was shot in the foot. At the Walmart prayer vigil Thursday night, family members told the crowd Jacob was a fighter. “We’re waiting and hoping for a miracle,” Gerald Gambrell, one of Jacob’s older brothers, told the Greenville News. Jacob, who has light-brown hair and wears dark-rimmed glasses, was described by Gambrell as smart, “the top of his class in first grade.” Jacob attends Oakdale Baptist Church, where Marcengill preaches on Sunday mornings. At services, Marcengill told the crowd, Jacob always appeared with a smile, full of warmth. Several weeks ago, the pastor said, Jacob’s grandfather prayed with the boy to “receive the Lord.” “Six years old,” Marcengill said. “But he knew. He knew.” Then the pastor turned his attention to comforting the believers. He reminded them what the Bible says about eternity, and what will happen if their hopeful prayers aren’t answered. “If Jacob were here, he’d tell you that Jesus loves you,” the pastor said. “And that he loves you.” More from Morning Mix: A teen took a gun to his middle school.

The post quickly went viral. Related News/Archive Walmart stores around Tampa Bay found selling expired products, including baby food 2 Months Ago For some low-income workers, retirement is only a dream 2 Weeks Ago Little known 'saver's credit' helps low-income taxpayers save for retirement 8 Months Ago The Tampa Bay Times wrote a front page story about it and a local television station covered it. At the time, Walmart said employees were working fast to fix the problem. They pledged to do better. For the next three weeks, Tampa Bay Times reporters browsed the aisles of Walmart stores around Tampa Bay looking for more expired goods. We continued to find expired baby formula, sour cream, baby food, supplements and prenatal vitamins at Walmart Supercenters and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties despite the media coverage that revealed the problem at local stores. Dozens of Times readers also wrote and called in with stories and photos about buying expired goods from Walmart stores in Brandon, Brooksville, Wimauma, Clearwater, Ruskin, Sebring and elsewhere. We checked out Walmart's competitors, like Aldi, Save-A-Lot, Winn-Dixie and even stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General, to see if they had expired goods, too. We didn't find any. We also found that the Walmart Supercenter stores and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores that serve neighborhoods that are low income and ethnically diverse seemed to have the most expired goods on their shelves. For example, the Walmart Neighborhood Market located at 1794 22nd St S., in St. Petersburg, where the original complaints went viral, serves a neighborhood where nearly half the homes sold over the last six months were less than $100,000. Compare that to the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 6850 22nd Ave. S., in South Pasadena, which serves more middle and upper class neighborhoods. Times reporters did not find any expired goods at this store, which is in a neighborhood where only 13 percent of homes sold over the last six months were under $100,000. Read more: Walmart stores around Tampa Bay found selling expired products, including baby food Walmart acknowledged the problems: "We want to apologize for what's been brought to our attention. This is unacceptable, and we've worked hard to remove all out-of-date products from our store shelves. We'll continue addressing this matter to make sure our customers have access to the freshest products, and we encourage them to speak to a manager about concerns they may have," said Charles Crowson, spokesman for the retailer. It appeared Walmart was making progress as time went on. Times reporters noticed fewer expired items on shelves over the three-week period. By the end, most stores no longer had expired goods at all. Phil Lempert, editor at SupermarketGuru.com, wondered if Walmart had a distribution problem. He said new technology could fix problems like this fast. "The answer lies with barcode technology," Lempert said. "New technology wouldn't allow a cashier to sell a product that was expired. The barcode would flag it for the cashier. The problem is, retailers aren't using this yet. It's a complicated issue." Troubles with stores in low income neighborhoods is common, according to recent study shows that Walmart stores nearest to low-income or diverse neighborhoods often have the worst online reviews. A study published in Contexts, a publication of the American Sociological Association, analyzed thousands of Yelp reviews of Walmart stores nationwide and found that the higher the percentage of Black or Latino residents in a specific ZIP code, the worse the Yelp reviews were for that corresponding store. Crowson described the study as "flawed" and "meritless." "Our customer traffic is up, we're hearing positive feedback from more satisfied shoppers and we remain focused on getting better," he added. Most of the specific complaints in the study had to do with too few employees working in the stores and dirty store conditions. "While there's no excuse for anyone to go into these stores and find expired goods, this sounds like a staffing problem," Lempert said. "People want to pay the cheapest price possible" so often times retailers like Walmart employ less people to make up the difference. "They can't afford to staff stores properly," Lempert said. Crowson said that staffing at Walmart stores depends on a variety of factors, including the time of the year and store sales. "We recognize the critical role our associates play in our success, and that's why we're investing $2.7 billion on education, training and wages. Those opportunities help to strengthen our associates, their families and the communities we proudly serve," he added. Staffing seemed to be a common issue among all discount grocery stores visited by Times reporters over the last three weeks. Often times there was only one or two employees working at Aldi, Save-A-Lot or Walmart Neighborhood Market stores we visited. "You never hear of this happening in chain-oriented environments," said Jeff Green, a retail analyst with Jeff Green Partners. "But Walmart is known for having especially few staffers." James Miller with the Florida Retail Federation said that sometimes retailers end up with a greater surplus of one brand of product if it doesn't sell well. "Maybe a store simply made an error in not removing that item or not reordering merchandise in a timely fashion," Miller said. "I think what you ran into with the expired food is highly unusual and were a few isolated incidents, not at all indicative of the company or industry." But this isn't the first time Walmart or another grocer has sold expired food and perishable goods. In 2008, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against Walmart, Target and a local grocery store chain over selling expired infant formula. Target settled the case for $375,000. Walmart settled two years later for $775,000. "What's the point of the expiration date? To give consumers the best, and most fresh product they can for their money," Green said. "While we can't say this was done intentionally, it's certainly not best practices, which is what Walmart usually prides itself on." Contact Justine Griffin at jgriffin@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8467. Follow @SunBizGriffin. Expiration date explanations Best if used by: This is the suggested date from the manufacturer that guarantees the best flavor and quality of a food product. The product is safe for consumption after this point, but the taste may be compromised. Use by: This is the date the manufacturer has recommended for use of the product. The food product is safe for consumption after this date, but the flavor or quality may not be as good as when it was initially produced. Sell by: This is the date that tells retailers when the manufacturer thinks the food product should be removed from the shelves. Infant formula: Federal regulations require a "use by" label on infant formula under FDA inspection. If stored too long, the formula can separate and clog. The "use by" date is selected by the manufacturer or distributor of the product. Do not buy or use baby formula after its "use-by" date.

Barclays believes that Wal-Mart stock can rise by more than 20% from current levels, and the thesis doesn't sound at all unreasonable. Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 29, 2016 at 7:00PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stock is doing remarkably well lately; shares of the retail juggernaut have gained almost 20% year to date. Even better, the stock still has a lot to offer to investors, at least according to Barclays. The bank recently upgraded Wal-Mart from an "equal weight" to an "overweight" rating, increasing its price target for the stock from $70 to $87 per share. This implies an attractive upside potential of more than 20% versus current price levels. Investors should always take Wall Street recommendations with a grain of salt; professional analysts can make mistakes just like everyone else, and they often do. However, there is nothing wrong with taking a look at Barclays' bullish thesis for Wal-Mart to find out whether it makes sense. The tide is turning The discount retail industry has always been notoriously challenging and competitive, and things are getting even more difficult for brick-and-mortar retailers due to asphyxiating competitive pressure from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The online retailer is focused on providing aggressively low prices and a high-quality experience to customers, even when these come at the expense of its own profitability. Competing against a company such as Amazon, which is willing to put market-share gains over profits, can be a daunting challenge, and this is having a negative impact on retailers across the board.  But Wal-Mart is fighting back; the company is increasing its investments in people and technology to improve service quality and accelerate online growth. In addition, Wal-Mart has recently formed an alliance with Chinese e-commerce operator JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and the company has invested $3.3 billion in the purchase of online retailer Jet.com. According to Barclays, these initiatives are generating improving performance at Wal-Mart. As quoted by CNBC, the Barclays note to clients says: "We believe the tide is turning [for Wal-Mart]. Investments in labor appear to be resonating with the employees and therefore the customers, the quality of the product offering is improving, and service and execution has improved." The company doesn't disclose its internal customer satisfaction figures, but management is talking about consistent improvements in customer satisfaction and service over the past several quarters. Specifically, CEO Doug McMillon said in the most recent conference call: "Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding and I'm proud of them." The company is making sound progress in key areas such as mobile payment technologies. Its digital payment app is now available in the more than 4,600 Wal-Mart stores nationwide. According to the company, four out of five customers would recommend using Walmart Pay, and 88% of transactions come from repeat Walmart Pay users. These numbers speak well of customer satisfaction scores in mobile payments. While the company still has substantial room for improvement, revenue figures are pointing in the right direction. Global revenue excluding currency fluctuations grew 2.8% last quarter, and comparable sales in the U.S. exceeded the company's guidance, with a year-over-year increase of 1.6%. Wal-Mart has delivered positive comparable sales in the U.S. over the past eight consecutive quarters, while traffic has increased for seven quarters in a row. About the price target Wall Street analysts are estimating that Wal-Mart will make $4.34 in earnings per share over the current year. Of course, earnings forecasts are subject to errors and adjustments, and analysts have, in fact, increased their earnings estimates for Wal-Mart over the past several months. Just 90 days ago, Wall Street was expecting $4.26 in earnings per share from the company, so estimates are increasing as a reflection of positive business momentum. Based on current earnings expectations, Wal-Mart stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio in the area of 16.5, while a price target of $87 per share would put the stock at a P/E of around 20. As a reference, the average company in the S&P 500 index is currently trading at a P/E in the neighborhood of 19.3. Similarly, Wal-Mart pays a dividend of $0.50 quarterly per share; this represents a dividend yield of 2.8% at current prices. The $87 price target from Barclays would mean a dividend yield of 2.3%, which is the average dividend yield currently offered by companies in the S&P 500. An $87 price target for Wal-Mart would mean a valuation roughly in line with the average stock in the S&P 500. The company operates in a difficult segment, and growth rates will probably remain below average over the medium term, so Wal-Mart needs to continue delivering improvements to justify an expansion in valuation ratios. However, as long as management keeps leading the company in the right direction, Barclays' price target for the company doesn't seem unreasonable at all. Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Amazon.com.

I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? — Stuck at 17 Dear Stuck: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at (800) 656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. Dear Amy: My son recently got married, and although I hosted a nice reception dinner and was appropriately dressed for the wedding, I was not invited to participate in any of the wedding photos. Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests and it was only afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn’t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom, and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride’s family prior to the wedding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am I wrong? — Mother of the Groom Dear Mother of the Groom: Whether your son and his wife were deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless when it came to photos, your reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely justified. They owe you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one, you would accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing to receive this album (an understandable, but not really generous reaction), a gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. Dear Amy: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a while, but caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper, but better yet: RUN! — Siri Dear Siri: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis.   Tags:  Ask Amy Amy Dickinson Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Ask Amy Ask Amy: Woman caught between boyfriend and mother November 17, 2016, 1:00 am Dear Amy: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half.

Shooting suspect captured in North Spokane By Nina Culver ninac@spokesman.com(509) 459-5473 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Police arrested a suspect in an August shooting in West Central outside a north Spokane Wal-Mart Saturday afternoon with the help of two citizens. Someone called police shortly after noon Saturday to report two suspicious men outside the Wal-Mart on Colton Street. When police arrived one of the men ran and two bystanders helped an officer capture him, according to a Spokane Police Department news release. The man, who initially gave police a false name, was identified as 26-year-old Danny T. Williams. He is suspected of being involved in a shooting in the 1500 block of West Sharp Avenue on Aug. 25 that left a men with a non-life-threatening wound to the leg. Williams has been booked into the Spokane County Jail on charges of second-degree assault, drive-by shooting and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The man who was with Williams at the Wal-Mart was arrested on an unrelated felony warrant. Published: Oct. 1, 2016, 4:18 p.m.  Tags: Danny T.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 1, 2016 at 10:43AM $1,000 might not seem like enough money to invest in the stock market. But in a previous article, I noted that well-timed investments of $1,000 in Apple or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would each be worth about half a million dollars now. Today, I'll go a step further and discuss two stocks that turned $1,000 into several million dollars over several decades. Disney Disney (NYSE:DIS) went public in 1957 at $13.88 per share. $1,000 would have been enough to buy 72 shares. After six splits, you would have 27,648 shares today, which would be worth $2.55 million at today's prices. That massive stake would also be paying out $39,260 in dividends every year. Image source: Pixabay. Granted, $1,000 in 1957 is equivalent to about $8,500 in today's dollars. Nonetheless, an $8,500 investment that blossoms into a $2.55 million one reveals the market-crushing potential of investing in well-run companies over the long term. It also demonstrates the value of patience. In the 1960s and 1970s, Disney was one of the "Nifty 50" stocks which were considered solid "buy and hold" investments and fueled the bull market in the early 1970s. But when the bear market hit later that decade, Disney and the rest of the Nifty 50 were aggressively sold off. The House of Mouse then languished for years as theme park attendance waned and the company's family friendly movies saw big box office declines. Disney only recovered after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Paramount, took over as CEO and had the company acquire Touchstone Pictures, Capital Cities ABC, ESPN, and other higher-growth media properties to become a media powerhouse. Eisner also oversaw the "Disney Renaissance" between 1989 and 1999, which saw the House Of Mouse release hit animated films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Eisner's successor, Bob Iger, further expanded Disney's media empire with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Today, Disney faces fresh headwinds, with cord cutters threatening to derail its cable TV business. But Disney continues evolving to face these challenges with new streaming platforms and investments in "new media" companies -- indicating that it could still have room to run. Wal-Mart Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) went public at $16.50 per share in 1970. $1,000, or $6,500 in today's dollars, would have been enough to buy 60 shares. After splitting 11 times, those shares would have multiplied to 122,880 shares -- which would be worth $8.82 million today. You would also be receiving $245,760 in dividends per year. Image source: Wal-Mart. Like Disney, Wal-Mart was a member of the Nifty 50 that initially soared but faced tough challenges during the bear market of the mid-1970s. But as Wal-Mart spread across America and other countries with its superstore format, it drove smaller competitors out of business with economies of scale. As a result, its annual revenues rose from $1.3 billion in 1980 to $165 billion in 2000. Wal-Mart didn't face any significant challenges until Amazon evolved from an online bookseller into an online superstore in the late 1990s. The company failed to keep up in online sales, and its sales growth fell far behind Amazon's. Source: YCharts Amazon aggressively expanded its ecosystem with Amazon Prime, new services like grocery and food deliveries, and (soon) drone deliveries. Wal-Mart fought back by matching Amazon's prices, launching its own subscription-based delivery service, and expanding its digital ecosystem of streaming media and online payments. It also recently agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. CEO Doug McMillon, who took over the top job in 2014, is trying to reinvent the massive retailer with billions of dollars in investments in e-commerce, employee training, and higher wages. The jury's still out on those efforts, and analysts expect Wal-Mart to post just 1% sales growth this year. But if they pay off, Wal-Mart's sales growth might pick up over the next few years. The bottom line The growth of Disney and Wal-Mart over the past few decades reaffirms Benjamin Graham's famed statement: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine; but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Therefore, long-term investors who want to turn thousands into millions should analyze a company's growth potential in decades instead of quarters.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com and Walt Disney.

Smith turned to a legal insurance plan that he had taken out for situations just like this. With the help of an attorney, a settlement was negotiated with the district attorney’s office to get the misdemeanor dismissed upon the 16-year-old’s completion of community service hours. And thanks to the legal plan with ARAG, Smith figures he saved more than $2,000 in attorney fees and a lot of time, not to mention avoiding stress. The coverage “saved us from having to pay a lot of money,” said Smith, a police officer in Austin, Texas, “and it saved my son’s reputation. He wants to go to college, and having any kind of a record would have made it difficult.” Companies like ARAG, U.S. Legal Services and others have designed legal insurance plans that are offered as part of employer-sponsored benefit plans or sold directly to consumers. And insurers are seeing a growing number of parents purchasing the coverage. Parents can purchase the protection for a range of legal matters ranging from traffic violations and apartment leases to more serious problems such as theft and personal injury claims. The cost? Premiums are typically less than $20 a month and carry a deductible of $250 or so. For some parents, legal insurance can provide peace of mind in the event their teenager or college-age child gets into trouble. And let’s face it, even the best kids sometimes do stupid things. Here’s how ARAG’s standard policy works: When a policyholder has a legal problem, he or she contacts the company and explains the problem. Once the legal issue is identified, the insurer provides the policyholder with a list of qualified attorneys who practice nearby. The policyholder then picks the attorney and makes the contact. ARAG has a network of about 11,000 attorneys with different specialties. The company generally aims to provide attorneys who practice within a 30-mile radius of the policyholder. Smith is a believer in the protection. The father of six pays about $14 a month, or $168 a year, for his legal plan, which is offered through the police department. While having the policy lessened the impact of the candy theft on Smith’s son, the outcome was far different for his son’s best friend, who wasn’t covered through legal insurance. The teen was fined, had to perform twice as much community service work and still has the misdemeanor on his record, which eventually might require the help of an attorney to have it removed when he becomes an adult. Laura Budd, an attorney near Charlotte, N.C., who has been in the ARAG network since 2004, has handled multiple cases involving kids who got into trouble. Having immediate access to an attorney, Budd said, “keeps kids out of the (legal) system.” Still, is legal insurance the answer? Certainly, the benefits may not be worth the price for some. Do the math, and factor in the deductible. Moreover when reviewing these policies, pay attention to what is covered and what is not. Some policies will broaden the coverage, but at a higher price. And some serious legal problems won’t be covered at all. Like other types of insurance, you’re also paying for some peace of mind just in case your son or daughter gets into a jam. Backing this legal protection up with stern advice to your kids is also key. There needs to be a discussion about responsible behavior, owning a mistake and the consequences for getting into trouble. No legal insurance plan will cover all those bases for you.

It's a big number, even considering the fact that the biggest reason there's so much student loan debt is because more and more people — and not just those whose families can afford it upfront — are going to college.  The average amount of debt on student loans is about $37,000, but whether someone owes $5,000 or $100,000, debt can cast a shadow over their entire life. And not all debt feels the same. Someone who graduated from a four-year university might be better able to manage their debt load than someone who dropped out of a community college or a for-profit after a few semesters.  Jen Smith knows what that's like. She's the first person in her family to go to college — she went to the for profit International Academy of Design and Technology (IADT) in Chicago. She left after a year and a half. IADT's parent company has since closed several campuses. When Smith went back to school to get her nursing degree, she found out the credits she earned there didn't count.  "I didn't know that those credits would be worthless," Smith said. "Who would sign up for something like that?" Since leaving IADT, the original $27,000 loan Smith took out has ballooned to $45,000. She has a job in human resources now, while working towards her nursing degree.  Sandy Baum, who studies debt at the Urban Institute, says that for a majority of students who attend traditional colleges, debt isn't a crisis, or even a problem. "They don't like repaying their debts, but they're fine," Baum said. "Their earnings premium from going to college is far higher than is necessary to pay back those loans."   The for-profit schools present a different problem. "We have too many people borrowing to go to institutions, and programs that we know in advance are not going to serve them well," Baum said. "That's a crisis." Like IADT, some other for-profit programs have struggled, or even shuttered in recent months. Corinthian and ITT Tech collapsed, leaving thousands of students with ruined credit, and, potentially, piles of debt. But in the last 15 years, loans have become a bigger issue for traditional schools, too. Part of the reason is that the cost of attending a public university has gone up by 54 percent since 2000.  Sara Goldrick-Rab,  a professor at Temple University who studies the price of higher education, said "the major thing driving that increase is that states used to fund public higher education. They withdrew some of their support and in doing so, somebody has to pick up that tab and they basically decided that the people going to college and their families should pay for that."  For students who started school in the years before the recession, the price change was acute. Chris Savelle, who studied finance at Central Michigan University, said the price of a credit went up dramatically — from $148 when he started school in 2002 to $324 by the time he graduated in December 2008.  Toby the dog stares out the window at the home Chris Savelle shares with his mother and sister. After his father died and his mother was laid off, Chris began supporting his family while paying off his student loans.  - Eliza Mills/Marketplace Savelle has about $100,000 in loans, and pays $1000 a month on the interest. He doesn't blame his school for his debt load, though. "I did this to myself," Savelle says,  "I knew, when I was taking out these loans, that I was building up a bigger and bigger debt burden but told myself 'I'll have a good job when I get out of college.'" Savelle wanted to work on Wall Street as a trader, but finding a good job during was harder than he anticipated it to be. After six months of unemployment, he got a job as a manager at a Walmart.  "We used to make jokes in that store because it was one of the most well-qualified Walmart stores I think we've ever seen. The number of laid-off engineers was amazing," Savelle says. After nine months at Walmart, Savelle got lucky, and found a job in supply chain engineering. It wasn't high finance, but he likes it, and makes $85,000 a year, enough to support his mother and sister and cover rent for the house the three of them share, make payments on his loans and save a bit for retirement.  Even though his debt is in a manageable place now, Savelle's loans continue to have a major impact on him and his family. His younger sister, Katie, is terrified of debt. She dropped of college after one semester because she wasn't happy, and immediately paid off her debt with earnings from a part-time job at a bakery. She's not sure if she'll go back to school, but is considering a trade certificate instead of a four-year program. Having six figures in student debt isn't the norm — Savelle is an outlier. But he's also a study in what happened to a generation of students whose time in school coincided with rising prices and stagnating middle class wages.  "The people who are most impacted are low income, African American, Latino families who finally put a child, put their family through college, and now seeing they are stuck with this lifetime of debt that even if the parents and grandparents try to help, they can't seem to ever make the payments," said Lisa Madigan, an Illinois attorney general who is pushing loan servicers  — companies who collect payments and process loans — to automatically enroll borrowers in income-based repayment plans.  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan in her office in Chicago. Madigan is pushing for loan servicers to enroll borrowers in income based repayment plans.  - Eliza Mills/Markeptlace   Income-based repayment is an option for all borrowers, but many don't know that they're eligible and many complain that debt servicers don't assist them in finding a manageable solution. Instead, they push them to make the highest payments possible.  Almost all student debt is owned or guaranteed by the Federal government — in 2010 the government took over making federal loans, often contracting loan servicers. Servicers will make about $2 billion in commission from the Department of Education this year, but many borrowers have complaints about the way servicers handle their loans.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) monitors complaints about loan servicers and is working to create and enforce guidelines for loan servicers, to make sure that the billions they collect from the government to collect on federal loans are going towards services that make repayment more manageable for families.  CFPB Ombudsman Seth Frotman said, "there are supposed to be protections for all of these borrowers who thought they were doing the right thing by going to school, taking on this historic level of debt, and the promise kind of was 'you'll never have to pay more than you can afford.' And the very companies that are supposed to be ensuring that is the case are essentially failing borrowers for a second time." "One of the things that the bureau has been working toward, through public enforcement actions, through the first ever federal oversight of these entities, is ensuring that illegal practices will no longer be tolerated," Frotman said. The Department of Education oversees the contracts with loan servicers, and recently made an announcement about their expectations for future compliance, which would start in 2019. Frotman said that the CFPB is pushing for more immediate action. "The bureau has new tools at its disposal, so if we find that a company's practices are unfair, deceptive, or abusive, we have the ability to take action," he said. "The challenge that we face in this space is that when a market essentially doubles over a very short time, like we saw in this student loan context, the question is, have the regulators, have the people overseeing the market, have the rules kept up. In this case, they haven't," Frotman said. Any potential changes to the system, from pricing to collection to forgiveness, may not come fast enough for borrowers who are already saddled with student loan debt. But for the next generation of college students, bearing witness to struggles with student loan debt have already prompted a new outlook: asking whether a traditional college education has become too much of a financial risk.

Advertisement We’ve all heard about recent retail store closings at successful companies such as Kohl’s, Macy’s and Walmart. A major reason for this is the shift from brick-and-mortar stores to the growth of e-commerce as a result of omni-channel marketing and distribution. In fact, according to an NFI Industries article entitled, The E-Commerce Effect on the Commercial Real Estate Industry, “In 2014, e-commerce sales for United States retailers surpassed $300 billion for the first time, reaching $304.9 billion, which was a 15.40% increase in comparison to the previous year and is the fifth year in a row that web sales growth has been close to or above 15%.... With companies offering same-day delivery, gift wrapping, ship-to-store and other e-commerce advantages, consumers are opting to do more of their shopping online. As e-commerce continues to grow, industries like commercial real estate are adapting to offer more ideal solutions to support e-commerce goals. E-commerce has shifted what companies look for in their real estate facilities and has evolved what is now expected in today’s fulfillment centers.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things One doesn’t often think about the intersection of supply chain management and real estate, but the relationship goes back a long way in the distribution and warehouse function, and now with the shift towards e-commerce, it is more important and visible than ever before. In fact, regional distribution facilities are the most common property type in the U.S., comprising well over 60% of the U.S. industrial inventory and the majority of industrial REIT portfolios, according to an article in Wealth Management Magazine. The article goes on to state that e-commerce retailers use logistics real estate in ways that require more space. Many activities that were typically carried out within stores are now consolidated into logistics facilities, and e-commerce customers just need more room… as much as three times as much logistics space—or more—as their brick-and-mortar counterparts. So, as the NFI article points out, and is true in general, the “location decision” now more than ever is a strategy that shouldn’t be taken lightly and can be looked at in terms of: Sourcing —An organization must decide if they plan to fulfill e-commerce orders from the store, a distribution center (DC) dedicated to fulfilling e-commerce orders with a separate DC dedicated to their stores, or one DC that fulfills both the e-commerce orders and replenishes store inventory. In many cases, companies may choose to have a combination of these methods. Location—In many cases with e-commerce, it is important to reach most consumers in the least amount of time due to the requirements of overnight or even same-day shipments. So there has been an increase in the amount of retailers headed toward urban hubs like New Jersey, Lehigh Valley and southern California which are near major metropolitan areas. It is also critical to consider labor availability in the area, especially during the holiday season. Develop or Adapt—The type of facility you choose can depend on your business objectives and specific current and future needs (often customized), which may push the decision towards either a new building or finding an existing building. Design—E-commerce has specific and different requirements than traditional DCs such as they may be more automated but still require a vast amount of labor for “pick and pack” vs. “pallet in, pallet/case out” traditional DCs with a high variety of items. Each company needs to determine its own needs for capital investment, length of commitment and anticipated rate of change in its business to determine their particular e-commerce real estate strategy, but there is no denying that e-commerce is driving the need for industrial real estate and is now a critical part of the competitive and location strategy of many companies today.

Hong, File) A Walmart apologized after employees didn’t make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake in the latest cake-related controversy to befall the retail giant. Employees at one of its stores refused to bake the cake, which also depicts the “thin blue line” frequently mentioned by law enforcement, for the daughter of a retiring police officer, reported the Macon Telegraph. One of the employees told the woman, who remained anonymous, that “the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.” When asked to place a blue line on a chocolate background, the employee said she didn’t “feel comfortable” with that either. Walmart later apologized. Wal-Mart employees in McDonough, GA have been accused of refusing to make a Blue Lives Matter cake for a retiring police officer. pic.twitter.com/qRAI9v2WjZ — Everything Georgia (@GAFollowers) September 27, 2016 “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But sometimes we misstep,” the company said in a statement, according to a local ABC affiliate WTVM. “We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” Related Coverage ‘Sorry-I-Tased-You’ Cake Doesn’t Cut It for Florida Woman Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro Police Department, said the refusal to design the cake represents a larger issue. “It’s really heartbreaking, because officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us,” said Allen. On Facebook, a person who claims to know the woman said the manager at the Walmart “offered to make the cake (which had already been taken care of by Kroger) and apologized for the mistake.” Last year, Walmart was slammed when one of its stores in Louisiana stores refused to bake a cake with a Confederate flag on it, but agreed to bake a cake with the ISIS flag design for the same person, according to ABC News.

However, the firm pointed out four reasons for initiating a Buy rating and $82 price target. In the last four quarters, the company's EPS provided positive surprise. The company's top-line beat in the most recent quarter surprised the Street analysts, who started to look back at the stock.

Last week, at a Walmart in Texas, a female bystander spotted a man pushing a shopping cart with a crying child’s hair wrapped around the handle. The woman intervened, and eventually called the police for help. The incident set off a debate on when bystanders should say something about another parent’s discipline . But what happens when safety is not at stake? Is there ever a right time to tell someone you don’t agree with a parenting decision? Gretta Keene, a Brooklyn psychologist, had a friend who was adopting a child and was insistent on never telling the child. Having dealt professionally with patients on the sensitive subject, Ms. Keene was aware of potential issues up ahead. This was a close friend, so she offered free advice: “I thought there were other ways of handling the situation and just said her choice might have unintended consequences,” she recalled. How was this received? “She reacted by cutting off our longtime relationship.” John Jacobs, a psychiatrist and associate professor of family therapy at N.Y.U., said, “You are always taking a gamble when discussing others’ lives, especially when it comes to their children. It’s a dangerous place to go and usually doesn’t end well.” Two couples I know in New York reached a tense standoff when one couple’s son decided to cancel a planned spring break with the other boy. Why? Because he got a “better” offer. The boys remained friends, though the parents did not. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Similar conflicts also play out onscreen. NBC’s limited series “The Slap” dealt with the repercussions of one child’s misbehavior at a party. The incident led to cruel accusations among the adults, broken friendships and eventually, a lawsuit. The premiere of this season’s “Blue Bloods” featured the paternal paragon, played by Tom Selleck, saying to an old friend, “I would never try to tell you how to show your love to your own son, but maybe you could try seeing him for what he’s become.” The response? “Go to hell, Frank!” In the recent film, “Captain Fantastic,” Viggo Mortensen’s character is raising five kids in such an unorthodox way that the children’s grandparents fight for custody. Indeed, the most daunting emotional tightrope involves questioning the parenting of our own children-turned-parents. With the number of “grand-boomers” growing every year, this problem is not going away. Theirs, after all, is the generation that not only thinks it will be forever young, but too often feels it is forever right. “It’s a huge issue for them to deal with their own kids’ raising of children,” said Meryle H. Gellman, a Los Angeles therapist. “Each family has to find the way because the last thing you want is disconnection.” I recently had breakfast with three relatively new grandmothers who all acknowledged how often they hold their tongues. One feels her grandson is distant and could make eye contact more. But she is scared to mention it to her generally defensive daughter. The second asked her husband to speak with their son about his 4-year-old’s “meanspirited” behavior. The third said she had to withhold vocal disbelief when her daughter took her 3-year-old to an occupational therapist because she wasn’t eating fruit. “I did suggest that she might be panicking too soon, and that she herself only ate grilled cheese sandwiches for one year,” she said. “When the therapist also told her that some long-term perspective was necessary, my daughter said to me, ‘O.K., but you don’t get to butt in on this a second time.’ So now we have something we call the ‘one-time only’ rule.” Of course, there are times when some interference may be called for. Sandy (who did not want her full name used) thought her son was coasting through his first year of college until she received what she thought was an annoying call from the mother of his roommate. “She started asking me if I’d talked to my son lately, if I had any worries and so on,” Sandy told me. “I was ready to hang up on her when she said that, apparently he had not been attending any classes and was spending most the time in the dorm room. I called the school but because of a law, they are not allowed to say anything without the student’s consent. We finally went to Michigan and found our very lost and confused son. Suffice to say, in the end, I was grateful for that phone call.” Though every child’s life has its own trajectory, and every family its unique dynamics, there is some general advice that fits all. “Parenting is a learned skill and like any other, might need some peer or educational counseling,” said Donna Naftalis, a grandmother who worked in early childhood development. “Support groups that offer guided instruction are valuable in forming new friendships for the new parents, and can offer nonjudgmental feedback from others who have been through it.” Dr. David Anderson, senior director of the ADHD and Behavior Disorders Center at Manhattan’s Child Mind Institute, suggested: “Share your own possible shortcomings and soften any comments by first pointing out the person’s strengths.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story My own mother was exemplary as both mom and grandmother, but it was not until her memorial service that a friend of hers told me, “Your mother said one of the great surprises of her life was how good a parent you turned out to be.” I wish I’d heard it from the original source. In the meantime, tread gently and consider the words of the children’s book author and grandparent Judith Viorst. She wrote a book about what happened when her adult son Alexander — yes, the one who had that famously terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day — temporarily moved back into her extremely tidy home with his wife and three kids. She notes that advice about other people’s parenting always ends up sounding like criticism, “no matter how charmingly expressed.” “Here’s my thought on offering unsolicited advice,” Ms. Viorst said. “Don’t.” Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

Market share gains and an inflection point in earnings could take shares of Wal-Mart to $90 in the next 12 months, a gain of 27 percent from Thursday's close, according to KeyBanc, which initiated coverage of the retail giant with an outperform rating. "Walmart's investments in store experience, e-commerce and eventually price are helping drive sustainable market share gains, and we think earnings are poised to inflect positively," wrote equity analyst Edward Yruma in a research note Friday. "The company has posted positive comps for eight consecutive quarters, which validates recent investments. We think that the company can opportunistically use price investments as a lever to drive the targeted incremental $45B-$60B in sales over a three-year period," read the note.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive West Utica grocery store almost a reality Friday Sep 30, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sep 30, 2016 at 9:52 AM The Utica Urban Renewal Agency, at its Oct. 13 meeting, is expected to approve the sale of city-owned property in the area of Lincoln Avenue and Roberts Street to Compassion Coalition, which has operated the 1,200-square-foot Your Bargain Grocer store at 506 Columbia St. for 17 years. S. Alexander Gerould @OD_Gerould UTICA — When Shelley Robbins needs to go pick up some groceries, she hops in her car and usually heads to Wal-Mart in North Utica. But while the West Utica resident can get around easily, she knows others aren’t so lucky. “I have a vehicle, but there’s a lot of people that don’t have vehicles that are on foot,” said Robbins, who lives on Court Street. “I’m sure it’s a little difficult for them to get to a grocery store.” There is good news coming for some of the neighborhood’s residents and others. The Utica Urban Renewal Agency, at its Oct. 13 meeting, is expected to approve the sale of city-owned property in the area of Lincoln Avenue and Roberts Street to Compassion Coalition, which has operated the 1,200-square-foot Your Bargain Grocer store at 506 Columbia St. for 17 years. Compassion Coalition offered $100,000 for the property that now serves as a construction staging area for the North-South Arterial project. The coalition will be relocating from its current location to the new site, where they hope to build an 11,500 square-foot grocery store along with a commercial kitchen for cooking classes. “We’re already (in the neighborhood)," said Charlie Sweet, the coalition’s vice president of business development and external affairs, "so all we’re doing is we’re going to a larger venue so that we can offer more product and healthier choices and also have the education end to it with the kitchen and cooking and such.” According to a 2015 Observer-Dispatch article, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website indicated that the West Utica neighborhood and other parts of the city could be considered food deserts, which are defined as a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlets. There are 1,292 low-income residents within the census tract containing a portion of West Utica who are more than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, according to the USDA. That compares to around 649 low-income residents who are more than one mile from the nearest grocery store within the census tract containing most of Commercial Drive in New Hartford. West Utica residents have limited smaller options for shopping for food, including Stewart's at 425 Court St. and the West Utica Foodland at 912 Court St. In June, a farmers market offering fresh produce, local products and other items opened near the Boilermaker headquarters at 805 Court St. The new Compassion Coalition store, meanwhile, is expected to carry more items and product lines such as more fresh, organic produce and meats. Sweet said they also are making a big push toward offering more organic products and locally produced and grown products by working with local farmers and others. “So, all we’re basically doing is taking what we’ve done very well with these past 10 to 11 years," he said, "and going to a larger scale so that we can better serve the community that we’re within." Brian Thomas, executive director of the Urban Renewal Agency, said that the West Utica neighborhood has been asking for a grocery store for a long time and that city officials have been working diligently to bring something to the neighborhood. “They bring a high level of activity with their current store where they are to the downtown,” Thomas said of the Compassion Coalition, “and it is definitely good news that they will remain both in the city of Utica and specifically in the downtown.” Robbins, meanwhile, said the proposed store will be good for the neighborhood. The neighborhood also might see an influx of new people as a result of projects in the area such as Indianapolis-based KCG Development plans transform the three-building Globe Mills complex at 811-827 Court St. into about 131 apartments. “I am positive it will because you have a lot of young people from Kennedy Plaza, even older people that don’t drive,” she said. “I see that there’s a lot of young couples and stuff in the neighborhoods around here and they always walk. I mean there’s going to be people around here that might not have the transportation to go places, so it would be very beneficial, I believe.” Follow @OD_Gerould on Twitter or call him at 315-792-4995.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscriber Services Classifieds Submit Announcements & News Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Your Community News Blotters Herkimer County Oneida-Verona New Hartford Rome Utica Oneida Indian Nation Whitestown Blogs - Living - Sports Sports: Anne Delaney Sports: John Pitarresi Sports: Ron Moshier Boilermaker College Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

(AP) — A Massachusetts Wal-Mart employee charged with setting three fires in the Sturbridge store has pleaded not guilty. Twenty-year-old Maiya Cruz was arraigned Thursday in Dudley District Court on charges including of destruction of property and burning a building's contents. Firefighters responded to the Wal-Mart around 5:25 p.m. Tuesday after someone reported a fire in the jewelry section. Three fires were discovered at the scene. No injuries were reported, however the store's food needed to be thrown out because it was exposed to smoke and chemicals from fire extinguishers. Investigators identified the Southbridge woman as a suspect after reviewing surveillance video. Cruz was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing. Members of Cruz's family say she has mental health issues and her lawyer said she had been hearing voices. Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

Despite seemingly little in common, the two hit it off when they first met, when Obama was still a junior senator on the rise, and in response to the death of Peres Obama released a statement that was unusually long and personal. The U.S. delegation will also include members of Congress from both political parties as well as former President Bill Clinton. • Perhaps a surprising guest at the funeral will be Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, who announced Thursday that he would attend the funeral, putting him in proximity to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when the two have been jousting over who is to blame for their failure to sit down and talk. •After a difficult season, Rays starter Chris Archer can at least say he won't be a 20-game loser. Archer avoided the 20th loss he didn't care much about and reached the 200-inning milestone he did in the Rays' 5-3 rain-delayed win over the White Sox on Thursday. • A Super Bowl-sized audience tuned in Monday night to watch two presidential candidates duke it out on a debate stage inside an auditorium on Long Island. Two more presidential candidates were locked out, forced to watch it on television like regular voters while the mass media pretended they didn't exist: Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. Neither have much chance of winning the Nov. 8 election, experts say, but both could have an outsized effect on the outcome, especially in Florida. Read Josh Solomon's story this morning on tampabay.com. • As debate about free speech on campus heats up at colleges across the country, Eckerd College in St. Petersburg is stepping into the fray. The school has adopted a statement that underscores a commitment to free speech in a time of tumult, when students concerned about injustice and inclusion are making waves for voicing their demands. • Hurricane Matthew strengthened into a strong Category 2 storm overnight, and is battering the Caribbean islands with heavy rains and whipping winds. The storm is forecast to continue west before taking a northerly turn, but its current path could still have it skirting South Florida. • Three weeks ago, Walmart got some bad publicity in the Tampa Bay area when people began sharing on Facebook that they found expired goods — including baby formula — on local store shelves. Walmart said the items would be removed, but Tampa Bay Times reporters kept checking in on local Walmarts to see how they did. The results weren't always positive. Read business reporter Justine Griffin's full column this morning. • It was a night for deeply personal revelations, as candidates seeking state House seats representing parts of Pinellas County spoke at a forum on substance abuse and mental health. Then political newcomer Jennifer Webb, a Democrat challenging Republican incumbent Rep. Kathleen Peters, told the packed room at the Operation PAR campus why she decided to run for the District 69 seat. • From the Times Editorial Board: Bernie McCabe, the longtime state attorney for Pinellas and Pasco counties, is not a prosecutor to whom a "soft on crime" label would ever stick. He never before had appeared at a parole hearing in favor of the convicted. But in Timothy Kane, a Pasco man imprisoned for life at age 14, he saw an exceptional case that prompted him to take an exceptional step.

President Barack Obama, after receiving the Presidential Medal of Distinction, raises a toast along with President Shimon Peres of Israel at an official state dinner in Jerusalem on March 21, 2013. Despite seemingly little in common, the two hit it off when they first met, when Obama was still a junior senator on the rise, and in response to the death of Peres released a statement that was unusually long and personal.

On Wednesday, 29-year-old William Murray and 36-year-old Antony Kanazeh seemingly thought they were meeting drug users but it ended up being undercover agents. Kanazeh and Murray are just two of the six suspects Delaware County detectives arrested Wednesday on drug-related charges. “If you’re looking for drugs in Delaware County, we’re purchasing everything. If you’re going to sell drugs in Delaware County, we’re going to purchase it from you. We’re going to arrest you,” said an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. Investigators tell FOX59 they previously caught Kanazeh selling drugs to an undercover officer at a gas station.  During that arranged drug buy, Kanazeh supposedly brought his 8 and 10-year-old children with him. “It’s a cycle, the war on drugs. Everyone asks, ‘How are you going to beat them?’ You aren’t going to beat them but we are just going to keep tackling them,” explains an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. With the price of heroin increasing, detectives are seeing an influx of crystal meth. Kanazeh allegedly was selling both. “It’s here and everybody’s talking about it and we want to stop it. We are trying to find the source.  We believe the source is from Indianapolis but we are trying to find the source here,” explains an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. This isn’t the first time the Muncie Wal-Mart on East 29th has had drug activity.  Last March, a meth lab was discovered in the store’s bathroom. “It’s apparently the place to go buy and sell drugs, maybe utilize bathrooms to get high,” said an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. When questioned, Kanazeh didn’t admit to selling drugs.  According to court documents, when investigators showed him pictures of the drug deal where his kids were present, his “head sank between his shoulders.” DCS was notified.  Both Kanazeh and Murray several drug related charges. So far this year, Delaware County has opened nearly 200 drug cases.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Someone didn't think it was funny and called police. Pohatcong Township police tracked down the clown and hearse after the 9 p.m. appearance in the mall along Route 22 in the township. Police said the clown will be cited for riding on the vehicle's hood. The clown showed up at the mall just a day after other people in clown costumes reportedly chased children in Phillipsburg and Wilson. To some at the mall, the clown was fun. To others, he was suspicious. "There have been many inquiries about the incident from concerned parents," police said Thursday after their investigation. "There was no contact between the man and shoppers in the area. … At this time, there is no reason for concern." The clown was Sean Fuller, 18, of Alpha, owner of the hearse. Driving the vehicle Tuesday was his father, Matt Fuller, 42, also of Alpha. Matt Fuller said the hearse ride was simply to spread some good cheer. He and his son rode in the open at the mall and did nothing to scare anyone, he said. Creepy clown sightings across the U.S. Creepy clown sightings have been taking the nation by storm. Florida is the most recent state to experience multiple appearances. Creepy clown sightings have been taking the nation by storm. Florida is the most recent state to experience multiple appearances.

The car moved about 2 mph, and the ride through the parking lot lasted about 5 minutes, Fuller said. "We stopped to wave to people while they were snapping pictures and smiling and laughing, realizing it was a joke," he said. "But then someone found it to be scary or offensive and called police. The police followed me to my house." The police were polite, he said, but they told the Fullers they ought to be more careful.

"They said, 'Hey guys, you don't need to be doing this kind of stuff.' " The hearse is his son's "play toy," Fuller said. "I had one years ago and he [Sean Fuller] wanted one," he said. "He saved his money and he bought it a few months ago." Pohatcong Mayor James Kern said he was happy the police quickly identified the clown and the hearse driver, and found they were not up to anything nefarious. "It wasn't a major threat or a major concern, like we've seen elsewhere," Kern said, "but with everything going on, people are on edge. Any reasonable person would be concerned. "This ended up being a harmless copycat situation, but it came the same day there were reports in Phillipsburg of clowns chasing children," he said. "This was bad timing."

Published Sep 29th, 2016 5:19 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Here we go again. With multiple media reports suggesting Wal-Mart Stores may make another big ecommerce and buy Indian-based Flipkart, retail industry watchers say the deal would be good for the world’s largest retailer. Bentonville-based Wal-Mart has moved in recent years to grow its ecommerce business to compete on the world stage with Amazon, Alibaba on other online merchants. Part of that move included the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. It’s the highest price ever paid for an internet retailer, and respected Jet.com CEO and co-founder Marc Lore was included in the deal and will lead Wal-Mart’s ecommerce division. Bloomberg News reports that Wal-Mart may invest between $750 million and $1 billion in the online startup FlipKart. Wal-Mart nor FlipKart have confirmed the talks are taking place. Even so, the retail world is already considering what a possible deal might mean for the retail giant looking grow its e-commerce business in a country of 1.2 billion consumers. FlipKart is the brainchild of two former Amazon employees and was launched in 2007. The website sells a variety of products from home goods, food, health & beauty aids, apparel and electronics with approximately 44% of the market share in India. Amazon is knocking on that door with about 30% of the market share. India has been a tough market for Wal-Mart to crack with respect to physical stores. Last year Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright told Talk Business & Politics that wholesale was the way the retailer planned to go in India. He said it is valuable market long term and the plan at that time was to gradually add more cash and carry stores that service the mom and pop businesses throughout the country. But that was before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced in June plans to invest $3 billion in India on the heels of $2 billion already spent rolling its Prime service out in the populated country. Dr. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor of supply chain at the University of Arkansas, said there are several things to consider in trying to assess how Wal-Mart might benefit from a deal with FlipKart. “First there is the Indian market. It is very important for Wal-Mart, while some of the BRIC countries are in turmoil … Brazil and Russia, and with China slowing, India holds opportunities. Amazon is also playing very heavy in that market,” Sodero said. He also noted that brick and mortar did not go so well for Wal-Mart in India and if they are going to have a shot at winning share in India it’s going to have to be via e-commerce and most likely that’s going be through acquisition. “Look at how Wal-Mart ultimately chose to grow e-commerce share in China against Alibaba. They partnered with JD.Com to run their Yihoadian business because that was the best way to participate in a larger share of the business,” Sodero explained. Secondly Sodero said Wal-Mart U.S. sales are flattening and its best long term growth opportunities are outside the United States. He said growing through acquisition is the best way for Wal-Mart to expand its international footprint and a Flipkart deal makes sense following that strategy. Thirdly, he said FlipKart’s expertise in “slash sales events” is a different business model than Wal-Mart. But it has not been without issues, especially when advertised products sell out quickly leaving customers frustrated. Sodero said FlipKart is also vertically integrated in that it has its own electronic brands. He said this is an interesting play for Wal-Mart who is a seller of other electronic brands. A deal for Flipkart won’t be without challenges, Sodero said. The geographic barriers are huge and the business model is vastly different. But that doesn’t mean it won’t work. He said Jet.com was vastly different and that deal was made. “Wal-Mart is not going to find a perfect glove to fit their hand so they have to make strategic plays when they can do so,” Sodero said. “One thing for certain is that Wal-Mart is going to have to invest in acquisitions to grow e-commerce share against the likes of Amazon and Alibaba. I don’t when it will happen but I wouldn’t be surprised to see them shopping in Latin America as well for an e-commerce play.” Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, agreed with Sodero’s assessment of the alleged deal with FlipKart. “Some global markets are better scaled through digital and that certainly describes India. Just as Walmart’s recent acquisition of Jet.com girds its digital presence in the U.S., partnering with Flipkart is an efficient way to make a meaningful move in India,” Spieckerman said. Continuing, she noted, “Walmart has set its sights on achieving true ‘global e-commerce’ — so has Amazon. By partnering with an established and familiar digital leader like Flipkart, Walmart can immediately go toe-to-toe with Amazon in India. Flipkart benefits from Walmart’s scale and expertise, which will only accelerate through Walmart’s other digital acquisitions. Walmart is well on its way to creating a synergistic, global, digital ecosystem.” Analysts say FlipKart and its competitors continued to lose money last year because infrastructure investments and deep price discounts on goods eroded margins. It’s hard to imagine that would be an acceptable practice by Wal-Mart, who would no doubt leverage its scale and international expertise to fatten up the margins and still compete with Amazon. Wall Street values FlipKart at around $11.5 billion, which is more than 10 times the alleged investment reported at $1 billion. Wal-Mart could be considering a minority stake in FlipKart like it did with a 5% investment with J.D.com (5%) in China.

I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (there was underage drinking at the party, etc.). Amy Dickinson  I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? Stuck at 17 DEAR STUCK: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. DEAR AMY: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a little while but eventually caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper before you do it, but better yet: RUN! Siri DEAR SIRI: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis before she re-enters a relationship with an abusive ex.

COMICS   •   MOVIES   •   MUSIC   •   TELEVISION   •   GAMES   •   BOOKS Album Review: National Lampoon Presents: Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? By BAADASSSSS!   |   Thursday, September 29th, 2016 at 1:00 pm Tweet Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? iTunes | CD Baby The Final Edition | NL Release Date: September 9, 2016 National Lampoon has certainly seen better days; a few decades before they became a brand synonymous with puerile, sophomoric frat boy humor and cheap direct-to-video “comedies,” the Lampoon was a brain trust of America’s boldest and most fearless young satirists who used their incisive, inventive wit to offend, compel, and amuse and who would lay the foundation for some of the great works of modern comedy, from the small screen success of Saturday Night Live to the celluloid classics Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, and This is Spinal Tap. As the company slowly evolved into a multimedia empire, they lost their edge. Now they exist solely because ten Wal-Mart customers demand movies where they can enjoy lamebrain toilet humor and Vida Guerra’s naked breasts without having to change the DVD. Two years after the National Lampoon magazine launched, editor and writer Tony Hendra teamed up with the great Michael O’Donoghue to create the company’s first comedy album, Radio Dinner. Hendra later helped put together the Lampoon’s off-Broadway smash Lemmings, which featured comedic giants John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Christopher Guest in breakout performances that kick-started their own amazing careers. Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? is the first album by The Final Edition, a satirical troupe founded by Hendra and Jeff Kreisler, and is appropriately presented by National Lampoon no doubt as part of a belated attempt to recapture a bit of their former reputation. Triggers is a sketch-heavy effort that takes the form of a live show being staged before a crowd of increasingly hostile college students who seem to find something offensive about every single skit performed by The Final Edition. No one in the group, among them Hendra himself (he’s the chap with the British accent, dear boy), can understand what the fuss is about considering the skits feature excerpts from a sex tape starring former Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders, an interview with Kim Kardashian’s ass, a couple dining at a restaurant that specializes in rectal feeding (in an effort to disprove the C.I.A.’s use of the technique isn’t torture), a woman’s uncomfortable encounter with an abortion doctor required by law to make her hesitant to pursue the procedure by any means legally necessary, representatives of ISIS defiantly trying to prove to the world that they’re not gay, and much more. Equal parts crude, lewd, gross, and caustically humorous, Triggers is a valiant yet frustratingly scattershot attempt to expose a new generation of comedy fans to the type of take-no-prisoners humor that electrified the youth of America in the days of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the brief but horrific rule over the nation’s pop culture landscape by the Pet Rock. The 44-minute album also takes aim at police corruption and brutality, the aggressive security methods employed by the Transportation Security Administration, and anti-gay politicians who will stoop to the lowest lows imaginable to change the laws in order to satisfy their agenda and base. The writing is mostly smart and stays on target, but sketches about Enya’s music and the cocaine habit developed by Elmo after Sesame Street moves to HBO overstay their welcome and are rather pointless and forgettable. Although the album’s structure and format was inspired by that of National Lampoon’s Radio Dinner, it rarely goes for their subjects’ throats and balls the way the Lampoon’s finest comedic minds used to do with manic gusto and depraved genius. Triggers‘ primary target is the tendency of contemporary audiences to become overly sensitive at the very mention of certain topics, and yet the people in The Final Edition don’t really give anyone much to find offensive here because there is precious little to be found on this album that one might possibly consider provocative or at the very least original. I laughed some during Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight?, but the Final Edition’s attempt to break into the comedy album market can’t help but be a little late to the party when up-to-the-moment humorists and comedians on television and the Internet have already ripped into the same subject matter with greater candor and imagination. Still though, there’s a lot more hilarity to be found on Triggers than in an entire season of the current Saturday Night Live. The spirit of the Lampoon lives on even as the company itself has tried to snuff it out permanently in the name of greed and establishing brand recognition.

The bizarre scheme of Eduardo Dejesus Cossio III, 32, involved him purchasing beer at Target and Walmart stores in Eastlake, Chula Vista, National City, and elsewhere and then returning it with bottles filled with cleaning solution. He would apparently drink the beer and place cleaning solutions and soap in the bottles and return them for refunds. He would glue the caps back on the bottles and it appeared to be unopened. Court records say other customers would buy the tainted beer and then discover the beer had been tampered with. Target stores looked at their security tapes and records and discovered it was Cossio repeatedly returning beer to get refunds in 2014 and 2015. Target employees identified Cossio as he wore a distinctive pair of earrings, beard, and hair style in store security tapes. He filled out the refund records with his correct name, date of birth, and driver’s license number. San Diego Police officers discovered glue sticks, glue guns, cleaning solutions, and dye bottles at his home. Records don’t say if anyone was harmed. He pleaded guilty to returning adulterated beverages to the Target store at 910 Eastlake Parkway, and at 2911 Jamacha Road in El Cajon. Charges involving 29 similar counts were dismissed. Cossio will be sentenced Oct. 7 in San Diego Superior Court. He faces a sentence of one year in jail and has agreed to pay restitution. The maximum sentence is four years and four months in prison.

Proclaimed in Massachusetts by Governor Charlie Baker, and recognized annually on October 1st by the United Nations and World Health Organization, International Day of Older Persons celebrates the important contributions of older adults and raises awareness toward issues of aging, with particular focus this year on “Taking a Stand Against Ageism,” including discrimination, misconceptions and stereotypes about older adults and aging. This day encourages the promotion of a positive image and social inclusion of older adults as they age to better understand their experiences and needs and celebrate their societal contributions. With over 600 million persons aged 60 years and over expected to double by 2025 and reach two billion by 2050, a demographic revolution is underway worldwide, including in Greater Boston where the population of adults aged 60+ increased by 11% from 2000-2010 and that by 2030 one in five Boston residents will be age 60+. As this population grows, LBFE’s mission in Greater Boston is to alleviate isolation and loneliness in older adults, with the support of staff and over 1,500 volunteers who provide companionship, support and care to over 800 elders aged 70 and over without the benefit of family or adequate social contacts. LBFE’s mission is accomplished through a variety of initiatives, including individual home visits, city site partnerships where elders are brought together to meet their neighbors, on call services such as medical escorts, and nutritional programming including an emergency food pantry, grocery distribution and holiday luncheons around Thanksgiving and the winter holidays. LBFE’s nutritional programming were recently bolstered by a $25,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program. LBFE is welcoming volunteers for events and programs throughout October and at our upcoming holiday luncheons.

CRIME ROUNDUP: Parolee jailed in credit card theft Anthony Borrelli , aborrelli@pressconnects.com | @PSBABorrelli 12:13 p.m. EDT October 1, 2016 Michael Gumaer (Photo: BROOME COUNTY SHERIFF) Police say a parolee stole a credit card and was found with meth when he was taken into custody on an Endicott street. Michael Gumaer, 38, is accused of illegally using an Endicott woman's credit card at businesses in Vestal, Johnson City and Endwell, according to the Broome County Sheriff's Office. The credit card was reported stolen Sept. 23, police said, and Gumaer was identified as a suspect through surveillance video. The card was used at Lowes Home Improvement store in Vestal, the Walmart in Johnson City, a McDonald's and several convenience stores, according to police. On Thursday, deputies and state parole officials were on the lookout for Gumaer, who is also a recent parolee. He was stopped by a state trooper while walking on Washington Avenue in Endicott, according to police. When taken into custody, police say, Gumaer had three grams of methamphetamine. Gumaer was charged with felony counts of first-degree identity theft, second-degree identity theft, second-degree forgery and fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property. He was sent to the Broome County jail, to await further court proceedings. Forcible touching alleged A 56-year-old man is accused of crimes involving a child whom he allegedly gave alcohol to. Blair G. Williams, of Toronto, Ontario, was arrested Tuesday by New York State Police after an incident in Hancock, Delaware County. Police say he forcibly touched a child under the age of 17 and also gave the child alcohol to drink. Police did not disclose how Williams knew the child. Williams has been charged with misdemeanor counts of forcible touching and unlawfully dealing with a child. He was sent to jail with bail set at $1,500 cash or $3,000 bond, to await further court action. Card theft charges A Corning man is accused of illegally using a debit card that belonged to a woman from Horseheads. Christopher D. Barrett was indicted on felony counts of fourth-degree grand larceny and fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property, along with misdemeanor counts of petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. According to court papers, Barrett allegedly stole a Horseheads woman's Visa card on June 13, and he kept it with intent to benefit himself or to impede the recovery of the card by the owner. He also is accused of stealing property the same day from an Express Mart convenience store. Further proceedings in the case are being held in Chemung County Court. Burglary indictment Prosecutors say a man burglarized an Elmira residence and stole property from the people who live there. Ryan C. Kolcun was indicted in Chemung County Court on a felony count of second-degree burglary and a misdemeanor count of petit larceny. According to the indictment, Kolcun is accused of illegally entering a residence on West Church Street in Elmira on Aug. 15, with the intent to commit a crime there. He allegedly stole property from the residence, but court papers do not specify what was stolen. Kolcun is expected to face further proceedings in county court, after the indictment was handed up Sept. 15.

Christian Gooden Gary Simpson, a Teamster, pickets outside the Schnuck's in Arnold on Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2016, to call for a boycott and direct attention to the union's disapproval of a Schuck's warehouse it says was built partially with TIF funds and hires non-union workers. Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com photo by Roberto Rodriguez UFCW Local 655 members cast ballots wether to accept a new contract with Schnucks or authorize a strike during a meeting at The Family Arena in St. Charles, Monday, September 26, 2106. Photo by Roberto Rodriguez The Schnucks store at Ballwin Plaza Decades ago, people shopped for food at the grocery store, period. Now they can buy ingredients for tonight’s dinner or tomorrow’s breakfast at convenience stores, discount superstores, drugstores or warehouse clubs, or they can shop online. The supermarket industry itself has become crowded with competitors ranging from discounters such as Aldi to high-end specialty stores such as Whole Foods. Add in a nine-month-long trend of falling food prices, the second-longest stretch of grocery deflation since 1960, and you have an unprecedented level of challenges for middle-market chains such as Schnuck Markets, whose largest union took a strike vote last week. I’m not taking sides in the talks between Schnucks and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 655, but clearly the venerable St. Louis chain is under a lot of pressure. When prices of the goods on your shelves are falling, it’s hard to cover even a modest increase in operating costs. In a statement issued after Monday’s strike vote, Chief Executive Todd Schnuck said his company faces “explosive growth” in competition. He counts 719 stores selling food in the St. Louis area, of which 584 are nonunion. Schnucks’ two biggest unionized competitors, Shop ’n Save and Dierbergs, also are negotiating contracts with Local 655. Wal-Mart Stores was a relatively new threat in 2003, the last time local supermarket workers went on strike. Now it’s by far the area’s largest grocery merchant, and plenty of other newcomers are nibbling away at the traditional supermarket chains. Dollar stores added refrigeration and expanded their grocery offerings. Aldi made an expansion push and Kroger opened nine of its deep-discount Ruler Foods stores here. Stores such as Lucky’s Market and Fresh Thyme filled niches. All this choice is being driven by a change in consumer behavior, says Susan Viamari, vice president of thought leadership at market research firm IRI. While shoppers of yesteryear bought most of their groceries on a weekly stock-up trip, today’s consumers pick up items on frequent fill-in trips. That trend accelerated during the recession, when consumers were too cash-strapped to buy a week’s groceries all at once. It has persisted, and Viamari says shoppers have become savvy about seeking deals on items they buy frequently. “It is happening quickly, but it has a profound impact on how grocery retailers market to the consumer,” she said. “Everyone is scrambling a bit. … There is a battle for share of stomach going on.” See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis In such a fragmented market, grocers’ marketing challenges are tougher than they used to be. “These are targeted trips,” Viamari says. “Shoppers are very informed, and to a degree shoppers are in control.” Workers, on the other hand, must feel like they have less control than ever. Union members reportedly are unhappy with the raise they’re being offered and with higher health care premiums, but they won’t have a job if the stores can’t make money. Supermarket margins have always been thin, and they’re being eroded by deflation and intensified competition. Supervalu, Shop ’n Save’s publicly traded parent company, has seen its share price halved in the last 18 months. Even tougher competition may be on the horizon. Amazon offers same-day grocery delivery in only a handful of cities now, but CEO Jeff Bezos wants to conquer food the same way he conquered books, diapers and other categories. Bezos famously says, in reference to competing retailers, “Your margin is my opportunity.” If he ever brings AmazonFresh to St. Louis, local supermarkets and their workers will learn the bitter truth of that aphorism.

(Doreen Christensen) Doreen ChristensenContact ReporterSun Sentinel Doreen's Deals: Save on fall cosmetics with these beauty hacks and drugstore swaps Privacy Policy Cosmetics are my weakness. I'm a sucker for the latest look and I've got a big shoebox filled with half-used products to prove it. As the seasons change, women freshen beauty bags and empty wallets in the process. Globally, we spend more than $425 billion on face creams, lipstick and such. This explains the explosion of beauty retailers like Sephora, Ulta and South Florida-based GBS Beauty moving in on department-store turf. Walmart, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond and other mass retailers continue to expand beauty offerings, too. Beauty might be big business, but you don't need to break the bank to look good. Recently I stopped in at Ulta Beauty and, as usual, walked out a poorer woman than when I entered, but with the promise of flawless skin. I bought Benefit's The POREfessional Face Primer for $31 and other odds and ends I couldn't live without. The bill was $79. While I was happy with my purchase, I returned to Ulta to see if I could find a cheaper, comparable product in the name of journalistic research. It cost me another $43. A manager introduced me to NYX, a brand I had barely glanced at, which is favored by makeup artists for its huge range of on-trend products and low prices. A tester revealed NYX Pore Filler, $13.99, to be indistinguishable from the Benefit product I'd purchased earlier, except it was $17 cheaper.

Sign up to get a free fall beauty box full of seasonal products from Walmart for $5 in shipping. Beauty Boxes come four times a year stuffed with eight to 10 trial- and full-sized products from name-brands including Secret, Olay, L'Oreal, Rimmel,  Dove, Neutrogena, TreSemme, Cover Girl and others.... (Doreen Christensen) That's why I like shopping at Ulta. The store carries prestige products once only found in department stores, along with mass-market brands carried by drugstores. That makes it easy to use testers and compare ingredients on labels to get the best bang for beauty bucks. Stores also accept returns (80 percent of the product must remain) for up to 60 days. Add Ulta coupons, manufacturer coupons and reward points and you're really sittin' pretty. Slick marketing and flirty packaging have always lured me into spending more than I intended. It's time to stop buying into the hype and go cheap. A few corporate conglomerates own nearly every brand, so it stands to reason the premium and cheaper products have similar formulations in different packaging. Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) owns Christian Dior, Benefit, Make Up For Ever, Marc Jacobs and Sephora stores. Estee Lauder owns Clinique, Smashbox, Origins, Mac, Aveda, Bobby Brown, Le Mer and Tom Ford. Shiseido owns Bare Minerals, Nars and Buxom. L'Oreal owns Lancom, Maybelline, NYX, Urban Decay, Giorgio Armani and YSL. Coty owns CoverGirl, MaxFactor, Rimmel and NYC. Revlon owns Almay. Johnson & Johnson owns Neutrogena.

The Invati 3-step thickening system promises to reduce hair loss by 33 percent. You also can redeem the offer... (Doreen Christensen) Any new brand not owned by one of the biggies will likely be gobbled up, as was the case with It Cosmetics. In July, L'Oreal bought the company for $1.2 billion. Again, with a B. Cosmetics are a real racket. Market research companies estimate products are marked up 78 percent. Slick packaging, manipulative advertising and celebrity endorsements brainwash us to believe that expensive equals better. So, instead of spending $74 on Lancome Renergie Lift Multi-Action Eye, make a drugstore swap for sister brand L'Oreal Age Perfect Eye Renewal for $25. Compare labels. Both contain mostly water and silicone oil, and have many other ingredients in common. My multi-store survey revealed wide price differences on mass-market brands, too. Bed Bath & Beyond, with more than its many aisles of beauty and personal-care products, tended to be cheaper than CVS and Walgreens. You can pump up savings by stacking the store's 20-percent-off coupon with manufacturer coupons on each item. (Stockpile store coupons. They're accepted even when expired.) Don't assume discount stores only peddle discontinued products, either. I found excellent prices at Marshall's, especially on premium products. Clinique Even Better Dark Spot Corrector was $50. It's $80 in department stores. StriVectin eye and neck creams were on clearance for $10 to $15. They retail for $95. Essie nail polish, Maybelline and L'Oreal mascaras were $3.99 each. All retail for at least twice that. Take a closer look at house brands at GBS, Ulta and Sephora as well as value products from NYX, e.l.f., Physicians Formula and Essence. They're all going to end up in the shoebox anyway.

 Shopping at Walmart is getting a lot cheaper Hayley Peterson Sep. 28, 2016, 9:24 AM 14,608 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Walmart Supercenter in Arkansas. Thomson Reuters Grocery prices are in a free-fall.  Food prices have declined for nine straight months in the US, marking one of the longest stretches of food deflation in 50 years. We went to Walmart to find out just how far prices have fallen at the No. 1 grocery store in the US. We compared the prices of 34 items at a store in Richmond, Virginia on Tuesday to the prices of the same items at the same store in December 2015. The result? The basket of groceries is now 10% cheaper than it was nine months ago.  The basket total in September was $104.17. In December 2015, the same items cost $114.86.  Some of the products' package sizes have changed over the last year, so we calculated those differences into the final price. We found the biggest price drops among the eggs (down 67% to 82 cents for one dozen eggs); goat cheese (down 56% to $1.99 for 4 ounces); pineapples (down 41% to $1.75 per fruit); almonds (down 37% to $5.13 for 12 ounces); peanut butter (down 28% to $3.14 for 40 ounces); and extra virgin olive oil (down 23% to $2.98 for 17 fluid ounces).  The prices of ground beef and chicken also fell considerably, dropping 8% and 11% respectively. Some items cost considerably more than in December 2015, such as 2-liter bottles of Coca-Cola (up to $1.48 from $1 per bottle in December) and canola oil (up to $2.88 for a 48-fluid-ounce bottle from $1.98 in December).  It's possible Walmart increased prices on those items to offset the plunging costs of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Since August 2015, prices of those items have dropped 6.5%, representing the biggest drop of any food group in that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Walmart denied that it prices products according to trends between food categories.

 Everything you know about millennial spending is about to change Ashley Lutz Oct. 1, 2016, 9:27 AM 13,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock Millennials are becoming parents — and it's creating shockwaves in the retail, restaurant, automotive, and home-buying industries.  The 18- to 35-year-old generation is notorious for renting homes instead of buying, spending on experiences over apparel, and dining at restaurants instead of at home.  But that's starting to change as more millennials become parents. More than 60 million millennials — about 80% of the generation — will become parents in the next decade, according to a study by marketing platform Crowdtap. Millennials currently spend $170 billion a year and are projected to spend $200 billion annually starting in 2017 and $10 trillion in their lifetimes, according to a study by Exponential. Millennials are becoming parents — they're just doing it later than previous generations.   This chart using Wells Fargo data shows how the average age of first marriage and childbirth is rising in the US.  Business Insider/Wells Fargo Once people have kids, they usually trade in happy hours and vacations for houses and cars.  This chart by JPMorgan shows that millennial spending is fairly similar to older generations. As they increasingly become parents, spending on categories like home improvement are expected to rise.  JPMorgan Shifting attitudes toward lodging and transportation Millennials have long said in surveys that they want to own homes like their parents, as Business Insider's Bob Bryan recently reported. Even those living in their parents' basements have expressed their intent to get their own place. KB Homes CEO Jeffrey Mezger said in a recent earnings call that first-time home buyers and young people are beginning to enter the market, driving demand to his business.  Millennials are also buying more cars.  The largest generation in the US bought 4 million cars and trucks last year, according to the Associated Press. Their share of the new-car market was at a record 28%.  New winners in the fast-food industry Their habits as parents are also influencing the restaurant and fast-food industries.  Traditional fast-food chains are losing market share to up-and-coming establishments like Panera Bread as millennial customers search for healthier options.   This shift in consumer mindsets puts Starbucks in a unique position to take over, according to a 2015 report by Goldman Sachs. "Starbucks is virtually the only large incumbent that can offer millennial parents the convenience of a (fast-food chain) and food they would not feel guilty/embarrassed to feed to their kids," Goldman Sachs' analysts write. McDonald's recently retooled its McNuggets recipe to eliminate preservatives. Thomson Reuters Starbucks has been expanding its menu to include more food options such as sandwiches and salads. It has also added drive-thrus to many locations.  The coffee chain has also been "steadily expanding kid-friendly snack options, such as organic fruit squeezes, organic food snacks, and organic Greek yogurt," according to Goldman Sachs.  But McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Wendy's, and others are trying to catch up by eliminating preservatives in food and offering more healthy and organic options.   Grocery stores make a change  Companies like Target, Walmart, and Kroger are making changes to appeal to millennial moms, who tend to do most of the shopping for their households. Target's CEO has been traveling around the country visiting the homes of millennial moms to better understand how they shop. Walmart and Kroger have been offering wider selections of organic foods, which are important to the health-conscious generation. Kroger has also been expanding its private-label products so it can offer cheaper prices.  Whole Foods is opening a new chain of stores to better appeal to millennial moms, who crave convenience and well-organized aisles.  The company's new 365 stores will be much smaller than regular stores, offer lower prices, and cater to more technology-savvy consumers. Reuters Traditional apparel chains struggle, athletic retailers win "The fashion industry has undergone one of the most dramatic makeovers in recent history — no doubt influenced by the millennial consumer," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD.  While US consumers spent slightly more on apparel, footwear, and accessories in 2014, those increases were driven by the new "athleisure" trend, not by traditional retailers like Macy's, NPD says.  While previous generations dressed up for work and play, millennials have a tendency to wear brands like Nike, Under Armour, and Lululemon everywhere, according to NPD.  "There is an underlying sense of rebellion that comes through in today’s fashion," Cohen said.  While department and discount stores struggle, business for athletic retailers is booming. Cohen says that traditional retailers will have to evolve to newly casual consumers.  "This is no longer a trend — it is now a lifestyle that is too comfortable, for consumers of all ages, for it to go away anytime soon," he said.  It's likely millennials will pass their fashion preferences on to their children too.  Hayley Peterson contributed to this story.  SEE ALSO: Millennials reveal 100 brands they love Follow Us: On Facebook NOW WATCH: What this symbol that’s on nearly half of your food actually means Loading video...

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Oct 1, 2016 at 7:44AM A fragmented industry is one that has no major players that heavily influence business practices. That doesn't mean these industries are small because there are many examples of the opposite: such as the U.S. trucking industry where many mom and pop operations make great money within the $700 billion industry.  Despite the fact that fragmented industries devoid of any Wal-Mart sized whales, there are advantages to being a medium sized fish in a pond filled with guppies. With this in mind, here are two dividend stocks with upside as they continue to thrive in their fragmented industries. Diamonds are forever Image source: Getty Images. Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) owns a host of brands and brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. that investors will likely recognize. Those brands include Jared, Kay, and Zale, among other regional brands. Signet operates in a highly fragmented jewelry industry and has become the largest seller of affordable diamond, gold, and silver jewelry in the United States. Over time it has acquired smaller companies and driven consolidation in an industry that has a plethora of sole proprietors, entrepreneurs, and single-location retailers. This offers investors of Signet a couple of advantages. First, thanks to being the largest player in a fragmented industry, it can use its scale and purchasing power as leverage to lower costs for its diamonds and other jewelry products -- something smaller competitors can't do. Another perk of Signet being the largest player, with the largest balance sheet, is that it can offer its customers something smaller competitors typically can't: financing options. Signet offers its bridal and engagement jewelry on credit and that offers a significant advantage as consumers unable to purchase without financing gravitate toward Signet's stores. This scenario plays out quite often as more than half of Signet's diamond sales are bought on short-term credit. Despite its advantages, Signet isn't immune to retail weakness which has plagued brick-and-mortar retailers in many industries recently, and that reared its ugly head during the second-quarter when Signet missed estimates. Further, with the recent Brexit vote completed and the U.K. opting out of the European Union it could present headwinds for the company's U.K. business. SIG data by YCharts. Those two factors have sent the company's stock price plunging year-to-date, but it could also offer investors a great time to start a small position in a company that will likely bounce back and continue to take advantage of its size in a fragmented industry. Everybody loves a good network effect Image source: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. Similar to Signet Jewelers, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) is a leader in a highly fragmented industry. More specifically, RBA is the largest auction company of used heavy-equipment and machinery via its industrial auctions. The company appraises, sells, inspects, buys, refurbishes, ships, and helps finance these specialized heavy equipment for businesses operating in construction, mining, transportation, and agriculture, among other industries -- and it does this globally. The intriguing part about RBA as an investment is that, in my opinion, the company has a strong competitive advantage thanks to its network effect. Because the heavy-equipment auction industry is highly fragmented, sellers and buyers gravitate to RBA because it's the largest player. It's a virtuous cycle where more sellers equates to more product, and more product equates to more interested buyers, which attracts more sellers -- on and on the virtuous cycle goes. Despite being the largest player, RBA recently made a move to significantly squash competition trying to follow in its footsteps. Earlier this month RBA announced it would acquire IronPlanet in a deal worth nearly $760 million and the news initially sent its stock price soaring 23%. What many investors don't realize, though, is that IronPlanet was an online-based auctioneer that was innovating its way to success digitally -- something that RBA was focusing its efforts on recently. Also, IronPlanet was one of RBA's few competitors that had anything resembling the scale necessary to compete. RBA effectively took one of, if not its largest, competitive threat and brought it in house to improve its scale, network effect, and online ambitions. That's a home run acquisition in my book. Morningstar estimates that despite being the world's largest auction company it only represents about 4% of the $100 billion used-equipment auction market. That leaves a huge runway for growth if the company can continue to handpick home-run acquisitions, leverage its scale, and grow its online presence.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Instead of trucks on the road or drones in the sky, the Starship Technologies delivery robot boosts safety and efficiency by sticking to the sidewalks.

The grocery delivery startup was considered "high-tech" because you could order groceries on a website and have them delivered. A darling of the late '90s dot-com boom, WebVan ultimately failed, becoming a poster child for the dot-com bust (the company went bankrupt in 2001) and a cautionary tale about the perils of so-called "last-mile" delivery -- the link in the supply chain that brings products to consumers. Delivery is expensive and inefficient. Unlike most parts of the supply chain, the last mile doesn't scale, especially when a human employee drives a big car to bring one product to one consumer. The "last mile" is ripe for disruption. But how? Companies like Google and Amazon are trying. Google Express picks up goods at stores and delivers them to homes using route-optimization algorithms. Google Express competes against Amazon's AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, which costs a whopping $299 per year -- and that's from a company famous for free delivery of regular packages. (AmazonFresh is for groceries and should not be confused with recent reports that Amazon is working on its own shipping service for nongrocery packages to compete with FedEx and UPS.) Peapod, Fresh Direct, Whole Foods and others are also trying to make grocery delivery work. But none of these companies has really solved the last-mile delivery problem. It's still too slow and expensive. So what's the solution? Drones, right? When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed his company's drone initiative on 60 minutes in 2013, the world was incredulous. Since then, Google and other tech companies, along with Wal-Mart and other retailers as well as numerous delivery companies like UPS, have unveiled drone-delivery experiments, plans and trials. So the public can be forgiven for believing that the future of last-mile delivery is all about drones. But drones don't scale: They can't fly that far, can't carry that much and need to have their batteries recharged frequently. While drones are great for bringing high-value items (like medicine) to remote places, they're not great for everyday deliveries. The good news is that last-mile delivery can, in fact, scale. Several companies are already testing and showcasing technologies that could make that happen. The rolling drone-base idea Auto giant Mercedes-Benz recently rolled out a delivery concept that combines truck and drone delivery with robotic in-truck warehousing. Mercedes' so-called Vision Van, which was created in partnership with a drone startup called Matternet, is an all-electric warehouse on wheels. Two internal racks, which are loaded with packages in the warehouse, are placed in the van. A robotic system grabs the right package based on the next delivery and hands it to the driver through a window while he's still in the driver's seat. Alternatively, the robot system can push the package through a window in the ceiling and into the "arms" of one of two rooftop drones, which then delivers the package to the customer's backyard. This enables faster delivery to homes that are far from the road, and makes it possible for two or three packages to be delivered at once (one by the driver and two by the drones). Another use for the drone port is to deliver a package to the driver that was ordered for same-day delivery after the driver left the warehouse. The robotic in-van warehousing system increases efficiency and cuts down on errors, theoretically. The launching of the drones from vans, rather than from the warehouse, cuts way down on the battery problem. Taken further, you could imagine the rolling drone-base idea leading to large trucks rolling into neighborhoods and then dispatching a fleet of drones, delivery bots and humans to deliver many packages at once. The self-driving ice chest idea An Estonian company called Starship Technologies makes a robot that looks like an ice chest on wheels for delivering packages and food autonomously or semi-autonomously. Starship co-founder Ahti Heinla, who was one of the original creators of Skype, told me that his delivery robot is inherently safe because it's light and slow (4 mph) and has software that causes it to get out of the way and stop when pedestrians are close. It's also safe because the robot is supervised remotely by humans, who can take over if the robot can't manage. In 8,000 miles of testing, the robots have "encountered" more than 1 million pedestrians and haven’t injured anyone, according to Heinla.

William Eugene Dillard, 33, was arrested on counterfeiting and theft charges Thursday in Seymour. Police got a call about a theft at Walmart and then stopped a vehicle matching the one described in the theft. Officers searched Dillard’s vehicle and found several bags that contained evidence of printed counterfeit money, supplies to print counterfeit money, such as paper and printing cartridges, and homemade counterfeit money templates, according to police. Dillard gave the Jackson County jail a home address in Franklin, but told Seymour police he had been living in the area for several weeks, police said.

Kevin Kennedy, KPNX 10:26 PM. MST September 30, 2016 The Scary Peeper peers through a window. (Photo: Kevin Kennedy/12 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PHOENIX - Halloween costumes and decorations are already on store shelves across the Phoenix area. There are witches and goblins, pirates and skeletons hanging on racks from Walmart to Target. Even clothing and construction stores offer Halloween decorations. Home Depot is typically a store you’d buy a rake or a shovel, maybe some paint or a new barbeque but if you want to spook up your house, there are plenty of options. The only problem is that one of those decorations has been pulled off of every shelf in Canada after someone complained. The Scary Peeper peeping window prop is designed to look like a creepy man peering into the window. “First of all, my reaction to seeing it would be fear,” said Lynda Bloeser, a Halloween enthusiast. She decorates every year but feels putting something up like that is not keeping with the spirit of Halloween and sends the wrong message. “In this day and age, I do not think it is appropriate,” said Lynda Bloeser. The window decoration sells for around $30 and can still be bought at a Home Depot in the U.S. We showed the prop to several people, placing it in the window to see what they thought. “Oh my God, that is the creepiest thing I have ever seen,” said one man. Many women calling the scary decoration insensitive and in poor taste. “Oh, I would be startled if I saw it,” said Monica Goddard. Ken Baer didn’t think the window creeper was scary but felt many wouldn’t like it. “I would not say it is inappropriate, I’d just say it is a joke that some would not enjoy,” said Baer. 12 News reached out to Home Depot but was not able to talk with a supervisor.

clock menu more-arrow Los Angeles Living the Pizza Dream, One Delivery at a Time How Dough Box Pizza manages to keep so many people happy with so little by Farley Elliott Sep 30, 2016, 3:59pm PDT Photos by Farley Elliott tweet share pin Los Angeles is not, on its face, a food delivery town. That’s surprising, given the amount of time everyone in Southern California spends in their cars, or stuck at one destination awaiting the slow recess of yet another traffic wave. But give people what they want — access to quality ingredients, a fair price, and a story — and, eventually, they'll pick up the phone and call. That’s when it’s time to get to work. Dough Box Pizza is that none-too-rare L.A. business model success story you usually only hear about in the Arts District or Silver Lake. Fine-dining chef turns taco cart into street food sensation (read: Guerrilla Tacos). Promising jam maker turns forlorn storefront into America’s breakfast obsession (read: SQIRL). It’s a story told on gourmet food trucks every day, and dreamt about during morning prep sessions in kitchens across the city. But with Dough Box, the upstart Chicago-style deep dish pizza pick up and delivery-only company, its commissary kitchen space in City Terrace did not immediately seem like the right sort of micro neighborhood for their needs. Pushed into a windowless building with no signage and ringed by tow yards and salvage lots, young owners Alexandra Gonzalez and Tony Hernandez saw an opportunity that speaks to the unique economics of a delivery-only restaurant in Los Angeles. Yelp "From the beginning, I looked at it as a necessity," says Hernandez. "We didn’t start with a bunch of money." The partners had experience on their side — Tony is a carb wizard with a background at places like Proof and Bread Lounge, while Alex spent time at Hollywood Pies making deep dish herself for years. "It was pretty amazing how little we started with," she says. Rather than present their financing challenge as a hurdle to be cleared, the two looked at the track they were on and decided to play a different game altogether. By keeping their plans focused on delivery and take out orders, Dough Box could run as a lean operation with almost no overhead and minimal start-up costs. "I like how controlled it all is," says Gonzalez, working dough from one of the two prep tables inside their 225-square-foot kitchen space. "It’s going to be difficult if we ever have to move to a different space, with all those people we have to take care of." Maybe the best Chicago style pizza in Los Angeles People, indeed. Labor costs are among the single highest expense for any restaurant, hovering anywhere from 25% to 45% of total overhead, depending on the business model. The lower that percentage is the healthier the bottom line, which is precisely why chain restaurants (and giant corporations like Wal-Mart) spend millions of dollars to study workflow patterns, track employee efficiency, and employ a host of other strategies to manage the cost. At Dough Box, labor cost is about as close to zero as you’ll find. Sure, both Hernandez and Gonzalez need to pay their own rent, eat food, put gas in their car, and just generally survive, but practically any small business owner will tell you that most of the money spent on their personal salary actually stays right inside the business. The pair employs a phone guy who sits on a small stool right up by the entrance to the kitchen and takes orders for five hours a night. They pay out their delivery drivers, of course. But the vast majority of the work happens before anyone else who requires a paycheck even shows up, and comes from just four hands. What’s the trade-off for not having a sign, or a picnic area or a bathroom or napkins or light fixtures or chairs or any of the endless other fixed-cost items that come with opening a brick-and-mortar restaurant to lure in customers and get them to spend more money? Overhead costs that sit around $4,000 a month, all in. That’s boxes, ordering pads, credit card fees, the lights, the gas, the real estate they stand on. The building even pays for their water and trash removal. You just have to know the game and play it well to survive And then there's permitting, a consistently arduous and often expensive dance with various municipal bodies that can sink the most even-keeled financial model. Restaurants in this town and anywhere else in America have gone broke, either literally or at least functionally, before even opening their doors thanks to cost overruns associated with code compliance, the health department, or the DWP. That’s not to say those organizations offer any malicious intent; you just have to know the game, and play it well, to survive. Many first-time restaurateurs find that out in just about the hardest ways possible. Dough Box has their certifications, an A rating from the health department, hanging on a small cork board right above the head of the guy who takes those calls. At the top of that board is a single string that stretches across the room (it isn’t far), holding clips of orders for the night to come. Forget the need for an ADA-compliant bathroom, or for a POS system. You’re never more than three feet from the only other person you could possibly need to ask a question to. Back at Dough Box HQ, the afternoon is fading and the two-person team has a night of cooking ahead of them. Because each deep dish pizza takes about an hour to cook all-in, the timing for getting orders in and out of their mid-sized oven in the corner needs to be precise. It’s an older model that came from Craigslist thanks to a guy in Santa Clarita who closed his own pizza shop. The refrigerator is another Craigslist find, and both sat in storage until this commissary kitchen space became available. Now they’re humming along in prep for another evening turning out what may be the best Chicago-style pizza anywhere in Los Angeles. Eventually they will break, and need to be replaced. Eventually the guy with the headset to his ear will want more money, a better chair, or will move on to some other job somewhere else. Eventually he, and anyone else on the official payroll, will need to be paid at least $15 an hour. And eventually, if all goes well, Gonzalez and Hernandez might even leave their little City Terrace hideaway for some sit-down restaurant with table cloths and window shades and 1,000 other items that someone will have to pay for. But for now, it’s just Dough Box. Two people in a warehouse off the 10 freeway, available only by phone while answering to nobody. And for them, business couldn’t be better.

Earlier in April, it raised $500,000 Hit revenue mark of $1m this year; claims to be profi table. For Dhruvil Sanghvi, catering to the needs of customers was always more important than providing convenience. So, early this month, when fashion etailer Myntra tied up with Sanghvi-cofounded logistics data analytics startup LogiNext, the idea was simple: provide real-time tracking of shipments for improved intra-city logistics, information the customer needed. “Doing a need-based business is much better because you don’t have to push the customer to buy,” says Sanghvi. Reason: clients come to you for your products or services. This leads to better unit economics, faster profitability and lower investment requirements, he says. “Amazon gets much larger profit margins from its B2B business than its B2C marketplace,” says Sanghvi. The stickiness of the need-based nature of business-to-business (B2B) startups and the attendant financial virtues, including negligible cash burn, help them cope in an environment where investors, singed by obscene spending and reckless scaling-up by business-to-consumer (B2C) startups, tighten their purse strings. Pranjal Prashar, 30 Cofounder, Repup, an online reputation management platform for hotels Got undisclosed funding from IAN last year Claims to have clients such as Radisson Blu, ITC Welcom Heritage and Fortune. According to market intelligence platform Xeler8, B2B startups logged in 209 funding deals in the first eight months of this year compared with 173 deals during the corresponding period last year. While the number of deals has increased, in terms of money raised, funding has declined for both, although B2B startups may be faring better than their B2C counterparts. So far this year, the top five B2B investments have totalled $224 million, which is 27% less than the $305 million in all of 2015. In the B2C segment, funding shrank 68% to $941 million from $2.94 billion in 2015 Devesh Rai, 35 Founder, wydr, wholesale marketplace raised undisclosed funding last October claims to have over 1,000 sellers, 1.5 lakh product listing and 25,000 retailers “They might not be as glorified and fancied as B2C counterparts, but they mean business,” says Rishabh Lawania, founder of Xeler8. They offer more bang for buck, he adds. Sunil Goyal, cofounder of early-stage venture capital firm YourNest, reckons that from an investor’s perspective, B2B companies are sexy because funded startups offer the most attractive exit route. NEGLIGIBLE BURN B2B gives an opportunity to co-create, collaborate and even pivot without the risk of burning too much cash to build a scalable global company, says Goyal, who opted to invest in B2B business models as early as 2014. Sanjay Swamy, managing partner at Prime Venture Partners, an early-stage VC firm, echoes the sentiment and contends that B2B startups are coming of age due to pervasive adoption of smartphones and mobile internet Brijesh Agrawal, 40 founder, tolexo, online marketplace for business goods and supplies Funded by IndiaMART, which raised series C round of Rs 150 cr in March this year Claims to have over 7,000 sellers and 10 lakh product listing. Swamy explains that B2B is poised for massive growth because banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI) solutions from startups can offer businesses significant benefits in invoicing, working capital, payroll processing, expense management and payment collection. “BFSI is set to boom,” he says. Secondly, formalisation of the small and medium enterprises sector—where smaller businesses are leveraging the cloud and mobile internet to get best-of-breed solutions across operations—offers immense hope. In addition, globalisation of software as a service (SaaS) products—where customers around the world can buy products made in India for their dayto-day needs—is a big boost for the B2B sector. “Add to this the recurring business models and reasonable customer acquisition costs of B2B startups and you have the ingredients for a viable business,” he says. For Brijesh Agrawal, founder of Tolexo, an online marketplace for business goods and supplies, what’s made B2B attractive for investors is the large market size. According to a Walmart report, B2B ecommerce in India is estimated to touch $700 billion by 2020. “This makes it highly lucrative for investors,” Agrawal says. Another plus for B2B players, according to him, is that the market is not driven by heavy discounting but by value proposition built around key aspects such as product variety, authenticity and availability and predictability of delivery. Backed by IndiaMART, Tolexo has over 7,000 sellers and 10 lakh product listings on its platform and has served more than 3.5 lakh businesses across 900 cities, claims Agrawal. “The success story of Alibaba in China is an inspiring one,” he says, adding that he aspires to build a better B2B story in India. Another entrepreneur with a similar aspiration is Devesh Rai, founder of online wholesale marketplace Wydr. HIGHLY UNDERSERVED MARKET He contends that B2B is a significantly underserved market, still largely unorganised and with very little technology-led innovation. “Now the timing is absolutely spot on for a technology-led disruption in B2B,” he says. The key challenge, however, is to inculcate the use of technology. Wydr, says Rai, has designed an education programme that communicates the key benefits of products and features to users. Asokan Sattanathan, 58 cofounder, Aahaa, Online marketplace raised Rs 10cr so far; aiming at Rs 20 cr sales this year Claims to log in 5,200 transactions every day. Focused targeting and reducing spillage in acquisition are other challenges that Rai is trying to solve by adopting digital campaigns and database-led marketing. While B2C has done the job of establishing the ecosystem around ecommerce in India, the next wave of disproportionate value creation will come from B2B, he asserts. Investors say B2B startups should also keep devising ways to tackle problems in the ecosystem. “Long sales cycles and adoption of technology are the biggest challenges,” reckons Goyal of YourNest. Enterprise technologies need to be up to date to make a greater consumer connect by building cloud-based SaaS delivery models, he says. B2B entrepreneurs are aware of the tough task. Unlike the B2C model, where freebies and discounts lead to customer acquisition, it’s a different ball game in B2B, according to Vinay Singhal, cofounder of content company WittyFeed. “You have to have a clean solution before going to the market,” he says. Another challenge is targeting enterprises. Two B2B startups working in a similar space need to have distinct solutions for customers even if they’re catering to the same problem, says Singhal, who works on a hybrid model of B2B and B2C. WittyFeed has over 120 million unique visitors every month, 400 million monthly page views, clocked $6 million in revenue last year and is profitable, claims Singhal. “There is nothing wrong about B2C, but there is definitely so much right about B2B,” he adds. Another ‘right’ thing that has taken place over the past few years, reckons Pranjal Prashar— cofounder of online reputation management platform for hotels Repup—is the global success of Indian B2B players. PEAK THE SCALE Companies such as Zoho, Freshdesk, RateGain and Wingify have given B2B startups a zing, he says. “It’s also the scalability of business which has made B2B attractive.” Prashar contends that failure of B2C has brought the focus back on products and companies that are adding real value for their clients. “We are relevant today because there are inefficiencies and unsolved problems in B2C companies,” he says, adding that Repup has grown six times in the past year. “We are not profitable yet, but have had a sustainable and frugal journey so far,” he says. Asokan Sattanathan, cofounder of online marketplace Aahaa, could never fathom the B2C business model. In fact, it was the ‘sustainable and predictable’ nature of B2B that hooked him. “In a B2C, you don’t really know who is going to buy what,” he says. This means complexity in inventory sizing and last-mile delivery, he adds. B2B, in contrast, is highly predictable as one gets to know the purchasing patterns. Vinay Singhal, 26 cofounder, Wittyfeed, viral content firm claims to have 120 m unique visitors every month,400 m monthly page views Is bootstrapped; clocked $6 m revenues last year, and is profitable Sattanathan believes that B2C ecommerce is yet to evolve as a profitable business model in India. “Whereas B2Cs are trending to be bargain hunters, B2B customers are with you for a lifetime,” he says. Aahaa has raised `10 crore in funding, is aiming at `20 crore sales this year and logs in over 5,200 transactions every day, claims Sattanathan, who has had his share of failures during the entrepreneurial journey. While initially he tried doing everything himself, a few slipups made him realise what he was good at: customer experience, supply-chain execution and technology. “We now engage a partner ecosystem for many of the physical aspects of our business,” he says. Manish Kumar, 35 cofounder, Kredx, invoice-discounting platform Raised $750,000 so far claims to grow at a rate of 20% per month Sanghvi of LogiNext, too, made mistakes, but not the cardinal ones committed by B2C counterparts: acquiring customers with heavy discounting leading to negative net margins, and burning cash on every transaction resulting in negative gross margins. From over-hiring to overbuilding the product, to quickly trying to make money at the cost of customer experience, Sanghvi lists out a couple of his bloopers. What saved him was having a f lexible approach. “Investors are fundamentally looking for startups that are able to sustain themselves,” he says. For now, sustainability is what gives B2B startups an edge over their B2C counterparts. But will the show continue? Well, it’s too early to declare the winners in the startup world, which is always ready with a bagful of surprises. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

DOT will turn U.S. 401 from Purser Drive to Legend Road into a synchronized street in hopes it will ease traffic and reduce wrecks. JONATHAN M. ALEXANDER jalexander@newsobserver.com i By Jonathan M. Alexander jalexander@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story GARNER North Carolina Department of Transportation officials unveiled a $3 million street improvement plan expected to ease congestion and reduce wrecks along U.S. 401 in Garner. The plan proposes creating a synchronized street on the 1.4-mile stretch from Legend Road near Wake Christian Academy to Purser Drive near Walmart. Construction for the project would begin in the summer of 2020. The plan is only a temporary fix though, as N.C. DOT officials say there are plans to make a much larger improvement in the future. The current design allows side street drivers to cross over U.S. 401 when needing to make a left. However, that causes delays in traffic and more wrecks. The synchronized street design forces side street travelers who want to cross or turn left to instead turn right first, and then make a U-turn. The U-turn area is usually about 600 to 1,000 feet from the intersection. The U-turns would have signals. Five intersections at U.S. 401 were analyzed, and by 2040, all were projected to be at service levels E or F. An “F” is lowest possible service level. By 2020, U.S. 401 north of Purser Drive and Pinewinds Drive are expected to see about 48,000 trips per day. Over the last five years, there were 366 crashes from Legend Road to Purser Drive. Those crashes resulted in more than 200 injuries and two deaths. According to N.C. DOT officials, research shows that after improvements are made, crashes along that corridor are expected to decrease by 50 percent. There have been a number of projects approved by the Garner Town Council along U.S. 401 within the past year. One is a 99-acre project of townhomes, apartments and single-family homes in the McCullers Crossing area. Another project recently approved was the 660-lot Swift Creek Substation, a mixed-use development, which will be north of Eagle Ridge subdivision. Both projects are south of the street improvements. And these aren’t the only improvements being proposed for U.S. 401. N.C. DOT is also adding additional lanes from N.C. 540 to Ten Ten Road in 2019. Council member Buck Kennedy suggested N.C. DOT officials look into further street lighting on U.S. 401. N.C. DOT will be looking for input in the fall for U-turn locations and pedestrian crosswalks. N.C. DOT will first meet with property owners along the corridor, then have a public input meeting. “I really like your idea of meeting with the property owners first,” Kennedy said. “Because if it was in reverse ...” Mayor Pro-tem Kathy Behringer suggested N.C.

Clarke work on designs at Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, Md., for their business, Copiosity, which sells internationally themed wrapping papers and greeting cards. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) By Abha Bhattarai September 30 Follow @abhabhattarai Dianne Harrison was out jogging in 2009 when she came up with an idea for a business. The country was eking its way out of a recession. All around her, people were dealing with what seemed like a never-ending cycle of bad news. But the greeting card industry had yet to catch up. Where, she wondered, were the cards and gift wrap bearing hopeful messages that African Americans, Latinos and people of other cultures could relate to? What could she send to a friend who was battling cancer or had just been laid off? “For people who are losing homes, losing jobs, losing all kinds of things, you don’t want to say, ‘Have a good day’ with a card with a smiley on it,” Harrison, 56, said. “You want to be able to send something that recognizes the gravity of the situation but you want it to be uplifting as well.” The stay-at-home mom partnered with a friend, Cynthia M. Clarke, 58, to create Copiosity, a Silver Spring-based business that specializes in offbeat wrapping paper and cards. Six years in, the company’s products have landed in Whole Foods Markets, CVS stores and most recently, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which sells a line of wrapping paper called “tapestries” in its gift shop. But the path to success has been a gradual one, fueled by small spurts of investments and incremental growth. The company, which expects to make about $100,000 this year, has yet to turn a profit. Harrison and Clarke remain its only employees. Copiosity is at a crossroads as Harrison and Clarke wait to hear back from a number of national chains, including Walmart, Lowe’s and Giant Foods, about whether they will stock the company’s products. It is a crucial time for the fledgling business, said Bruce Gitlin, a retired executive who works with Harrison and Clarke as part of the nonprofit Score Association, which provides mentoring for entrepreneurs. “They’re on the runway, their wheels are up and they’re close to serious takeoff velocity,” said Gitlin, a longtime Xerox executive and former chief executive of the technology firm ContentGuard. “But they’re not that far off the ground yet. They’re at a critical stage where they’ve got to gain altitude and expand the business.” The key, Gitlin said, is to secure large-scale national deals. In a business like theirs, the more volume, the better. At the beginning, for example, when Harrison and Clarke were ordering 1,000 rolls of wrapping paper at a time, they paid $1.20 per roll. Today, they pay about 80 cents apiece, with plans to sell about 60,000 rolls this holiday season. If they could scale up to about 400,000 rolls, that cost would drop to 30 cents per roll. Harrison and Clarke got started by pooling their savings, borrowing from family and friends, and running up credit card bills. It took $50,000 to create their first line of prototypes. They spent months researching the market and testing ideas. “They had an idea, but the challenge was, how do you turn that idea into a business?” Gitlin said. “Does it make sense to do this? Will people want to buy your products? It took awhile to get going.” They incorporated Copiosity in April 2010. Two-and-a-half years later, they got their break when Whole Foods Markets agreed to stock wrapping paper and gift cards at a dozen area stores. They decided to start where there was the most demand: holiday gift wrap. But instead of traditional Christmas patterns, they came up with whimsical prints such as “cracked candy canes,” as well as Kwanzaa-inspired designs in black, purple and gold. That first holiday season, they sold $12,000 worth of wrapping paper in three weeks. “We went about it in a very methodical way, developing our product, testing it for years,” Harrison said. “We’re both over 50, so we don’t have room for major mistakes. We’ve got to get this right the first time.” Today, their products are sold at 25 Whole Foods stores. The State Department and the Navy have placed orders for gift wrap. Among the company’s best sellers is Nifty Wrap, a line of wrapping paper that comes with decorative stickers and stick-on googly eyes and feathers. Rolls of gift wrap typically sell for $5 to $7, while handmade cards cost $3.50 to $12 apiece. “Typically, most designs you find in other wrapping paper are tired, boring prints that you see every year,” said Bill Gwynn, a buyer for Whole Foods’ Mid-Atlantic Region. “The designs on Copiosity’s wrapping papers feature fun, playful prints that really set them apart.” The company is testing a line of bereavement cards for children and young adults, and it has a line of 30-day journals to help people reflect on big life changes. Among its wrapping papers are prints featuring piñatas and African textiles, as well as a contemporary Hanukkah line laden with silver-and-blue stripes and polka dots. A line of color-it-yourself cards includes greetings such as “Feliz Navidad” and “Happy Kwanzaa.” Harrison and Clarke often collaborate with retailers for new products. The duo, who work out of the Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, say it takes about six months to create each new design. It can take another year to 18 months for products to hit shelves. In the case of Walmart, for example, meetings began more than two years ago. Harrison and Clarke flew to the company’s Arkansas headquarters in July to present their products to buyers. They’ll meet again in October to make a final decision on products and designs. If Walmart decides that it would like to stock the company’s wrapping paper, Harrison and Clarke will design packaging that works for the store’s shelves. From there, it will take another year to manufacture the items and send them across the country, in time for next holiday season. “It’s a process,” Clarke said, adding that each retailer asks for specific tweaks based on their needs. Representatives for the home improvement chain Lowe’s, for example, told the duo to simplify their designs and scale back to two colors. Meanwhile, Ahold — the parent company of Giant Food — asked that they make their products “more ethnic.” “Our goal was to have broad appeal. Do we let Ahold go or do we try and do a couple of designs that appeal to them?” Harrison said. “That’s the question we have to answer. We haven’t decided yet.” There will be other questions to consider, too. So far, Harrison and Clarke have focused on selling to national retailers instead of individual consumers. It makes more sense, they say, to chase five- and six-figure deals than to sell wrapping paper by the roll. Eventually, that might change, which means they will have to figure out where to store excess inventory and how to ship items across the country. If it all works out — if they score a couple of big contracts and get in at Walmart — Harrison says the company could rack up $5 million in annual revenue by 2018. But after a seven-year slog to get their business off the ground, Clarke says she knows to be patient. “We spent our first three-and-a-half years doing nothing but researching the market,” she said. “We don’t have a problem taking our time.” business capitalbusiness true Please provide a valid email address.

With 26 kittens abandoned in boxes in the Shuswap area within less than a week, the BC SPCA is letting the public know that there is a much better option: surrendering any unexpected or unwanted animals to the BC SPCA, said a BC SPCA press release. Two kittens were found by a Tim Hortons, near Walmart, dumpster last Friday, three-week-old kittens were found in two boxes in Enderby last Saturday, four kittens left on the top of a hiking trail (two of which are still missing), Shuswap SPCA staff are hoping to see an end to the sudden spike in kitten abandonment, the release said. "We get boxed kittens all summer but this is just a spree of them," Shuswap BC SPCA Branch animal care attendant Barb Gosselin, who notes the shelter helps manage the abandonment or surrender of litters with the help of foster guardians. “We’re asking the public to please, come and surrender any unwanted animals to the BC SPCA – it’s important for us to get background information about the animals, like their age and health, in order to provide them with the best possible care,” said Gosselin. The kittens are in good shape now, but Gosselin said when they were found, the kittens on Mt. Ida were starving. The situation is not uncommon, with the SPCA getting boxes of abandoned kittens throughout the year, but Gosselin said it's unusual that so many kittens have been found within the last week. It's better for the animals if people bring them to the SPCA, rather than abandoning them, she said. "When kittens are abandoned or just dumped in a box somewhere, it puts the animals’ health in jeopardy, and we lose the opportunity to gather the information necessary to rehome that animal. We urge people who feel they must surrender their animals to please do so in a responsible way so that we can all work together to give these animals the best possible chance to live a happy life.” The best thing to do to prevent these instances from occurring is to spay/neuter your pet. She recommended the Kamloops Spay Neuter Clinic which has low rates. Foster guardians for animals are always needed at the SPCA, and Gosselin encourages anyone thinking of becoming a foster fur-parent to contact the branch today. With the abundance of felines across the province, the BC SPCA is hoping an upcoming adoption promotion, presented by Hill’s Science Diet, will encourage British Columbians to consider adopting an adult cat companion – or even two. “We’ve currently got more than 1,700 cats and kittens (in B.C.) in foster care and in our shelters, with more waiting to come in each day,” said BC SPCA director of regional operations Jane Talbot. From Oct. 1 to 14, all BC SPCA branches are offering 50 per cent off the usual adoption fees for all adult cats. “Kittens are always in high demand, but the goal during this event is to find fantastic homes for as many felines as possible,” Talbot said. Adopting an adult cat instead of a kitten has many benefits, she notes, as they’re calmer and more settled, litter trained, fully grown and their personalities are already developed, so potential adopters know exactly what they’re getting. Each year, the BC SPCA rescues more than 15,000 cats and kittens. To adopt an adult cat this weekend, visit your local BC SPCA branch during business hours, or visit spca.bc.ca/adopt to search for adoptable cats.         We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

(Rob Andrews/CleverPet/TNS) The Furbo Dog Camera has streaming video, two way audio and interactive treat tossing mechanics. (Furbo/TNS) We love our four-legged pals to pieces, crave time with them, feel terrible when we’re apart. Thank heaven (for little girl and boy animals) that a growing crop of innovators is working in the pet-tronics and pet-care space, helping to reassure us that Fifi and Fido are doing well even when we’re many miles from home. Smile for the camera. Surveys suggest that “checking in on the pets” is a core reason for purchase and use of web-connected home-security cameras. Most video snoopsters also have a built-in speaker, so app-linked viewers can remotely coo words of comfort or bellow, “Get off the couch!” Even better, I’ve found, are specialty video cameras that also distribute treats, such as the Furbo Pet Cam, the Petzi TreatCam, and the Feed and Go Smart Pet Feeder. – Furbo ($119 at www.furbo.co) has the sleekest design and an easily popped-off lid for dropping in refills of your dog or cat’s favorite yummies. Furbo’s Barking Alerts feature pushes a message to your smartphone when your high-strung pal is complaining, encouraging a quick response in your most calming voice. – The Petzi ($151.37 at Walmart.com) has the Pavlovian response mechanism down pat. Remotely wake up Petzi through your phone or tablet app and a yellow light glows next to its lens, telling whomever, “You’re on Candid Camera.” Other app-taps remotely cue Petzi’s pleasant musical-jingle alert, capture, and then send your voiced communications and – most important – pump out a handful of dog or cat treats (better crunchy than soft, no longer than one inch). Petzi’s secure holding tank won’t spill stuff if your smart guy knocks the box over. As with Furbo, remote video views of the darlings can be snapped, shared, and compared on social media – in color when there’s strong room light, otherwise captured in black and white. – The Feed and Go ($249 at Amazon.com) sits apart by serving full meals, with six rotating compartments that each hold up to 8 ounces of dry or (if you dare) wet food. An SMS or email message is pushed when the feeding starts. And you’ll get a warning if there’s a system failure. – Coming soon, the Gosh easyFeed will increase the options with portioned food and water refilling, too. It will even reorder pet food from Amazon automatically when sensing the storage bin is running on empty. Due in November, it’s now a $155 early-bird special on Kickstarter. – No pictures, just treats. Too far removed or lacking the gear to connect remotely with your pooch? CleverPet serves as a surrogate babysitter, engaging your pal with paw-at-the-blinking-lights games that reward pattern recognition with treats. Get a demo and make an order ($299) at www.clever.pet. – Exercise this. WonderWoof is a cute, connected Bluetooth bow tie that attaches to your dog’s collar, then reports (to an app) if your pal is doing enough running, sleeping, playing, and walking. $95 at www.wonderwoof.com. For dogs that like to play “fetch” longer than you do, there’s PetSafe’s Playtime Anytime Automatic Ball Launcher. A tennis ball shoots out, adjusted to fly between eight and 30 feet away. Poochie hustles after the ball, doubles back, drops it into the device’s top hole, and then . boom! . the ball launches again. A rest feature guarantees a cool-down every 15 minutes. A Launcher costs $149.95 at www.petsafe.net, where you’ll also find the Train ‘n Praise Potty Training System, $110 and up. High-rise animals’ best friend, this thing dispenses a treat every time your pet uses its indoor/outdoor pee pad with fake (washable) grass, a large holding tank, and optional liners. – Plush accommodations. Spend half your day cleaning animal fur off the furniture? EnchantedHomePet.com offers an amazingly diverse and pretty line of pet sofas/beds that both lure your critters and blend with your home decor. Sized for either small pups or big bruisers, these snooze spots feature washable plush or pleather upholstery and storage for toys and bones, priced from $89.99 to $599.99. Also available online from Amazon, Wayfair, Target, Kohl’s, Bed Bath and Beyond, dog.com, and petco.com. – EnchantedHomePet’s Pet Therapeutics brand resting mats are prominent on the same websites. Placed atop a grownup sofa, a TheraWarm Sofa Bolster and Furniture Protector ($59.99) captures and radiates a pet’s natural body heat. Conversely, the TheraCool Gel Cell Cooling Pad ($82.99) absorbs and dissipates excess body heat. Both have memory foam, which help ease joint and arthritic pain, it’s claimed.

AUSTIN Rio Grande Valley farmers have reacted angrily to the news that Mexican President Vicente Fox will not be announcing his countrys water payback plan this week after all. Miguel Monterrubio, a spokesman at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said Wednesday that Fox needs more time to discuss certain aspects of the proposals with Cabinet colleagues and governors from the six Mexican states bordering the United States. But Valley farmers and irrigation district managers say they fear the holdup is due to Fox demanding increased U.S. funding for major irrigation system upgrades in Chihuahua and other northern Mexican states. Id like to say we are surprised by this latest delay by Mexico, but how can we be? said Tommy Garcia, a McAllen farmer who has just written off 300 acres of decaying grain sorghum due to lack of irrigation. We have been skeptical of President Foxs announcement from the start, and I think it proves that Mexico is going back on its word again. We are very much again-st our government helping modernize Mex-icos irrigation system at this time. Monterrubio said he felt sure that Foxs announcement was only being delayed a couple of days and that it could come early next week. Monterrubio said he had no knowledge of Fox asking for increased U.S. funding to help pay for a $420 million irrigation system upgrade for the states of Chihuahua, Tamau-lipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Its not really a delay at all, Monterrubio said. The presidents announcement has been put back just a few days so that some members of the different secretariats involved can meet with the government to discuss details on some aspects of the proposals. There are just a few more things that need to be ironed out. Monterrubio said Fox was working with five different Cabinet members on the issue, along with the Mexican National Water Commission and the governors of the six states along the Mexico-U.S. border. According to the International Boundary and Water Commission, Mexico is likely to owe the United States 1.7 million acre-feet of water by Sept. 30, the deadline for the current five-year repayment cycle. Mexico says it is still technically in compliance with a 1944 international treaty that requires the release of an average of 350,000 acre-feet of water from the Rio Conchos Basin to the Rio Grande every year. Fox said on May 15 that he would confirm within the next 15 days a detailed schedule on how and when the water repayments would be made. Fox made the statement the day after telephone discussions with President Bush on American involvement in a $420 million water conservation plan for the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Sam Sparks, a Mercedes grower of sugar, cotton, and grain sorghum, said Foxs delay in announcing a water payback plan would push more Valley farmers towards supporting the abolition of the 1944 treaty. This postponement shows that we are not going to get any water any time soon. It is another delaying tactic, Sparks said. Weve got to scrap the treaty and tell Mexico that we are going to keep our water and they can keep theirs. Most of our vegetable production has already been lost to Mexico anyway. Ray Prewett, executive vice president of Texas Citrus Mutual and a founder member of Texans for Treaty Compliance, dismissed talk of the dispute being irreconcilable. We play up the negative too much. If the state of Chihuahua had released just 10 percent of the 12 million acre-feet it has used since 1992, we would not be where we are today, Prewett said. We do not want to box ourselves in a corner over this. We must not think this dispute is un-resolvable. Gordon Hill, general manager of Bayview Irrigation District, said Valley farmers and growers should be just as upset with the IBWC as Fox after the binational agency failed to send a representative to a Rio Grande Regional Water Planning Group meeting in Zapata on Wednesday. Im furious. IBWC Commissioner Carlos Ramirez met with State Department officials in Washington last week to discuss the water debt and no one was here to tell us how that meeting went. Once again we are being kept in the dark, Hill said. I think its time Valley farmers stopped pussy-footing with Washington, the State Department and the IBWC and start looking at developing alternative, dependable, water sources, he added. Hill said his proposals to divert Mexico-bound water from the Hoover Dam to the Rio Grande had been favorably received by many Region M members at the Zapata meeting. Hill said he was also pleased Region M members had agreed to consider a resolution at their next meeting that calls on the U.S. government to block any financial aid for Mexican water conservation projects until the 1944 treaty is complied with. Sally Spener, IBWCs public affairs officer, said Principal Engineer Carlos Marin had confirmed in advance his absence from the Zapata meeting. Spener said both Ramirez and Marin were scheduled to attend the next Region M meeting. The meeting is scheduled to take place June 26 in McAllen.

While it doesn’t entail commemorating a notable figure from history, or carry religious significance, it does involve celebrating two things that many genre fans can get behind: Star Wars and toys. Although it almost seems greedy for me to celebrate both “National Drink Beer Day” and Force Friday in the same week, such is the case with today’s new annual tradition of unveiling a bantha poodoo-load of Star Wars toys and collectibles. Specifically, today’s release targets merchandise for the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, opening Dec. 16. Obviously there is no need to have a shortage of Star Wars toys in your life, but from 3.75” figures, to vehicles, to Nerf guns, to collectible Black Series figures, Funko Pop Vinyls, and more, there are dozens of new items hitting shelves today. Instead of listing all of them, I’ve selected these five standout items I am dropping some cash on -- you know, in the spirit of celebrating the holiday. K-2SO Star Wars Black Series figure The Star Wars Black Series 6-inch figs are always a win in my book because the sculpts are so incredibly detailed, but they are ultimately still action figures. For Rogue One, I’m already a big fan of the liberated Imperial Droid K-2SO, or “Kaytoo.” Performed via mo-cap and voiced by Alan Tudyk, the droid not only seems to have a pragmatic attitude -- that sets him apart from C-3PO -- but the look strikes me as steampunky. He’s tall and lanky, with oversized hinged joints, and slightly hunched over. The Black Series version of him ($20) is going to look great on my desk. The other Rogue One Black Series figures include Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, the Imperial Death Trooper, and an Imperial Hovertank fig (exclusive to Toys ’R’ Us).   Funko Pop Vinyl Exclusives Funko continues its world galaxy domination of collectibles with 18 new Rogue One Pops! hitting the market, as well as three Wobblers. Although last year saw a dearth of Rey toys and collectibles, there’s plenty of Jyns out there to make fans happy, including three Pops and a Wobbler. But I’m more interested in the Dark Side of things. Specifically, chrome Imperial Death Trooper ($9), available exclusively at Walmart, has caught my eye. It looks the shiny new toy I need – and one that is going to be hard to get. Speaking of exclusives, the Bistan aka “Space Monkey” Pop is going to be my chase item at New York Comic Con next week. Developed by Neal Scanlan’s creature shop, and unveiled at Star Wars Celebration in July, the character (who is of the Iakuru species) is a gunner on the new U-ship craft. There’s just something about him that reminds me of an Original Trilogy cantina creature, or a background character from Jabba’s Palace. Frankly, I want to hang out with this guy and get him cackling like mad over jokes about Ewoks. But I’ll settle for having him in Pop form.   Stormtrooper replica mask Introduce a little Star Wars roleplay into your life with Hasbro's Stormtrooper Black Series talking helmet ($80; available at retailers in classic white, or in Shadow Trooper black exclusively at Amazon). The helmet includes a voice changer so you can make certain to avoid being identified by rebel scum.  A Death Trooper half mask with voice changer and lights is likewise available for $30 at other retailers.   Nerf Blasters They light up, make noise, and, best of all, unleash hell in the form of a barrage of foam darts. The Nerf blasters are amongst my favorite of Hasbro’s Star Wars toy line. In fact, I currently have a pump-action First Order Stormtrooper one at the ready by my computer in case I encounter a surly commenter (don’t feed the trolls; blast them). The Rogue One character blasters include Jyn ($50), Cassian ($20), and a Death Trooper ($35). I’m split between the Jyn and Death Trooper versions. On one hand, Jyn’s has a nice weight to it, and fires off six darts in rapid succession. However, design-wise the Death Trooper blaster has an edge. It can easily be held in one hand, and the blaster sounds and are incredibly satisfying. It holds three glow-in-the-dark darts, and the muzzle lights up as you pump and fire.   Remote-controlled AT-ACT vehicle Not to be confused with the classic AT-AT (All Terrain Armored Transport) vehicles, the new AT-ACTs (All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport) introduced in Rogue One are bigger, with different blaster mounts, and a more trapezoid grill. The Hasbro toy version unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con for the 3.75” figures, is remote controlled (via smartphone) with the ability to fire four Nerf darts at a time. It moves its head, lights up, and makes a variety of sounds. There is also a detachable cargo hold that can be connected to the main vehicle with a zipline, and comes with three figures: Jyn, an Imperial Astromech, and a driver. There is a steep price of $300 for all this awesomeness, but let me restate: It’s a remote-controlled AT-ACT. I mean, this thing looks sweet, and might even fetch me my slippers and newspaper. As a notable mention, I have to bring up the LEGO Death Star set that is not technically a new Rogue One toy, but is still a new item available today. For $500, the 4,000-piece set is pretty epic in both detail and size, and comes with 23(!) mini-figs.   Let me know in the comments below if you plan on picking up Rogue One toys before the movie comes out, and what's topping your list of Force Friday items. And before I leave you, take in the nerdy splendor below of me in my new half-mask and blaster pose. It's basically my version of a Christmas sweater on Force Friday.

Attention Walmart Shoppers: Self-Driving Cart in Aisle 3 By Beth Stackpole on September 20, 2016 SHARE ARTICLE: Beth Stackpole Retail giant seeks patent on robot carts to streamline the shopping experience.   Talk of self-driving cars is everywhere lately, and now Walmart wants to take the whole autonomous operation concept to a shopping cart. Really? Apparently, the company has filed a patent for a self-driving robot cart that would address some of users’ pain points with maneuvering through crowded aisles and with the whole shopping experience in general. According to a Popular Science article, the robot cart design takes aim at common problems such as employees being unavailable or untrained to adequately support customers, aisles made messy by abandoned carts and displaced inventory. Popular Science explains the patented technology as putting a Roomba-like robot under the cart, which enables it to be driven around the store as directed by the shopper. There was discussion of a track system to enable carts to easily travel around the store to pick up other carts or locate products, and obviously, a tie in to the sensor-rich environment that is Walmart’s store and supply chain system. Seems a bit like overkill to me, but as we’ve seen from popular Internet memes, anything can happen in a Walmart store.

And I will admit, albeit begrudgingly, I somehow still do. But when I sit down to remember the 21st night of September, wherein I piled into UT Austin’s Frank Erwin Center along with over ten thousand other eager concertgoers for the Saint Pablo Tour, I can’t help but feel salty. And it’s not hard to understand why. The Life of Pablo (TLOP) is an incredible album. As someone who has spent her life observing and adoring Kanye West, it was the culmination of so many of his other creative techniques from the gospel roots of The College Dropout (2004) to the electro-punk stripped-down minimalism of Yeezus (2013). TLOP is a truly raw, spiritual experience from start to finish. Not being pleased with the Saint Pablo tour itself is, then, in no part due to any problem I have with the content of the album he’s touring. So why exactly am I disappointed and frustrated with his performance in Austin last week? Maybe it was the fact that Kanye ended up starting the show about 2 hours late, a move so incredibly unprofessional I felt insulted by how little he valued the time of his loyal fans, many of whom drove hours to come see him. Maybe it was the fact that he performed for barely an hour for us in Austin, after giving Houston a 2+ hour extravaganza the night before. Maybe it was the fact that his merch was composed of $95.00 long-sleeve Gildan t-shirts – you know, the same brand of shirts that cost $2.00 at Walmart – sporting designs that could’ve been devised in Microsoft Paint. Maybe it was the fact that I bought tickets way back in June as part of the Tidal Presale, tickets which put me out more than a couple of Benjamins. Maybe it was the fact that I felt like I did more vocals at the show than Kanye actually did, as he severely overused the “stop singing and hold the mic out to the crowd” move. I’m sure my saltiness is due, in no small part, to the previous concert experience I had with Kanye: the Yeezus tour, an earth-shatteringly magnificent auditory and visual spectacle that has proven impossible to forget. While all of those things collectively were enough to make me feel disrespected and ripped-off, I also was confused by the setlist. Yes, we got some key throwbacks like Stronger, Heartless, Touch the Sky and Can’t Tell Me Nothing, which energized the crowd and helped me feel a little bit less angry at Ye. Considering this was indeed the Saint Pablo Tour, however, there were more than a handful tracks of that were conspicuously absent. Both 30 Hours, my personal favorite track off TLOP, as well as No More Parties in L.A., a unanimous fan favorite, were not performed. Highlights and FML were also no-shows. Perhaps most strange was the lack of the actual tour namesake track, Saint Pablo, a six minute masterpiece we all had expected to hear at the show. I assume that the gaps in the setlist were a result of the show starting about 2 hours late, which just frustrates me even more. Kanye had an arena full of people who support his lifestyle out of our own pockets, and he couldn’t even be grateful enough to his fanbase to give us the show we paid for. As someone who has seen over fifty individual acts live, none of which were in festival environments, that’s something I have never before encountered and hope to never encounter again. Don’t get me wrong; it wasn’t all bad. I did have fun dancing my face off, and what songs he did play sounded pretty fantastic on the Erwin Center’s sound system. The small square stage that levitated above the general admission crowd, which was a pulsating mosh pit that looked like the sickest party since T-Pain at Trinity last fall, was cool. The rest of the stage set up seemed like an impressive feat of engineering. The red lasers during Ultralight Beam were trippy and gorgeous. Yet having been spoiled by Yeezus, the minimalism Kanye was going for on this tour really seemed to fall flat, as jaw-dropping visuals have come to be a key part of the big concert venue experience. I’m sure if I was a wee-bit more obedient of a fan, I would call it “art” and refuse to criticize it, but I’m not that blindly adoring anymore after having been ripped-off by the West’s offensively short performance. Yet if I’m being completely honest, I’m still a sucker. If Kanye came back to Austin or San Antonio tomorrow,I would drop everything and go. I love and respect him as an artist that much. But my experience at Saint Pablo made me feel like maybe I shouldn’t love and respect him that much, considering it isn’t mutual. Despite being a lifelong fan who thinks his music has only gotten better with each creative project, I’m left feeling like I really do miss the old Kanye.

The service puts Google in competition with Uber’s UberPool and Lyft’s Line services, but with some key differences in the business model. While the aforementioned Uber and Lyft services are basically swapouts for taxis that let you split the cost of your trip with another rider headed in the same direction, Google said it intends to have the Waze app match drivers and riders already looking to move in the same direction. The driver is only reimbursed for mileage driven at a maximum of 54 cents per mile — Google says it doesn't believe drivers need to report any payment as income because it is considered gas money. Coordination, communication, and payment are automatically handled through the mobile apps. According to an account by a Wall Street Journal reporter taking a trip from San Francisco’s financial district to Oakland — roughly a 20-minute ride — Google paid the driver $6.30 and charged the rider just $3 — factoring in a discount for the service’s launch. The same ride outside of rush hour would cost $23 to $30 on Uber or Lyft, according to the companies’ apps. Those in the San Francisco Bay Area can register via the original Waze app, but riders must make requests via the separate Waze Rider app. For now at least, drivers aren't subject to a background check, nor are they required to provide a photo ID, they are just required to provide Waze with a schedule overview in addition to their home and work addresses.

Banks are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tries to reassure investors about its financial health. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift and energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,343 as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. It lost 195 points the previous day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 22 points, or 1 percent, to 2,172. The Nasdaq composite rose 52 points, or 1 percent, to 5,321. DEUTSCHE BANK: Banks made the largest gains Friday as investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation. The German bank has struggled for years to turn its business around and the Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. “(A fine of) $14 billion basically wipes out their earnings for the year,” said Nathan Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. If the bank agrees to a smaller payment, it would be a big relief to investors. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.70, or 14.8 percent, to $13.18. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. BANKS REBOUND: Financial stocks had tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the Deutsche Bank’s health following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are worried not just about its stock price, but the effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank runs into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are problems to worry about, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and increased regulation, there’s little reason for investors to buy bank stocks. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added $1.13, or 1.7 percent, to $66.78 and Citigroup gained $1.60, or 3.5 percent, to $47.40. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.85, or 4 percent, to $153.34 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.47, or 1.7 percent, to $89.70 and Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $72.37. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.95, or 1.9 percent, to $103.22 and EOG Resources rose $1.88, or 2 percent, to $96.93. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. COGNIZANT: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $6.40, or 11.6 percent, to $48.60. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.36, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.38, or 2 percent, to $68.83. NXP surged 17 percent Thursday and Qualcom rose 6 percent. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 13 percent over the last three months. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world and Microsoft, the second-largest company on the S&P 500, is up 13 percent this quarter. Another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 15 percent. BONDS: Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. That sent stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, lower than the rest of the market. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1233 from $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks 2016-09-30 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks Previous: Audit: Take back $3.4M in FEMA money from Mississippi school Next: Cattle prices falter despite good news About Associated Press More Stories Like This FAA grant to help repair Vicksburg airport drainage problems November 18, 2016 Tupelo works to provide utilities to annexed areas November 18, 2016 Mississippi joins fight for legal sports betting November 18, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:40PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. There are many reasons to buy and own shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C), but the best reason right now is its valuation. Valuing bank stocks Bank stocks aren't generally valued in the same way that other stocks are. Most investors look to the price-to-earnings ratio to gauge how cheap or expensive a stock is. The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the valuation, and vice versa. For instance, shares of Wal-Mart trade for a P/E ratio of 15.6. This means that you have to pay $15.60 for every dollar of the company's earnings. Amazon.com, by contrast, trades at a P/E ratio of 208.6, a higher multiple that reflects the e-commerce giant's growth potential. The P/E ratio is a helpful way to gauge bank stock values as well, but investors in the industry tend to prefer the price-to-book-value ratio. This is the metric that allows you to see the best thing about Citigroup's stock. Citigroup's stock is cheap There is no hard-and-fast rule to determine whether a bank is fairly valued. That's because the industry's profitability and thus share prices tend to fluctuate with the business cycle. When times are good, bank stocks trade for high multiples to their book values -- two times book value or more. But when the economy is under pressure, so too are bank stock valuations, often dipping below one times book value. You can see this in a chart of Citigroup's valuation over the past decade. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the New York-based bank was valued at more than twice its book value. But now its shares trade for a 35% discount to book value. C Price to Book Value data by YCharts. To put all of this into perspective, the average bank stock on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, trades for a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.16 -- a 16% premium to book value. Of the 23 banks on the index, in fact, Citigroup's stock is the cheapest. Why Citigroup is cheap There are reasons, of course, that Citigroup's shares are valued at less than other blue chip bank stocks. The most important is the fact that Citigroup is far less profitable than it once was. Over the past year, Citigroup's return on equity, the primary profitability metric in the bank industry, was 7.3%, according to YCharts.com. That's meaningfully below the double-digit range that investors like to see at a bank like Citigroup. Unless the bank earns a return on equity of roughly 12%, it's said to be destroying shareholder value, after an investor factors in the opportunity cost of not investing his or her money elsewhere. Until Citigroup passes that threshold, or is expected to do so, there's little reason to think that its share price will eclipse book value. The point here is that Citigroup's stock is cheap, which is the best thing about it. At the same time, however, it's cheap for a reason. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:40PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. There are many reasons to buy and own shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C), but the best reason right now is its valuation. Valuing bank stocks Bank stocks aren't generally valued in the same way that other stocks are. Most investors look to the price-to-earnings ratio to gauge how cheap or expensive a stock is. The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the valuation, and vice versa. For instance, shares of Wal-Mart trade for a P/E ratio of 15.6. This means that you have to pay $15.60 for every dollar of the company's earnings. Amazon.com, by contrast, trades at a P/E ratio of 208.6, a higher multiple that reflects the e-commerce giant's growth potential. The P/E ratio is a helpful way to gauge bank stock values as well, but investors in the industry tend to prefer the price-to-book-value ratio. This is the metric that allows you to see the best thing about Citigroup's stock. Citigroup's stock is cheap There is no hard-and-fast rule to determine whether a bank is fairly valued. That's because the industry's profitability and thus share prices tend to fluctuate with the business cycle. When times are good, bank stocks trade for high multiples to their book values -- two times book value or more. But when the economy is under pressure, so too are bank stock valuations, often dipping below one times book value. You can see this in a chart of Citigroup's valuation over the past decade. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the New York-based bank was valued at more than twice its book value. But now its shares trade for a 35% discount to book value. C Price to Book Value data by YCharts. To put all of this into perspective, the average bank stock on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, trades for a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.16 -- a 16% premium to book value. Of the 23 banks on the index, in fact, Citigroup's stock is the cheapest. Why Citigroup is cheap There are reasons, of course, that Citigroup's shares are valued at less than other blue chip bank stocks. The most important is the fact that Citigroup is far less profitable than it once was. Over the past year, Citigroup's return on equity, the primary profitability metric in the bank industry, was 7.3%, according to YCharts.com. That's meaningfully below the double-digit range that investors like to see at a bank like Citigroup. Unless the bank earns a return on equity of roughly 12%, it's said to be destroying shareholder value, after an investor factors in the opportunity cost of not investing his or her money elsewhere. Until Citigroup passes that threshold, or is expected to do so, there's little reason to think that its share price will eclipse book value. The point here is that Citigroup's stock is cheap, which is the best thing about it. At the same time, however, it's cheap for a reason. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Keris Alison Lahiff Sep 30, 2016 12:13 PM EDT U.S. stocks moved higher Friday thanks to a Deutsche Bank  (DB) rebound on the final day of the month and third quarter. The S&P 500 is expected to close the quarter with gains, but September remains in the red. Walmart (WMT) was the top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after being initiated with an OVERWEIGHT rating and $90  price target at Keybanc. The firm said investments by the retailer should eventually lead to sustainable market share gains. Consumer sentiment in the U.S. improved at a faster-than-expected pace in September. Confidence among high-income households was particularly high, driven by lower inflation expectations. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) tumbled after disclosing an international investigation into whether it had violated U.S. law over a number of payments related to facilities in India.

(Facebook) Jackie Dunham, CTVNews.ca @JaclynLDunham Published Friday, September 30, 2016 12:16PM EDT A woman’s social media post has sparked debate online after she confronted a man dragging his daughter with her hair wrapped around a shopping cart handle in a Texas store. In a Sept. 19 Facebook post that featured photos of the girl and her father, Erika Burch describes how she and her husband, Robert Burch, were shopping in a Wal-Mart in Cleveland, Tex., about 72 kilometres north of Houston, when she noticed them. She described how the girl was walking with her head pressed against the cart her father was pushing. In the post, Burch wrote that the little girl was begging her father to unwrap her hair from the cart handle. “She was saying, ‘Please stop. I promise I won’t do it again. Please stop!” Burch wrote, adding that she told the man to let his daughter go. According to the post, the child’s father told her to mind her own business and that he “grew up just fine.” Her Facebook post has been shared more than 242,000 times and has more than 24,000 comments. Some of the commenters supported Burch’s decision to intervene, while others suggested the man should be able to discipline his child how he sees fit. “Thank you Erika for trying to stand up for children,” one commenter wrote. “If people can't control their children without hurting them, they should not have them.” Another comment said that most bystanders wouldn’t get involved in such a situation and that Burch showed “courage” for doing something. Other commenters believed that Burch should have minded her own business, instead of involving herself in another family’s affairs. “You’re (Burch) the problem with the way kids are turning out to be this day and age,” one man wrote. “It's none of your business how that man is raising his child.” Some comments suggested that Burch didn’t know the whole story before she confronted the father, such as what the girl did in the first place. Burch said she asked the man to stop three times before eventually calling the police. A police officer already happened to be in the store investigating a theft when Burch called, so he was able to join the group in a matter of minutes. She said his sergeant joined them soon after. In the post, Burch wrote that the police officer didn’t arrest the man because there were no bruises or visible signs of abuse on the girl. According to Burch, she showed the officers the photos she took of the episode and the sergeant told her that the man had a right to discipline his children. “This is what’s wrong with this world today! Nobody stands up for anyone, not even children!” Burch wrote. “Dragging a girl by the hair of her head is not proper discipline!” The Cleveland Police Department posted a statement about the incident on their Facebook page. They wrote that they had received numerous calls about the incident and that their Detective Division was looking into it. “CPS (Child Protective Services) has been contacted per our policy and is also investigating this case,” the police statement said. “A joint investigation is currently being conducted by both agencies.” Photos Burch's Facebook post has been shared more than 242,000 times and has more than 24,000 comments.

A viral YouTube video shows a terrified toddler having a meltdown over a Donald Trump mask. If he thinks that’s scary, imagine if we get a Trump presidency! But seriously, Mary Simms and her husband planned to take a family selfie of their two-year-old twins wearing rubber Hillary Clinton and Trump masks at a California Walmart. But to their surprise — and our endless amusement — son Miles threw a yuge tantrum that rivals temperamental Trump’s outbursts. “But it’s the best ever!” jokes the kid’s dad in a spot-on Trump impression while wearing the Donald’s trademark mug. (Mary Simms/Youtube) “But it’s the best ever!” jokes the kid’s dad in a spot-on Trump impression while wearing the Donald’s trademark mug. “There’s never been a better costume!” HEAR IT: Trump said Ivanka made him promise not to date younger Miles isn’t having it though. “No! No Trump! No Trump!” the little boy wails, while his sister — with a Clinton mask perched on her head — grins beside him in the shopping cart. This viral video shows a toddler terrified of a Donald Trump mask. (Mary Simms/Youtube) Simms, the CEO of a public relations firm and an Afghanistan combat veteran, notes in her post that they tried coaxing the boy into a family photo with the masks for “about 30 seconds before he was swept up for cuddles and we returned to a Sunday Funday.” But the video reveals that by the following weekend, Miles seems to get over his Trump phobia. He wears the mask at one point. And when mom asks what his political views are in the video, the little guy says, “Stump for Trump!” But by the end of the clip, Miles seems to have embraced a Trump presidency. (Mary Simms/Youtube) However, he also lets the Trump mask sink to the bottom of their swimming pool, so it’s safe to say he’s probably still an undecided voter.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, traders Kevin Lodewick, left, and Richard Cohen work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "People came to the realization that this isn't likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector," said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany's DAX climbed 1 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 30, 2016 11:02am   Comments Share: Related WMT 5 Good Things And 4 Bad From Wal-Mart's Earnings Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble Delta, American Airlines Are Buys; Saleforce.com PT Hiked (Investor's Business Daily) UBS’ Michael Lasser believes the key for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is whether the company is able to sustain its top-line momentum as it further invests in prices and reaps the return on its labor investments. Lasser maintained a Neutral rating on the company, with a price target of $73. EPS Expectations At its AR event in 2015, Wal-Mart indicated it expected to low single digit EPS growth in FY18. However, the analyst believes the company’s expectations would moderate lower at the 2016 event, with Wal-Mart guiding to FY 2019 as the year that EPS inflects higher. “There are a number of moving pieces that have impacted WMT’s EPS outlook in the last few Qs. Between FX, the Jet acquisition, and store closures, it should see a $0.20 to $0.25 EPS drag,” Lasser mentioned. Ecommerce The analyst believes the company needs to lay out a cohesive, long-term vision for ecommerce. Until now, Wal-Mart has focused on integrating its digital and physical, while expanding its breadth of third party sellers. “Now, it's bringing Jet into the fold, all under the direction of Marc Lore. It'll be key to know how it expects to compete. We think it’s no easy task,” Lasser stated. If Wal-Mart needs to gain an edge over the competition with pricing, the analyst believes it could be expensive and margin dilutive.

Couple that with living in an age when virtually anyone and everyone has the ability to make himself or herself heard and you have a complex situation. There are many advantages as well as some disadvantages to this reality. My purpose is not to evaluate the situation but rather to point out the need for some self-regulation. A certain Walmart shopper, with whom I am not acquainted, but I overheard yesterday as she passed by me surely needed some self-regulation of her speech. Certainly all of us from politicians to pastors to housewives to church members, etc. have a need to self-regulate our precious free-speech. I am in favor of free-speech but I am also in favor of the exercise of wisdom. Jesus was very straightforward, "I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." (Matthew 12:36-37, NASU) I shudder when I read that passage. James 3 presents controlling one's speech as a most difficult task, but may I recommend Proverbs as a most helpful guide that you and I can use to help us self-regulate our speech? Proverbs 9:10 lays the foundation, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." (NASU) Perhaps it is worth remembering that God spoke the world into existence: creation pours forth "speech" about the majesty of God (Psalm 19); God hears our speech; God wants us to speak to Him; Scripture repeatedly invites us to hear the Word of the Lord; we are reconciled to God through the confession of our mouth; we teach and train and disciple through our speech; we build up and tear down with our speech. There is no chance of sticking with the plan of controlling our speech without a healthy respect, awe, and fear of our Creator and Judge. Proverbs 4:24 is a good place to begin, "Put away from you a deceitful mouth And put devious speech far from you." (NASU) We cannot have satisfactory relationships of any kind if we do not keep ourselves from speaking deceitfully. Proverbs 6:12-14 can lead us into more peaceful lives and reduce our discomfort come judgement day, "A worthless person, a wicked man, Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth, Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who points with his fingers; Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil, Who spreads strife." (NASU) We ought to take this admonition very seriously and heed its warning. Many of us who think of ourselves as "watchmen of the wall" or "keepers of the faith" would do well to examine ourselves to see if we are guilty of spreading strife. The word of Scripture is plain here concerning one who spreads strife: "A worthless person, a wicked man". Grace should be prominent in our speech. Colossians 4:6 "Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person."(NASU) Ephesians 4:29 "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear." (NASU) We are commanded to make all our speech seasoned with grace. I am ashamed. Copyright 2016 The Courier - Your Messenger for the River Valley. All rights reserved.

Weep with me. Wall Street Journal confirmed that WME-IMG, the financial conglomerate responsible for the $4 billion purchase of the world’s leading mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion earlier this year, has farmed out pieces of the business to some of its celebrity clients. That list includes Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye, Adam Levine, Anthony Kiedis, Ben Affleck, Calvin Harris, Cam Newton, Conan O’Brien, Flea, Guy Fieri, Jimmy Kimmel, Li Na, LL COOL J, Maria Sharapova, Mark Wahlberg, Michael Bay, Rob Dyrdek, Robert Kraft, Serena Williams, Sylvester Stallone, Tom Brady, Trey Parker, Tyler Perry and Venus Williams. In buying the UFC, WME-IMG let celebrities buy small shares with a minimum investment of $250,000. Here's the list pic.twitter.com/3whha8eOPe— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 30, 2016 “Expanding our ownership group to include this caliber of talent and entrepreneurs is a strong indicator of UFC’s fast-growing global presence,” UFC President Dana White said in today’s release. “Our new investors bring an incredible depth of knowledge and experience to help us continue to elevate this brand and capitalize on its entertainment and sports crossover appeal.” That means a wider mainstream reach for the combat sports organization, which at one time was considered a pimple on the back of the sports world. While Hollywood and the music business are coming to UFC, the partnership is expected to work both ways, bringing MMA stars into more prominent roles (like this one).

(Photo: David Goldman / AP) It seems as though we dread elections in the United States. Over several past races, only 50 percent to 60 percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots. More and more Americans are tuning out of the electoral process. Monday night’s debate, the first matchup between the two major-party candidates, was a perfect showcase for explaining voter apathy. The confines of the debate were set by the Commission on Presidential Debates and had the potential to unleash a wide-ranging set of arguments on the issues of income inequality, race and policing, and national security. Instead, over the course of more than 90 minutes, we saw Donald Trump sputter lies and half-truths, interrupt, talk over and “mansplain” issues to Hillary Clinton. And we saw Clinton, the center-right candidate by most reasonable measures, appear by contrast to be the sane and liberal-leaning candidate—at least most of the time. Not only were the issues narrowed down to meaningless levels, they generally skewed politically rightward. Here are 10 big topics that got no mention during the debate. This is by no means an exhaustive list but simply an indicator of how issue-poor the first presidential debate was. 1. During the discussion on income inequality, no one mentioned how corporations and wealthy elites have created such a lopsided economy in favor of the rich that the entire project of capitalism can be questioned. A recent report by the U.K. organization Global Justice Now found that of the top richest 100 economic institutions worldwide, a majority—69 to be exact—are corporations. That means that Wal-Mart, the world’s richest corporation, on whose board Clinton once sat, is wealthier than the country of Spain. 2. No one bought up how poverty is affecting Americans, the residents of the world’s wealthiest of all economic entities. So dire are the straits of our most vulnerable citizens that a disturbing new report found that hungry American teenagers are often trading sex for food. This shameful effect can be traced to government policies of the kind that Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, pushed in the name of welfare reform. Whether on a global or domestic scale, such shocking indicators of the failures of capitalism were not considered worthy of discussion during the debate. 3. During one of Trump’s very few moderately sane moments in the debate, he raised legitimate concerns about free trade, calling Clinton out for her support of the 1994 North America Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. By most measures, NAFTA has been disastrous for both U.S. and Mexican workers and has driven much of the emigration from Mexico to the U.S. Trump also rightly called Clinton out on her initial support for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a much wider-ranging and highly secretive trade deal between the U.S. and a number of Pacific nations that has been denounced by labor and environmental groups. What Clinton failed to point out was Trump’s claim that economic growth is hampered by too much regulation—this idea runs counter to his opposition of NAFTA and TPP. The so-called “free trade” agreements are designed to free corporations from the burdens of environmental regulations, labor laws and similar things. Clearly, Trump, the billionaire businessman, has only attached himself to the anti-free-trade sentiment in order to win votes from working- and middle-class Americans. In the end, it became obvious that a billionaire debating a millionaire will hardly result in any substantive discussion of how global trade deals hurt ordinary people. 4. We have just caught one of the most high-profile U.S. banks, Wells Fargo, engaging in widespread criminal behavior, targeting millions of Americans with fraudulent bank accounts and credit cards. Wells Fargo has fired thousands of its low-level workers and taken no real responsibility, short of paying a paltry fine, for its shenanigans. CEO John Stumpf is so obscenely wealthy that as a penalty for overseeing the bank’s crimes, he will return $41 million in stocks. He will not, of course, face prison time. Nor will any top Wells Fargo executives. This major news story did not even get a mention during the debate because, after all, corporations are seen by politicians of both major parties as noble job creators, rather than the “blood-sucking vampire squids” that they often are. 5. During the discussion on race and policing, neither candidate mentioned these three little words: Black Lives Matter. Neither mentioned how so few police officers involved in so many killings of unarmed black Americans have been convicted, charged or even indicted. Instead, what we heard from both candidates is that “working with the police” is a major solution to curbing violent and unjustifiable killings by police. But our criminal justice system is already so biased in favor of police that black Americans live in constant fear of being pulled over precisely because, for far too long, we have indeed worked with the police, and only the police. 6. While the candidates had a welcomed debate over New York City’s now-illegal “stop-and-frisk” program, with Trump blatantly exposing his ignorance on the matter, what did not get mentioned was the ongoing practice of racial profiling nationwide. Racial profiling, at the heart of stop-and-frisk, is technically unconstitutional, but it persists throughout the country, deeply affecting the quality of life for people of color, especially African-Americans. Clinton’s mention of “implicit bias” came close to the issue but ultimately skirted it. 7. During the discussion of cybersecurity, which fixated on Russia’s espionage attempts, no mention was made of the National Security Agency’s unparalleled invasion of Americans’ privacy. As Edward Snowden’s revelations have shown, the U.S. has destroyed all semblance of the right to privacy in the name of cybersecurity. Halfhearted attempts at legislating curbs on mass surveillance have failed or stalled. 8. When discussing foreign policy (under the popular guise of “national security”), Trump made one brief mention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that seemed to have little bearing on the conversation. Other than that, there was no mention of Israel or the recent approval of an unprecedented aid package to Israel—a veritable gift of U.S. taxpayer dollars—in an amount larger than any nation has ever been promised. The military aid, in the form of sophisticated weaponry, will be used against Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. It is hardly surprising that the word “Palestinians” and “Palestine” did not feature at all during Monday night’s discourse. 9. While there was much focus on Islamic State, mostly in terms of who was responsible for its rise, no substantive discussion emerged on whether bombing Iraq and northern Syria will destroy Islamic State or cause it to proliferate. Discussion of President Obama’s expanded drone wars, which fuel much of Islamic State’s rage, also was absent. After all, drone strikes are at the forefront of our not-so-secret secret war. Both candidates also failed to mention that U.S. policies in the Middle East are driving the largest global refugee crisis in modern history. 10. Finally, there was no mention of the wars we have fueled in our own hemisphere, in countries whose refugees have arrived on our doorstep. Clinton’s role in Central America was easy fodder for Trump, but he stayed away from it because it would mean admitting that Central American children, whom Clinton has said she wanted to deport, are human beings driven by desperation to migrate northward through no fault of their own. Clinton’s role in the coup in Honduras that unleashed horrific violence in that country did not come up, even as she touted her credentials as secretary of state. Too many issues that are far too important remain invisible during our presidential election debates. It is no wonder that elections seem less and less relevant. © 2016 TruthDig Sonali Kolhatkar Sonali Kolhatkar is the host and executive producer of Uprising, a daily radio program at KPFK Pacifica Radio, soon to be on Free Speech TV (click here for the campaign to televise Uprising).

During a status conference in closed quarters on Thursday, Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Michael Toto set the next court date in the case against Kevin Roper for Nov. 9, MyCentralJersey.com reported. Roper, who lives in Georgia, was driving a truck for Wal-Mart on June 7, 2014 when he allegedly crashed into a limousine van transporting Morgan, Jimmy McNair and other friends of Morgan's down the New Jersey Turnpike in Cranbury. McNair was killed in the crash. Fellow comedians Ardie Fuqua, Harris Stanton and Morgan's assistant Jeff Millea were injured, as well as Morgan, who sustained broken bones and head injuries. Authorities said Roper slammed into slower moving traffic ahead of his rig, crashing into the rear of Morgan's van and causing a chain reaction that involved four other vehicles, including another tractor-trailer. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board determined Roper was speeding and had worked 13 hours straight before the crash. And a report by the New Jersey State Police indicated Roper had not slept for more than 25 hours before the accident. Roper pleaded not guilty in February to charges of aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and eight counts of aggravated assault. Morgan settled his lawsuit against Wal-Mart for an undisclosed sum in 2015. McNair's children were reportedly received a $10 million settle from Wal-Mart in 2015 for the crash that killed their father. Rob Spahr may be reached at rspahr@njadvancemedia.com.

Robert Hardister, from Stuart, Florida, US, has been arrested plenty of times –  but police still have trouble keeping up with his ever-changing face. Palm Beach Sheriff's Office 5 Robert Hardister latest mugshot after he was arrested for allegedly stealing a truck One of his earliest mugshots, in 2009 when he was just 18, shows a fresh-faced Hardister with floppy hair and not an ink in sight. But after being arrested multiple times over the years, each mugshot would boast a brand new tattoo. His latest snap shows there is little room for anymore work. The 25-year-old is behind bars yet again – this time police found him asleep in a stolen truck in a WalMart car park on Friday morning. Palm Beach Sheriff's Office 5 The 18-year-old’s first mugshot in 2009 shows him fresh-faced without a tattoo in sight (left) and every time he was back at the police station, he would boast a new tat (right) Palm Beach Sheriff's Office 5 He added a teardrop and bleached his hair in 2013 (left) before adding multiple inkings later for his next mug (right) Palm Beach Post reported Hardister told police he’d actually borrowed the 1998 black Ford F-150 from a friend to move furniture to his new apartment and had even paid him $20 (£15). Hardister said he didn’t know the truck was stolen, but police still charged him with vehicle theft.

If photos from previous bookings in the Palm Beach County Jail are an indication, Hardister appears to have got most of the facial ink since February two years ago when he was arrested by Tequesta police for an out of town warrant. In that mugshot, Hardister sports only a tear drop under his right eye and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. Then, a year later when arrested on a fraud charge, Hardister had added a tattoo to the left side of his neck.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Personal Finance Media & Advertising Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Costco Wins on Lower Fees to Visa ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More (Reuters) Costco Wins on Lower Fees to Visa Published September 30, 2016 Industries Reuters Facebook Twitter Print Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it benefited from paying lower fees to credit card partner Visa and shoppers spent more on appliances, electronics and hardware. Continue Reading Below The lower payments helped offset falling prices of grocery and fresh food in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a post-earnings call. Margins at grocery retailers have taken a hit due to lower prices and companies such as Wal-Mart and Dollar General further cutting prices to win market share. Costco completed the switch to Visa from American Express during the fourth quarter. The retailer is also likely to have benefited from higher fees from new credit card sign-ups, Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell wrote in a pre-earnings note. Consumer spending in the United states rose 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The bump in spending is likely to have helped Costco, which mainly caters to high-income customers. Net income rose to $779 million, or $1.77 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 28, from $767 million, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.73 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The retailer reported a 2 percent rise in quarterly sales to $35.73 billion. For the fourth quarter, it also reported a 1 percent drop in sales at U.S. stores open more than a year. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at U.S. comparable stores rose 2 percent. Shares of the company rose 2.1 percent after the bell. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had fallen 8.7 percent compared to a 15.4 percent rise in Wal-Mart's shares.   (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Alan Bates in the State Senate. DeBoer was quoted as saying, "We're going to get a lot of money from upstate." That makes total sense because DeBoer is the candidate of big corporate money. When corporate special interests like Walmart, Monsanto or Bank of America want subsidies and special tax breaks, he would be their voice. Tonia Moro is a working woman who will be our voice — the voice of teachers, nurses, firefighters, farmers and everyone else who works for a living. She's been a community leader for schools, more affordable housing, clean energy jobs and access to transportation. She's been a lawyer for small businesses and for people without great wealth. That's the kind of state senator we need. Lynn Kunstman Medford A bargain There is a bargain on the ballot this year. Measure 15-164, supporting the creation of the Rogue Valley Heritage District, gives voters the opportunity to benefit both the economy and quality of life in our region. This low-cost investment, less than $8 per year for the average property, provides stable funding and assures that the valuable collections of virtually every historical society in the county will be protected and remain available to the public, supporting education in our schools, tourism, the arts and more. Our heritage is important in Southern Oregon, and this is a reasonable and entirely affordable request. For less than the cost of two cups of coffee or a theater ticket, we can assure that our history is safe for the future. Please join me in voting yes on Measure 15-164 and help to support our shared heritage. George Kramer Ashland The opioid epidemic You are to be commended for your articles on the opioid epidemic. The 165,000 Americans who have died from opioid overdoses (78 daily lately) represent more deaths than all the deaths we suffered in the Korean, Vietnamese, Afghan and Iraq wars combined, yet most Americans are unaware of what is happening. Blame must be ascribed, at least in part, to the medical/pharmaceutical/FDA-DEA complex. Big Pharma pockets big profits from opioid drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, while employing hundreds of lobbyists and millions of dollars to weaken regulations on the sale of these dangerous drugs. At the same time the Drug Enforcement Agency has refused to recognized the (proven) effectiveness of marijuana in treating pain and other medical conditions, thereby denying Americans completely safe (there has never been an overdose death from marijuana) relief from pain. It's not possible to enumerate how many lives would have been saved if pain-relieving marijuana was legalized, but it surely is in the tens of thousands. Thus, our government has been (and continues to be) complicit in more deaths of its own citizens than are Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad in the gassing of their own citizens.
