Family sues Lake Hallie Officer shot, killed woman last spring after she swung hatchet around shoppers at Walmart posted March 25, 2017 12:00 a.m. | updated March 25, 2017 9:26 p.m. (CDT) email article print font size - + by / Chris Vetter. bio | email Leader-Telegram staff Staff file photo by Pamela Powers | Enlarge - Lake Hallie police respond on April 8 to Walmart, 2786 Commercial Blvd. An officer shot and killed a woman as she charged at him with a hatchet, according to an investigation. The woman’s family has filed a lawsuit against the village. CHIPPEWA FALLS — The family of a 25-year-old woman who was shot and killed last April by a police officer at the Lake Hallie Walmart store has filed a lawsuit against the village, the police department, Northern Wisconsin Center and several insurance companies. Melissa Abbott was a resident at Northern Wisconsin Center, a state-operated facility for persons with disabilities and mental diseases. On April 8, Abbott was at Walmart, 2786 Commercial Blvd., when she began swinging a hatchet around other shoppers in the store. The Chippewa County dispatch center received a call at 5:11 p.m. about a “disorderly female who refused to leave the store.” Lake Hallie police Officer Adam Meyers arrived at the scene. Meyers shot twice, striking Abbott in the leg and abdomen. Abbott was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died. In May, then-District Attorney Steve Gibbs issued a 12-page ruling, saying that Meyers “acted in self-defense and that his belief that he reasonably believed his life was in danger, or that he was likely to suffer great bodily harm, when Ms. Abbott refused to follow orders and charged officer Meyers with a hatchet.” Gibbs concluded his report by stating the evidence clearly showed the shooting was self-defense, and there is no reason “to establish a basis to charge officer Meyers with a crime.” The lawsuit, filed by River Falls attorney Dean Rohde, disagrees with Gibbs’ assessment of the incident. Rohde wrote that Meyers’ conduct and actions were “excessive and unreasonable, without lawful justification or reason, and was designed to and did cause specific and serious physical harm, pain and suffering and death.” He added that her death was caused by “the negligence of the village of Lake Hallie and/​or its agents and employees.” Rohde filed the lawsuit earlier this week in Chippewa County Court, seeking a 12-person jury to hear the case. Rohde is requesting a jury award punitive damages, that Lake Hallie, the police department, and Northern Wisconsin Center “provide necessary training, personnel and resources to adequately protect the constitutional rights of citizens and patients of the Northern Wisconsin Center,” and that the defendants pay all attorney fees and other associated costs. The defendants have 45 days to respond to the lawsuit. The case has been assigned to Judge James Isaacson. Lake Hallie village President Wayne Walkoviak didn’t return calls for comment. The lawsuit is specifically filed against Lake Hallie, ABC Insurance Co., the Lake Hallie Police Department, Officer Meyers, DEF Insurance Co., Northern Wisconsin Center and its director Jacqueline Neurohr, GHI Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores. Abbott was living at Northern Wisconsin Center on the east side of Chippewa Falls. Gibbs’ report includes interviews with workers at the facility who had accompanied Abbott on the trip to Walmart. Several other shoppers and Walmart employees also were interviewed. Abbot has threatened to kill the staff at Excel Treatment Center and wrote in her journal a desire that “when the cops get called I will grab their gun and there will be a shootout between me and the cops.” Meyers, who has been employed as a Lake Hallie police officer since Oct. 8, 2008, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which is standard protocol.

Adds byline, Adds AP photo. SAN FRANCISCO -- An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube _ an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,'' Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year.

Councilman Kahlil Seren The venerable Turtle Park in Cleveland Heights will be getting an upgrade in May. Tom Jewell/Special to cleveland.com  CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio -- The City Board of Control convened in rare session March 20 to deny an after-the-fact request from Walmart to continue to use its closed store as a warehouse. City officials learned earlier this year that Walmart had been storing fixtures at its former Severance Town Center location, although it was not clear how long this had been going on under the radar. "But they never had approval to be there, and now they're going to have to rent a new place to store fixtures," which came from Parma and Bentonville, Ark., said City Planning Director Richard Wong.  Walmart left Cleveland Heights in late 2013, when it opened a new Supercenter on the South Euclid side of a former golf course that straddles both cities' borders. The city's five-member Board of Control administers zoning ordinance regulations in S-1 Mixed Use District, of which there is only one in Cleveland Heights -- centered around the Severance Town Center. Wong said there may be some possibly delinquent local income taxes under review as well. In other business at Monday's regular meeting, City Council extended the deadline for filing applications on 100 percent residential tax exemptions in the expanded Severance Community Reinvestment Area. The previous deadline was last July, which will now be extended out to mid-2023 for townhouses and residential dwelling units. Asked by Councilman Kahlil Seren why the legislation needed to be passed on an emergency basis, Wong explained that there's actually a March 31 deadline to get the paperwork filed with the state. Council also heard from John Zagara, board president of the Cedar-Lee Special Improvement District, where a $3.5 million streetscape project will wrap up this spring. The SID drafted six recommendations to the city, the first half of which merchants would like to see implemented by June 30: -- Completion of "Phase 2" of the smartphone parking apps technology, affixing stickers to each parking meter in the city's surface lots. -- Installation of additional security cameras, north of Cedar to Cain Park. -- Addition of one more foot patrolman for the Cedar-Lee SID on the weekends between 4 p.m. and 1 a.m., as well as an additional patrol car to cruise the district and the adjoining side streets. By the end of the year, merchants want more commercial code enforcement, as well as more aggressive promotion through the city on social media. And looking at the first half of next year, the Cedar-Lee SID wants to see movement on the city-owned parcel between Meadowbrook Boulevard and Tullamore Road. This could include reapplying to the American Institute of Architects for a design competition among recent graduates, based on Cleveland Heights' position as an inner-ring suburb, as well as its proximity to University Circle. Also, the Community Center hosted the annual St. Baldrick's Foundation head-shaving event on March 19, raising over $132,000 for childhood cancer research -- well over the $111,000 goal. Spokeswoman Krissy Dietrich Gallagher, the mother of a two-time cancer survivor, said that 212 people had their heads shaved this year. She thanked barbers from Quintana's, Shawn Paul Salon and Abstract for their work toward the cause, noting that the event has raised about $550,000 over the last six years. Council also approved a contract of just over $66,000 for purchase and installation of new playground equipment, shading and seating in Turtle Park, tucked into the corner of Euclid Heights Boulevard and Overlook Road. Parents have been advised to remove all personal belongings from the 5-and-under playground before work starts in May. Funding was already approved in the 2017 city capital budget.

(Image source: KMPH-TV/Facebook) 74 Follow Share Tweet Three men described by media sources as “cowboys” rode into a Walmart in Texas, where security guards reportedly did nothing more than stare in shock. Woody Fields and two others rode into the store, located in Houston, on Sunday, videotaping themselves as they trotted past dozens of confused-looking shoppers. The video was quickly picked up by KMPH-TV, which aired it on its television news program, helping the video go viral. It has now been viewed more than 4 million times. Fox News reported Walmart issued a statement condemning the cowboys’ actions, which, not surprisingly, are against the store’s policy. “We in no way condone yesterday’s reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions,” Walmart’s statement said. Fox News also reported the ride was condemned by the Houston Humane Society, which called the act “incredibly irresponsible.” “At minimum, riding a horse inside a store is incredibly irresponsible,” the Houston Humane Society said. “This would be extremely stressful on any horse.” Share Tweet Rate this story 78% 5% 1% 4% 11% Recommended from the Web Other Must-Read Stories 74 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

Here are three that investors should bet on in 2017. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Mar 25, 2017 at 12:00PM The retail industry is going through a major disruption, with e-commerce reaching critical mass and forcing even the most successful brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt. Already we've seen some bankruptcies, including RadioShack, hhgregg, and Sports Authority, and companies like Sears Holdings are knocking on death's door. Buying retail stocks amid this carnage is a delicate task, to say the least. There are a few retailers, however, that have bucked the trend. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) is investing in both its stores and e-commerce, driving growth across the board. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is getting more efficient, slashing costs and delivering impressive profit growth. And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is proving that its business is about as Amazon-proof as it gets. Here's why these three retailers are the top picks for 2017. A retail juggernaut Wal-Mart dominated the era of big-box discount stores, driving countless competitors out of business with its low prices. Amazon is now dominating the era of e-commerce, at least so far, putting every brick-and-mortar retailer at risk. Competing with Amazon will be neither easy nor cheap, but Wal-Mart is finally taking the threat seriously. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's stores are, somewhat surprisingly, doing just fine in the age of e-commerce. Comparable-store sales have risen in the U.S. each quarter for the past few years, driven in part by investments the company has made in its stores, including higher wages and better training for employees. While other retailers were struggling to attract customers during the holiday quarter, Wal-Mart managed a 1.8% increase in U.S. comparable sales, driven almost entirely by an increase in traffic. The stores also provide a platform for Wal-Mart's online grocery pickup service, where customers order online and pick up for free at a store, with delivery available for an additional fee. This service, along with Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com last year, led to a 29% increase in online sales during the fourth quarter. Going forward, the recent move to offer free two-day shipping for all orders above $35, which dealt a blow to the value proposition offered by Amazon Prime, should help Wal-Mart maintain its e-commerce momentum. All of these investments are taking a toll on the bottom line. Wal-Mart expects to produce EPS between $4.20 and $4.40 this year, down at the midpoint compared to last year and substantially below peak earnings in 2014. But the cost of ignoring the threat posed by Amazon would be far higher in the long run. After dominating traditional discount retailing for decades, Wal-Mart is positioning itself to be a major force in e-commerce as well. Surviving and thriving Since 2012, Best Buy has staged an impressive turnaround. Unnecessary costs were slashed, with layers of management removed and efficiencies wrung out of the supply chain. Investments in e-commerce have led to booming online sales, driven by both increased web traffic and higher conversion rates. U.S. online sales jumped 17.5% year over year during the fourth quarter, with a larger 20.8% gain registered for the full year. Most importantly for investors, profits have soared. Adjusted EPS surged 28% during 2016 on a slight decline in total sales, driven by a higher gross margin and lower operating costs. Best Buy has become more competitive on price during its turnaround, but its gross margin is now not too far below historical levels. At the same time, the company has become far more efficient, spending just 19.2% of revenue on operating costs in 2016. That compares to 20.5% in 2010. Further earnings growth will be tougher to achieve, as there is a limit to Best Buy's cost-cutting efforts. Results last year were hurt by product availability issues, recalls like that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, and a general lack of exciting new products, but Best Buy still managed to drive earnings higher. Trading at just 10 times earnings after backing out the net cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy is one of the best deals in retail. Amazon-proof While some retailers have done better than others in the age of Amazon, Home Depot is firing on all cylinders. Revenue has grown consistently since 2009, jumping 6.9% in 2016 largely thanks to a 5.6% increase in comparable sales. Home Depot's operating margin last year was an impressive 14.2%, nearly double its operating margin in 2009. Based on this performance, it should be no surprise that the stock has nearly tripled over the past five years. HD data by YCharts. Selling large appliances, power tools, fixtures, outdoor furniture, lumber, and other products that don't translate well online, Home Depot has been able put up record numbers despite the ongoing consumer shift toward e-commerce. Home Depot isn't ignoring e-commerce, with online sales jumping 19% in 2016 and representing 5.9% of total revenue. But its stores are driving a big part of that growth, with 45% of all online orders being picked up by customers. Home Depot's stellar performance doesn't come cheap for investors. The stock trades for about 23 times earnings, a lofty valuation for a retailer with nearly $100 billion in annual sales. Still, the company's record over the past few years, and its potential to grow earnings going forward, may be enough to justify the price tag. Home Depot certainly isn't a stock for bargain hunters, but it is a good choice for those wanting to invest in one of the best retailers around. Timothy Green owns shares of Best Buy.

PepsiCo Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Starbucks Corp on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen AG and other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads do not appear alongside unsavory videos. It is not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos, because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted on Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they will not return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo Inc and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party Web sites. If Google cannot lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of US dollars in revenue. However, most analysts doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue last year totaled US$73.5 billion after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for US$5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted that the backlash would not last long, because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by British newspaper the Times revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. Alphabet shares on Friday fell US$4.51 to close at US$835.14. This story has been viewed 2441 times. Comments will be moderated.

Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ——— AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story.     Tags: youtube, google, videos, friday, their, google, Other stories from today: More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Disney CEO: ‘Last Jedi’ not changed due to Fisher’s death Apple: Software flaws in latest WikiLeaks docs are all fixed     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Do you think San Mateo County cities should do more to ensure there are sufficient and affordable child care spaces?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 March 2017 by Military News Why Buying Stocks on Margin is Usually a Bad Bet It may be tempting to buy stocks on margin as a way to magnify your returns, but doing so exposes your portfolio to extra risk, and can cost you thousands of dollars in interest on your brokerage account. In this segment of Industry Focus: Financials , The Motley Fool’s Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen respond to a listener’s query about the pros and cons of investing on margin, and explain why margin is usually better avoided, particularly if your broker charges a high fee to leverage your portfolio. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This podcast was recorded on March 20, 2017. Gaby Lapera:  „I have a question about trading on margin. I just opened a brokerage account and I’m building a portfolio of high-quality stocks that I intend to hold for the long-term. I’m wondering if there’s a way to invest Foolishly using margin. For example, I’m making monthly contributions to my account and adding to my positions, keeping my transaction costs under 2%, but I don’t always have cash on hand to make my purchases, so I end up using margin. Does it make sense to maintain a margin position as my portfolio grows? The interest rate is only 1%, and I’m hoping my returns will continue to exceed that hurdle. If I plan on holding my investments for the long term, the interest will be constantly adding to my margin position, and I will grow and grow at an accelerating rate over time.” First off, I did send this listener a set of articles about trading on margin, and I’m happy to send those to you if you write to industryfocus@fool.com  and ask for them. Jordan, I know that you and I have very similar risk-averse personalities. I’m going to say what I said to this guy, which is that I cannot give you personal advice — I know I’m harping on this, but as always, I need you guys to know that. But, this is how I personally feel. I am a very risk-averse person, and trading on margin makes me very, very, very nervous. So, I would never personally trade on margin, but you have to decide what’s best for you. What would you say, Jordan? Jordan Wathen: I’m going to be a bit of a hypocrite, because I’ve short-sold things before, and that’s inherently on margin, and exposes you to unlimited risk. But, truthfully, if you’re going to manage a constantly long portfolio and you’re going to use margin, it sounds like, to me, „Is it OK to use heroin one day a week, or every day of the week?” I’m never going to advise it, it’s so dangerous. It looks so lucrative, especially when stocks are going up. If I just doubled my portfolio value by leveraging it, it would be fantastic, but … Lapera: Wait, actually, that reminds me: Can you explain what trading on margin is, real quick? Wathen: Trading on margin is basically using the broker’s borrowed money. You’re borrowing money from a broker to buy stocks, and you pay interest on the margin. So, if you borrow $10,000 to buy stocks at a retail broker, they might charge you 4% interest on that every year, or $400 a year. Lapera: Yeah. And that’s great, as long as the stocks are going up, if you’re not shorting. But the problem is, if you’re shorting a stock in particular — and that’s when most people trade on margin, as opposed to our friend David — there’s potential for unlimited amounts of loss. I don’t know if you remember this, Jordan, do you remember the guy who shorted KaloBios  on margin? Wathen: I did. It’s a good lesson on why you should never short a biotech company. Lapera: Yeah. This guy, what was it, a year ago? Wathen: It was about a year ago. Lapera: He shorted this company called KaloBios, and it was something like $3, and then it went up to $17 when he wasn’t looking, and he lost an absurd amount of money. I think it was like $100,000. That’s crazy. What he did was start a GoFundMe to help pay off a debt to his brokerage. Which is funny in and of itself. He’s like, „I don’t understand why the brokerage didn’t tell me this could happen.” They do. It’s just in the fine print. Wathen: Right. And that’s a problem. They give you a 27-page contract. Everyone goes through it and signs their digital signature and then moves on with life. I can really categorize this into two basic ideas that say as a general rule, it’s not good to use margin. The big one is that margin is not like a mortgage. If you go buy a house with a mortgage and the house drops 50%, the bank can’t just show up, knock on the door, and say, „Hey, you owe us a ton of money.” That’s exactly how margin loans work, because it’s mark-to-market every single day. If the stock you buy with margin goes down, you have to come up with money or you have to close it out. You might have to sell at a price you would never dream of selling a stock at, which is the No. 1 „oops, don’t want to be part of that.” The second one is, you’re paying so much in general to borrow money from a broker that you’re giving up a lot of the upside, but the downside is still 100% yours. If the stock moves against you, that’s all your loss. If it moves up and that’s gravy, you’re still paying interest. You have a scenario where you get less than 100% of the upside, and 100% of the downside. It’s not a great deal, conceptually. Lapera: Yeah, definitely. There’s a difference between shorting, which you do on margin, and investing on margin. I want to make that clear for listeners. But when a stock loses out, the most you can lose is 100% if you’re trading normally. Like I said, if you’re shorting, you can lose the way more than that. But if you’re trading on margin, you’re still on the hook for the amount of money that you borrowed, plus whatever you’ve lost in the stock itself. And I wanted to follow up on how that turned out for the listener who emailed me. And I know when we first talked about this, you were like, „Man, 1%, that’s really cheap for trading on margin.” But he wrote back after I responded and told me he had misread the fine print on the margin interest rate. He thought it was 1%, but it was actually 1% above the base rate of 8% percent. He says, „Needless to say that I won’t be using margin going forward because I’m not confident in exceeding a 9% hurdle rate with my returns.” Wathen: Yeah, that’s just massive. And truthfully, if you go to any retail broker, I don’t think there’s a single one even at $3 million of account equity that’ll give you money at 1%. They just won’t. Benchmark interest rates are 0.5%, why lend to Joe Blow on margin? You just don’t. That’s the thing. It’s really hard to beat the benchmark at most retail brokers. And either way, it doesn’t matter. Even if you didn’t have to, I would just say, it’s OK, just leave a little money off the table to not expose yourself to such massive losses. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .

An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after The Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing, even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video are now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising purposes. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have also said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.61 -0.25 -0.36% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 845.61 -1.77 -0.21% Macy's Inc M ▼ 28.17 -0.10 -0.35% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▼ 168.66 -1.23 -0.72% In recent months, Walmart has purchased a number of trendy, online retailers, including hip fashion brand ModCloth, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and shoe store ShoeBuy. These brands' wares are very different from the apparel stereotypically sold by Walmart, which is better known for its low prices than fashion innovation. ModCloth's dresses typically cost from around $60 to $150; Walmart's dresses are usually priced between $10 and $25. "The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a call with analysts in February. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart ModCloth The addition of more "upscale" merchandise demonstrates the changes that the discount retailer has been forced to make as the number of potential middle-class customers plummet. Between 2000 and 2014, middle-class populations decreased in 95% of the 229 metropolitan areas reviewed in a Pew Research Center study. In an economically-divided America, Walmart has begun working to sell not only to shoppers looking for extreme discounts, but also to upper-income shoppers seeking higher-quality items. Walmart has been working to grow sales from more affluent customers for years, especially when it comes to e-commerce. "The nature of e-commerce, the nature of the Neighborhood Markets and other things we’re doing do create an opportunity for us to be even more relevant to customers that are at the higher end of the scale," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting in October 2015, reported Fortune.

However, the retailer has a long way to go until it catches up with rival Amazon — especially as the e-commerce giant expands its own apparel offerings. Amazon is predicted to exceed Macy's as the biggest apparel seller in America this year. Prior to Walmart's recent acquisitions of trendy ecommerce brands, Amazon similarly ventured into more high-end fashion, selling products by designers such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. Walmart's market value is now $298 billion, compared to Amazon's $356 billion. In February, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold off $900 million of its Walmart stock, the last of Buffett's shares in the company, after saying in 2016 that Amazon's competitors had not figured out a way to counter the e-commerce company.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:March 25, 2017 9:29 am PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube. (Source: AP) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Posted: Friday, March 24, 2017 12:15 pm More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Associated Press | 0 comments SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement.

SHARE Your Town, March 26, 2017 By Tammy Gemaehlich Saturday, March 25, 2017 An ode to Kmart. My dear friend … we go way back. We met in the summer of 1980. I was new in town and lived a few blocks away. I had just started my new job in The Daily Sentinel circulation department and needed some office attire, on a very limited budget. You were nearby and had exactly what I needed, thus began a long, enduring friendship. A Gibson’s store was catty-corner from you, in the Red Cliff Pointe Shopping Center, where PartyLand was and now dental offices reside. Gibson’s later moved across the street to the spot where Hobby Lobby was and soon a Planet Fitness will open there. The former Hastings was a Safeway in 1980. Believe it or not, there was a McDonald’s in that parking lot too. Directly eastward was a Furr’s Cafeteria with its long dinner lines snaking out the door. The fried okra was to die for. It’s now A Taste of Heaven Catering. Walmart had only been invented a few years prior and was still a mostly Southern state attraction. In 1980, the now North Avenue Walmart property was a popular drive-in movie theater. During the years I’ve been in Grand Junction, Kmart, you’ve always been there. I pass you every day on the way to work. So much merchandise … so little time. We bought our patio table from you a few years back and overnight, the back yard transformed into a blissful retreat where we listen to chirping birds while sipping morning coffee, and star-gaze in the evenings as a concert of crickets serenades us. My garden frog statue, bought with accumulated Rewards points, greets me when I come up the walk, and you wouldn’t believe the compliments I get when I wear the cardigan I got on clearance a few years ago. This past Christmas, I visited you for some new winter pajamas, and I noticed something was off. Way off. There was so much inventory, carelessly piled about, and I began to wonder if … no! Not you! When official word of your closing came in January, it was a big blow. I’ve tried to visit every few weeks since the news broke but each time I leave, discounted goods in hand, my heart feels heavier. Today is your last day, old friend, and I grieve the ending of our brick-and-mortar friendship. May your blue light never fade. Thanks for the memories. ■ Speaking of memories ... the Montrose High School class of 1967 will have its 50-year reunion Aug. 25-27 in Montrose.

Echele uses a wheelchair and has been a greeter at Walmart for 25 years. Firefighters say he’s expressed a great deal of interest in firefighting.  That prompted several of the firefighters to coordinate a surprise with the store’s managers.  They arrived at the Eureka Walmart and made Echele an honorary firefighter, taking him on a ride. “This was amazing,” said Echelle.  “I was shocked.” He was joined on the truck by his mother.  The two were moved to tears over the invitation by firefighters.  The truck traveled to Echele’s neighborhood where he was greeted by some of this neighbors. “I’ve been a fan of the fire service ever since I was a kid and never really outgrew it,” said Echele.  “So, to be able to meet and interact with all these guys is amazing.” “It means a lot to us too,” said Lt. Steve McKinney, Eureka Fire Protection District.  “It’s very important for us to have community members like him backing the Eureka Fire District.” Firefighters say Echele has routinely expressed support for them.  They told him he was welcome to visit their fire station anytime he wants.

The so-called Store No. 8 will be located in Silicon Valley and marks the latest attempt by the company’s new head of e-commerce operations Marc Lore to speed up innovation at the company. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, brought over Lore, founder of Jet.com, when the discounter bought the online retailer last year for more than $3 billion and has been on an acquisition binge since then. The incubator lab’s mission will be to house new startups that will run independently from the company. It will hatch, invest in and team up with entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists to create proprietary technology.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK  — Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is “substantial doubt” it will be able to keep its doors open. It’s a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. The Toledo area has eight Sears stores — one each in Bowling Green, Bryan, Holland (outlet store), Lima, Norwalk, Toledo (Westgate area), and Van Wert in Ohio and Adrian in Michigan. There are four Kmart stores in the Toledo area — on each in Fostoria, Oregon, and Toledo (Alexis Road), and in Monroe. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. “I bought my tools from Sears and I’ve still got them,” Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It’s a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it’s been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent today. Sears tried to soothe investors’ fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it’s highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. “They’re past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.‘s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. “When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,” said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store today. “We still have some of those.” Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. “They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. “It has a lot of good memories,” he said. “It stands for being dependable and reliable.” Related Items Target Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Sears Holdings Corp Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

(tns) Saturday, March 25th, 2017 at 10:12am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........LAS CRUCES — Las Cruces Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information that helps identify the couple suspected of stealing the purse from the shopping cart of an 80-year-old woman, according to the Las Cruces Police Department. Police said an 80-year-old woman was shopping at Walmart, 571 Walton Blvd., when she had her purse stolen from a shopping cart. The incident occurred about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, police said. Surveillance video from the store shows that a couple — a man and woman — followed the 80-year-old woman throughout the store, according to police. At some point, the man distracted the 80-year-old shopper while his accomplice grabbed the purse from her shopping cart. Police said the couple fled the store and left the parking lot in a dark-color car, possibly a station wagon or PT Cruiser with faux-wood trim panels on its sides. Among other items, the victim’s purse contained cash and bank cards, police said. Later that day, the couple used one of the woman’s bank cards to withdraw cash from Citizens Bank, 2511 E. Lohman Ave., police said. Police released images of the suspects with the hopes of identifying them.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 25 March 2017 DFTZ – boom or bane for our local SMEs? by tan thiam hock I NEVER got to know my grandfather. All I know about him was from stories told by my dad. During the fight between the Communist Party and Kuomintang (KMT) from 1927-1949, many Chinese migrated to South-East Asia in search of a new life. And when the Communist Party under Mao Ze Dong defeated and pushed KMT to Taiwan in 1949, the exodus of people mainly from southern China intensified. My grandfather had migrated to Singapore where he ran a lucrative business housing the immigrants and sending them over to Malaya at that time. He had four wives, two in China and two more in Singapore. My grandmother who was the first wife was finally brought over from China when my dad was 10 years old. This must have been around the 1930s and my grandmother and dad was subsequently sent to Paloh, Johor where my dad’s elder sister had settled down with her family. My grandfather eventually passed away as an opium addict in Singapore. After my mom passed away in 1992, I decided to accompany my dad back to his birth place in Yongchun, Fujian. Malaysia Airlines had a twice weekly direct flight to Xiamen and we had a taxi ride on a long and winding journey to our hillside village which took us a good four hours to reach. This road has now been replaced by a super highway which I understand had cut travelling time to under two hours. We visited the once grand mansion that my grandfather had left behind. It had more than 20 rooms with a courtyard in the middle. One of my cousins and his family was occupying the rundown mansion and half the rooms was used to rear ducks, chickens and pigs. Another cousin stayed in the town centre where he had built a three-storey modern house where the ground floor was used as a warehouse to store goods. He had prospered in supplying apparels and knitwear to Hong Kong companies for re-export to US and Europe. When Deng Xiaopeng became the paramount leader of the Communist Party in 1976 after Mao’s death, he started to reform China by introducing socialism and opening China to the world’s market. After 15 years of fighting with his Maoist compatriots, Deng finally won the ideology war and in the early 1990s introduced the concept of a socialist market economy. This was the era of an export driven economy. China through their state enterprises initially went into manufactured goods and subsequently private entrepreneurs were encouraged to join the economic industrial revolution. China had become the largest factory in the world supplying all kinds of manufactured goods to retailers like Walmart in the US and many other retailers in Europe. Middleman like Li & Fung from Hong Kong was the main beneficiary, acting as a go between for the customers in the West and the factories in China, getting a 6% commission fee for being a quality assurance broker. Just imagine Li & Fung handling US$100bil worth of exports from China. With the earnings from the exports, China then started a major internal modernisation reform, building massive infrastructure of roads, bridges, railway lines, airports etc. Property development projects were massive in size and many modern malls were built. Our own Parkson department stores saw the opportunity and expanded swiftly in China culminating in a lucrative listing in Hong Kong. By 2013, China had built massive production capacity in almost every industry. Not only has China built excess production capacity in manufactured goods, the high growth years has resulted in the formation of colossal companies in construction, property development, railways, banking etc. In September 2013, the current supreme leader Xi Jinping announced the One Belt, One Road development strategy which basically competes with the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) in integrating the region into a cohesive economic area through building infrastructure and broadening trade. To fund this expansionary project, China led the formation of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. With a slowing domestic economy, China had to export its excess production capacity in construction, railways, property development etc. As we have witnessed in the last three-four years, many Chinese companies have invested in Malaysia. From ports in Kuantan and Malacca to massive property development projects in Johor, Malacca etc to securing railway contracts for the East Coast Railway and possibly the high speed railway to Singapore. The contractors have brought their own workers, imported China-made sanitary wares and even nails for their own construction projects. Their property development companies like Country Garden have reclaimed four islands in the southern tip of Johor and building almost 20,000 apartments, hotels, schools and medical facilities and this is only like 30% completion. About 90% of the sales have been to Chinese buyers and it looks like Country Garden have built a mini-city for the potential migration of 400,000 Chinese residents. On the commerce retail business in China, the surprise success of Alibaba has been well recorded. For financial year ending March 2016, Top line gross merchandise sale for Alibaba’s group was US$485bil. Alibaba and its companies enjoy a revenue of US$15.7bil which is 3.2% commission margin on sales of US$485bil that was done through their digital marketplace. Alibaba is now the largest retailer in the world if compared to Walmart’s sales of US$482bil. Amazon which trades strictly through their e-commerce website had clocked in at US$100bil in sales revenue. Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba is now the face of China’s push for global free trade through his Electronic World Trade Program. This is in contrast to the new protectionist policies of the Trump administration with the planned introduction of border tax for imports into US. With its low cost production base, China’s manufactured goods have been successfully exported through the traditional distribution channels over the last 30 years. Local importers have sourced from China, importing through our ports, paying relevant import duties as charged by our customs, now selling with an additional GST 6% added to the cost of goods. The importers then sell to wholesalers and retailers creating a value chain of margins to support the distribution channel. Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) Credit must be given to our Prime Minister and Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC) for its efficiency in getting Alibaba to invest in an e-commerce and logistics hub in DFTZ, the first outside China. Located in our former LCCT, it will be Alibaba’s regional warehousing and fulfillment facility for Malaysia and the region. The e-hub with centralised customs clearance is expected to create top line gross merchandise sales of US$65bil by 2025. In a statement on Feb 19, our Second International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Ong Ka Chuan announced that purchase of goods via the Internet or e-commerce worth RM1,200 and below will be exempted from paying tax in the DFTZ. This would mean that Malaysian consumers do not have to pay import duties, if any, or 6% GST. As a free trade zone, manufactured or semi finished goods can be imported into the DFTZ without payment of import duties or GST. This will facilitate re-export to other countries in the region. Who benefits from DFTZ? Malaysian consumers who purchased via e-commerce companies situated in DFTZ as any purchases bought below RM1,200 will be tax free. No import duty and no GST. Malaysia Airports or MAHB as they have finally found a tenant for LCCT, a white elephant since Air Asia moved to KLIA2. Malaysian Inland Revenue for potential tax revenue assuming the Alibaba company in DFTZ is a locally incorporated company but might miss out for some years if pioneer status is given. But if the Alibaba company is incorporated in other countries, then it will be difficult for our tax authorities to collect income tax as foreign incorporated companies is outside its jurisdiction. The same philosophy applies to including the sales value of USD 65 billion into our national GDP numbers. Only statistics from our local companies are included as GDP output. Logistic companies, freight forwarders and Malaysian Airlines assuming Cainiao Network, Alibaba’s logistic arm leases cargo planes from MAS. But then again, Cainiao like Amazon might decide to buy its own cargo planes. Malaysian youths as the DFTZ project is expected to provide 60,000 new jobs. Local SME’s increasing their exports via the DFTZ e-commerce gateway. That is assuming our manufactured goods are relevant and cost competitive vs the manufactured goods from China. Most unlikely. Currently, production cost in China is at least 20-30% lower. In addition, can our local companies claim back the GST portion when they sell to Alibaba DFTZ? If not, our Malaysian products will have a 6% tax disadvantage vs the tax free imported Chinese products. Alibaba DFTZ as they have an open freeway to disrupt the local distribution channels of wholesalers and retailers via tax free advantages. For B2C e-commerce, purchases in Malaysia is less than RM500 per transaction which suits Tao Bao (Alibaba B2C) just fine. In addition, Alibaba runs a B2B marketplace where the tax free threshold of RM1,200 per transaction is more applicable. A big order can be divided into smaller transactions to ensure tax free purchases. Alibaba is a sure winner with this unparalleled tax free advantage. Losers from DFTZ? Depending on the manufactured products brought in from China, our importers, wholesalers, retailers, manufacturers and e-commerce SME’s will be badly disrupted due to lower cost products and tax free, GST free imports. It definitely will be an uneven playing field for our local SME’s. Our authorities should note that we have 200,000 retail outlets in Malaysia and the retail industry hires 1.2 million workers. Even if the DFTZ model disrupts 30% of our commerce retail business, we will lose 360,000 jobs and close down 60,000 outlets. And that is not counting the disrupted manufacturing industry. Customs Revenue. Assuming 30% of the US$65bil DFTZ sales is imported into Malaysia. Collection of GST alone will be lower by US$1.2bil or RM5bil a year. Not counting those items that still attract import duties. Our National GDP will actually shrink as the whole market will trade on lower prices. DFTZ – entrepreneur beware! Comparable advantage in production cost have been a zero sum game for competing nations. With so much excess capacity for almost any product in the world right now, the nation that has the lowest cost of production will always win. And the nation that is least competitive will lose market share. In world trade, most nations that are nor competitive will adopt a protectionist stance in defense of its local industries. The Malaysian authorities should weigh the cost benefits of the DFTZ carefully and ensure that it does not create an irreversible uneven playing field for our local SMEs. Be realistic and pragmatic as you review the capabilities of our SME against the factory of the world. Much as I like and admire Jack Ma for his brilliance in e-commerce Initiatives, I am wary that this could be a Chinese conspiracy to dump their excess manufacturing capacity on our doorsteps. Local entrepreneurs are advised to go on high alert when more details on DFTZ becomes available. Study the proposals carefully and try to figure out if any advantages given to DFTZ players will affect your livelihood. If it does, start looking for alternative businesses that will not be disrupted. Chinese winter is coming. Stay warm always.

Starbucks and Walmart join growing list of advertisers boycotting YouTube Read more In the US, the telecom companies AT&T and Verizon, as well as the pharmaceutical company GSK, Pepsi, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and the car rental firm Enterprise, have all pulled advertising from Google’s video-sharing platform, a contagion spreading from Europe, where a number of high-profile advertisers pulled out of YouTube following an investigation by the Times. Major brands’ content was found to be appearing next to videos promoting extremist views or hate speech, with a cut of the advertising spend going to the creators. Verizon’s ads were featured alongside videos made by Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim, who was banned from the US over extremism, and the hate preacher Hanif Qureshi, whose preachings were said to have inspired the murder of a politician in Pakistan. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” an AT&T spokesman said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate AT&T spokesman Following the exodus of some of its high-profile advertisers, Google has publicly apologized and pledged to give brands more control over where their ads appear. “This marks a turning point for YouTube. For the first time, it’s dealing not only with reputation damage but revenue damage,” said Alex Krasodomski-Jones, a researcher at the thinktank Demos. YouTube might purport to be a video-sharing service, but as with Google’s search engine and Facebook’s social network, the platform is really about one thing: advertising. “So when there’s a problem with advertising like this, it’s a big problem,” Krasodomski-Jones said. The row highlights an uncomfortable fact about advertising in a digital age: most brands don’t know exactly where their online advertising is running. Black box machines are now largely responsible for the placement of ads online, using complex trading systems that try to get the right message in front of the right person at the right time for the the cheapest possible price. This process is called programmatic advertising. When an ad appears against a piece of content, it’s not always clear whether it’s been shown based on a person’s previous browsing behavior, interests, or demographic data or because the brand is affiliated with a particular content creator, such as a YouTube star. “There has always been good placements of ads and bad placements of ads and media buying companies have always prided themselves on trying to get the context right,” said Charlie Crowe, chairman of the media and marketing publisher C Squared. “The difference in the online world is that it’s all done by an algorithm. The human element is taken out of the equation, so there are problems. “Programmatic advertising has been largely fraudulent since its inception, and there are many companies in the marketplace including Google to have made vast profits out of the naivety of the advertisers, who haven’t really known what they’ve been buying.” The dispute adds weight to demands for companies such as Google to take more responsibility for what is on their websites, as Facebook was forced to do in the wake of the “fake news” scandal. YouTube already provides “brand safety” controls for advertisers, allowing them to pick what types of videos they are happy to be associated with based on keywords. The platform also advises creators about the types of videos not considered “advertiser friendly”, including content that’s sexually suggestive, violent or dealing with a controversial subject matter. However, with 400 hours of video uploaded to the platform each minute, it’s a challenge to keep unpalatable content completely quarantined from paying customers. Fifteen minutes of browsing YouTube by the Guardian was enough to find T-Mobile ads on videos about abortion, Minecraft banners on videos about snorting cocaine and pre-roll ads for Novartis heart medication running on clips titled “Feminism is cancer”. YouTube and Google boycott spreads to US as AT&T and Verizon pull ads Read more “They need to get better at the management of what is brand-safe and what isn’t,” said Gabe Winslow, of the digital marketing agency Ansira. Advertisers and agencies also have a responsibility to audit their campaigns to ensure that their ads appear in the desired location, he said. This squabble is indicative of growing tensions between the advertising industry and technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become indispensable partners and, in some cases, competitors. Silicon Valley technology companies completely dominate the online advertising market. According to a 2016 study, Facebook and Google accounted for 90% of the growth in the online advertising industry. All other online media companies are competing for the scraps. The more powerful they become at the expense of traditional media companies, the harder it has become for advertisers to negotiate favourable terms. The current YouTube boycott offers some leverage for demanding better, independently verified data and controls. “There’s increasing resentment among agencies and publishers [towards Google] that’s difficult to talk about given its sheer power,” Crowe said. “This issue has given them a sense of schadenfreude.” Topics Google The Observer YouTube Advertising AT&T Verizon Communications Internet news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Fake tube sign read out on BBC News and in Commons after Westminster attack Sign with defiant message for terrorists goes viral and is commended in parliament – but is an online fake Published: 23 Mar 2017 Fake tube sign read out on BBC News and in Commons after Westminster attack 'Disputed by multiple fact-checkers': Facebook rolls out new alert to combat fake news Feature – which flags content as ‘disputed’ – trialled on story that falsely claimed thousands of Irish people were brought to the US as slaves Published: 21 Mar 2017 'Disputed by multiple fact-checkers': Facebook rolls out new alert to combat fake news Google to overhaul advertising policies after growing boycott ‘We deeply apologise,’ says company’s CBO Philipp Schindler as he announces tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content Published: 21 Mar 2017 Google to overhaul advertising policies after growing boycott Google ad controversy: what the row is all about What is programmatic advertising, how does it work and why did big brands appear next to inappropriate material?

Carmelina Santana, 42, West Hazleton, was apprehended by state police at Hazleton alongside Magisterial District Judge James Dixon’s office. They charged her with retail theft and resisting arrest and she was released on $5,000 unsecured bail set by Magisterial District Judge Rick Cronauer, Wilkes-Barre, on March 17. When troopers found her at Dixon’s office around 4:30 a.m. they ordered her to stop and put up her hands but she ran away, arrest papers state, and two troopers pursued her on foot while two others followed in a vehicle for a short distance. She was eventually apprehended and restrained by all four troopers, according to court papers. A store loss prevention worker told troopers he saw her take about $135 worth of home linens like bath towels and sheets from Wal-Mart without paying for them, troopers wrote. As she was searched at the police barracks, Santana continued to resist and made derogatory remarks to officers, arrest papers state. Man steals fabric softener, cops say A Tamaqua man stole fabric softener from a borough store Thursday. Renado Natal, 40, faces a count of retail theft by Tamaqua police and was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, who released him on his own recognizance. Arrest papers state the theft took place at Dollar General, 1213 E. Broad St., and the $4.19 item was retrieved by the store. Tamaqua burglar charged, jailed A Tamaqua man took items from a home in the borough, according to court records. Russell Nelson, 36, was charged with burglary and criminal trespass, felonies, and theft and receiving stolen property, misdemeanors, by Tamaqua police. He was arraigned March 18 by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, who set bail at $10,000 and unable to post the money, he was taken to jail. Arrest papers state Nelson took items totaling $1,250 from 242 Van Gelder St., Tamaqua, on March 4 just before 11 a.m. Man charged with harassing his ex A Plymouth man who refused to stop contacting a Butler Township woman faces criminal charges. Cory Bonczewski, 28, was charged by Butler Township police with harassment. The charge was filed March 8. The victim, arrest papers state, told police her ex-boyfriend, Bonczewski, contacted her at least 42 times between January and March, via telephone and social media, after she told him to stop.

In those bins you will find straight-to-video movies like “American Pie Presents: Band Camp,” or “American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile,” or “The Lion King 1 ¹/₂.” If you dig deep enough, however, you can often find classic movies like “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Road House,” “School Ties” “Howard the Duck” or “No Holds Barred.” (Hey, if you can honestly look at the cover of that 1989 Hulk Hogan classic without smiling and can resist purchasing it, you’re not human). It is no different when searching for fantasy pitchers to round out your rotation. Sometimes, you just have to reach in and dig deep to find what you’re looking for. In Ivan Nova’s seven years with the Yankees, he went 53-39 with a 4.41 ERA, 1.388 WHIP and 543 strikeouts (6.7 per nine innings). They’re not the worst numbers, but they certainly don’t jump off the page, screaming, “I belong on your fantasy squad.” There are several reasons why Nova, who landed in Pittsburgh last season, is an attractive late-round selection this year, with the main reason being his price. According to FantasyPros, Nova has an average draft position of 283.7 and an average auction price of $1. At those prices, it pays to make a play for him. Why? Well, yes, most pitchers are more attractive in the NL than they are in the AL, but the simplest answer is this: pitching coach Ray Searage. The Pirates’ pitching guru has made a name for himself in recent years for his success with reclamation projects like Francisco Liriano, J.A. Happ, A.J. Burnett and Edinson Volquez. Though it was a short sample size, Nova was spectacular after moving from The Bronx to the Steel City. After allowing 2.3 walks per nine innings while going 7-6 with a 4.90 ERA, 75 strikeouts and a 1.356 WHIP in 21 outings with the Yankees, Nova was dealt to Pittsburgh where he quickly became a viable fantasy option. The 30-year-old righty went 5-2 with a 3.06 ERA, 1.098 WHIP, a crazy 52:3 strikeout-to-walk ratio and a 2.62 FIP, which indicates he was slightly unlucky in his 11 starts with the Pirates. He never has been a big strikeout pitcher, but he struck out 19.8 percent of the batters he faced (his highest percentage since 2013). It is unlikely he will maintain the same walk rate, but Nova signed a three-year deal with Pittsburgh this offseason, so he not only gets to stay in the NL, but he gets to stay with Searage — both of which should work to his advantage on the mound, and yours in the fantasy world. Here are some other late-round starting pitcher bargains: James Paxton’s (167.3, $5) record (6-7) and ERA (3.79) were nothing to write home about last season, but his velocity was up (from 95 mph in 2014 to 97 last year), he walked a career-low 1.8 per nine innings, struck out a career-high 8.7 per nine and had a 2.80 FIP. This could be a breakout season for the lefty in Seattle. Mariners starter Drew SmylyAP Coming off his worst season in the majors, Drew Smyly (200.3, $1) finds himself with the Mariners in pitcher-friendly Safeco Park and a solid buy-low option. He limits walks (2.5 per nine innings), has great strikeout potential and a solid strand rate. The Diamondbacks’ Robbie Ray (231.5, $2) may be 14-31 with a 4.65 ERA for his career, including his 8-15 record and 4.90 ERA from last season, but don’t pay attention to those numbers. He struck out 218 (11.3 per nine innings), had a 3.76 FIP and 3.45 xFIP, so his overall numbers don’t tell the entire story. Target him late. If the Rays’ Blake Snell (248.7, $1) can gain some control (he walked 5.1 per nine innings over 19 starts last season), he could be in for a big year. He throws hard (93.5 mph) and can strike out batters (9.9 per nine innings) with regularity. Ervin Santana (283.7, $1) may be 34-years-old, but he still managed to get the job done last season on a miserable Twins team. Though his 7-11 record left much to be desired, he went 6-4 with a 2.41 ERA, .213 opponent average and 100 strikeouts over his past 18 starts. He can provide solid depth as a back-end starter.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Villeneuve, Melissa on March 25, 2017. Melissa Villeneuve Lethbridge Herald mvilleneuve@lethbridgeherald.com A little extra cash is going to make a big difference for the Interfaith Food Bank Society of Lethbridge. For years, Interfaith has had to juggle resources whenever a truck makes a food delivery. When Interfaith first purchased the building, there was a loading dock in the back. “But we haven’t been able to use it all this time because the leveller was gone, and all the equipment that goes with it had been removed by the previous owners,” said executive director Danielle McIntyre. They had to rely on one man, who was trained to run the forklift, to unload a truck parked outside. And if he was out on a call and a truck showed up, he would have to stop what he was doing and return to the building. “So for years we’ve been hoping that one day we would get the money it would take to upgrade the dock so it could be fully functioning for us,” said McIntyre. They’ve received $20,224 to upgrade the loading dock, with a retail capacity building grant through the Walmart Foundation’s support of Food Banks Canada. The grant was part of a greater $2-million donation from the Walmart Foundation to Food Banks Canada. The Foundation later kicked in another $2.6 million. “I’m exceptionally grateful to Walmart and to Food Banks Canada right now,” she said. “It’s going to make a huge improvement to our facility and allow us to really support not just our families, but families throughout southern Alberta.” They are now installing a hydraulic dock leveller, bumpers and a dock seal. It may be a few weeks still before the upgrades are complete. Once they are, it will mean trucks can now back into the loading dock and be offloaded inside the building. It also means more volunteers will be able to assist when a delivery comes. “Not every volunteer has the ability to hop on the forklift for us. It allows us to maximize our resources and accept the trucks whenever they can come,” said McIntyre. Interfaith Food Bank processes about 70,000 pounds of food per month. With a new loading dock, they’ll be able to accept a lot more, she said. “Having the ability to accept more loads means we can process more food to get it out to more families.” Interfaith Food Bank has been partnering in a pilot project with the Food Bank Alberta’s Food Share system to be a “hub” for southern Alberta. Smaller rural food banks in the area can get food stocks through Lethbridge, as opposed to paying for truckloads to come from Calgary or Edmonton. “It’s a means for us to move more food around to more food banks and more food bank families,” said McIntyre. Food banks in smaller communities such as Coaldale are typically “one-room operations,” she said. “They don’t have the space to accept a truckload or the budget to pay for the transportation on a full truck. By us having a big facility here, with proper infrastructure to accept these loads, then the smaller guys can come in and access stuff through the Food Share system.” Follow @MelissaVHerald on Twitter 000000 You have 7 free stories left to read this month.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish joined an already impressive list of companies that have pulled their ads from the search giant over concerns the Silicon Valley giant isn’t able to ensure their ads will not pop up on unsavory sites or be attached to scummy videos. Google said it was stepping up its efforts to protect the brands. However, it might not be happening as quickly or be as effective as the advertisers had hoped. The four companies said they were suspending their ads on YouTube and on Google’s ad exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported that some ads were still being placed against anti-Semitic content. Other advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors and FX Networks, said they were suspending their various activities with Google. Google has been ratcheting up its game — hiring more people and talking with advertisers about its efforts — to prevent ads appearing in objectionable content. The Friday exodus comes after a week of nonstop negative press that was kicked off by a March 17 Times of London report that resulted in an entire ad agency holding company yanking ads for all of its clients. Walmart, in a statement, said, “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values.” Google parent Alphabet has seen its market cap shrink by about $26 billion in a week. Its shares have fallen 4.5 percent since March 17, to $814.43 on Friday. Alphabet was downgraded on Monday by Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research which warned that unless Google could say its systems are foolproof it would continue to suffer from the fallout. Google has said it is retooling its video verification process and introducing new artificial intelligence in response to the problem. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, Google added it would create a new hot line manned by humans. The WSJ found ads from Google’s own YouTube Red subscription service running on racist videos containing the “n—–” in the title. The ads are served up typically as part of automated or programmatic ad programs that deliver traffic to advertisers from across the web. Some marketers put filters to screen out blacklisted Web sites.

By Jacob Thorpe jacobt@spokesman.com(509) 710-8070 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Related topics Gonzaga faces red-hot Xavier with Final Four spot on the line John Blanchette: There is no monkey – Gonzaga, Mark Few are legit Gonzaga, Xavier share many traits, including no football teams to share spotlight Xavier’s shifting defenses present a challenge for Gonzaga NCAA Tournament At SAP Center, San Jose, California Saturday, March 25: Gonzaga Bulldogs vs. Xavier Musketeers, 3:09 p.m. TV: TBS Online: March Madness Live SAN JOSE, Calif. – Allen Payne stood in a Cincinnati Wal-Mart, staring at the pink container decorated with green flowers and thought, “This is supposed to hold dead people?” The Xavier graduate assistant had been dispatched on the errand by head coach Chris Mack, who had a notion that his team needed an urn to house the ashes of a February the Musketeers would happily lay to rest. Payne settled on a glass jar that Musketeers call an urn and Mack brought it to a meeting before practice. Xavier was five games into a six-game losing streak that Mack wants to make sure you know was a “brutal strech” in which team had to play No. 1 seed Villanova, three road games against NCAA Tournament teams and then Elite Eight participant Butler at home. Xavier was without leading scorer Trevon Bluiett for three of those games, not to mention second-leading scorer Edmond Sumner, who suffered a season-ending injury on Jan. 29. The Musketeers were still clinging to NCAA Tournament hopes, but something had to change and fast. So Mack brought out a calendar of the month of February (technically the final loss in the streak came on March 1) and asked each player to write a secret thing they would be willing to sacrifice so the team would start winning games again. J.P. Macura wrote that he would turn the ball over less, sacrificing a carefree style of play so his team could maintain possession. Quentin Goodin sacrificed his time, pledging to be in the gym more often working on his game and to spend more hours off the court with his teammates, working on those relationships. And Malcolm Bernard wrote that he would give up whatever his team needed to win, be it sacrificing his body by diving for loose balls or shooting less so that his teammates could score more. Then Mack put the calendar in a trash can and burned it. When it was over, the ashes were scooped up and placed in the almost urn. “The symbolism is not to worry about what’s behind us, but to focus on moving forward, control what we can,” Mack said. “We’ve tried to keep that urn either at the scorer’s table during practice when the players walk in the locker room, on the locker room floor.” It was not an entirely smooth immolation. The calendar burned slow and the fire had to be restarted at one point. The calendar took so long to burn, in fact, that the Musketeers had to leave it smoldering so they could go practice. And there is a mark on the floor that can serve as a reminder to future teams. “It went through the trash can and burned the carpet,” Macura said.

Digital Trends Home > Deals > Take pictures in 4K with the Panasonic Lumix… Take pictures in 4K with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K, now $560 from Walmart By Lucas Coll — March 24, 2017 1:03 PM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you’re in the market for a compact digital camera, Walmart has the high-end Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K on offer for a 30 percent discount, which brings the price down to $560. The DMC-LX100K shoots photos and video in 4K Ultra HD and earned the Reader’s Choice Award from Digital Photography Review in 2014 with reviewers naming it the best high-end compact digital camera released that year. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K packs a cropped 13-megapixel Four Thirds sensor which lets this little camera punch well above its weight when it comes to power and image quality. The 24-75mm F1.7-2.8 Leica DC lens provides a shallow depth of field and makes it easy to achieve artistic bokeh effects which create a defocused blur around the subject of your photo. The eye-level 2,764-dot Live View Finder ensures picture stability and color clarity, while the Eye Sensor AF and Depth from Defocus functions rapidly focus the lens for quick point-and-shoot photo-taking in virtually any environment. More: Panasonic’s LX100 is a 4K pocket rocket with the heart of a bigger camera Along with still photographs, the DMC-LX100K can record up to 15 minutes of continuous 4K Ultra HD video and can take pictures or film in three different aspect ratios — 16:9, 4:3, or 3:2 — with a quick adjustment of the lens barrel. Video can also be recorded in 1080p for up to 30 minutes if desired. Manually operated rings and dials for adjusting zoom, focus, aperture, exposure, and shutter speed give you precise control of your photography. The camera features a 3-inch 921k-dot rear monitor on the backside and comes with an external flash attachment. The current lowest price from other retailers for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100K is around $700 but the sleek black model is available from Walmart for just $560 for a limited time. For professional and hobbyist photographers alike who are looking for a digital 4K camera that can fit in a pocket, the DMC-LX100K packs big power in a small 4.5-inch package. Buy it from Walmart for $560

The company's shares slid more than 12% in afternoon trading Friday. GameStop reported a 13.6% drop in global sales to $3.05 billion compared to a year ago. The company blamed weak sales of certain blockbuster games during the holiday period and "aggressive console promotions" from its competitors. The company saw a 29% drop in new hardware sales while new software sales fell by 20%. GameStop's struggles with video game sales come as the company faces increased competition from competitors such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. In addition, more players are purchasing games online, whether for traditional consoles or for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. While video game sales fell, Gamestop reported a 44% sales increase in its Technology Brands business, which includes cellphone retailers such as Spring Mobile. The company's Collectibles business also saw growth of 28% due to strong interest in Pokémon merchandise. Another possible boon for the company is the release of the Nintendo Switch, which GameStop indicates has continued to sell out since launch. The company also expressed enthusiasm for Microsoft's upcoming Project Scopio console. While the company intends to close the doors of some of its video game stores, GameStop plans to open 65 Technology Brands stores and 35 Collectibles stores this year.

"A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering more big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant," reports the Dow Jones Newswire. Reporters from the Wall Street Journal spotted ads from Microsoft, Amazon, and Procter & Gamble appearing on hate videos -- and thus indirectly funding them. An anonymous reader quotes their report: Asked about the Journal's finding that their ads were still appearing with such content on YouTube as of Thursday night, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dish Network Corp. said Friday they were suspending spending on all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks Corp. and General Motors Co. said they were pulling their ads from YouTube. FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox Inc., said it was suspending all advertising spending on Google, including search ads and YouTube. Wal-Mart said: "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values." An executive at one of the affected companies complained that Google "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content. Despite their assurances, it's clear they couldn't give assurance." google youtube advertising ← Related Links → SAS Mocked For Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source YouTube Says Content Owners Made $1B Last Year -- So Music Labels Should Stop Complaining Google To Revamp Policies, Hire Staff After UK Ad Scandal YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Terrifying Anti-Riot Vehicle Created To Quash Any Urban Disturbance Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos More | Reply Login Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

YouTube is not removing these videos, it is simply preventing adverts from these companies from appearing next to them. That generally means that the content creator can't earn revenue through YouTube any more, but the videos are not being censored or removed. This has actually been happening for ages due to copyright issues. For example, a lot of Mario players on Twitch also post clips to YouTube, but they can't be monetized because Nintendo won't allow it and will file copyright claims if you try to. So they make their money from Twitch and Patreon and merchandise, rather than YouTube ads. Sucks but you can't really force advertisers to give you money.

Washington Center. It is for young people from age 15 to 25 who are looking for jobs. Many prospective employers were represented at the event, including Walmart, Country Fair, Splash Lagoon, and educational institutions like Edinboro and Mercyhurst Universities and Triangle Tech. There were also orientation classes and mock interviews to teach young people how to prepare for an interview. "My thought is if you keep the kids busy, you'll keep them out of trouble," said Sonya Arrington, MATV founder. "By providing them with a job, it not only helps them, but it helps the household. It will also teach them responsibility and giving back to the community. Whatever I can do to help these kids stay out of trouble, that's what I try to do it." In all, 15 vendors were there. Some students were hired on the spot, especially for summer jobs.

Here we’ll explore each factor and its impact on keyword value. Let’s get to it! The 3 Components To Keyword Research Component #1: Search Volume How often is your keyword searched? Valuable keywords are frequently searched. The greater the search volume, the more traffic the keyword can bring. Use Google’s Keyword Planner to estimate search volume. Enter your target keyword, its variations, plurals, and other related keywords. Estimate the amount of traffic your site would get if you ranked for each keyword and its variations. If you target “denver chairs” you’re also targeting “chairs denver”, “chairs in denver,” and maybe even “denver chairs store.” Why? These searches yield similar search engine results. With one web page, you can target multiple related keywords if they fall under a single topic. Include all variations and document your search volumes in a table. Target Keyword Search Volume Notes Chairs Chairs - 110,000 Seats - 33,100 Note: When you search Google for “chairs” you find nothing for “seats.” For this reason, don’t include “seats” in your search volume. Chairs Denver Chairs Denver - 10 Denver chair - 40 Include all variations! Barstools Denver Bar stools Denver - 480 Denver barstools - 30 Apparently “bar stools” is more frequently searched than “barstools.” Sofa Denver Sofa Denver - 210 Denver sofa - 70 Now that we’ve got an idea of search frequency, let’s move on to component #2. Component #2: Competition Which domains rank for your target keyword? If your competition is Wikipedia, Best Buy, and WalMart, your chances for success are slim to none. Compare your domain authority using MozBar (it’s free) with websites that rank on the first page for your keyword. When you activate the MozBar plugin, search Google for your keyword, and the search engine results page (SERP) will look like this. Is there room for your domain? If your website’s domain authority is 5, don’t target keywords that are dominated by websites with domain authorities in the 80’s and 90’s. Find something in your range. Note: When gauging competition, check their title tags. If the competition doesn’t have a title tag that matches or closely relates to your target keyword, there is space for your content. Don’t mistake this for a sure ranking, but note this search isn’t as heavily targeted as other search terms. Now we have a better understanding of our keyword targets... Keyword Search Volume Competition Chairs 110,000 Very High Chairs Denver 50 Medium Barstools Denver 510 Low Sofa Denver 280 Low Component #3: Relevance For obvious reasons, your target keyword must relate to your business. Here are some questions to consider. ● How well-aligned is your keyword with your target audience? ● Is the person searching your keyword ready to buy? ● How much would this customer benefit you? Is the nature of their search broad and topical? Or is it specifically related to your product or service? ● Are they searching for your most expensive item? Or a low-cost service? Answers to these questions can help you gauge your keyword’s relevance. Here’s how we gauged the relevance for each of our original keywords. Keyword Search Volume Competition Relevance Chairs 110,000 Very High High Chairs Denver 10 Medium Very High Barstools Denver 480 Low Very High Sofa Denver 210 Low Very High Keyword Research And Content Prioritization Now that we’ve considered each attribute, let’s prioritize our keywords and content. The priority estimation draws from each component: search volume, competition, and relevance. Keyword Priority Estimation Explanation Chairs 1/10 Competition is way too high. As a store with several locations, you can’t compete with Target, Overstock, and Wayfair Chairs Denver 5/10 Search volume is low, but consider local results. Google this keyphrase and you’ll find local results front-and-center. Local results are fed by Google My Business. If you haven’t already, create/beef up your listing. Barstools Denver 9/10 There’s a lot of opportunity here! A solid number of searches, low competition, and high relevancy. Make sure you have a webpage on your site that targets this keyword! If you have your products online (which you should!) incorporate these keywords into your title tag. Sofa Denver 8/10 More opportunity! Beware, however, this SERP currently has one domain in the top 3 spots. Multiple domains on the same SERP are grouped together. Given the current state of the SERP, the highest you could get is #4, unless you jump this domain to the #1 spot. How To Create A Content Schedule Create a content schedule with target keywords for each piece of content. Use the attributes and notes discussed in this article. Gauge the potential value and competition of your keywords, and use this gauge as a benchmark to prioritize your content. Let this guide your organic search campaigns. It’s easy to get sidetracked with ideas that sound good, but for organic search growth, they must pass the logic test. Other Influencing Factors Remember, quality content alone doesn’t necessarily translate to content marketing success. It’s a huge factor, but consider these others... Link Profile Websites need links to rank. Not every page needs a plethora of links to rank, but in most cases a website’s domain needs links to rank. Keyword Niche Websites that publish numerous pieces of quality content on the same topic are often looked as a “trusted source” for that topic. This can affect keyword ranking. SERP Landscape Certain searches lend themselves to different results. Local searches often display local results ported over from Google My Business listings. Some searches contain Google AdWords ads, leaving fewer clicks to organic search results. Conclusion The most important ranking factors are your content and your links. Test each of your target keywords with each of the three components listed in this guide. Such planning will put you well on your way to successful content marketing and website growth.

(Aaron Lynett/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Man wanted in stepson’s death fled 2,000 kilometres before arrest: police Add to ... Paola Loriggio ST. CATHARINES, Ont. — The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 2:20PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 5:58PM EDT Comments closed Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he’d once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested, police said Wednesday. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nationwide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy’s death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the bank employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer’s arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. “It’s because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday,” he said at a press conference. Outside a St. Catharines sandwich shop owned by Nathan’s grandparents, flowers and stuffed animals formed a makeshift memorial for the slain boy. Residents walking by expressed rage at the attacks and relief that a suspect had been caught. Ken Chipman, who was walking his dog near the school Nathan attended a short drive away, said news of the attacks had left him “really upset.” “I thought it was horrible,” he said, adding he was glad the search for Kuijer was over. McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer’s alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation. Police were first summoned to a RBC branch in St. Catharines on Friday morning after reports of an assault. Officers found an employee suffering from stab wounds, he said. McGuire confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, had worked with Kuijer on financial matters in the past. Witnesses reported seeing Kuijer fleeing the scene in a dark grey van, which enabled police to connect the attack at the bank to another call they were fielding at essentially the same time, he said. Across town, in a home above the family’s sandwich shop, police said a relative discovered that Nathan had been critically injured. The boy was rushed to hospital with undisclosed injuries and died the next morning. Police learned that the van in which Kuijer allegedly fled the bank was registered to the address where Nathan was found. McGuire said the dual attacks had a wide-ranging impact across St. Catharines, a small city in the heart of Ontario’s wine country. He read a note from a staff member at the school Nathan attended which outlined the grief experienced by staff, parents and fellow students. Another anecdote from McGuire highlighted the national scope of the hunt for Kuijer. “One of the detectives answered the phone, and it was two officers sitting on the side of the TransCanada Highway in Alberta to say they that they’re out looking for our man,” he said. McGuire said Nathan’s mother and the RBC victim were “elated” at news of Kuijer’s arrest, but were asking to have their privacy respected in the wake of the attacks. The bank employee remains in hospital but is expected to make a full recovery, he added. Kuijer will be returned to the Niagara region on Wednesday in advance of a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. The next day, Nathan’s family plans to lay the boy to rest at a funeral in neighbouring Thorold, Ont. “Nathan was truly a kind, loving boy with a big heart, full of compassion for everyone and everything. He was always quick to help anyone who may have been in need,” reads an obituary for the boy. “As the polite young gentleman he was, he never missed an opportunity to open a door, give a gift or come to the defence of a good friend. Nathan truly felt the joy of giving, never looking for anything in return. There are no words to express the unbearable heartbreak we feel in his loss.” Nathan is survived by his mother and younger siblings, the obituary states, adding that his little brother looked up to him as a “best buddy” while his baby sister will be told growing up “what an amazing big brother she had” — with files from Michelle McQuigge in Toronto.

Both the progressive pro-immigrant and right-wing anti-immigration parties and movements propose easy answers and attack their adversaries with political invective. Both left and right engage in a losing war, based on historical omissions, abstract and muddle-headed assumptions and destructive proposals. I will proceed by outlining a framework to understand the political, economic and security implications, which form the centerpiece for confronting immigration. The Past and the Present A serious discussion of immigration begins by focusing on the centrality of time and place, encouraging the flow and absorption of immigrants. In the past, immigration flourished during periods when countries experienced: (1) rapid productive growth; (2)increasing labor demand; (3) trade unions and organizations capable of integrating new (immigrant) workers and protecting the on-going wage rates and conditions for all; (4) cross sectoral labor co-operation and solidarity lowering conflict between immigrant and native workers; (5) inclusive, equitable welfare programs; (6) local, not global wars and (7) violence confined outside of the US and the EU. During these periods, most immigration was confined within Europe and North America or between them. These conditions could not eliminate competition and conflict but they limited its nature and time frame and allowed for successful integration. If these conditions formed the basis for relatively peaceful immigration, their absence has intensified conflict amidst an increased flow of immigrants. This process has produced deep political problems. Progressives, who cite past ‘Ellis-Island’ type immigration experience and ignore the unfavorable current socio-economic conditions, are in denial. They dismiss the vast socio-economic and political changes, which have occurred and which make the absorption of new waves of immigrants extremely difficult. Mass Immigration and Imperial Wars The vast majority of refugees today are on the move because of Western wars. These wars are ‘total’ wars, designed to obliterate civilian, as well as military institutions and structures. In the last two decades, the US and EU have launched seven wars devastating the lives of once-cohesive and productive families, their homes and farms, jobs, institutions and security. Millions have been driven into exile. The vast majority of new immigrants are refugees from countries targeted by the US-EU and their suffering has no visible end. During and after the Second World War, refugees suffered greatly, but were generally absorbed or repatriated and integrated into re-constructing their homes and societies. These favorable transitions were aided by an acute post-war labor shortage (over 40 million, mostly men, were killed in WWII) and the economic demands of post-war reconstruction. Western peace movements in the post-WWII past were effective and succeeded in limiting the scope and length of wars. Such peace movements no longer exist. Wars today are designed to be endless and total – in terms of the destruction of civilian infrastructure and national institutions. Over the past 2 decades, the peace movements have disappeared. This is largely because the US and EU increasingly rely on the use of devastating bombing campaigns by their air and naval forces, which sharply limit Western casualties. Most anti-war movements were sustained by domestic anger at their own soldiers returning in ‘body bags’. Current domestic economic conditions have sharply deteriorated. Capitalist regimes have imposed brutal economic policies increasing unemployment and low paying temporary job. Joblessness approaches 50% among young workers in Southern Europe – regions flooded with desperate refugees. Moreover imperial policies have shifted steadily to increased military spending for wars while imposing austerity measures, slashing social programs at home. In this context, new immigrants, especially refugees from imperial wars, compete for diminishing public resources and drastically reduced wages. Their competition effectively drives down the wages for all workers – sharply increasing the conditions for brutal exploitation. The intense competition over jobs between native workers and immigrants is the result of capitalist wars and deliberate domestic economic policies to pay for these wars. This creates greater insecurity and hastens the downward mobility experienced by workers and the lower middle class. In the past, such pressures and conditions led to workers protest, resistance and class conflict. Today, trade unions cease to unify old and new workers into a strong organized force to confront the worst excesses of capital. Trade union membership has declined precipitously. The union bosses have exchanged militancy and independence for self-serving alliances with capitalist politicians. Trade unions do not protect the basic interests of workers and their families – they follow the lead of the ‘progressive’ pro-immigrant parties which are an arm of the militarist capitalist ruling class. The workers are not racist when they resist further deterioration in their income and living standards: They are trying to protect their jobs, benefits and social programs for their families – in an environment of increasing insecurity and capitalist exploitation. In the recent past, workers could rely on stable jobs and increasing wages because of the strong manufacturing domestic economy. These same workers, who are now labelled as ‘racist’, generally accepted immigrant workers at their plants and in their neighborhoods and schools. But this was in the decades before droves of refugees and destitute immigrants fleeing US-EU wars and destruction came to be viewed as threats to their livelihoods and children’s future. Unlike the past, when international capital brought extracted raw materials back to the imperial country to be processed by local manufacturers, today US and EU multi-nationals have relocated their industries to overseas low wage countries, undermining jobs and living standards at home. Commercial importers and retailers, like Wal-Mart, re-employ the displaced workers with offers of minimum pay, no benefits and contingent work. ‘Free Trade’ is not really ‘trade: Rather it is the easy outflow of investment and jobs and the retention of profits overseas in tax-havens. US government-subsidized, high-tech corporate agro-exports have decimated ‘Third World’ farmers, forcing mass immigration of displaced peasants who then form a base to compete with domestic workers and lower the wages in the US and EU. Progressives falsely argue, ‘ex post facto’, that migrant have merely taken the poorly-paid, unpleasant jobs that local workers rejected. The reality is more complex: In a previous era, most immigrants quickly moved into decently-paid jobs and were generally accepted by US workers. Once, US meat packers were well-paid workers supported by militant unions. Over time, the unions lost key labor struggles and capitalists reduced wages, in some cases by fifty percent. What had once been well regulated and strictly protected workplaces deteriorated dramatically. This decline was accompanied by the influx and hiring of low wage immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Today, the meat packing industry is among the most dangerous work environment where even immigrant children are employed. The same pattern of deteriorating wages and conditions and replacement by immigrant labor has occurred in landscaping, construction, the garment industry, transport, retailing, plumbing etc. What has most recently pushed millions of young workers to migrate from their homes are the series of destructive imperial wars. These devastated the domestic security situation, erasing any functional national military and police structures as well as the possibilities for jobs and a stable future for young people. Former military commanders and soldiers, whose families have been torn apart by imperial US-EU wars and stripped of all dignity, have little choice but to join resistance fighters, such as ISIS in Iraq, or join the waves of refugees. The US and EU invasion forces and puppet regimes have systematically destroyed any secular, democratic, nationalist or socialist parties and movements in the targeted countries, in their drive to divide once cohesive nations into tribal client states. In their place, violent Islamist and ethnic resistance movements have sprung up to fight the invaders and their puppets. This is the natural and predictable result of the imperial policy of destroying modern states on a massive scale. Since multiple imperial wars in contiguous countries have destroyed all hope for refuge and new lives within the war-torn region, the new violent Islamist movements have adopted their own ‘international strategy’. Since the imperial wars were launched from distant imperial capitals in Washington, London and Paris, using bombs and missiles, the Islamists have little alternative but to base their military and terrorist strategies within civilian populations, leading to massive casualties. The violent jihadi attacks against civilian targets in the West are not specifically religious or directed at capturing economic resources or power. The objective is to gain political influence among the growing and marginalized immigrant population in Europe and to undermine the capacity and willingness of the EU and US to continue these endless wars. In the neglected immigrant neighborhood, there will be growing numbers of sympathizers for the ‘attackers’. This will increase demands by angry and frightened citizens in the West who have increasingly accepted the nationalist political solution of ‘draining the lake’ (immigrants) to catch the ‘fish’ (terrorists). Anti-immigrant politics and anti-terrorist police activities become inter-mingled with growing domestic economic insecurity and the sense of cultural and national displacement experienced by traditional homogeneous working class communities adjacent to large enclaves of immigrants. Increasingly severe ‘austerity’ policies, imposed by neo-liberal governments, greatly inflame the situation. The so-called, liberal pro-immigration parties and movements ignore the fragile socio-cultural fabric of the local communities. They have done little to protect vulnerable communities from capitalist policies of literally dumping immigrants into areas and regions which cannot support or absorb them. The political leaders of pro-immigrant parties are generally far from these communities and immune to growing competition for scarce jobs and resources. For many politicians, bureaucrats and even NGO administrators, ‘their immigrants’ are domestic workers, cooks, baby sitters, gardeners, who directly serve the most comfortable strata of society. In contrast, the masses of uprooted refugees and immigrants live close to local workers, compete for jobs and share crowded clinics, social services and schools – under conditions of increasing scarcity. The ruling class collaborates with highly domesticated trade union officials and certain ‘coopted’ second generation immigrant leaders to ‘pacify’ this domestic discontent through multi-cultural programs and mandatory diversity training sessions for workers and neighborhoods, without ever having to actually confront the class issues of deteriorating living standards and the loss of future job prospects for the children of local workers. Working and lower middle class communities will naturally close ranks on ethnic, regional and religious bases, because they lack principled class leaders. They are susceptible to the appeals of nationalist-populist or anti-immigrant leaders and politicians, despite these parties long association with the hard right. With the notable exception of French leader, Marine Le Pen, who skillfully combines a deep understanding of French socio-economic trends with her restrictive immigration policies, the majority of Western populist and anti-immigrant politicians channel the widespread resentment over downward mobility among native workers to blaming ‘the immigrants’. The virulent media attacks and charges of ‘racism’ made by liberal politicians and intellectuals against the downwardly mobile workers, who have been devastated by neo-liberal policies and the broad consequences of imperial wars, do nothing to combat imperialism and class exploitation. They certainly do not help the immigrants. Denunciations of the marginalized American workers and rural citizens, who voted for US President Donald Trump, by the middle class intellectuals, living in the more comfortable and urbanized coastal states, show a deep misunderstanding of the fundamental changes occurring in the country. In Europe and the US, employees and activists, connected to liberal NGOs, flock to immigrants like carrion birds, carving out their own little careers ‘educating’ immigrants and entreating the local residents of deteriorated neighborhoods to join in ‘sharing’ the dominant ruling class-directed celebrations of ‘diversity’ ( or the ‘multi-culturalism of suffering’). Conclusion Immigration in the 21st century is significantly different from past waves of migrants. It is highly manipulative to compare the current displacement of millions of war refugees with ‘Ellis Island’ in the US or the post-WWII situation of massive reconstruction in Europe. Immigration today is a direct product of imperial wars, where murder, injury, terror and deliberate shredding of social institutions have forcibly displaced tens of millions of people – the immigrants. Meanwhile, in the imperial countries, crass capitalist exploitation, the export of capital and jobs, and austerity have aroused the anger of workers and lower middle class employees, whose living standards have sustained significant losses. The forced merger of two enormous waves – the millions of dispossessed refugees and migrants and the marginalized and increasingly threatened workers and citizens in the West has become the key focus of the deepening conflicts of capitalists and workers in the US and the EU. Progressives and reactionaries alike obfuscate the fundamental class issues by diverting public attention to the issue of ‘racism’ and ‘immigrants’. In the long run, the West must face this dangerous phenomenon by organizing broad and militant anti-imperial peace movements to prevent the wars that produce these waves of desperate migrants. Trade unions, co-operatives and local or national social movements must organize the under-employed, unemployed and underpaid workers to combat the loss of jobs, the pillage of national wealth, massive capitalist tax evasion and the de-industrialization of the national economy. Banks must be nationalized, and education and health care should be publically funded and replace the current massive public budgets for war. Immigrants, who decide to settle in their new countries, should seek to fully integrate, reject dual citizenship and dual loyalties and denounce organizations that act as “fifth columns” for overseas ethno-religious states of all persuasions. Uprooted people must ultimately choose to remain and fight over flight. They must engage in resistance to imperial occupations in their homelands instead of choosing abject submission and indignities abroad. The role of citizens in the West is to support these struggles by opposing the militarists among their own political leaders. There are no easy answers for mass migration but there are clear causes and proposals for the future.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 25, 2017 at 12:35PM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) will never be a sexy stock pick. The company moves slowly. It does not reinvent itself or beat other retailers to the punch when it comes to innovation. The warehouse club has only recently embraced the internet and its efforts in that space leave it well behind pure-digital players like Amazon and traditional brick and mortar chains including the resurgent Wal-Mart. Costco is slow and steady, sometimes even boring and behind the times, but unlike many retailers it has nothing to fear as the way that many Americans prefer to shop continues to change. The warehouse club, with its membership-based business and its shopping as entertainment model has shown that it's immune to the changes sweeping through the malls and shopping plazas of first the United States and then the world. That may change eventually. Perhaps someday people will find the idea of leaving their home for shopping absurd. But, for the foreseeable future, Costco has a business built on incredibly loyal customers who not only pay to shop there, but have increasingly been willing to pay more for the privilege in the form of enhanced membership. Costco has a model that works and executes it very well. Image source: Costco. Why is Costco's model strong? Unlike most retailers, Costco does not make the bulk of its income from sales. Instead, about 75% of its profit comes from membership fees. That means that while the chain's sales do impact its bottom line, its real business is keeping its members happy. In recent years the company has been doing that very well. Costco's United States renewal rate has hovered around 90%, inching up steadily from 88% in 2010 to 91% in 2015. In 2016, despite the company making a difficult switch moving its rewards credit card from longtime provider American Express to Visa, renewal rates barely budged.  In 2016 the warehouse club posted a 90.3% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. That's a tiny drop given the upheaval caused by the credit card switch. In addition, the company continued to convert Gold Star members, who pay $55 a year, to Executive Members, who pay twice as much in order to get 2% cash back up to $750 on purchases. At the close of Q4 2016, Costco had 17.4 million Executive Members, a number that was a 370,000 increase. At the time, during the company's earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required) CFO Richard Galanti noted that "Executive Members now account for a little over a third of our base and a little more than two-thirds of our sales, where Executive Members are offered." Basically, Costco has moved a third of its members to a pricier membership where the customer is more loyal because he or she spends more. The chain added another 348,000 Executive Members in Q1 2017 and renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada stayed at 90.3%. Costco stock has more or less steadily risen for five years. Image source:  YCharts.com. Savings plus experience Costco members have proven exceptionally loyal because the chain offers good values. Pricing, however, is not the only reason people shop at the warehouse club.Going to Costco is more than just shopping. The chain's locations are destinations where you never quite know what you may find, and where the numerous samples and food court add to the experience. While going to many retailers can be a chore, making them vulnerable to online competition, Costco has built a shopping experience that's fun. That ties consumers more strongly to the brand even if they don't buy very much. Walking through one of the chain's warehouses might lead to an unexpected purchase, trying a new food, or perhaps taking a picture with an eight-foot stuffed bear. Those things enhance your connection to the company and add value to your membership. Costco will likely never show explosive growth, but it has steadily expanded including slowly growing its international footprint. As it has done that its membership has grown and its increase in membership has been steady. This is a chain that has a model that works and that it knows how to execute. That may not be as exciting as the latest concept in retail which may burn out, but it's a winning formula for the long term. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Allowing for fully automated submission of software escrow materials on an ongoing basis, the new services benefit both licensees and vendors. Licensees can be confident that each software escrow will be updated more regularly and accurately, with mistakes resulting from manual processes being eliminated. Software vendors benefit from a streamlined escrow submission process that is far easier to manage and which does away with human error. As a leader in the field of software and intellectual property escrow, EscrowTech serves clients including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Walmart, and Verizon. The company's new fully automated software escrow update services are available to clients now. "Software escrow is an increasingly important concern in the modern, highly digital realm of business," said EscrowTech Vice President Jorge Sagastume, "When source code and other software-related materials are not kept up to date, however, even a well-designed escrow cannot provide the protection and security that might be hoped. Our new fully automated software escrow submission service improves greatly on the slow, labor-intensive processes that have traditionally been the norm. In addition to eliminating human sources of error, the new automated escrow service makes it much easier to keep source code, data, documentation, and other assets up to date as development progresses. That benefits both vendors and licensees in truly significant ways." Many large companies today spend millions of dollars licensing complex, business-critical software systems from vendors that develop them. Particularly given the costs involved in acquiring, migrating to, and using such software, a large organization could become exposed to significant harm if a vendor should go out of business, lose access to related digital resources, or otherwise become unable to support a system. Software escrow is an arrangement designed to provide protection against such risks. With a trusted third party taking possession of the human-readable source code, data, and other intellectual property that makes up a software product, a licensing agreement will include provisions for the release of those assets to a licensee upon the business failure of the vendor or other defined condition. EscrowTech International, Inc., is one of the world's leading providers of secure, trusted software escrow. The company's new automated escrow submission service improves upon industry norms by enabling more regular updating of source code and other resources while removing the possibility of human-derived error. Those interested can learn more about the new service at the EscrowTech website. About EscrowTech International, Inc.: Serving over half of the Fortune 500, EscrowTech International, Inc., is one of the world's leading providers of trusted, secure, robust escrow and related services for software, SaaS, and intellectual property.

The band have had a tumultuous few years culminating in the release of their most recent album, The Black, and founding member and guitarist Ben Bruce took some time to talk to Sam Steen about the band, the album and their future. America Though formed in York, Asking Alexandria and it’s members are now based in the US, for many artists from the UK or Europe in general the idea of "breaking America" is a daunting one and an incredibly difficult  thing to achieve but for Ben, the move seemed like a no-brainer.  Listen to Sam Steen's full interview above "When we formed the band I had a plan and a goal as to how we would be successful and originally our goal was that if we could play in front of 200 kids a night for the rest of our lives then that would be the greatest thing in the world and I said well think about the odds, the UK is this big, and the US is about 500 million times bigger than the UK so there’s more 200 kids a night to play to in the US" he explained, "so we just hopped on a plane with no visas, no nothing and said let’s try it. We lived in a Walmart car park for months and months and ended up falling in love with the country and now we all have visas and I have a Green Card now and the rest is history." The Black  The Black, Asking Alexandria’s fourth album, has been out for about a year now and the songs reflect a particularly difficult time in both the history of the band and Ben’s own life, while it might be hard to access those memories every time they perform, Ben says that, now, it’s almost a positive. "Over time I listen to them I still feel the same as when I wrote them because we try to be as true to ourselves as possible when writing and you know, I write a lot of the lyrics and when I listen to it now I remember what a tough time I was going through" he said. "In that respect they still hit me quite hard but on the other hand my life has changed so much since the release and even the recording and writing and creating of that album, now I look back on it and it’s almost a nice feeling to know I’m not in that place any more. No matter how much sh*t I went through, with the departure of Danny and my divorce and family members dying and my best friend dying, it’s like no matter how much sh*t the world threw at me, I’m here now and I’m happier than I ever have been." Split & Reformation The departure of Danny that he mentions is the story of their lead singer, Danny Worsnop quitting the band. It was a fairly acrimonious split that saw them question their friendship, ability and dedication to the project but after some time out to work with other bands and after being replaced for the recording of The Black, Danny has since been welcomed back in to the fold. Everything seems ok now but with so many of the lyrics being about the split, is it difficult for Worsnop to sing the songs? "A lot of them (are about him). It’s part of the past and you don’t hold on to the past and harbour those feelings it’s just nice to know that we’ve moved on. You know we go on stage every night and one of the songs that we love playing, I think it’s one of the most successful singles of our career, it’s called 'Moving On' and that was written by Danny and it’s very clearly about him thinking of leaving the band!" Happily for the band and their many fans the group are working well together now and Ben revealed that the decision to bring Danny back was not a difficult one. "No it it wasn’t but it probably should have been because the way he left was horrible but when you sit down and think about it, every side has it’s story and back in the day we were touring like three hundred and fifty plus days a year, all together, stuck in a metal tube of some sort, whether it was a plane, a boat or a bus and Danny kept saying, 'we need time off, we need time off', and we kept saying 'no, we need to keep going' and eventually he broke and I think we all broke we just didn't break quite as badly as Danny." “I think it was the the thing that had to happen in order to save this band, because with his year and a half away, now that he’s come back, we’re all happier and in a better place than we’ve ever been”, said Ben. "We don’t drink as excessively, we try not to tour as excessively and we’re all motivated and happier to be around each other again." With harmony restored Asking Alexandria are already working on their next album and the current tour is going really well. "We’ve started the gruelling process! It’s exciting! It’s good to be back creating with Danny and the original five again. It’s nice, there’s excitement in the air again in our camp". he said.

However, they had no idea that they were acquiring baseball’s top sweet tooth. Moncada, who will begin this season at Triple-A Charlotte, is featured in the latest edition of ESPN The Magazine. And it was revealed there that the man eats up to 85 Twinkies a week. That’s roughly 9 billion calories, yet the guy still looks like this: Here’s an incredible excerpt from that story (David refers to David Hastings, the husband of Josefa Hastings – a Cuban restaurant owner who befriended the Cuban-born Moncada): Moncada discovered Twinkies at Wal-Mart and started consuming them by the box, sometimes eating more than 10 in a single sitting even as the Red Sox were trying to counsel him on diet and nutrition. When David took Moncada to the dentist in the winter of 2015 — the first dental visit of Moncada’s life — he had about 15 cavities, David says. We haven’t seen such a strong affection for those cream-filled snack cakes since Woody Harrelson’s Tallahassee character in “Zombieland.” And is it any wonder the Red Sox were willing to part with Moncada in the Sale deal when you consider the prospect of the slimmed-down Pablo Sandoval walking past Moncada’s Twinkies stash in the clubhouse all spring? But, seriously, 85 per week? Right-hander Michael Kopech, who came to the White Sox with Moncada in that Sale trade, says it’s true. I can vouch for this… 👀 https://t.co/MFYCPk1NGK — Kopech (@MichaelKopech5) March 24, 2017 Moncada got a brief taste of the majors last September, going 4-for-19 with 12 strikeouts for the Red Sox. However, he hit .294/.407/.5011 with 15 homers, 68 RBI, 31 doubles, six triples and 45 stolen bases in 106 games between Single-A and Double-A last season. That’s a lot of speed considering all those Twinkies. 33 View gallery gallery: Every MLB team's 2017 motto in three words Getty Images | Getty Images FOX Fantasy Baseball Join or Create a Free League Play Now! 0 Shares Chicago White Sox MLB MLB’s top prospect has an insane sweet tooth – as in 85 Twinkies per week UP NEXT : MLB’s top prospect has an insane sweet tooth – as in 85 Twinkies per week UP NEXT :

Sheila Butt, of Maury County, Tennessee, where the first Amber Alert for Tad Cummins, 50, and Elizabeth Thomas, 15, was issued, said: 'If I could tell Tad anything right now it would be that I know he knows the right thing to do.  'He is the adult and it is in his power and it is his responsibility to make sure that Beth gets home safely now.' The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Cummins and Thomas could be anywhere in the country after they both disappeared from Columbia, Tennessee, on March 13.    Cummins is armed with two handguns and faces charges of sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping.  The teacher's former coworkers Blake Hight and Chandler Anderson are now offering a $5,000 reward for ensuring Thomas' safe return, stating: 'This child needs [to be] rescued'. The 15-year-old girl who changed her social media bio to 'wife' before they disappeared is in grave danger, police said. Scroll down for video  Sheila Butt, of Maury County, Tennessee, where the first Amber Alert for Tad Cummins, 50, and Elizabeth Thomas, 15, urged the teacher to 'man up' and bring the teen home Thomas (left) and Cummins (right) vanished from Tennessee on March 13 and could be anywhere in the country, according to investigators The teacher's former coworkers Blake Hight and Chandler Anderson are now offering a $5,000 reward for ensuring Thomas' safe return, stating: 'This child needs [to be] rescued' Butt, who said she has known Cummins and his wife Jill for 'a long time', told WKRN: 'The best thing that Tad can do is to make sure that Beth gets home safely and I know he understands that by now. 'I, and the people in this community are praying for them both and for their families. It is time for Tad to "man up" and I know he can. I know that he believes in God and in doing the right thing,' Butt added. On Thursday, police in Corpus Christi, Texas, received a call from a member of the public claiming to have seen them.  The town is only 164 miles from the Mexican border and is more than 1,000 miles from where they were last seen in Tennessee.  Police released this photoof the pair in Cummins' classroom in January. A student saw them kissing, and a principal caught them together before Cummins was suspended in February A member of the public claimed to have seen the pair on US Highway 181 in the tiny town of North Beach on Thursdsay A member of the public claimed to have seen the pair on US Highway 181 in the tiny town of North Beach.   Police had not yet been able to track them down on Thursday afternoon and would not confirm whether they feared they were making a run for the border. This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished. She appears to be carrying clothes A spokesman from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations told DailyMail.com it was not the first tip they had received and that so far, all leads had proved fruitless.   Earlier this week it was revealed that Cummins was under investigation by police in Tennessee for his relationship with the girl when they vanished. They believe he used his position as her science teacher at Culleoka High School to groom her for sex and brainwash her in to abandoning her family of 12 to be with him. Another student at the school where he taught and which Elizabeth attended reported seeing them kissing on the lips in his classroom on January 23.  Cummins took out a $4,500 loan, researched teen marriage and was seen buying women's hair dye at a Walmart (pictured) the day before they vanished Pictured, the dark brow hair dye teacher Tad Cummins was seen buying (right) and Elizabeth in a family photograph (left)  Tennesee's Bureau of Investigation released a photograph of them in Cummins' classroom in the same month on Wednesday.  The other student notified school officials and the police, but Elizabeth's family was not alerted until a week later. When Elizabeth's father confronted her about her relationship with Cummins, she insisted that he was just her teacher and a 'mentor,' and that the student who claimed to have seen them kiss had lied.  The teen was being bullied in school by both classmates and teachers over the alleged kissing episode and told her sister, 'I just have to get away, we have to get away,' according to ABC News.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Smirking 'father' is arrested for stabbing to death... FBI raid a rural South Carolina home as they hunt for... Share this article Share Cummins was allowed to carry on teaching before he was suspended on February 6 after the pair were found together again by the school principal. Local police in Tennessee were investigating them, they said, but did not have sufficient evidence to make an arrest.  They said that even if they had put him behind bars on suspicion of inappropriate behavior, he would have made bail and been free to run away immediately afterwards.  Elizabeth changed her Instagram biography before she vanished to describe herself as a 'wife'. She also added a ring emoji to the description  Elizabeth posted this image on Instagram in the days before she disappeared, writing simply beside it: 'Good morning'  Elizabeth referred to a 'mission' before disappearing on March 13. Police believe she was groomed by Cummins who she has known for more than two years  Law enforcement sources told ABC News that Cummins is believed to have watched a TV show about living off the grid before the pair went on the run.   Cummins also conducted online searches for teen marriage, and researched whether his car could be tracked by law enforcement, News Channel 5 reports. He also took out a $4,500 loan, and was seen buying women's hair dye at a Walmart the day before they vanished. Meanwhile, Thomas posted several romantic Instagram photographs about love and changed her biography to 'wife', added a ring emoji to it.  On March 13, Elizabeth told her family she was spending the day with a friend. She told one of her ten siblings to call police if she had not returned by 6pm.   Tennessee investigators say Elizabeth is in imminent danger. They believe Cummins is armed with two handguns Cummins was seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day the pair disappeared Police believe Cummins, who she has known for more than two years, brainwashed her into abandoning her family. They have not confirmed whether she went willingly with him on March 13. 'It's entirely likely Elizabeth doesn’t believe – at least right now – that she’s a victim,' Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine told DailyMail.com on Tuesday. Police issued the last photograph of her before her disappearance on Monday. In it, she appeared carrying a pile of clothes in her arms. She was dressed in a plaid shirt and dark leggings with her blonde hair scraped back in to a ponytail. The bureau did not specify where the image was taken. Cummins' embattled wife Jill made an emotional plea for his return last week, telling him: 'Tad, this is not you.' Elizabeth's father Anthony (right) said the teacher 'stole' his daughter from him  Cummins' conflicted wife issued an emotional appeal for him to return with the girl as the hunt for them entered its first week. 'Tad, this is not you,' she said.  Elizabeth's family held vigils in their hometown in the hope she may reappear. Her father said Cummins 'stole' his daughter from him.  On Wednesday, he revealed how Cummins 'convinced' his daughter he was a former CIA agent with 'all kinds of money'.   The pair are believed to be driving silver Nissan Rogue which he was filmed filling up with gas the day before they disappeared.  Anyone with information of their whereabouts is urged to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Police are asking anyone who sees a silver Nissan Rogue with a license plate of TN 976-ZPT to call 911 immediately.

Some advertisers said they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Walmart said in a Friday statement. Read more Google promises closer policing of websites The company, alongside PepsiCo and several others, said they will also stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites, AP reported. Verizon and AT&T, along with UK retailer Marks and Spencer and L'Oreal, pulled ads from YouTube earlier this week. AT&T said it is removing the ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its “ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company wrote in an email, Reuters reported. If the search giant fails to win back advertisers, this could potentially result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. “The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general,” analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research told Reuters on Thursday. “There's this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear,”he added. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube, AP reported. The Wall Street Journal found that Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing extremist content. Speaking at a press briefing at the start of Advertising Week Europe in London on Monday, Google apologized for tainting some brands, and pledged to ensure the ads will not appear alongside extremist videos.

The company’s EMEA president of business and operations, Matt Brittin, said 400 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube each minute, adding that 98 percent of “removals” take place within 24 hours, NBC reported. Ensuring brand safety, however, is a real challenge, Brittin noted. “It is not as simple as it might seem, so you might say: Why don't you just exclude content that relates to war or that relates to politics? Well actually if you were to do that you would exclude important news content or documentary content.” “It's not our job to be a censor, it's for the government,” Brittin said, as cited by Business Insider. “So, you will find online content that you violently disagree with, that you find incredibly distasteful, but that is a legitimate point of view and not illegal. And that is one of the joys of the web and the voices that are there. That's different to the issue of what's safe for advertisers, which is more tightly defined.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 03.25.17. 03.25.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am YouTube’s Ad Problems Finally Blow Up in Google’s Face WIRED Late last year, Israel-based entrepreneur Matan Uziel saw a notification he’d never seen before pop up on YouTube’s backend—the part of the site where creators upload their videos. “I saw a yellow dollar sign. At first I didn’t understand what it was,” Uziel says. “Then I moved my cursor over it. I saw it meant my video was not advertiser-friendly.” By then, Uziel had made and posted close to a dozen videos to a YouTube channel called Real Women Real Stories—women speaking frankly into a camera about their experiences of sexual abuse. The view counts on some of the videos had climbed into the thousands, qualifying them for pre-roll ads placed through YouTube’s advertising program. They were bringing Uziel and his team a modest amount of money. But Google was now pulling the plug. The company would not let ads run on his latest video—and eventually all the others. The problem, he was told: the “sensitive nature” of the videos. Related Stories Charley Locke The Tricky Art of Podcast Ads Is About to Get Even Trickier Davey Alba Under Pressure to Prove Its Ads Actually Work, Google Opens Up Davey Alba PewDiePie’s Anti-Semitic Videos Put YouTube’s Business in a Bind Davey Alba The Best Way to Quash Fake News? Choke Off Its Ad Money Uziel sent an appeal to Google, but the company denied it. A Google representative told Uziel in an email that the videos’ titles could be automatically triggering the site’s filters. But Uziel says he never got a full explanation from the company of what really got the ads pulled from his videos. That same confusion simmers at the heart of Google’s current ad debacle. Over the past week, major advertisers—everyone from the British government to AT&T—have pulled their ad buys from YouTube after their banners appeared over videos posted by extremists. Google has apologized. But the company still has a more basic transparency problem. Google ostensibly wants to make sure uploaders of hate speech and abuse don’t get paid. But as Uziel’s experience demonstrates, that effort can come at the expense of deserving content. The opacity around Google’s standards and practices, as reflected in their inconsistent enforcement, creates uncertainty at the heart of one of the internet’s most popular services. Until Google truly fixes the problem, the internet—and one of its core business models—will suffer. Ditching Google About a week ago, the Times of London published an investigation revealing ads sponsored by the British government and several private sector companies had appeared ahead of YouTube videos supporting terrorist groups. In response, advertisers started pulling their spending from YouTube and the wider Google ad network. The boycott has grown as more problems have emerged. PepsiCo and Wal-Mart have now joined the ranks of advertisers pulling dollars from Google. Google for its part has said it is examining its policies and renewing its commitment to better police content. It will accelerate reviews of potentially objectionable videos and filter more ads while giving advertisers more control over where their ads appear. Related Video Inside the Fake News Factory of Macedonia “While we recognize that no system will be 100 percent perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers’ brands,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in a statement. To be sure, Google faces major technical challenges in policing where ads appear. Users upload as much as 400 hours of content to YouTube every minute. And millions of websites rely on the company’s platform to funnel ads to their sites. But claiming sheer logistics doesn’t satisfy everyone in the ad world as an excuse. After all, no other company has done better at making money off of performing technical feats at a massive scale. Google may be reluctant to stand between publishers and advertisers for fear of becoming too much of an arbiter of what’s appropriate. But it also makes a lot of money off of ads in part by making the path from advertiser to targeted audience eyeballs as efficient as possible. “It’s difficult to understand what motivates Google,” says one advertising executive who did not want to be seen publicly criticizing a company with which nearly all advertisers have to work. “When you’ve operated a marketplace, or owned and operated inventory that’s been so noncompliant with basic standards for so long, you can’t erase that mark overnight.” Hot Topic Google’s ad system has long suffered from these weaknesses. But ever since Facebook admitted to flaws in how it reported ad performance to ad buyers, digital advertising has come under greater scrutiny, says media analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. On top of that, advertisers fear being seen as subsidizers of the festering scourge of fake news. “If it wasn’t obvious before that Google’s ad inventory was problematic, now it is,” Wieser says. And now Google has little choice but to try to fix it. Just a few advertisers control so many of the ad dollars, and they’ve been primed by recent events to be more conscientious about brand safety. Pressure from them could push Google to become more consistent and careful about what it allows on its platforms and where it allows ads to appear. “We draw a sharp distinction between free speech and the right to do business with a private company,” says Josh Zeitz, vice president of communications at AppNexus, which last year blocked Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools after it determined the site violated AppNexus’ hate speech policy. “We have our advertisers’ brand safety to look after, and we have a moral code to live by. If we won’t work with a publisher, that doesn’t stop them from directly selling ads to advertisers.” Matan Uziel of Real Women Real Stories hopes YouTube figures out that its content provides an important service, that the money paid by advertisers supports his ability to produce videos that provide women a place to speak out on a difficult subject. It might be sensitive, but it serves a public good. Until Google can start better making these distinctions, both advertisers and creators will have trouble trusting the company. Go Back to Top.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon ST. CATHARINES, Ont. — Police say an Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson before allegedly injuring a bank employee made it nearly 2,000 kilometres from the scene of the attacks before being arrested. Niagara regional police say Justin Kuijer was arrested Tuesday night in Kenora, Ont., four days after allegedly fleeing his home in St. Catharines, Ont. Chief Jeff McGuire says Kuijer’s flight from southern Ontario to near the provincial border with Manitoba came to an end when a member of the public recognized the van the man had been driving since going on the run. Kuijer was arrested in a Walmart parking lot without incident and will be brought back to the Niagara region to face a bail hearing on Thursday. Kuijer had been at large since Friday when police allege he critically injured seven-year-old Nathan Dumas, who died in hospital the next day. Police allege Kuijer stabbed an employee at a local RBC branch moments after the alleged attack on Nathan. A Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued Monday for Kuijer on charges of second-degree murder in the death of seven-year-old Nathan Dumas, as well as the attempted murder of a woman working at a local RBC branch. Police alleged that Kuijer had been on the run in his ex-girlfriend’s van ever since the two grisly scenes unfolded Friday. In a news release, Niagara regional police said the 2009 Pontiac Montana van was located at about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday in a parking lot with Kuijer alone inside. They said he was arrested without incident. “We would like to thank the public, the media, and our law enforcement partners for their continued support over the last few days,” Niagara homicide Det. Sgt. Brian Bleich, the lead investigator in the case, said. “Their efforts have led to the capture of Kuijer, and some small semblance of closure for the victims and their families.” Police have said that they were called to a home Friday morning above a sandwich shop owned by Nathan’s grandparent. Const. Phil Gavin said a family member found Nathan suffering from critical injuries and had him rushed to a hospital, where the boy died the next day. At around the same time the Dumas family was making the discovery, police allege Kuijer walked into a nearby RBC branch and stabbed a woman working there. Gavin said Kuijer — who is listed as the owner and operator of Niagara Elite Roofing — had a professional relationship with the woman. The officer described the attack as targeted, but declined to provide further details. The woman is now in hospital in stable condition, he added. Police had originally indicated that they would be seeking a charge of first-degree murder in Nathan’s death, but Gavin did not explain why the second-degree murder charge was listed on the warrant. “At the 11th hour the decision was made that this was the most appropriate charge,” he said. Related Stepfather wanted for first-degree murder of his seven-year-old stepson, police to seek Canada-wide warrant When reached by phone Monday, the boy’s mother, Whitney Dumas, declined to comment, but she addressed the loss suffered by herself and her two other children in a series of Facebook posts. “This is truly a tragic time for everyone involved,” she wrote. “I understand that everyone has questions, it’s human nature, so do I. I kindly ask that everyone respect my family’s privacy and space and allow my family this time to mourn the loss of my beautiful son.” Dumas thanked the Niagara community for an outpouring of support and a wave of financial generosity, and social media comments suggested those beyond the family circle also felt moved by Nathan’s death. “My kids and I said a prayer tonight for you and your family,” wrote one Facebook user. “You not only have a city, but a region … probably a nation at this point … supporting you.” An elementary school near the scene where Nathan died flew a flag at half-mast on Monday afternoon, and crowdsourcing efforts to raise money for the family generated considerable response. Friends of the boy’s family started a GoFundMe campaign that had netted more than $21,000 by Tuesday night. The page suggested Nathan died just a week shy of his eighth birthday. “Nathan’s precious life was abruptly cut short at the hand of someone else,” the tribute said. “Nathan was an energetic, loving and caring little boy who will never have his first girlfriend, graduate school or get married and have children. Nathan would have made a big difference in this cruel world.” – With files from Allan Benner, St. Catharines Standard Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

"I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." --Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass Why, of course the Democrats are going to filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. This is Washington politics, after all, and there's a scalp on the other wall with the name tag: Merrick Garland. The leadership in the Democratic Party wants payback, and a scalp of their own. Not that there's a whole lot to complain about when it comes to Neil Gorsuch, or his legal and judicial career. His elevation to the Supreme Court of the United States would improve the reputation of that court. Back in 2006, his nomination to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was unanimous. Yes, the same United States senators--think Charles Schumer of New York, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware--who gave him a thumbs-up a decade ago now threaten to filibuster. Even though Neil Gorsuch's time on the bench has only improved his résumé. The leadership among the Democrats might be upset because they couldn't get him to talk about cases that he might be required to rule on later. It's a time-honored tradition among judges, whether nominated for the bench or running for election. The only thing the Democrats know for sure is that Neil Gorsuch has long modeled his consitutionalist views after the man he wishes to replace: Antonin Scalia. In fact, when he was called with the news of Mr. Justice Scalia's death, he says he lost his breath. He was on a ski trip and was so blinded by tears that he couldn't see down the mountain. That's enough for the leadership of the Democrats. Like the former conservative stalwart on the nation's highest court, Neil Gorsuch is said to focus primarily on the text of the U.S. Constitution, and not invent things on his own. He has told the press that if judges factor in personal beliefs, societal changes or social welfare into their rulings, then judges risk becoming "little more than politicians with robes." That, too, was enough for the leadership of the Democrats. Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked Neil Gorsuch if he could be fair to the little guy. The very premise of the question shows the senator's ignorance of how the law works. If a homeless man robs a big store, such as Wal-Mart, would Neil Gorsuch or any other judge throw out his conviction? After all, he's homeless and Wal-Mart is the very definition of Big Business. Or would Neil Gorsuch follow the law instead? He said he'd rule according to the law, and has ruled for the little guy and the big guy, depending on circumstances. Gorsuch said he had ruled 2,700 times in his career, and in some cases it had been for corporations, but in numerous cases he had ruled for individuals or "the little guy." When Sen. Feinstein asked if he would send her examples, he said actually he would give her examples right then and there, naming citations to about eight cases, and said there were many more. When the New York Times called him on it, and called Cynthia Orr--the pregnant police officer in Albuquerque who sued when she had been denied compensatory time off--she told the Times that indeed, when her case was appealed to the 10th Circuit, it was Neil Gorsuch who sided with her over the police department. So the leadership among the minority party will filibuster this talented jurist who graduated from Columbia and was in Phi Beta Kappa, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and earned a Ph.D from Oxford University in legal philosophy. Trying to say he is unqualified will only make the Democrats look silly or vindictive. So unable to question his credentials, we expect to hear things like this over the next few weeks: Neil Gorsuch would roll back civil rights protections. He would overturn Roe v. Wade. His confirmation would harm working families. He followed a "disingenuous strategy" at confirmation hearings. All those things were said about John Roberts during his nomination. Neil Gorsuch would take America backward when it comes to anti-discrimination laws. He'd keep women down. He is too far right-wing for the bench. All those things were said about Samuel Alito. The bottom line is, just as Mitch McConnell noted not long ago, the Democrats will say these things no matter who a Republican president nominates. It's their default position. But the numbers just aren't there for the Democrats. As the president, the vice-president, the Senate majority leader and most in the commentariat have noted, Neil Gorsuch is very likely going to be confirmed. One way or the other. The other way? That'd be "going nuclear," to borrow an awful phrase in Washington these days. A few years ago, the majority leader in the Senate at the time, Harry Reid, decided he'd had enough of the filibuster and decided to all but kill it. That is, he could ram legislation and nominees through the process, trample all over the loyal opposition, and push through President Obama's picks on a simple majority vote. And he did. He didn't include Supreme Court picks, but surely he knew that one day the Republicans would be in control again, and they'd take the next step if necessary. And it appears as though they will, if they can't get to 60 votes in the next month or so. Harry Reid's legacy is sad indeed, especially when you consider that Supreme Court nominees as different as Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg got 90 votes for confirmation in their time. That is when the Senate voted on qualifications, not politics. When they go back to voting on qualifications, they will again earn back the respect of the American public.

Where was the outrage when Garrick didn't even get a hearing or a vote? Gorsuch will get both. This editor is nothing but a dishonest right wing shill. ( permalink | suggest removal ) RBear says... March 25, 2017 at 8:43 a.m. Many times I give the D-G Editorial Board a fair shake on their columns. Even though the arguments usually aren't constructed very well, they do bring out some good points on some occasions. However, this one just can't be passed over. It's like some right wing blogger was handed the reins of the editorial page and just hacked out a rambling indictment of Democrats that's full of flawed logic at best. ... To start with, this glowing, almost tear jerking (cough) review of Gorsuch is laughable. Teary eyed coming down the slope upon hearing of Scalia's passing? Yea, I'm sure the judge missed his mentor and I imagine he was grief-stricken. But that doesn't boost his creds any more in terms of being qualified for the bench. Gorsuch is a literalist which can at times be crippling in his interpretation of the law, especially when it deals with the constitutional merits of a case. Even Scalia wasn't that draconian in his views of the Constitution. Gorsuch's own testimony highlighted those facts when discussing his views on the law. ... With regards to Feinstein's question about looking out for the little guy, it's a fair question to make of someone who has sided more times than not with corporations over average citizens. But, instead of providing some rational comparisons the board went to some bizarre extreme corner about a homeless person robbing a Walmart. Huh? A B level senior could answer that one with regards to the merits of the law. It's as if that's intended to justify Gorsuch's big corporation positions. Come on. You can do better than that. ... Finally, Democrats have every right to filibuster this nomination which is more a protest of Republicans' denying Garland a hearing than Gorsuch's qualifications. Garland was as equally a qualified a candidate if not more due to his tenure on the DC Circuit, the most venerated circuit in the nation. Garland's period on the DC Circuit has been lauded by both Democrats AND Republicans for fairness and quality of decisions. Yet, Republicans pulled a maneuver to deny Obama his pick. So, to berate Democrats for their filibuster is misguided and laughable based on this column. ... Gorsuch will be confirmed, but I support the Democrats right to exercise a rule of the Senate as they protest the insanity of 2016 crafted by Republicans. I do hope this board works more on the quality of their columns and takes the keyboard away from their resident right wing blogger. ( permalink | suggest removal ) BirdDogsRock says... March 25, 2017 at 9:49 a.m. The SCOTUS has been working fine, more or less, with 8 justices for more than a year... what's another 4 years with 8 justices? If the Dems can lock up the confirmation process til they get a Dem in the White House, then they can refill the vacancy. The Republicans created a destabilizing situation on the SCOTUS when they refused to give Garland a hearing.

The checkout counter is your phone, and there is no checkout line. If legacy retailers want to survive the changing retail landscape, they must — at the very least — offer the same experiences in-store that shoppers can find online, a panel of retail experts on Friday told the annual Commercial Real Estate Summit. The event, now in its 28th year, drew a record crowd of more than 800 to the CenturyLink Center. Retail was top of mind, especially now that Omaha-based Gordmans’ fate is unknown as the department store chain navigates a bankruptcy and potential liquidation. Sears said this week it was on the brink of a second bankruptcy. Retailers nationally are shuttering stores, and some are closing altogether as they face stiff competition from online-only sellers and consumers’ changing shopping habits. “A lot of these retailers will disappear — I don’t think there’s any doubt about it,” Mark Hasebroock told the conference attendees. Hasebroock, founder of e-commerce site Hayneedle and Dundee Venture Capital, spoke on the panel focused on the evolution of retail, and how brokers can adapt. The year is already ramping up to be a bumpy one for retail companies and their landlords. Cushman & Wakefield anticipates as many as 5,000 major chain closures nationally this year, a 25 percent increase over 2016, according to a report by research firm CoStar. Part of the problem? Many retail companies aren’t focused on long-term investment that allows for evolution and, ultimately, survival, said Michael Staenberg, president of St. Louis development firm the Staenberg Group. Instead, they’re owned by private equity firms looking to make a return. “It’s, ‘How can I make money today?’ ” rather than what’s best for the business long-term, he said. Sears’ chief executive and chairman is also its top shareholder. Gordmans’ majority owner is Sun Capital Partners, a private-equity firm based in Florida. The days of a shopping center filling up with purely retail tenants are over, said Brian Kuehl, a retail broker at Investors Realty who also spoke on the panel. “They’re not really retail shopping centers; they’re service centers,” Kuehl said. Tenant mixes might include a medical clinic, a salon of some kind or an iPhone repair shop. Staenberg said his firm anchors many of its new developments with popular grocery stores because they guarantee some foot traffic. “It’s good to lease off that,” Staenberg said. “If you have the right locations and the right retailers it can be successful.” The upheaval is even affecting banks, said Leslie Anderson, president of Bennington Bank, who spoke on another panel. As more people bank and shop online, banks don’t need eight teller stations or nearly as many branches. The panel wasn’t all doom and gloom. The retail industry has always been evolving, said Ben Meier, a retail broker with the Lerner Co. Catalog shopping, QVC, the rise of Walmart and even door-to-door salesmen have all forced change in the retail industry in the past. “Our retail environment is always changing. We need to embrace the experience of shopping,” Meier said. The panel pointed to one retailer that is doing things right: Apple. Their stores are “the holy grail,” Hasebroock said. Meanwhile, another huge retail question mark sits at 72nd and Dodge Streets. Whether or not it will ever be overhauled became a point of debate during the conference, which featured a face-off between Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and her opponent, former State Sen. Heath Mello. The two sparred over several real estate-related projects, including the Crossroads Mall. Mello called the proposed Crossroads redevelopment “stagnant.” Stothert announced that she had just spoken Friday morning with the developer who wants to transform the corner. She said that the city has offered a package of incentives, including tax-increment financing, and that the ball now is in the developer’s court. The two also talked about balancing a desire to preserve Omaha’s history, and landmark buildings, with the needs of future development. In doing so, Stothert announced that the city will not — after all — demolish a century-old streetcar barn in northeast Omaha. Omaha Public Works officials previously wanted to raze the worn building to make way for a parking lot to serve an expanded city vehicle repair facility at 26th and Lake Streets. Restoration Exchange Omaha saw the property as a key to reviving the area’s legendary arts and entertainment scene and had protested. Stothert said she plans to announce soon what is planned as the next chapter for the old barn. To that, Mello said “thanks for taking my lead.” He said he had earlier talked about the need to save the garage structure. In other real estate-related news, Stothert told the group her administration is drafting an ordinance opening the door for a new financing tool that could assist commercial projects. “Pace” funding can be used only for energy-efficiency improvements. Mello pointed out that he was the sponsor of state legislation allowing Nebraska cities to tap the tool. No public funds are involved, but City Council approval is needed because an assessment is repaid as if it were property tax, said Chris Peterson of Pace Sage, the entity that wants to be Omaha’s lender. Meanwhile, both mayoral candidates said they support the proposed streetcar project that would connect downtown with fast-growing midtown retail and residential corridors. Echoing the sentiment were several other speakers at the conference, including Jay Lund of the Blackstone District, Todd Heistand of NuStyle Development and Jay Noddle, whose projects include Aksarben Village. “It’s super-important,” Noddle said of the streetcar. “It’s one of the things that’s got to happen next.” In other news at the conference: » Panelists talking about the “explosive world of multifamily” said they don’t believe the metro area’s apartment scene is overbuilt — yet. Josh Larsen, vice president of Northmarq Capital, said a vacancy rate of below 5 percent is great. With more than 2,500 new apartments expected to become available in the next two years, Scott Mausbach, an appraiser with Mainland Valuation Services, expects the vacancy rate to creep up and development to start slowing. Both Larsen and Mausbach said that Omaha, increasingly, is seeing outsiders shopping in Omaha for apartment projects. Mausbach expects them also to start buying and upgrading older apartment buildings — which could bring to the supply a different look and quality. » Five commercial real estate experts joined the Summit Hall of Fame Friday: Dan Smith of Smith Slusky Law, Ellen Albrecht of First American Title Insurance Co., Dennis Hogan III of Pansing Hogan Ernst & Bachman, and Keith Basham and Tim Holland of Holland Basham Architects. cindy.gonzalez@owh.com, 402-444-1224 paige.yowell@owh.com, 402-444-1414 More information Troubled Gordmans owes hundreds of thousands in rent, documents show Plummeting sales at the Omaha-based operator of 100 stores in 22 states appear to have bitten hard into bill-paying capacity.

Tanya Keenan-Mack, 37, was arrested by Lycoming County police after she allegedly sold $194 dollars worth of food stamps in exchange for heroin. The investigation began after a tip was received on February 6 that she posted an ad on “Williamsport New, Used, Buy and Sell” page on Facebook, stating that she was selling her food stamps worth $194 for $100. [Image by Shutterstock] It was revealed that Keenan-Mack was sent to jail for a probation violation in an unrelated forgery case. It was not mentioned whether she was in jail when the food stamps were used, but CBS Pittsburgh states that transactions were last recorded last month at a Walmart and Weis Markets. Keenan-Mack did request the assistance of a public defender, and currently has not made any comments on this particular case. As of right now, Pennsylvania does not participate in drug screenings for food stamps; however, according to Extract, there are 13 states that do require drug tests in order to receive government benefits. [Image by Shutterstock] Among the required states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. There are 19 additional states considering this stipulation, and West Virginia is currently in the process of changing their law, thus making it possible for drug testing to be mandated to “suspicious” welfare applicants starting in June, Think Progress reports. According to Think Progress, if an applicant in West Virginia should fail a mandated drug test, they will be able to receive government benefits only if they enroll in a drug treatment program and attend job training programs. A second failed drug test, however, would ban the applicant for a year, followed by a life-ban if a third drug test was failed. Furthermore, should a parent fail a mandated drug test, Child Protective Services will investigate the situation. West Virginia is awaiting federal approval, but should it receive approval, the new law will go into effect in June. According to a 2015 report, seven states that currently drug test for government benefits have found drug testing to be of little assistance. Statistics show that among Utah, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arizona, very few drug users were found among government assistance applicants. The report revealed that less people were found to use drugs among those who applied for government benefits than the general public. “The national drug use rate is 9.4 percent. In these states, however, the rate of positive drug tests to total welfare applicants ranges from 0.002 percent to 8.3 percent, but all except one have a rate below 1 percent.” The said report certainly caused concern, having questioned whether or not drug screening those who apply for government benefits was truly worth the thousands of dollars spent. Certainly some drug users will be “weeded out” of the system, or perhaps even pushed in the right direction to gain access to the necessary help they may need, but is it worth the extra money? Some argue that drug tests are expensive and will not help with reducing the amount of drug use, but is it really that ineffective? Although there is much skepticism over the drug testing laws for government benefits, more proposals have been regularly popping up. These proposals seek drug test mandates for government benefits, hoping to reduce costs by eliminating drug users who may potentially use their benefits to purchase illegal drugs. Perhaps if Pennsylvania had drug test mandates, Keenan-Mack wouldn’t have had the opportunity to sell her food stamps for heroin because she wouldn’t have received the food stamps in the first place. What do you think about drug testing government assistance applicants?

WALL STREET SHUFFLE - the tyranny of mere wealth, the tyranny of plutocracy (Image by YouTube, Channel: JFWilliam)   Permission   Details   DMCA - Advertisement - By golly, The Donald delivers. Trump and his new blue-ribbon panel of working-class champions have announced a bold new initiative to create millions of American jobs. A spokesman for the panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute -- Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes -- and holy money bags, there's Jamie Dimon, head of the scandal-ridden bank JPMorgan Chase. - Advertisement - Working-class champions? Hardly. Trump's whole "jobs" panel, it turns out, is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Wal-Mart that are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop, he's brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But there's not a single labor advocate on his policy council, in his cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for de-regulating Wall Street. These flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money to invest in American jobs. - Advertisement - Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs -- so they won't. There's a name for this: fraud.   - Advertisement - 2   1   View Ratings | Rate It Jim Hightower is an American populist, spreading his message of democratic hope via national radio commentaries, columns, books, his award-winning monthly newsletter (The Hightower Lowdown) and barnstorming tours all across America.

Union bosses are NOT "workers." Washington, as you know is a very aristocratic, closed society. How many middle class Americans are appointed to anything? Until this changes we will continue the to have a status-quo government which goes nowhere but down.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

Gowen Sr. ‘Outstanding Citizen’ works for betterment of city, county By Carol Rolf/Contributing Writer This article was published today at 12:00 a.m. Comments aAFont Size PHOTO BY WILLIAM HARVEY Jim S. Gowen Sr. of Newport is the recipient of the 2016 Jackson County Outstanding Citizen Award from the Newport Area Chamber of Commerce. He is chairman of the board of directors at Merchants and Planters Bank. He is shown here in his office with that award, bottom right, and with his display of shot glasses that he has personally collected from all 50 states, left. The Newport Area Chamber of Commerce honored Jim S. Gowen Sr. at its recent banquet by presenting him with the Outstanding Citizen Award. “I was surprised,” said Gowen, 73. “It was quite an honor to receive it. “I received it once before and never thought I would receive it again,” he said. “After receiving it this time, I looked back and found the plaque that I received in 1994. That was 22 years ago.” Introducing Gowen at the banquet, on March 2 at the Newport County Club, Julie Allen, chamber director, said the 2016 Outstanding Citizen Award “is presented to an individual who truly embodies everything a town looks for in a model citizen.” Allen said Gowen “has spent many years leading and developing projects that have produced industrial growth, sparked business development and spurred tourism.” She said Gowen “has visited every state in the country but proudly hangs his hat in downtown Newport.” A lot may have changed in Jackson County since the chamber honored Gowen with that first award, but his involvement and dedication to the city and county have not. He moved to Newport in 1983 to become president and senior lending officer at Merchants and Planters Bank and quickly became involved not only in his new business, but also in his new hometown. “This is home. One thing I like about this community is that you had better not tell us we can’t do something because we will prove you wrong,” he said, laughing. “Just look at this downtown park we are developing; we are doing it all with local money. If we are able to get an art complex … a museum … we will have the only such facility in northeast Arkansas,” Gowen said. “We already have Depot Days and PortFest,” he said, referring to two annual festivals. “We already have a lot of things going, but we want to be able to attract tourists the year around. “I’m real active on several committees in Newport and Jackson County.” He is a founding member of DRIVE (Downtown Revitalization and Improvement Volunteer Effort), which is a small group of leaders determined to revamp the downtown section of Newport. He helped create a master plan for the renovation of the area and has worked to secure funds to implement the plan. Gowen also serves on the Jackson County Commission and Economic Development Fund and has been involved with Rotary Club International and the Newport/Jackson County Industrial Bond Board. “It is really vital that Newport and Jackson County become a tourist attraction,” Gowen said. “That would help with our economic development. Tourism is a big, big industry. “We have a master plan to develop the downtown park, which will include a stage and a veterans memorial. As soon as we can get it built, we already have commitments from three different groups to provide entertainment on the stage once a week from April to October.” Gowen said the stage and park would also be utilized during the annual Depot Days Festival. “DRIVE has also acquired a doll collection of more than 7,000 dolls. We are looking for a building that could become the permanent home of that collection,” he said. “We already have the Arkansas Rock ’n’ Roll Highway 67 Museum downtown,” he said, adding that the museum attracts visitors from all over the world. “Jon Chadwell (director of the Newport Economic Development Commission) is looking at an old building that he would like to see renovated and turned into an art museum that could be used for the annual Delta Visual Arts Show,” Gowen said. “That event was just held in February and attracted 2,500 to 3,000 people to Newport and featured 185 artists. “Developing an art museum would be a $2 million to $3 million project.” Gowen said the DRIVE group would also like to see the development of a project to honor the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., who opened his first five-and-dime store (a Ben Franklin franchise store) in Newport. Gowen said Jacksonport State Park is another tourist attraction for Jackson County. PortFest 2017 will be held at the state park June 10 and will include a variety of events, including a large lineup of tribute bands. Gowen was born in Wynne in Cross County, the only child of Scott and Evelyn Gowen. He graduated from Wynne High School in 1961 and attended Arkansas State University. “I didn’t graduate. I went for two or three years, and then I had to go to work. I went to work at a bank in Forrest City,” he said. “It so happened that a state bank examiner came to examine our bank, and he talked to me about becoming a bank examiner. I was just a kid,” Gowen said. “I sent in my resume, and it sat on somebody’s desk for quite a while. I gave up,” he said. “Someone came through town and stopped at my dad’s service station, where I worked on Saturdays, and said, ‘I recognize you.’ “It wasn’t too much longer after that, and I received a call from them and got a job as a bank examiner. I worked as a bank examiner for several years in Little Rock.” Gowen left that job and moved to Clinton, where he was president of Clinton State Bank for several years. He also served as president of the Clinton Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors during his time in that city. “I came to Newport in October 1983 and went to work for Merchants and Planters Bank as president and senior lending officer,” he said. He is now chairman of the board of directors. “This has been a wonderful experience for me,” he said, adding that when he came to the bank, it had two branches with total assets of $46.9 million. “The bank has grown through the years. We are now in five counties — Jackson, Independence, Prairie, Woodruff and White. We have 11 locations and assets exceeding $250 million. “We offer full banking services and have a full trust department as well,” he said. “Many larger banks have trust departments, but not many small community banks offer that service. The trust department is a super department, and it adds to our bottom line. “A few years ago, we bought an insurance agency. We now offer insurance and investment services through this independent agency.” Gowen said one of the best things about Merchants and Planters bank is “our largest shareholders are our employees.” “There is no controlling interest,” he said. “Employees have the option of buying stock in the company. This gives our people something for their retirement.” Over the years, Gowen has been active in the Independent Community Bankers of America, a national trade association for community banks. In 2014, he was named Banker of the Year for the Midwest Region of the Independent Community Bankers of America. Gowen has served on several ICBA committees and boards, including the education committee, and as chairman of ICBA securities. He has also been on the Arkansas Community Bankers Board of Directors for more than 15 years. He is a strong supporter and longtime board member of the Barret School of Banking in Memphis and is on the advisory committee of the Northeast Arkansas Higher Education Charitable Foundation, an organization dedicated to expanding higher-learning institutions. Gowen and his wife, Nita, have been married 22 years. They live in downtown Newport. “This is a second marriage for both of us,” he said. “Between us, we have three children.” Their son, Jim S. Gowen Jr., 48, and his wife, Cindy, live in Newport, with their son, Scott, 12. Jim Jr. is president and CEO of Merchants and Planters Bank. Jim Sr. and Nita’s older daughter, Tammy Jennings, 50, and her husband, Dr. Larry Jennings, live in Marshall. They have two daughters — Alex Coffman, 26, who lives in Jonesboro with her husband, J.A. Coffman, and their 2-year-old daughter, Blair; and Zoe Jennings, 22, who attends the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. Alex and Zoe both work at Bear State Bank — Alex, in Jonesboro, and Zoe, in Little Rock. The Gowens’ younger daughter, Denisha Young, 45, and her husband, Chance Young, live in Monticello with their 3-year-old daughter, Chloe. “We have a great family,” Jim Gowen Sr. said.

It is very disappointing that the Express-News allows its obvious bias against our president to raise its ugly head every opportunity it gets. In doing so, you promote the damaging and divisive hatred that has taken over our country. Shame on you! You have a professional duty to help maintain and encourage self-control and polite discourse. Your publication does not promote maturity or patriotism. Adele Barnett Nepotism in action Re: “Ivanka to get classified info,” Nation Briefs, March 21: I wasn’t aware that we elected Ivanka as part of Trump’s entourage, nor is she technically a government employee. According to her attorney and ethics advisor, Jamie Gorelick, Ivanka will not have an official title, yet will get a “ West Wing” office, government-issued communication devices and security clearance to access classified information ...” Scary … Nepotism at its highest. Anne Turner There you have it I think we all have finally found common ground with the new health care proposal. The three main things which we can all agree as the most important are: 1. We would rather have people die than provide them health care. 2. We want the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and his family to have the best insurance available. 3. It is more important to give rich people tax breaks than it is to make sure all families can go to the doctor. As George Bush would say, mission accomplished. Mark Porter Scary scenario I tried to imagine the dilemma of a missile launch officer who might, one day, receive a launch order from the president. The launch officer, while preparing the deadly projectile, recalls that this order comes from a man who claimed he lost the popular vote because of 3 to 5 million votes cast illegally. He recalls this man tweeting about an attack on Sweden. He recalls this man claiming that then-President Obama had tapped his phone during the election. He has to ponder the deadly seriousness of the order he has just received. Has the order been thoroughly vetted? Should he wait for further verification? This is what happens when we wonder if a president, the leader of the most powerful, dynamic and respected nation in the world, has the temperament for the job. Will our country be all right? Bobby Riley Indeed an angel With all the turmoil going on these days, it’s nice to know we still have good people in our community who will do the right thing. My wife called me yesterday in a panic after she couldn’t find her wallet while trying to check out at a local Walmart. She had previously made a purchase at a nearby Dollar Tree, so I suggested she go back there to see if it may have been found. Before she could get to the store, I got a call at home from a lady who had found the wallet in the parking lot. Vicky looked us up online based on my wife’s driver’s license information and contacted me to arrange for retrieval. She and her mom waited patiently for my wife to arrive and made the exchange. Thank you, Vicky … you are indeed an angel! Oh by the way, Vicky is African-American and we are Caucasian, proving once again that real goodness is colorblind. Jim Whitmore, New Braunfels Wide world of sweat Re: “Clump bias together,” Henry McLeish, Opinion, March 19: I agree with the letter writer on his suggestion that certain sections of the paper be offered as separate subscriptions “for those who don’t want, need or respect” the material. I would subscribe to Section A that would include the op-ed pieces, however, because I enjoy and learn from the content therein. I don’t always agree, but I come away feeling as if I’ve had a provocative conversation with educated, intelligent people. The section subscription I would decline, and would really, really appreciate it if it were offered as such, is the Sports section. I’ve had it with sweaty, hairy armpits, ugly, scraggly beards, gun show ads, escort, er, companion service ads, and whatever else constitutes the predominantly sweaty guy world glorified in the Sports section. True, I don’t have to look at it, but I’m not happy having to pay for it. Françoise Wilson, Kerrville Campaign pledges Re: “Britain’s Brexit and America’s Trump” Editorial on March 19: The final sentence of Henry McLeish’s long diatribe against Britain and, in part, the U.S., refutes his entire elitist argument. Putting the people’s interests first is what both Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump campaigned upon and, once elected, are endeavoring to carry out. John Flanagan Let them eat cake What I find most distasteful about the current health care repeal is that Congress (and we, the people) appear to have forgotten that members of Congress can exempt themselves from the very legislation they expect others to follow. And they can create their own health care programs for themselves and their families. Instead of lecturing the people on the importance of making good lifestyle choices, getting better paying jobs, and saving for future health care needs, I say Congress should waive use of their own personal health care policies until all their constituents have full medical coverage.

GameStop revealed in its recent earnings report that total global sales were down 13.6 percent to $3.05 billion. Drilling down deeper, the company said hardware sales slid 29.1 percent while sales of new software dropped by 19.3 percent. Pre-owned sales outperformed new video game sales which were down 6.7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter although one can’t help but wonder if this metric is a result of its own questionable employee guidelines. GameStop noted that the fourth quarter was significantly impacted by weak sales of certain AAA titles as well as aggressive console promotion from other retailers on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Increased overall competition from stores like Best Buy and Walmart in addition to continued encroachment from digital marketplaces have also impacted retail sales, one would think. The company said it is planning to close between two and three percent of its stores worldwide, or at least 150 or so locations, over the course of 2017. At present, GameStop operates more than 7,500 stores across 14 countries. GameStop took a beating on the stock market Friday with shares falling 13.61 percent on the news. As of writing (mid-Saturday), they’ve regained just 0.63 percent of their value.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Linda Davidson. 1 of 2 By Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan Denton Record-Chronicle The Washington Post Published: 25 March 2017 11:53 PM Views divide neighbors in rural Valley View VALLEY VIEW -- At 4:30 a.m. on a windy Monday, Tamara Estes swallows vitamin B12 for energy and krill oil for her arthritic fingers. Even with her nightly Ambien, she is always up before the sun, getting ready for a job that reminds her of what infuriates her about America. She drives a school bus on a route that winds through a North Texas neighborhood filled with unauthorized Mexicans. She picks up nearly 100 of their children and drops them off at public schools funded by American taxpayers. By her. One immigrant family lives in the house next door, and in the dark hours before dawn, they are also stirring. As the father leaves for his job at a construction site, the mother is scrambling eggs and scooping them into warm tortillas. They have been working in America for two decades without legal status, but their four children were born here and are U.S. citizens -- or, as Estes and President Donald Trump call them, "anchor babies." The eldest, Rainier Corral, 15, emerges from his bedroom carrying a book bag and a trumpet case. He's a 188-pound rock of a kid who plays lineman on the high school football team, a top-notch student who wants to study mechanical engineering at Texas A&M University. Rainier's family has always believed in the promise of America, where they saved enough to buy their own home and their kids go to good schools. But now that Trump is threatening to deport millions -- and even change the law that gave their children U.S. citizenship -- they are filled with fear. Estes, meanwhile, is filled with new hope. For years, she has felt she was living the American Dream in reverse, her life sliding backward, in part, she believes, because unauthorized immigrants take good jobs and drive up her taxes. Now she thinks her life will improve because Trump is promising to "take our country back." This is what divides them at the dawn of the Trump era: For the president to keep his promise to millions of working-class white voters like Estes, he is threatening millions of working-class immigrants like the family next door. Frustrated It's 20 miles to the school-bus depot and, as Estes drives, she flips on conservative talk radio, where she gets most of her news. She tunes to KSKY-AM (660) and Mark Davis, who is praising Trump, trashing liberals and making Estes nostalgic for better days. "I wish we could go back to a time when we could live, not just exist, when everything wasn't a struggle," she says. Estes is 59, divorced and earns $24,000 a year. With four days left to payday, she has $118.72 in her checking account. She earns a bit too much to qualify for most government assistance but too little to buy health insurance. When she broke her arm last year, she wrapped it in a $15 drugstore brace and popped ibuprofen for a month. The way she sees it, life is easier for unauthorized Mexican immigrants than for taxpaying, working-class white Americans. As her life has gotten harder, she believes the fortunes of "illegals" have been rising, and that she's paying for it. Little galls her more than "anchor babies," who are entitled to government benefits, including Medicaid, public schools and food assistance. Estes resents paying for their safety net when she feels she has none. "I can't seem to pull my status back up where it was 20 years ago," she says. "Some of it's my fault. Some of it's not." The United States has been granting "birthright citizenship" to babies born on its soil, regardless of their parents' legal status, since just after the Civil War. Congress and the states adopted the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868, primarily to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. Over the past three decades, every other developed economy in the world except Canada has abandoned or restricted birthright citizenship amid rising flows of immigrants and refugees. But in America, it remains. In 2014, 7 percent of U.S. births -- about 275,000 babies -- were to parents illegally in the United States, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. In Texas, unauthorized immigrants accounted for a quarter of deliveries paid for by Medicaid in 2015 -- more than 54,000 babies -- according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The cost to taxpayers: $116 million. Defenders of birthright citizenship say that integrating immigrants is part of what makes the United States exceptional and that denying these babies citizenship would create a huge new underclass of people living outside the law. Critics say it encourages unauthorized immigration and drains public resources. Everywhere Estes looks, she's reminded that her country is changing. White enrollment in Texas schools recently dipped below 30 percent. Hispanics are the new majority; Pew estimates that more than 13 percent of Texas students are the children of undocumented parents. Estes wants a better-paying job but says it's hard to get one these days if you speak only English. Increasingly, the first question in any job interview is, "Habla espaÃ±ol?" So when Trump started talking about deporting unauthorized immigrants who "compete directly against vulnerable American workers," Estes went to his rallies and stuck a Trump sign on her lawn. She has come to be known as the "Trump Lady" on her school bus, which on this Monday morning approaches its first rider, a tiny kindergartner wearing a purple backpack. "Love you!" the little girl says in English to her Spanish-speaking mother. For two hours, Estes picks up dozens of children. They chatter in the seats behind her in Spanish, a language she doesn't understand. She boils inside about her tax dollars paying for their education. But she likes the kids, and she can't afford to lose this job. So she smiles and says, over and over: "Careful on the stairs." "Have a good day, y'all." Worried As Estes heads to work, Rainier is in the kitchen next door, checking his phone for news. "Quieres caf?" his mother, Azucena Reyes, 34, asks him, as she stirs eggs on the stove. "No, thanks," he says in English, waving off coffee to check the Young Turks news site on YouTube, where today's headline is "Trump's Deportation Force Unleashed." Rainier was born four months after Reyes, then 18, entered the United States on a tourist visa hoping to give her child a better life than the one he would have faced in her poor mining town in Durango, Mexico. He has always felt fully American, no different from his white classmates. But now, in this county that voted 83 percent for Trump, he suddenly hears people spitting out: "Go back to your own country," or "Go mow a lawn." Rumors about deportations are flying. Reyes heard from a friend that immigration agents were arresting people at Wal-Mart. Others say it was at a different store. Or at roadblocks. The family stays home more often now but still went to church the day before, joining 1,400 others at a Spanish-language Catholic Mass. Their pastor says many more are choosing to skip Mass, worried that federal agents might stake out the church. Reyes is worried, too, but said she and her family agreed to be interviewed for this story because they want people to better understand the immigrants who are being threatened with deportation. Amid so much "uncertainty and fear," she says, "I hope we can do some good." What's happening now doesn't seem fair to Rainier. Americans hire the unauthorized to build their houses, pick their crops, mow their lawns, wash their dishes. They're happy to take the hard, low-paying jobs nobody else wants. In return, they'd like to live without fear of being deported. Rainier says families like his are being targeted for problems they have not created. "Most of them are just normal people that are trying to get a better way of life," Rainier says. "It's one thing to deport people who have criminal records -- that's fine. It's another thing to deport families that haven't done anything wrong." Most economists do not blame unauthorized immigrants for the decline of the U.S. working class. They argue that immigrants boost the nation's fortunes by filling undesirable jobs at low pay, cutting the cost of many goods and services. Rainier's parents have worked for years cleaning homes, working in a glue factory, installing bathroom partitions, nailing baseboards. Four years ago, they pooled their life savings to buy their little house, paying $40,000 in cash at a foreclosure sale. They now pay $1,700 a year in property tax. They file federal returns on income of about $30,000 in a good year, including withholdings for Social Security and Medicare -- benefits they are unlikely ever to receive. Nationwide, unauthorized immigrants pay about $11.7 billion a year in state and local income, sales and property taxes, including about $1.5 billion in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. And more than 4 million people who do not have Social Security numbers -- most of them unauthorized immigrants -- file federal tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Rainier's family has been trying for two decades to become legal. Since 1997, his father, Nicolas Nevarez, 38, has had an application pending for a resident visa through his father, an unauthorized worker granted U.S. citizenship under Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty program. Last year, the U.S. issued only 801 visas in his category -- a Mexican married adult child of a U.S. citizen -- out of a waiting list of more than 204,000. His lawyer tells him to be patient. "I'm trying to do everything right," Nevarez says. "But 20 years?" Nevarez and Reyes have no health insurance and constantly worry about getting sick, although their children are eligible for Medicaid. When Rainier needed knee surgery last year, it was fully covered. Many jobs Estes grew up in Dallas, in a grand home with a built-in pool. She even had a horse. Her mother died when she was 4. She lived with her father, a small-business owner who drove a red Thunderbird convertible. Her father died when she was 19. She quickly married and, by 26, was divorced and had two kids. She has worked a lifetime of jobs that have paid less and less. She was a scrub tech at a medical clinic, a courier carrying blueprints for a developer, a shuttle driver for a casino. Years ago, she moved an hour north of Dallas, where she could afford a tiny house on a two-acre plot carved from a vast expanse of wheat fields. Now she is almost 60, raised in upper-middle-class comfort and living in working-class stress. Estes regrets not going to college and becoming a veterinarian. On the radio, she hears that good jobs for people with only a high school diploma have been stolen by globalization and automation: China and robots. She knows that it may take Trump more time to bring those jobs back. But she's thrilled that he is moving on his promise to kick out the "illegals." By the time Estes finishes her route and arrives home, the sun has already set. Her headlights splash across her little house, and her dogs start barking. She breeds Doberman pinschers for extra cash. Minutes later, Nevarez pulls into his driveway. The daily routines are similar in these two small, prefabricated houses on a flat road paved into the prairie. Both families raise chickens and dogs, work long days for little pay and pray for better at church on Sunday. In four years, the neighbors have barely spoken. Once, Nevarez and some other Mexican immigrants helped Estes dig a grave for one of her dogs. She seemed friendly enough. But then the Trump sign appeared on her lawn, and the distance between them grew. Estes says her opposition to "illegals" isn't personal. When she needs help around the house, she says, her Hispanic neighbors offer before "my white neighbors do." She doesn't want the kids on her bus to think she is heartless for supporting deportation raids. But she says something has to change. She flips on the TV. She has recorded eight hours of inauguration coverage on C-SPAN and a two-hour History Channel documentary on Trump, which she now starts watching. "They are losers! They are babies!" Trump is shouting. She laughs. He sure is entertaining. Trump's booming voice fills her small house: "The working class is going to strike back!" "Yes," Estes says. "Yes!"

Governor after governor proposed what they considered the answer to upstate's economic woes, but program after program came up short. Gov. Andrew Cuomo was determined to change that when he took office in 2011. Cuomo has increased state subsidies, launched several bold initiatives and crisscrossed the state to announce state-funded projects he frequently described as "game-changers." "The past four years we have focused on upstate New York and economic development like never before," the governor said in his 2015 state address. More Information The upstate economy remains sluggish, however. Job growth for the state as a whole wasn't too far off the national average, 9.6 percent for New York compared with 11 percent nationwide, between December 2010, the month before Cuomo took office, and December 2016. But most of that job growth occurred downstate. The number of jobs upstate has increased by only 2.7 percent during the Cuomo years. What's more, 88 percent of the net jobs added upstate have been in low-wage sectors, led by restaurants and bars, employment data shows. "The policies Cuomo says are focused on upstate and he claims have improved upstate were not the right policies and have not worked," said E.J. McMahon, research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative watchdog group. Investigative Post, ProPublica, and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism teamed up to assess the state's economic development efforts since Cuomo took office in 2011. The work included developing a database to track nearly 16,000 subsidy deals involving 12 of the state's largest economic development programs and local industrial development agencies. An analysis of employment data, interviews with dozens of public officials and others, and a review of reports and audits of subsidy programs conducted by the state comptroller and watchdog organizations indicate the state's substantial investment in the upstate economy has not generated many jobs. The research also found that economic development programs suffer from a lack of transparency and objective analysis to determine their effectiveness. Indeed, the state does an arguably poor job of vetting subsidy recipients to determine their history of compliance with federal and state regulators. Some companies have also used their influence to tap into a variety of subsidy programs, or placed executives on decision-making bodies that help determine how tax breaks and other forms of assistance are awarded. The upstate economy has long suffered from a loss of both population and the manufacturing jobs that were once its bedrock. Experts note that economic development deals can only go so far in counteracting those forces. That hasn't stopped elected officials from trying. Both state and local economic development agencies have ramped up spending on subsidy programs since Cuomo took office. In the last fiscal year the total subsidies hit a record $8.6 billion, according to a calculation by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group that tracks state spending. The governor has also introduced a handful of bold economic development programs, several of which failed spectacularly. His decision to empower former SUNY Polytechnic president Alain Kaloyeros to manage several upstate, big-ticket projects built at taxpayer expense has mired Cuomo's administration in scandal, culminating in criminal charges against developers and state officials, including Kaloyeros. It's also left many planned developments in limbo. The Start-Up New York program, which Cuomo said would "supercharge" the upstate economy by creating tax-free zones for businesses locating near college campuses, has been widely criticized for meager job creation despite heavy state spending to advertise it. Furthermore, the investigation found that New York under Cuomo continues to pursue costly trophy projects. In fact, no state in the nation has helped finance more of these megadeals. Empire State Development, the state's primary economic development agency, declined requests for an interview with ESD President and CEO Howard Zemsky or another senior official. Growth in subsidies While Cuomo has worked to slow the pace of state spending since taking office, the cost of state and local subsidy programs has grown. The value of subsidies awarded at the state and local level rose from $7.9 billion for fiscal year 2011 to $8.6 billion for the most recent fiscal year that concluded last March. The state's share of that grew from $3.7 billion to $4 billion during that period. Cuomo's proposed state budget for the upcoming fiscal year calls for $644 million in additional economic development spending and $1.5 billion in tax credits. The sheer number of subsidy programs helps explain New York's largesse. There are property and sales tax abatements. Discounted power programs. Cash grants. State budget allocations to build and equip facilities for companies. And a growing number of state tax credits. The Tax Reform and Fairness Commission empaneled by Cuomo reported that the number of state tax credit programs had grown from nine in 1994 to 50 in 2013, the year it issued its report. Relatively few companies reap most of the benefits from these programs. "A small number of taxpayers account for the vast majority of tax credits claimed," the commission reported. A report issued about the same time by ALIGN, an economic justice research and advocacy organization, found that only 4 percent of businesses receive subsidies, many of them large, out-of-state corporations such as Target and Walmart. The state's penchant for costly projects also contributes to New York's high spending on subsidies. A database maintained by Good Jobs First, a national subsidy research organization, indicates that of 306 projects that received at least $50 million in public subsidies since 2000 no state has earmarked more for these so-called "megadeals" than New York. The Empire State committed $11.8 billion for 24 megadeals, followed by Michigan ($9.9 billion) and Louisiana ($9.6 billion). No other state spent more than $4.1 billion. Only a half-dozen of New York's megadeals took place downstate. The six costliest deals benefited businesses located upstate and include Alcoa in Massena, GlobalFoundries near Albany, and SolarCity in Buffalo. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, said megadeals are "guaranteed losers for taxpayers." The government can never hope to recoup its investment through increased tax revenues, he said, shifting the tax burden for public services to other taxpayers. So why do megadeals remain popular? "They're catnip for politicians," LeRoy said. Major effort's woes Cuomo's boldest initiative attempted to turn the state's traditional approach to economic development on its head by going even harder after megadeals. To that end, Cuomo sought to replicate a model used by Kaloyeros to develop a nanotechnology sector in the Albany region. It's an unusual approach that involves taxpayers shouldering the cost of building and equipping advanced manufacturing facilities for a company recruited in exchange for job guarantees. The task of exporting the Albany model across Upstate was entrusted to Kaloyeros and two state-affiliated nonprofit corporations he controlled. Problems soon ensued. The two development corporations, citing their nonprofit status, contended they were exempt from the state's Open Meetings and Freedom of Information laws. The development corporations also maintained they were not required to follow state procurement policies. The outcome? Developers who were major Cuomo campaign contributors were awarded lucrative contracts with hardly any competition. Last September, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed criminal charges of bribery and bid-rigging against Kaloyeros, top former Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco, and private developers in Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany.

By then, the wheels had fallen off several other deals he brokered across upstate. Projects in Rochester, Utica and Dunkirk have been delayed, scaled back or shelved altogether. Meanwhile, a $15 million facility built outside Syracuse to serve as a filmmaking hub stands all but unused. Mixed results Start-Up New York, another of the governor's marquee initiatives, has also floundered. State officials said the program, which allows companies to operate tax-free for 10 years by locating near university campuses, would lure businesses to upstate. The governor said it would "give New York an edge like never before" in attracting companies. But Start-Up New York created just 408 jobs in its first two years of operation, despite the state spending more than $53 million dollars to advertise it. In the coming budget year, the governor proposes rebranding the program, reducing the number of jobs companies must promise to create and revising the eligibility criteria to focus more on genuine startups. State officials still say the program will create around 4,000 new jobs over the next few years. Another of Cuomo's new initiatives, a system of 10 regional economic development councils that compete for state funding, has played to mixed reviews. A 2015 report by the Citizens Budget Commission found that inadequate reporting made it almost impossible to tell how well projects were doing. Of the fraction of projects for which employment figures were available, none created as many jobs as promised, the report found. Another report in 2016 found that although all 10 regions prioritized manufacturing in their development plans, six still lost manufacturing jobs between 2010 and 2015. "The results suggest it may be time for REDCs to rethink their strategies," the report concluded. Brian McMahon, executive director of the New York State Economic Development Council, disagrees. "Overall, I think the REDCs have been effective," he said. "They have worked because they brought together opinion leaders to talk and develop strategies around economic development." LeRoy, of Good Jobs First, said the combination of high spending and modest job growth, warrants New York an overall grade of "D minus." "Just because you throw money at the problem doesn't mean you solve the problem. The question is, are you spending the money the right way?"

John Heller/Post-Gazette Ten-year-old Brooke Koutsogiani creates slime at her home in Peters Township. By Anya Sostek / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Brooke Koutsogiani has an Etsy shop, nearly 1,000 Instagram followers, a designated work space and a corporate logo. She’s 10. And selling slime. The Peters fourth-grader is one of thousands of teens and tweens leading a gooey resurgence of the substance first manufactured as a Mattel toy in the 1970s. While slime has had many sticky subplots in American culture, from “Ghostbusters” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” to umpteen Nickelodeon shows, this iteration is prettier and fancier — often homemade with the help of YouTube videos. Brooke, like many other kids, isn’t just making slime but also selling it — to her friends, door-to-door in her neighborhood and online through her slimeyomg Etsy shop, where she offers varieties such as scented gingerbread slime, birthday cake slime and lilac-scented cream cheese slime (all non-edible). The start of the current slime craze has been hard to pinpoint. Leen Nsouli, who tracks sales of office supplies for the NPD Group, a New York-based market research company, wonders if some of it might have been kicked off by the “Ghostbusters” reboot last summer. Whatever the initial impulse, she said, slime has taken off on social media, noting that there are more than 2 million #slime posts on Instagram. How-to slime videos are in abundance on YouTube, including one with more than 2.5 million views from “Dance Moms” star and former Murrysville resident Mackenzie Ziegler (Maddie’s little sister). The ingredients in a basic slime recipe are glue, borax and water, with optional additives such as shaving cream, lotion or food coloring to change its appearance, smell or consistency. Slime is a “non-Newtonian fluid” formed when the long polymer chains of molecules in glue combine with borax, creating “bonds between the chains that lock them up so they can’t bend as much,” said Katie Brunecz of the Carnegie Science Center, which hosted about 200 kids for a “Slime Sleepover” last weekend. In Moon, sisters Peyton and Emma Perry demonstrate the process in less than 5 minutes on their kitchen island, mixing glue with a borax and water solution, adding lotion and glitter, and kneading the goopy slime with their fingers until it begins to hold together. Their first attempt at making slime in December was a failure, possibly because they tried to use regular laundry detergent instead of borax. But in January, while her mom and 13-year-old Emma were out at the Twenty One Pilots concert that she was deemed too young to attend, 10-year-old Peyton tried again at her grandmother’s house, with much more success. And she was hooked. “It was the funnest thing I ever felt,” she said, while stretching and popping a white “stretchy slime.” Once Peyton got the hang of it, she began selling slime to her classmates at Moon Area Middle School. And that got her older sister’s attention. “At first, she was making it on her own,” said Emma. “Then I figured out she was actually making money.” The two have made about $70 in profit so far, brainstorming ways to make their product stand out from the other kids at their school also selling slime. They have bought fancy cases for their $5 slime ($2 will get you slime in a plastic bag) and embellishments like googly eyes for their “monster slime,” red glitter for their top-selling “Valentine’s slime” and special luminescent paint for their “glow-in-the-dark slime.” Emma often markets their slime on Snapchat. “It’s fully customizable,” she said. “If you want red slime with glitter we will do that for you.” “Business-wise, they’ve learned a lot,” said their mother, Debby Perry, a publisher of websites including Macaroni Kid. “And they’re working together.” Money from the slime fad isn’t just going into the pockets of grade-schoolers. Sales of liquid Elmer’s glue, widely regarded as the best glue for slime production, more than doubled in retail stores in the last four weeks of 2016 compared to the same period the previous year, said Caitlin Watkins, a company spokeswoman. Sales of all types of glue were up nearly 40 percent in the first three weeks of February compared to those weeks last year, said Ms. Nsouli of the NPD Group. That demand has made glue hard to find on store shelves. Giant Eagle, for example, is recommending that customers seeking to purchase glue call ahead to ensure availability. “Like many retailers, we have recently noticed increased demand for glue that has impacted the overall availability of the product,” said company spokesman Dick Roberts. Peyton recounted going from Walmart to Walgreens to CVS in search of glue, with little success. She finally was able to stock up at Kmart, though she thought twice before letting a reporter in on that secret. “No one had hit them yet,” she said. “It was like glue heaven.” Elmer’s has increased production of its most popular slime-making glues, while other retailers also try to capitalize on the phenomenon. “We’ve Got You Covered ... In SLIME!” tweeted Office Depot’s corporate account on Thursday. Michaels has installed “Slime Headquarters” on aisle endcaps, with displays sporting glue and slime mix-ins like beads and glitter. All that slime has become a distraction in some schools, such as Ross Elementary School in the North Hills, where the principal noted the popularity of it among “kids with an entrepreneurial spirit” in an email newsletter asking parents to keep it at home. Though there have been scattered concerns about the toxicity of borax, the medical director of the Pittsburgh Poison Center said that hasn’t been much of an issue here. “We don’t see a lot of patients or kids with kids presenting with adverse effects,” said Michael Lynch, noting that it shouldn’t be inhaled or ingested. “It’s not a common toxic exposure.” Brooke, the Peters fourth grader, first tried to make slime this fall after she heard about it from a friend of her 12-year-old sister. That effort was unsuccessful, also perhaps for lack of borax, but Brooke kept at it, finding success with her own recipe developed just by feel. “I showed all my friends and they were like, ‘Make me some, I need some,’ ” she said. And so her Peters slime factory began. Brooke whips up a batch of slime nearly every day, in a designated spot in her basement that her parents directed her to after they were tired of seeing trails of slime in bathrooms, and after a failed experiment making an entire gallon at once did a number on the dining room carpet. When she started selling it, she came up with the name slimeyomg and downloaded an app to make herself a logo. Her father, John Koutsogiani, helped her calculate costs to set a slime price of $1 per ounce. She’s been donating her profits to the United Way, in part because her parents pay for her slime supplies, which include eye shadow for a tint with a pearl sheen, Japanese clay for her thick “butter slime” and foaming hand lotions for scent. As for the longevity of the slime craze, Ms. Nsouli wonders if the popularity of slime may wane as the weather gets warmer and outdoor activities take precedence. As for the Perry sisters in Moon, the end of slime is hard for 10-year-old Peyton to imagine. “Nooooo,” she said. “I love it.” To that, her 13-year-old sister shrugged. She’ll be into slime, Emma said, “as long as we keep selling.” Anya Sostek: asostek@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1308.

Gonzaga breaks through to the Final Four, eliminating last reason people had to discount the program Originally published March 25, 2017 at 8:24 pm Updated March 25, 2017 at 9:14 pm The one thing missing from the Zags’ resume as a college basketball power was a spot in the Final Four, something the Bulldogs took care of by running through Xavier. Share story SAN JOSE — With a minute to go and Gonzaga’s long-awaited but oh-so-elusive regional title finally, blissfully secure, Mark Few pulled his starters out of the game, en masse. Then he hugged Nigel Williams-Goss, and all the emotion of this Zags breakthrough hit him with the force of a Przemek Karnowski screen. “Tears, absolute tears of joy,’’ he would say afterward. Few went down the line of players, hugging each one, thanking them for the sacrifices they had made, the “leap of faith,” in the case of transfers such as Williams-Goss, Jordan Mathews and Johnathan Williams, who gave up points and minutes to join Gonzaga. Saturday National semifinal, East champion vs. Gonzaga (36-1) at Glendale, Ariz., TBA And Few had one other message that he whispered to each jubilant player as they were in the process of celebrating the Zags’ 83-59 romp over Xavier: “We might as well win it all.” Related story Gonzaga advances to first Final Four, blasting Xavier in West Regional final Everything is possible for a Gonzaga team that looked every bit the powerhouse that many were unwilling to concede them to be. All day, Few said, he had a good feeling, quietly confident that this was the team to get them to the promised land. He couldn’t help but reflect on the start of his Gonzaga journey, 28 years ago, long before Dan Monson started the Zags on one of the most unlikely rises in NCAA history in 1999, and before Few brought them to even greater heights in his 18 years as Monson’s successor. “My first year on the staff, we won four Division I games,’’ he said incredulously. “I mean, this wasn’t even possible. And each year, we got better and better, and then we got really, really good.” And now they’re legitimately great, no longer having to apologize for the conference they play in or the myth that they can’t win the big one. Xavier coach Chris Mack paid tribute to Gonzaga, lauding a defense that held one of the hottest teams in the tournament to 35.5 percent shooting, and an offense that can beat you from the outside if, as the Musketeers did, you try to take away the inside muscle of Karnowski and fellow 7-footer Zach Collins. “Sometimes,’’ Mack said, “you just lose to a better team.” That sentiment could be put on a continuous loop for a team that is now 36-1, its lone blemish a 79-71 loss to BYU. It’s enough to make a fellow dream as Gonzaga heads off to Phoenix for a semifinal matchup with either Florida or South Carolina. “I’m so impressed with how Villanova did last year,’’ Few said. “And we’re going to take the same approach. But these guys don’t know any different. That’s how they’ve been all year. Basically, we’ve had about five or seven minutes of not very good basketball, where we got away from what we’ve done against BYU, or we’d be looking at 37-0 right now.” Most Read Stories Rachel Dolezal struggling after racial-identity scandal in Spokane Aerospace firm Electroimpact agrees to pay $485K after AG finds ‘shocking’ discrimination against Muslims Wave goodbye: Live Seafair hydroplane-race TV coverage sputters out after 66 years  VIEW No repeal for 'Obamacare' — a humiliating defeat for Trump  VIEW Here's where the Seahawks stand in free agencyUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. When Xavier hit a six-game losing streak in February, Mack held a ritual in the locker room during practice one day. He gave each player a calendar of February, and then threw each page in a trash can and burned it. The ashes were placed in an urn purchased at Wal-Mart, and hauled to each practice and game as a reminder to look forward, not backward. Gonzaga can now symbolically burn all the postseason disappointments of prior years, even though it was never fair to have them obscure the monumental achievements of the program. Certainly, the roll call of past players — the Dickaus and Morrisons and Turiafs and Olynyks and Pangoses and Bells — who fell just short was front and center as the Zags went through the happy ritual of cutting down the net. Guard Josh Perkins went on the radio after the game with Matt Santangelo, now one of their broadcasters after playing on the ’99 team that first put Gonzaga on the map. “I told him, ‘Man, your team started this for us,’ ’’ Perkins said. “Without them, some people might not be in the locker room.” “Our culture is just so strong,’’ Few said. “And this was a culture win and a culture statement, and I couldn’t be prouder.” Gonzaga’s players, one after another, said they couldn’t be happier for Few, who no longer has to endure the endless questions about getting to the Final Four. Few has been steadfast in saying that he wanted to do it for his players, past and present, not for himself. But there was no question the victory was deeply felt. “Now that we’ve delivered on it, I mean, it’s just a total, total feeling of elation and happiness for these guys,’’ he said. “It just makes your heart warm to like 350 degrees Celsius or something. Maybe it’s Fahrenheit. It’s been awhile since I’ve been in class.” Gonzaga guard Silas Melson watched Few’s postgame television interview in which he lauded the team and his family but deflected praise for himself. “Coach deserves it,’’ Melson said. “Third-fastest to 500 wins, and people just totally blow that away because he hasn’t been to a Final Four. But they can’t say that no more. He puts everyone before himself, because that’s who he is. But also everyone knows Coach Few is happy on the inside. That’s a big milestone for him.” Someone asked Mathews if the victory validated the Gonzaga program. “Definitely not,’’ he answered firmly. “Gonzaga’s been a big-time program for 20 years now. People look at Gonzaga. They know what it is. They know what Bulldog means. “It’s not validation now that they’ve made a Final Four. Look at the past great teams, great players. … the Final Four doesn’t validate or discredit a season. It’s not an end-all be-all. Gonzaga has been a great program, and we’re just happy to keep carrying the torch.” Sitting near Mathews on the podium, Few nodded his head. “Amen, brother,’’ he said.

Michael Chevy Castranova The Gazette More stories from Michael Mar 25, 2017 at 8:09 pm | Print View There’s this joke I like about this guy who telephones his brother who now lives in another state, and he says, “Hey, Billy, our family cat, the one you grew up with, died last night.” And the brother gets upset and replies, “What’s wrong with you? Don’t just break bad news to me like that. Lead up to it gradually, a bit at a time. You know, sort of like, ‘Hey, Billy, I wanted to tell you, our cat is stuck up on the roof.’ Something like that.’” The first brother says, “Gee, you’re right, I’m sorry. I’ll keep that mind.” A couple weeks later, the guy calls his brother again, and he says, “Hey, Billy, I wanted to tell you, grandma’s stuck up on the roof …. ” Retail in Eastern Iowa and across the country isn’t exactly stuck up on a roof. But in some cases, it looks pretty close. In just the past few weeks alone, I’ve scoured the websites and reached out to corporate communications people to get local updates for business stories for The Gazette on what’s happening with Gordmans, Staples, Gander Mountain and J.C. Penney. All those chains have operations here in the Corridor and all have announced they’ll be shutting down locations. Each time, I’ve asked pretty much the same question: What’s happening with your stores here? Sometimes, the corporate answer was, We’ll let you know when we know. Staples early this month said it would close 70 of its stores in North America. Right now it operate brick-and-mortar locations in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City in our neck of the woods. The Framingham, Mass., chain’s hard times got harder when the feds stymied its plan to merge with Office Depot, citing antitrust reasons — to the surprise of some given the declining foot traffic for buying office supplies. On March 6, Omaha, Neb.-based Gordmans said that part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy, it would close all 106 stores, including its venues in Cedar Rapids, Coralville and Waterloo. And then there’s Gander Mountain of St. Paul, Minn., which on March 10 — after national news wire services reported it was getting ready to file for chapter 11 — announced it would turn out the lights on 32 “underperforming” stores. A spokesman told me none of the venues of the chopping block were in Iowa. And it still plans to move into the under-construction 52,000-square-foot anchor store on Blairs Ferry Road NE. On March 17, Plano, Texas-headquartered J.C. Penney finally put out a list of the 138 stores it will be shutting down over the next several months. Four will be in Iowa, but none in the Corridor. Those marked for darkness are in Decorah, Fort Dodge, Oskaloosa and Ottumwa. For each vacated building, that’s another big chunk of commercial real estate not paying property taxes. A number of industry observers have suggested in recent months that grocery stores can be the answer for luring shoppers to ailing malls — enclosed and strip alike. That’s not an always-winning solution, though — while Lucky’s Market moved into part of Von Maur’s former location in the strip mall once known as Sycamore in Iowa City, the 24,000-square-foot space that housed Fresh Market on Blairs Ferry, on Cedar Rapids’s northeast side, remains silent. All is not lost in the retail world, though. Market Watch columnist Philip Van Doorn listed 10 chains that are doing reasonably OK these days, including Lowe’s, Foot Locker, O’Reilly Automotive, Dollar Tree and, of course, Wal-Mart. And then there’s this: The CIT Retail Outlook survey, put together by the Harris Poll people and released in November 2016, characterized its respondents’ confidence level as “bullish.” While they admitted that “brand strength and popularity of prominent retailers is steadily eroding … many may not exist three years from now.” And yet, many of them at that time believed they’d have a merry Christmas, sales-wise — which they didn’t, as it turned out. Moreover, “They also have plans to continue that growth for the next three years and to increase hiring for next year, especially in the internet/mobile category,” the survey found. That’s the thing about retailers, and why we cannot count them out so easily or early. They are an optimistic bunch. For them, the sun’ll always come out tomorrow. ---------- — Our Iowa Ideas symposia continue to roll out.

Mansfield University's deeply rural location has caused enrollment drops and financial problems, and those two factors put it on short list for possible merger or closure. Steve EsackContact ReporterCall Harrisburg Bureau Mansfield University: A Solomon's choice between tight state finances or community benefit in study to consoli Except for the road itself, humanity's mark is hard to see along the main north-south highway that runs through Pennsylvania's Northern Tier. Mountains dominate here. Forest-covered peaks — oak, maple and white pine — stretch to the horizon and rock walls hem in the road that runs around, over and down mountains at ear-pounding elevations. This craggy wilderness, devoid of industrial parks and subdivisions, surrounds U.S. Route 15 for miles and miles. Just when the isolation feels thickest, the mountains give way to civilization when the brick buildings of Mansfield University appear above a tiny crossroads town of the same name in Tioga County. "This is a very sparsely populated area," university President Fran Hendricks said. "We are in a region by ourselves. We are far from an urban center." That location — ideal for the hamlets that sprang up during the 19th century's timber and agricultural booms — now threatens the university's survival in its 160th year. Decades of reduced state funding, rising personnel costs, changing demographics and a student trend toward urban universities have chipped away at Mansfield's financial stability. With the second-lowest enrollment among the 14 universities overseen by the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, the school is more vulnerable than most to a full or partial closure should that recommendation come after a systemwide sustainability study. Why some Pennsylvania public universities are in danger of closing STAFF REPORT The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education could shut down or consolidate some of its 14 universities.

(STAFF REPORT) Should Mansfield close, the ripple effect across this rural region could be devastating economically and in other ways, interviews and data show. "I'm from Johnstown and I know what happened because of the total shutdown of steel," said Barry Denk, director of the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a nonpartisan legislative agency that serves the House and Senate. "In this instance, when you look at the quality of life, the diversity of employment, with decent-paying jobs, and outreach any university does in terms of arts, cultural events, speaker series, that all affects the quality of life. That is the reality that must be considered in the event Mansfield does, in fact, close its doors."

Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education has hired a nonprofit with decades of experience in crisis management to lead a study that could recommend closing or merging campuses. Just don't call the Colorado-based National Center for Higher Education Management Systems the ax men of PASSHE.... (Steve Esack) Mansfield, historically reliant on local commuting students, has seen its enrollment plunge 38 percent to 2,198 since the fall 2009 semester as the overall population in the Northern Tier counties of Tioga, Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna and Wyoming has decreased and gotten older than the statewide and national medians. Among PASSHE schools, Mansfield's enrollment drop is second only to Cheyney University's nearly 50 percent loss of students in the same time period — and that could put those two schools at the top of the chopping block because all PASSHE schools are more reliant on student tuition and fees than taxpayer subsidies to meet operating expenses. Mansfield is not afraid of the PASSHE study, said Hendricks, a 1979 Mansfield graduate who became university president in 2012 following his retirement as an Air Force brigadier general. "The study is very much needed and, in fact, we welcome the study," he said in an interview in his office. "We are not afraid of merger or closure and, in fact, don't think about that as outcomes for us. We do like to think about recommendations that will be forthcoming regarding partnerships with schools, regionalization or centralization of services." Fortifying state schools The state System of Higher Education was created under a 1982 law to "provide high-quality education at the lowest possible cost to the students." But Harrisburg's commitment to that purpose has waned on a percentage basis while costs have risen and the pool of students has drained. In 1983-84, state tax dollars accounted for 63 percent of PASSHE's $384.1 million operating budget. This year, tax dollars equal 27 percent of PASSHE's $1.67 billion operating budget. The largest state funding drops and corresponding tuition increases occurred after the Great Recession beginning in 2007, resulting in state funding per full-time student falling by $724 to $4,052 this year. That is nearly three quarters lower than the national average — $6,966 per student — for publicly funded universities, PASSHE records show. Gov. Tm Wolf has recommended raising PASSHE's funding by 2 percent to $453 million. PASSHE Chancellor Frank Brogan has asked for a lot more. But money isn't PASSHE's only problem. Children are. PASSHE is ultrareliant on in-state students and there are not enough of them. Between 2007-08 and 2014-15, the number of children attending Pennsylvania's primary and secondary schools has dropped more than 6 percent to less than 2 million. Across PASSHE, that has translated into a 5 percent enrollment drop over the last decade. Mansfield's enrollment decline has been steeper because school districts in Tioga and neighboring counties lost 24 percent of their students between 2007-08 and 2015-16, state Department of Education records show. By comparison, West Chester University, in the expanding Philadelphia suburb of Chester County, is bursting with in-state students. And larger research institutions such as Penn State University and the University of Pittsburgh, which also receive state funding, make up for the drop of in-state student enrollments by registering more foreign students who pay full tuition, which helps stabilize their finances, the colleges' online records show. The downward shift in enrollment is a national trend and the demographic change caught all of higher education flatfooted, Hendricks said. "There are just less students," he said. Fewer students and rising costs are the main reasons Brogan launched the $400,000 sustainability study, which could lead to mergers, closures or curtailments. The goal of the study, to be completed this summer, is to make all universities viable and sustainable, PASSHE spokesman Kenn Marshall said. "But at the end of the day, if the study recommends mergers as the only way to go, we have to consider that," he said. The final recommendation will fall to the Legislature. State Rep. Matt Baker, R-Tioga, said PASSHE needs to make changes and he would prefer not to raise taxes to get them. The Legislature, he said, would better serve taxpayers by no longer shortchanging PASSHE schools by providing money to community colleges, private universities and the large semi-public research institutions of Penn State, Pitt and Temple University. "In difficult times we need to prioritize funding for what we own first and not try to be all things to all people," Baker said. "Politically, that might not be popular but it's the right thing to do." Financially, other lawmakers say, Mansfield's and Cheney's enrollment declines make them more ripe for curtailments. Mansfield is projected to run a $5 million deficit this year, and Cheyney, which is in Delaware County, needed an emergency $8 million infusion to cover expenses. Closing either would have political as well as educational and economic ramifications, given that Mansfield is in a conservative, predominantly white corner of the state and Cheyney is a historically black college outside Philadelphia. To soften the blow, lawmakers could choose to cut programs or majors at those schools. "It gives you a little bit of cover," said Chris Borick, a political science professor and pollster at private Muhlenberg College in Allentown. "If you do one in a part of the state that is predominantly conservative then it opens the Democratic governor up to why he made the choice. If you target the only predominately black school in PASSHE ... you are going to be scrutinized in a very deep way because of the racial implications." While Cheyney students would have options in the many colleges in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Mansfield students would be more limited. The closest four-year school is about 45 minutes away — Lycoming College, where tuition is nearly four times that of Mansfield. The closest PASSHE school, Lock Haven, is more than an hour away from Mansfield. Ultimately, lawmakers could face a Solomon's choice: Is it better to close struggling universities that are losing market share to strengthen PASSHE? Or is it better to keep those schools open to protect local communities that rely on them for education, jobs and other ancillary economic benefits? Those questions, Borick said, would present lawmakers with a decision equivalent to closing a mill or a factory that might employ a whole town. "It's not like when you take a 5 percent budget cut you have to work around," Borick said. "This is life-changing for towns, staff and students." Mansfield's history Some refer to the Northern Tier as God's country, 4,000 square miles of hilly beauty. An outdoor lover's paradise, it draws tourists interested in climbing, hiking and biking, especially in and around its most famous feature: Pine Creek Gorge, better known by its nickname — Pennsylvania's Grand Canyon. However, that rugged beauty also has made economic development tough. "Not much has changed here today, Prosperity never seems to stay," singer Van Wagner wrote in "North of 80," which he wrote in 2001. "One hundred miles off the map." That's where the Mansfield Classical Seminary set up in 1857, on an eastern hill overlooking a village that would be incorporated as Mansfield borough 37 days later. That was the same year the Legislature passed the Normal School Act of Pennsylvania to set up colleges that would train teachers to serve the state's burgeoning population in communities created by mills, farms, factories and coal mines. Mansfield became a state normal school in 1866 and developed a reputation for musical instruction and a strong football program, which recorded the nation's first game played under electric lights in 1892. "Our music education and performance is off the charts," Hendricks said. Its enrollment historically has not been. In the mid-1970s, the threat of closure first hit Mansfield after it failed to meet a recruitment goal of 4,000 students. After living that history, Hendricks, upon taking over his alma mater, commissioned an internal report that used Mansfield as the case study for the viability of the PASSHE system. The 2013 report highlighted Mansfield's ongoing financial and enrollment crunches. In response to its own report, Mansfield cut staff through attrition and expenses by more than $15 million since 2013. It also launched a marketing campaign that touts its frozen tuition levels, small class sizes and its status as the state's only officially designated public liberal arts university. "We are resetting the university to a smaller footprint, but our excellence will not wane at all," Hendricks said. "We are committed to student success and academic excellence. It's what we do." Other PASSHE schools, such as Kutztown University, Edinboro near Erie and Clarion out west, also are retooling. They face the same, albeit lighter, financial and enrollment strains while trying to attract students to campuses in small or rural communities that don't have much going for them beyond the universities themselves. An air of uncertainty floats in the mountain air. "It's unsettling," Peggy Dettwiler, Mansfield's choir director, said after taking a break from teaching her students, who soon will depart for a European tour. "But it makes me put more energy into making the experience better for students." Mansfield is a key player in the economy of Tioga County, which has a per capita income 39 percent lower than the state average of $49,745 and higher unemployment than the state rate of 5.2 percent, according to the state Department of Labor & Industry. With 365 employees, Mansfield University is the county's fifth largest employer, state records show. The county's other main employers are a regional hospital system, a pipe manufacturer, a school district, a trucking outfit and Wal-Mart. The Marcellus Shale gas drilling boom helped the area financially and allowed some to get well-paying jobs right out of high school, but there's a lull in drilling activity, Baker said. That makes the university's financial presence even more important for Tioga County and the surrounding region. "We are fully aware that it would be a drastic economic impact if the university closed," said Dawn Hull, executive director of the Mansfield Chamber of Commerce. Mansfield University generated an estimated $111.8 million for the region's economy through its spending as well as the income and sales taxes generated by employees, students and businesses, according to a 2015 PASSHE study. If accurate, that economic impact would be nearly seven times more than the $16.5 million in taxpayer funds the Legislature allocated to Mansfield this fiscal year. It also would be more than 2.5 times more than Mansfield's operating budget of about $44 million. "I can't imagine the state closing the university and allowing that devastation on this community," said Tom Oswald, who owns a bicycle shop on Main Street. "This place would be a ghost town if the university were to close." "This area is just barely surviving," added Bryan Berguson, director of member services at Tri-County Northern Electric, which has an office on Mansfield's Main Street. "You take away that many more jobs ... ," he said, his voice trailing. Walking from campus to Main Street to get food, Mansfield junior Hunter Brown, a math major and football player, said lawmakers have to strike a balance between taxes and economic development. Citing his own out-of-pocket expenses, he said, most Main Street shops would not exist without students spending money. "There's got to be an equilibrium," the 20-year-old York County native said. The community relies on students for more than money, said Alana Corradi, a 21-year-old senior from New Jersey. Students lead clothing and food drives and care for developmentally disabled people as part of their studies and community outreach, she said. "Without the university the town would get eviscerated," said Corradi, a social work major. But Mansfield's enrollment downturn cannot be ignored. It's too noticeable in the halls of the state Capitol and the few streets of Mansfield. "This is a college bar and I'm able to watch the school kids and it's like there's less and less," said Alison Johnson, manager of Changos Cantina and a 2008 Mansfield marketing graduate. "Honestly, this area does not have a lot to offer kids. It's like rural Pennsylvania." The location has made it hard for Mansfield to hold on to some students, especially those not from the area. Freshman Josh Wilson of Mifflinburg, Union County, said Mansfield's location can be challenging for some students. A handful of Wilson's friends this year transferred out of Mansfield or dropped out of college because they were tired of going back home every weekend to Mifflinburg for activities, said Wilson, a criminal justice major. "There's nothing to do," he said. The solitude can also be a blessing for students like Leron Strothers, 21, of Philadelphia. The junior mass communications major said he chose Mansfield because he had to get away and it was closer than the West Coast options he had. "It was easy for me to adapt," said Strothers, a member of the football and track teams who is active in the campus Black Student Union. "I've grown to like it but everything is uphill." steve.esack@mcall.com Twitter @sesack 717-783-7305 SOURCE: Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Colleges and Universities University of Pittsburgh Tom Wolf The Pennsylvania State University Though schools' future uncertain, PASSHE says students should still apply Breaking Popular Obits Top Workplaces Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds 43°

Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images During the 2016 campaign, the stock market was “with her” — when Hillary Clinton’s prospects improved, equities climbed. Summarizing the implications of the market’s behavior, one economist told Politico that a Trump victory would spur “major Brexit-style selling.” Then the incompetent demagogue won. And investors remembered that what’s bad for the American republic is often quite good for their portfolios. Specifically, Wall Street decided that Trump was all but certain to deliver a large tax cut to corporations — and business-friendly pushovers to America’s regulatory agencies — and that these two measures would (almost) certainly boost near-term profits (no matter how many Muslims the new president banned from the United States). These convictions — combined with the already solid performance of the Obama economy — produced a sustained rally for equities. Entering Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up 6 percent in 2017. By the time the closing bell struck, however, stocks had suffered their worst day since Donald Trump’s election. The Dow Jones fell around 240 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent. And Trump seems to be at least part of the reason why. “With the health-care morass, the Trump effect is taking a little bit of a backseat in peoples’ minds,” said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill LLC, told Bloomberg. “It feels like the market needs another catalyst. The catalysts had been coming largely from the Fed and the Trump effect. Something is spooking people.” On Tuesday, the president and his party’s leadership warned recalcitrant conservatives that failure to pass Trumpcare would jeopardize tax reform. Many of those conservatives then said that they would oppose Trump’s bill anyway. And some on Wall Street got spooked. Meanwhile, other investors are fretting that the House GOP’s approach to tax reform might hurt Walmart’s balance sheet: On Tuesday, GOP congressman Kevin Brady predicted that the border-adjustment tax — which would cut taxes on exporters and raise them on importers — would appear in the final version of his party’s corporate tax plan. Retail stocks proceeded to fall by nearly 2 percent. There’s little reason to think that the GOP can’t cut taxes without repealing Obamacare. And it’s hard to imagine that the border-adjustment provision will survive the Senate. Nonetheless, some investors are losing faith in Trump’s legislative prowess — and starting to worry that he won’t be able to redistribute as much income upward as they initially thought.

With this grant, THI will build Hunger Free Coalitions across the state, continue child nutrition program outreach and conduct university-based research to evaluate and improve upon its work. The new funding will allow THI to go deeper in its current efforts as well as expand on projects working to find long-term, community-driven solutions to hunger and poverty. More than 4.5 million individuals in Texas are food insecure. THI’s innovative model addresses the hunger problem at all levels – local, state and federal – by organizing systems and helping people work together to create more efficient and effective programs and policies that reduce hunger in Texas. “There is so much great work happening in Texas communities, but without coordination, this work is pushing upstream,” said THI senior director Jeremy Everett. “We fill a unique role. We are getting people to work together – nonprofits and legislators and businesses and state agencies – and it’s untangling some complicated systems, allowing local organizations to maximize their work and getting existing resources to the people that need them.” This model has proven to be successful for THI and its partners. Since 2009, 300,000 more students are eating breakfast at school every day, and 10 million more meals are served in school programs. In addition, there are 2,000 more summer meal sites in Texas that have served 21 million more meals each summer than compared with participation rates in 2009. In Waco, THI has partnered with organizations such as the McLennan County Hunger Coalition, Waco NAACP and Waco Regional Baptist Network, among others, to support child hunger programs and raise awareness about resources to address hunger in Waco and McLennan Country. During summer 2016, nine sponsors of the summer meals program in McLennan County operated 72 sites, which together served 147,456 lunches and a total of 226,146 meals, including breakfast and lunch. These increases mean that more children and families in local communities have access to nutritious meals. Along with its efforts to coordinate and support child nutrition programs, THI will be able to strengthen its efforts to build Hunger Free Communities across the state. These coalitions will bring together local individuals and organizations to foster collaboration, helping community members plan for and coordinate anti-hunger and anti-poverty efforts in their own cities and towns. “We are excited that our new funding from the Walmart Foundation will allow us to continue existing relationships and grow deeper roots in and with communities,” Everett said. “We are looking forward to continuing to work with Texans to better serve all of our neighbors.” ABOUT THE TEXAS HUNGER INITIATIVE Baylor University’s Texas Hunger Initiative (THI) is a capacity-building, collaborative project dedicated to developing and implementing strategies to end hunger and reduce poverty through policy, education, research, community organizing and community development. THI convenes federal, state and local government stakeholders with nonprofits, faith communities and business leaders to create an efficient system of accountability that increases food security in Texas.

News Trailers Reviews Upcoming Heroes Pop Games TV   Television Tons Of Major Companies Are Pulling Commercials From YouTube, Here's What Happened By Nick Venable 21 hours ago As the entertainment steadily shifts more towards streaming output, advertisers and corporations have been forced to alter their strategies for reaching the broadest range of consumers. But even the most surefire tactics, such as pumping commercials out to O.G. streaming giant YouTube, aren't immune to disasters, and a bunch of huge companies like Walmart and PepsiCo have pulled all advertising from the service after it was revealed their ads were being paired with racist and unsavory videos. Why they gotta make Walmart's smiley face all sad? In what is shaping out to be one of the biggest advertising boycotts in some time, Friday saw Walmart, Coca Cola, PepsiCo and Dish Network all announced they'd axed all YouTube and Google ties (minus targeted search ads), while Starbucks and General Motors reported they'd pulled YouTube commercials. FX Networks also announced it was yanking everything from YouTube and Google. A day previous, YouTube lost commercials from Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Volkswagen, Verizon and Enterprise. And it all began not long before on the other side of the pond, when the BBC, the Guardian and the British Cabinet Office all pulled ads from YouTube and Google. What's the deal? This expanding boycott came around a week after reps from Google and YouTube apologized for having paired such high-market ads with offensive content. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the ads were still appearing on these videos as of Thursday night. I won't get too much into what was in the clips, but they were derogatory in nature to the Jewish population, the black population, former FLOTUS Michelle Obama and many others. Nobody at FX is particularly interested in promoting Season 3 of Fargo to anyone watching 15-minute manifestos of prejudice. Both Google and YouTube have pledged to strengthen their ad-pairing methods and technologies, but one has to wonder if there's any guarantee of success that doesn't involve someone making the decision to just ban all of the racism-embracing videos altogether. This boycott is an extension of the wave of advertising-yanking that occurred when companies found their ads appearing on "fake news" websites and the like. I dare not guess what the outcome could be, but I'm betting it involves Google and YouTube losing a lot of money in the coming days. As you might imagine, all the aforementioned companies aren't the only ones whose commercials have been lined up with hate speech. At this time, Toyota and Microsoft are reportedly keeping a close eye on things, while Proctor and Gamble says its team is communicating with Google about the situation. Geico and Amazon, meanwhile, declined to make any comments about their tactics. So if you happen to be watching YouTube videos or searching Google over the next few days and you notice something a bit off with the commercials and ads, that's why. Also, why would you notice that a Coca Cola commercial isn't playing? Do you always notice when Coca Cola commercials aren't playing? This isn't a Coca Cola commercial. (Drink Coca Cola.) Kidding.

By Peter Dreier / AlterNet March 25, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Shannon West / Shutterstock.com “Resistance” comes in many forms. In discussions about how to deal with the fear and alarm ignited by Donald Trump, no word has been used more frequently than “normalize.” Democrats and progressives engage in almost daily protest rallies to defy Trump’s agenda. But perhaps the most successful component of the anti-Trump movement has been its willingness to challenge his legitimacy. The popular slogan and hashtag “#Not My President” doesn’t mean that people think the November election results were rigged, but that Trump’s Electoral Vote majority doesn’t translate into a popular mandate and that his views and policies don’t reflect the popular will. The anti-Trump movement refuses to “normalize” a president whom they view as an authoritarian, even a neo-fascist, who violates that basic norms of democracy and the rule of law. By poking fun at Trump and exposing his narcissism, conflicts-of-interest, and pathological lies, his opponents are undermining his credibility and destabilizing his presidency as much as any marches and demonstrations. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted February 18-22 found that Trump's job approval rating stood at just 44 percent — a record low for a newly inaugurated president. Only 34 percent of Americans considered Trump to be honest and trustworthy. Just 18 percent said Trump had the proper temperament to be president, while 55 percent ranked his temperament as poor. A Quinnipiac University Poll conducted March 16-21 found that Trump’s approval rating had dipped even further – to just 37 percent. Particularly worrying for Trump is that is support among his base is slipping. In the past two weeks – in the midst of controversies over Trump’s ties to Russia and his claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower -- approval among Republicans dropped from 91 to 81 percent. Among white voters it declined from 49 to 44 percent. The support among men dropped from 49 to 43 per cent. The effort to not normalize Trump isn’t a conspiracy. It involves separate but overlapping components that, when viewed together, reflect a powerful effort to withhold from Trump the things he craves most: public approval and esteem. Entertainment: Five nights a week, CBS “Late Night” host Stephen Colbert mocks Trump with jokes that depict him as a bumbling buffoon. Comedians Bill Maher, Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver taunt Trump on a weekly basis, with no pretense to be even-handed. “Saturday Night Live’s” sketches eviscerate Trump each week, none more than Alec Baldwin’s uncanny impersonation and acerbic barbs directed at the Trump. Trump can’t stand the stings. In December, Trump tweeted: "Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad.” In January, five days before his inauguration, Trump still couldn’t contain himself, tweeting: [email protected] is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!” These reactions expose his inability to laugh at himself, a characteristic of all narcissists. This year’s Golden Globes, Grammy, and Oscar award shows included fusillades of scorn directed at the 45th president. Meryl Streep’s six minute condemnation of the president at the Sunday night Golden Globe ceremony—without once mentioning his name—so got under Trump’s skin that in a series of tweets before dawn Monday, he called Streep, who has more Academy Award nominations than any other actor in history, "one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood”— a gesture that revealed the magnitude of his vanity and the thinness of his skin. At the Grammy awards, several artists used their time on stage to rebuke Trump. Pop star Katy Perry, not known as a political performer, debuted a new song, “Chained to the Rhythm,” wearing a white pants suit (in honor of Hillary Clinton) and an armband with the word “Persist” on it (in honor of Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to be silenced by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell), while telling the audience “No hate!” The hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest performed “We the People” while Busta Rhymes said, “I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of the evil that you’ve been perpetuating throughout the United States. I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban.” While a sign saying “No Wall No Ban” flashed in the background, rapper Q-Tip joined them on stage holding the hand of a young woman wearing a hijab – a straightforward attack on Trump’s anti-Muslim policies. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, the rock band Green Day released its music video for their “Troubled Times.” It features an animated Trump-like figure wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat while spewing hateful rhetoric, images of the Ku Klux Klan, scenes from the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements, and contemporary protesters holding signs that read “Make America Hate Again” and “No Border Wall." The video ends when someone pushes a red button and the screen morphs into a mushroom cloud. The Media: In his previous gig as the host of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central, Colbert coined the word “truthiness” not only to mock Fox News’ claim to be “fair and balanced” but also to jab at the mainstream media for trying its traditional “he said/she said” approach to reporting in which all claims are given equal weight, regardless of their validity. Since Trump took office, the mainstream media have become bolder about calling out his lies and distortions. Now, the media is prepared to challenge Trump’s comments that are outright falsehoods. Rather than simply report what Trump says—making journalists little more than transcribers—the media have increasingly questioned the veracity of president’s statements, starting with his claim that the crowds at his inauguration were the largest in history. After Trump said (during a January 11 press conference) that the public doesn’t care about his tax records, the media reported on a new Pew poll revealing that two-thirds of Americans want the president to release his returns. When Trump claimed that he had received more electoral votes than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, the media quickly reported that he was wrong. On January 23, following Trump’s claims that he would have won the popular vote if three million people hadn’t voted illegally, the headline on the New York Times front-page story read: “Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers.” In the past, the Times might have headed the article “Trump Repeats Assertion” or “Trump Repeats Claim” but in an unprecedented move, it called a lie a lie. Having broken that barrier, the Times headline writers were free to tell the unmitigated truth. In March, after Trump tweeted that Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower, the headline in the next day’s Times read “Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones.” The Washington Post headlined its story, “Trump, citing no evidence, accuses Obama of ‘Nixon/Watergate’ plot to wiretap Trump Tower.” After the nation’s two leading papers changed the norms of journalism, other news outlets felt more comfortable doing so. The Chicago Tribune and Washington Post have each initiated regular columns devoted to fact-checking Trump’s statements and exposing his lies. The media watchdog site Politifact has been working overtime to keep track of the validity of Trump’s assertions. It has discovered that through mid-March, 70 percent of Trump’s statements were “mostly false,” “false,” or “pants on fire” outright lies. Since Trump’s inauguration, the media has ratcheted up its investigative reporting about Trump’s business empire, his ties to Russia, and the right-wing affiliations, regulatory abuses, and outlandish views of many of his cabinet nominees and advisors. NPR, for example, created a team devoted to covering Trump’s conflicts of interest. Media coverage of Trump’s links to Putin and Russian businesses has put the president on the defensive since he took the oath of office. At a March 13 press briefing, NBC's Pete Alexander got into a heated exchange with Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer, raising questions about Trump tweeting things without proof "When should Americans trust the president?” Alexander asked Spicer. “Should they trust the president, is it phony or real when he says President Obama was wiretapping him?" Trump’s twitter tirades reveal that by doing its job, the media are getting under his thin skin. At 6:40 am on February 15, for example, Trump tweeted: “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” Forty minutes later, he was back on twitter, proclaiming: “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia.” Two days later he tweeted: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” The following week he was still fulminating on the same topic: “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!” Sports: But it isn’t only the liberal entertainment and media institutions that are challenging Trump’s legitimacy. In February six members of the New England Patriots said they wouldn’t accompany their teammates to the White House later this year, where the Super Bowl champions will be honored by Trump. Also in February, Baltimore Orioles Vice President John Angelos announced that he would refuse to allow Trump to throw out the opening game ball. This year’s Super Bowl featured commercials promoting diversity and tolerance – a not very subtle criticism of Trump’s attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and others. Budweiser’s commercial eulogized its founder, Adolphus Busch, an immigrant from Germany, who was told, upon reaching this country, that he was "not wanted here." Coca-Cola’s ad revealed a montage of young Americans singing "America the Beautiful" in different languages, with the tagline,. "Together Is Beautiful." The ad for 84 Lumber, a little-known construction supplies firm, showed a Hispanic mother and daughter making their way north to the U.S. border, where they encountered a large wall. It's A 10, a hair-product company, warned viewers that we're "in for four years of awful hair." Consumer Boycotts: Some activist groups are directly going after Trump’s corporate allies and even trying to undermine Trump’s own business empire. Last year Color of Change initiated a campaign to persuade corporations not to sponsor the Republican convention. A number of the big firms – including Coca Cola and Microsoft – backed out in response to the pressure campaign. This year, Color of Change, MoveOn and several other groups launched an anti-Trump social media campaign, #GrabYourWallet, which is urging consumers to boycott corporations with ties to the Trump. Its website listed companies owned by the Trumps or that are actively supporting or doing business with the Trump family. It not only targeted Trump’s golf courses and hotels, but also stores that stocked Trump-branded merchandise, including Ivanka Trump’s line of clothing and shoes and companies that advertise on the Celebrity Apprentice television show, that Trump is still executive producer of. This boycott list includes Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Zappos, Bloomingdales, Bon-Ton, Burlington Coat Factory, Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, Dillards, Neiman Marcus, Sears and T.J. Maxx. The #GrabYourWallet activists have also targeted the CEOs who sit on Trump’s business advisory council. The first domino to fall was Uber. A separate online petition sponsored by the Independent Drivers Guild, which represents nearly 50,000 Uber drivers in New York City, called on Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign, saying that Uber was built on a "foundation of hard work by immigrant workers." In early February, for the first time in its history, downloads of Uber’s app on iOS were surpassed by those of its chief competitor, Lyft. A few days later, Kalanick resigned from the president’s business advisory council. The group’s next targets include Disney, Tesla, Wal-Mart, and Pepsi, whose CEOs also sit on Trump’s business group. Yale students, alumni, and faculty are currently pressuring the university to give back a $150 million gift from alumnus Stephen Schwarzman, chair of the private-equity Blackstone Group, who is serving as chair of Trump’s business advisory group. A new online group, Sleeping Giant, targeted consumer-oriented companies that advertised on Breitbart News, the right-wing white supremacist website run, until last year, by Steve Bannon, who chaired Trump’s campaign and is now his chief political advisor. The tech-savvy Sleeping Giant activists created a Twitter account that allowed consumers to send screenshots to companies who might have been unaware that their ads were appearing next to Breitbart’s offensive content. Over 1,000 companies – including Allstate, Kellogs, Air Canada, and Nike -- dropped their ads on the Breitbart site. So did AARP, Duke University and other advertisers that unwittingly found that their brand was being promoted on the toxic propaganda site. Closer to Trump’s home, Nordstrom – the nationwide department store – told his daughter Ivanka that it would no longer sell her clothing line. The company claimed that it did so because the brand wasn’t selling, not make a political statement, but the president wasn’t buying it. “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom," Trump tweeted in February. "She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Mental Health Professionals: The comedians’ ridicule, the Super Bowl ads, the criticism by sports figures, and the attacks on Trump’s corporate allies and his daughter’s own business operation not only contribute to Trump’s declining favorability, polls show, but also drives Trump crazy. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the constant ridicule directed at Trump brings to the surface or deepens his existing mental instability. In fact, a growing number of major news outlets, as well as the Columbia Journalism Review, have run columns, new stories, and broadcast segments interviewing psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who raise questions about Trump’s emotional health, sanity, and fitness to serve as president. In 1964, opponents of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater mocked his slogan, “In Your Heart You Know He’s Right,” with a slogan of their own, “"In Your Guts You Know He's Nuts." That year, a magazine called Fact published a poll of 2,417 psychiatrists, the majority of whom said that Goldwater was "psychologically unfit" to be president. In addition to the survey, the magazine published 38 pages of psychiatrists' comments, which including calling Goldwater a dangerous lunatic," "paranoid" a "counterfeit figure,” and “emotionally too unstable,” as well as saying that he had an "impulsive quality" and a "Godlike self-image." In response, the American Psychiatric Association revised its code of ethics, saying that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person. It became known ever since as the “Goldwater rule.” Since then, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have been wary of diagnosing presidential candidates and presidents. But this year, many of them decided to break the Goldwater rule and talk publicly about the condition of Trump’s mind. Last month, for example, 33 prominent mental health experts signed an open letter to the New York Times warning that Trump’s mental state “makes him incapable of serving safely as president.” Trump’s “words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize,” they wrote. They noted his tendency to “distort reality” to fit his “personal myth of greatness.” The added that “Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions.” Their letter warns that Trump’s "grave emotional instability" makes him “incapable of serving safely as president." Explaining why they decided to break from the Goldwater rule, the mental health professions explained that “This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer.” The letter to the Times reflects the growing willingness of mental health professionals to make public statements, including interviews with the news media, about Trump’s psychological condition and his fitness to be president. Of course, it is impossible to assess the impact of all this ridicule and lampooning of Trump on public opinion. The accumulation of mockery may simply reinforce existing views of the president rather than change minds. Trump haters enjoy the scorn because it confirms their assessment. Trump supporters ignore the taunts or view them as evidence of the condescension of the bi-coastal liberal elite. But for Americans in the middle, the constant bombardment of anti-Trump satire, investigate reporting about his business failings and corruption, and the exposure of his penchant for lying can only serve to lead them to question Trump’s fitness for the job. One challenge for the anti-Trump resistance movement is to raise the political costs for Republicans who remain loyal to the president and his unpopular policies. Typically, when a president’s poll numbers plummet, members of his party in Congress seek to distance themselves from his agenda. In normal times, Trump’s sinking credibility would undermine his ability to advance his policy ideas and inflict harm on Republicans in the House and Senate running for re-election next year. But, as we’re learning about Trump, nothing about him is normal. Peter Dreier is a professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

The debut at Amazon's invitation-only MARS conference (Machine-Learning (Home) Automation, Robotics and Space Exploration) held in Palm Springs, Calif., on Monday signifies another step in realizing its drone delivery dream – an envisioned “future” that's already a reality in China.  “It looks like science fiction, but it's real,” Prime Air said on its website. “One day, seeing Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road.” In a video, the e-commerce giant’s quadcopter could be seen gliding through the sky carrying a box containing several bottles of sunscreen, and landing on a small pad in a field. The fully autonomous flight, completed in the controlled airspace of the Palm Springs International Airport, received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, Gur Kimchi, vice president of Amazon’s Prime Air, told Recode in a statement.  The demonstration came three months after the company put its autonomous aircraft into practice in Britain. Amazon delivered a Fire TV stick and a bag of popcorn to select customers near Cambridge, England on Dec. 14, marking a milestone for its drone delivery plan announced by its Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos in 2013.  Infographic The future of drones in the US “We’re starting with two customers now and in the coming months we’ll offer participation to dozens of customers living within several miles of our U.K. facility, and then growing to hundreds more,” the company said at the time. “After that, well it’d be easy to say the sky’s the limit, but that’s not exactly true anymore, is it?” And the skies might not be so empty soon – with plenty of companies, including UPS, Google, and Walmart testing and developing drone technology, hoping to make transport and delivery cheaper and faster to customers. UPS launched its drone testings earlier this month, successfully delivering a package to a residence.  For US drones to deliver packages on a regular basis, technical and airspace regulations still remain hurdles. The FAA regulations prohibit commercial drones to be within sight of aircraft pilots and to be flying over people that are not involved in the transaction. Licensed drone operators are also required to take a test every two years.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → Smart Beta ETFs for Rising U.S. Interest Rates Smart Beta ETFs for Rising U.S. Interest Rates March 20, 2017 at 11:02 am by Todd Rosenbluth Thus far in 2017, iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV) have shed a combined $1.3 billion assets. Despite the exposure differences – for example USMV has sector constraints not employed for SPLV — both offer relatively strong exposure to higher-dividend-yielding stocks relative to the S&P 500 index. As the Fed raises rates further this year, a rotation away from these “bond proxies” may occur. CFRA has Overweight rankings on both ETFs, based on a combination of holdings-level analysis and fund attributes.  More specifically, SPLV and USMV currently earn favorably low risk consideration attributes in our research, which is consistent with the downside protection investors should seek out from a lower-volatility product. In April 2015, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility Portfolio (XRLV) came to market and has $220 million in assets. Similar to the $6.5 billion SPLV, XRLV focuses on the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 index. But the smaller ETF first excludes stocks that historically have performed poorly in rising interest rate environments. Examples of stocks inside SPLV that do not make the cut for XRLV, include utilities Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co (SO). Rather, those and other utilities are replaced in XRLV by other S&P 500 constituents, including industrials stocks Ametek (AME) and J.B Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Both are CFRA buy recommendations that have medium CFRA qualitative risk considerations. In 2017, XRLV is up 5.9%, ahead of SPLV’s 5.1%, highlighting the importance of understanding the construction of these index-based products. Meanwhile, some dividend ETFs, such as SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY 89 Overweight), experienced net outflows year to date despite offering exposure to companies with long-term records of dividend increases. In September 2016, Fidelity Dividend for Rising Rates (FDRR) launched with a twist on the traditional dividend-growth theme. The proprietary index behind FDRR holds companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends and have a positive correlation of returns to increasing Treasury yields. Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are among the ETF’s largest consumer staples (9%) holdings and have low CFRA qualitative risk assessments. CFRA equity analyst Joseph Agnese has a buy recommendation on KHC. He thinks the company’s leading market share positions, strong cash flow generation and significant EBITDA margin expansion opportunities positions it well to achieve strong EPS growth over the next three-years. Despite also launching less than three years ago and with only $94 million in assets, CFRA ranks FDRR as Overweight. Our ranking is helped by favorable CFRA STARS and overall modest risk consideration attributes. FDRR is up 6.3% year to date, ahead of the 4.5% and 3.5% respective gains for SDY and Fidelity Core Dividend (FDVV 27 Overweight); FDVV focuses on dividend-growth companies but does not incorporate sensitivity to bond yields. With the Federal Reserve raising rates last week and indicating that gradual rate hikes are to be expected throughout the year, CFRA thinks investors should broaden the range of smart-beta products they consider. While established offerings SDY, SPLV and USMV remain worthy of attention, we contend FDRR and XRLV are next-generation products with some strong attributes.

The American video game retailer announced it will close at least 150 of its 7,500 brick-and-mortar stores as the company's shares fell more than 12 percent on Friday afternoon. GameStop reported that sales of video game hardware had declined 29.1 percent and new software sales fell by 19.3 percent during the fourth quarter. "We encountered stiff headwinds as we completed the third year of the console cycle," GameStop CEO Paul Raines said, according to USA Today. The Texas-based company dropped 13.6 percent in total sales to $3.05 billion from 2016, citing weak sales of some blockbuster video games during the holiday season and "aggressive console promotions" by other retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart. GameStop said its video game category had become "weak" as consumers move toward purchasing games from digital storefronts and primarily online retailers such as Amazon. Despite the losses in video games sales the company posted a 44 percent increase in sales for its Technology Brands business, which includes cellphone retailers like Spring Mobile. GameStop also saw growth in its collectables business, including apparel retailer ThinkGeek, which increased by 28 percent. Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd announced that the company will no longer share quarterly earnings nor same-store-sales guidance moving forward. "We believe that providing only annual guidance will reduce investor distraction as we continue to diversify the company and seek to maximize long-term shareholder value," he said.

The parking lot is largely empty at the Sears at Westgate in West Toledo. Sears Holdings Corp. is facing flagging sales at its stores and is in danger of going out of business. THE BLADE/KATIE RAUSCH Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Sears and Kmart, two struggling retailers that combined have 12 stores in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan, faced an even shakier future Wednesday, a day after their parent firm said in a regulatory report that “substantial doubt” exists whether the two venerable chains can survive. Having lost $10.4 billion since 2011 and $2 billion last year alone, the parent firm Sears Holding Corp. of Hoffman Estates, Ill., acknowledged in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that doubt existed about its “ability to continue as a going concern.” But company officials insisted on Wednesday that it didn’t necessarily mean all the stores would shut down and the well-known retail names would disappear. Sears Holding chief financial officer Jason Hollar indicated on the company’s blog that the retailer is poised for a turnaround, not extinction. Sears executives said they are trying to raise cash by financing debt and selling off real estate, but warned those efforts may not succeed. Ken Perkins, of research firm Retail Metrics LLC, and other industry analysts, think otherwise. “They’re past the tipping point,” Mr. Perkins told the Associated Press. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, he said, it would need to operate just 200 stores. And Kmart does not have much of a future, he added. Sears Holding has 1,430 Sears and Kmart stores now, with a combined 140,000 full and part-time employees. Sears Holding, which had declining sales last year of $22.1 billion, this year announced 108 Kmart and 42 Sears locations in 40 states are slated to close this spring. The list includes a Kmart in Adrian. In northwest Ohio, it operates Sears department stores, smaller outlet stores, or auto centers in Toledo, Holland, Bowling Green, Bryan, Lima, Norwalk, and Van Wert, and Kmarts in Toledo, Oregon, and Fostoria. In southeast Michigan, it has a Sears outlet in Adrian and a Kmart in Monroe. Investors were skeptical Wednesday. Sears Holding’s shares fell 12 percent to $7.98 a share on the Nasdaq and trading volume was 4 million shares, more than twice average volume. Retail analysts suggested the situation might get worse before it gets better for Sears, which began in 1886, and for Kmart, which began in 1899. Loss of market share The two brick-and-mortar chains have struggled for several decades by losing market share to competitors like Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, and J.C. Penney, as well as Internet-based retailers like Amazon.com. For decades, Sears was a leading retailer, with its storied catalog selling items from bicycles to sewing machines. Sears, through its anchor department stores, helped drive mall construction in the 1960s and 1970s. And its catalog business in the early 1900s helped spawn sales for the retailer, including an unconventional aspect of selling “catalog homes.” Those kit homes were built in much of Toledo’s inner city; some still remain as they do in other cities. Sears Holding Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness. But the firm this year sold the Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. for $900 million, and has made other moves to improve its finances. Analyst Neil Saunders, of GlobalData Retail, described Sears as “beyond repair” in his recent analysis of its 2016 performance. In an InsideRetail.com report, Mr. Saunders said that every fiscal quarter the company says it is working its way to profitability. “However, where Sears sees a path, we see a tangle of extremely dense vegetation through which it is near-impossible to navigate,” he wrote. Burt Flickinger, of Strategic Research Group, said that to its credit, Sears Holding has hired the best and brightest people in retail to help it stage a comeback. “The danger is that Sears has postponed so many capital expenditures for the last decade,” he said. “So even though they have hired a ‘dream team’ of retailing, it’s uncertain whether Sears has enough time to turn it around. “If they can’t turn around quickly enough and they have to file bankruptcy, they still will at least have their best leadership team in 20 years.” Mr. Flickinger said he could see a reorganized and smaller, leaner Sears succeeding. “They are two of the greatest retailers ever seen over the last two centuries,” he said. “There’s still a place in America for Sears, especially in the cities where Walmart is not established. I think there’s still a strong place for Kmart in the urban markets and near-urban markets.” Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

Joel was born April 2, 1924, in Roselle Park, N.J., to Joel and Olive (Ulmer) Biggs. Not long after Joel was born, the family moved to Tucson, Ariz. Joel worked in the family business as a machinist until graduating from Tucson High School in 1942. In 1943, during World War II, Joel enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, serving as a motor machinist on the cutter Perseus, spending time on the West Coast before being deployed to the Philippines. On July 5, 1946, Joel married the love of his life, Alice Elizabeth Briggman, in Tucson. To this union, they were blessed with six children: Joel Jr., Sandi, Cathy, Peg, John and Mark. In 1960, Joel and Alice purchased a homestead south of Winthrop, where they farmed and raised their children. Joel also worked at John Deere for 13 years as a machinist before retiring from farming in 1986. Not one to sit idle, Joel started his second career in 1988 with Walmart in Independence. The people he worked with during that time were an extension of his family and he appreciated and loved them dearly. Joel will be remembered for his kindness, his loving soul and giving spirit. We will miss his wisdom and positive outlook on life as well as his witty conversation. Preceding him in death were his wife, Alice; his parents; sisters Marian Chapman and Doris Todd; and brothers, Ray, Ted, Kenny, Cliff and Harley. Survivors include one sister, Olive Craig of Houston, Texas; six children, Joel Jr. (Ellie) of Guttenberg, Sandi (Bob) Colin of Urbandale, Cathy (Bob) Amfahr of Grundy Center, Peg (Mick) Thein of Garnavillo, John (LuAnne) of Winthrop and Mark (Dawn) of Quasqueton; 15 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and many nieces, nephews and friends. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Hospice of Comfort Regional Medical Home Care of Manchester or Cedar Rock American Legion Post 434, Quasqueton. The family will greet friends at the Cedar Rock American Legion Building in Quasqueton from 1 until 4 p.m. Sunday, March 26, where they will celebrate Joel's life. Private family burial will take place in the Quasqueton Cemetery. Fawcett Funeral Homes and Cremation Services are assisting the family with arrangements.

Crosby told City Council members Tuesday during their work session that he met with the citizens on Monday evening. The meeting was set up by Scott Myrick with some residents who were expressive of their opinions or concerns about the City of Yukon on the Yukon Happenings Facebook page. Myrick was unable to make the meeting he set up due to car troubles, Crosby said. Crosby said options for the land where the Sports Complex would’ve been built if passed during the March 7 special election were discussed. The attendees had both questions and suggestions for the land. One woman who attended the meeting told Crosby she had done an analysis and would be able to do the same park for only $5 to $7 million, but Crosby said the city got the estimates done and for it to be up to code with the state, and widening Frisco Road to four lanes, which is an expensive job, was also included in that budget. All of the attendees weren’t residents within the legal city limits of Yukon, but told Crosby they consider themselves Yukon residents because it is where they eat and shop. Some of the attendees who were not Yukon residents, but Oklahoma City residents, asked about sales tax and why Yukon can’t have Oklahoma City’s sales tax, Crosby said. They also said they could talk with Oklahoma City about making it happen. Crosby told Council members that he explained to the attendees how vital sales tax is to cities in Oklahoma and that Oklahoma City is already down in sales tax, just as everyone else is, so they will not give up their sales tax. He also explained to Council members that he’s already visited with Oklahoma City and none of the sales tax will go to Yukon. Other questions or concerns that came up during the meeting included development west of the hospital, vehicles purchased for the city, the land west of Wal-Mart and the Yukon Fire Department’s yellow fire engines. Crosby confirmed with Council members that the City of Yukon hasn’t purchased any new vehicles since he became City Manager in June of last year, but some vehicles have been painted. The only vehicles that will be purchased soon are the police vehicles will come from the Yukon Police Department’s Public Employees Sales Tax (PEST) Revenue fund. He also confirmed that the land west of Wal-Mart hasn’t been sold yet, and Yukon will not be helping with development west of the hospital at this time due to previous let downs. The City of Yukon previously paid for the road near there with promises of businesses such as Crest Fresh Market and Academy Sports + Outdoors coming to that location, but none of the promises businesses will be built there. “It’s just empty promises from the other side,” Crosby said. Fire Chief Kevin Jones addressed the question about the yellow fire engines. He said they’re older engines but they are still maintained and running well, and they are kept inside as back up fire engines. Mayor John Alberts questioned the meeting and if it would be an ongoing discussion, which he said he thinks needs to happen. Crosby said it’ll have to be because it’s definitely going to take more dialogue. “City financials are more difficult than people understand,” Crosby said.

Winners are found this way: First, the Product of the Year Canada jury carefully selects the finalists—that is, products that meet or exceed innovation standards—which are then categorized and judged by an online survey, on behalf of Rogers Insights and conducted by TNS, of thousands of regular Canadian shoppers. Their feedback and opinions form each product’s Methodology Innovation Index Score (ISS), which accounts for and incorporates satisfaction, innovation, appeal and intent to purchase. This year, top product picks include gel nail polish you need not venture to the spa for, water that doubles as makeup remover and resealable disinfecting wipes to replace a cabinet full of spray cleaners. Shampoos were a big winner—including a dry shampoo “mist”, a dandruff shampoo with peppermint-flavoured “cooling symptom relief” and Garnier Whole Blends Honey packed with a hive-full of natural extracts. And there were plenty of tasty treats: Fontaine’s sugar-, fat-, lactose-, gluten-, and preservative-free sorbet made the list, as did Walmart’s new line of kung pao, tikka masala and tandoori cooking sauces. View a selection of winning products in the gallery below. 5 view slideshow Photos Winning appliances Of the 31 winners of the 2017 Product of the Year Canada award, 10 are appliances that innovate and modernize on the home front. But like all Product of the Year winners, a jury of industry experts first narrow down the year’s coolest gadgets to a short-list of finalists that excel at innovation, whether in design, function, value or even packaging. The judges’ picks then move on to the real test: a stamp of approval from consumers themselves, who were polled by the thousands by global market research company TNS on behalf of Rogers Insights. Feedback scores on satisfaction, innovation, appeal and intent to purchase are then crunched into each product’s Methodology Innovation Index Score (ISS). Cooling up your kitchen and laundry room this year are some cutting-edge appliances like the Hamilton Beach Blender, quiet enough to blend a morning smoothie while your partner snoozes; a convection oven that uses electromagnetic energy to keep perfect temperatures in separate baking compartments; and the KitchenAid Artisan Mini stand mixer—now 20% smaller and 25% lighter. Here are five more futuristic contraptions—and Product of the Year winners, of course—putting your old microwave to shame: 5 view slideshow Photos Product of the Year is a program used under license by Rogers.

(Photo: Steven Senne, Associated Press) 701 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE LANSING — Municipalities that are collecting substantially lower property taxes than they used to from big-box stores must overcome opposition from business interests and their allies in the Legislature to tilt the tax assessing system back in favor of local governments. The retailers have been successfully reducing their tax bills in the Michigan Tax Tribunal since 2010, when the administrative court began agreeing that the real estate should be compared to "dark," or vacant, structures for tax purposes. Bipartisan House legislation reintroduced in the past week would restore fairness to the property tax appeals system, according to supporters who contend that the problem has reached crisis proportions especially in smaller communities unable to afford legal fights. "Most of these stores, if they're assessed $2 million less than what they should be, they're saving a hundred grand a year," the sponsor, Republican Rep. David Maturen of Vicksburg, said after helping to unveil the bill at the Michigan Municipal League's conference in Lansing. "Multiply $100,000 times every big-box store in this state and all of a sudden there's some major money out there. ... That should be going to police and fire and schools and every other service that's provided." He cited examples in Kalamazoo County, where he said Costco spent $17.5 million to open a new store but argued it was worth $4 million and Menards spent $16.5 million for a store while contending it was worth $5.6 million. The bill won overwhelmingly approval in the GOP-led House last year, 97-11, only to die in the Republican-controlled Senate. It would not necessarily have increased taxable values from existing levels, but it could have potentially prevented large reductions in future appeals, according to the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency. Read more: Can Michigan lure urban grocery stores? Dying or thriving? The status of 9 metro Detroit malls Municipal groups are leaning on lawmakers to address the "dark store" issue, but opponents include the powerful Michigan Chamber of Commerce and groups representing retailers, grocers and manufacturers. Amy Drumm, vice president of government affairs at the Michigan Retailers Association, said the measure is unconstitutional and would slant the tax appeals process toward assessors. Big-box owners discovered after the Great Recession that their stores had been "dramatically overvalued" by local assessors in Michigan and across the country, she said. She said Michigan property typically is based on the true cash value, which is defined in law as the usual selling price. "So we have to look at comparable sales, and most of these properties that are larger retail properties or manufacturing properties sell when they're vacant because that's when they go up for sale. You don't sell a thriving business typically," she said. But Rep. John Kivela, a Marquette Democrat, said the retailers — which he characterized as "large out-of-state corporations" — are exploiting a loophole while smaller Main Street competitor businesses still must pay higher taxes. "This is touching every corner of the state," he said, seeking to debunk a perception that the tax appeals primarily affect Upper Peninsula communities. He said it is "wrong" that businesses such as Wal-Mart, Menards and Home Depot are paying way less in taxes in Michigan than in the states where they are headquartered. The bill's critics question if such comparisons to other states are apples to apples. The renewed debate in Michigan, where the dark store strategy took hold before spreading elsewhere, comes as Wisconsin Republicans aim to close the so-called loophole. Indiana last year enacted a law to curb the tactic. But with the legislation likely to stall in the Senate Finance Committee if it clears the House again, municipalities' hopes may hinge on the Michigan Supreme Court. Justices in February ordered arguments in a dispute between Escanaba and Menards. The state appeals court in 2016 ruled for the city and reversed the Tax Tribunal's decision to use sales comparisons in a tax reassessment case instead of the cost of construction less depreciation, noting how deed restrictions prevent the reuse of many big-box store properties as retail space. Maturen's bill would limit the extent to which other similar properties could be used for comparison if they have deed restrictions. Deena Bosworth, director of governmental affairs for the Michigan Association of Counties, said the restrictions "artificially drive down demand for the property, thereby lowering the value." ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00.

It’s that magical time of year where 13, no, FOURTEEN drag queens are carted off to Los Angeles to sling lashes and insults at each other in hopes of being crowned America’s Next Top Host of Logo’s Gay Aspen Ski Weekend. Like most reality TV competitions, the prize truly doesn’t matter. RuPaul’s Drag Race is a bonafide phenomenon, and it’s easy to see why: It’s a treasure trove of pop culture knowledge, excavating retro gems and fueling the catchphrases of our future; Ru and the writers craft some of the most wickedly naughty and gleefully cheesy turns of phrase you’ll hear anywhere on basic cable; and the contestants showcase a level of talent that spans so many skill sets, it’s hard to watch and not be dumbfounded why these people aren’t huge stars already. RELATED: Get To Know the ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Season 9 Queens in This Massive Must-Read Preview And that’s what brings us to the show’s most important element: It tells stories about queer people from the most marginalized segments of our society. RuPaul’s Drag Race engages gender head-on (sometimes with mixed results), but it also boasts one of television’s most diverse contestant pools, highlights the queer experience in small-town USA and celebrates the ingenuity of creative artists struggling to work on a budget. This season marks a big step for the scrappy show that was once considered a cult favorite. It’s leaving its home at the LGBT channel Logo for its much more mainstream fellow Viacom property, VH1. Little seems to have been lost in translation, so hopefully the only result is a wider audience for this excellent series. But enough throat clearing. Gentlemen, start your engines, and let’s get this recap going. We kick things off with our traditional arrivals into the workroom, starting with Peppermint. Some notable entrances include Brooklyn’s Sasha Velour stepping into the workroom and letting out a guttural scream, Nina Bo’nina’s cartoon mouse and a nearly naked Farrah Moan. We also got a hint at Eureka and Trinity’s pageant rivalry (and Trinity’s concern about the, ahem, “astigmatism” against pageant girls). Is it possible for a tuck to cut off circulation to your brain? Of course, the real star of the workroom is Lady Gaga herself. She initially tries to pass herself off as a Gaga impersonator (Gaga’s most meta ARTPOP project yet?), but before it really gets to be any fun, she reveals herself to the momentarily befuddled queens. That sure was a lot of buildup about going stealth for what amounted to maybe 40 seconds of suspense. Once the reveal has been made, the ladies collectively lose their minds over her presence. Eureka even goes so far as to break down in tears over how Gaga saved her from the brink of death many times. It may seem like hyperbole, and for a lot of snarky internet commenters out there, it’s tempting to give it an eyeroll, but the power of pop culture icons like Gaga — especially for small-town queer kids — cannot be overstated. It was a sweet moment, and Gaga seemed genuinely moved. Ru enters the workroom to declare two pieces of important information. First, the ladies will be competing in a special pageant showcasing both a look that represents their hometown and then something inspired by Lady Gaga. (Please someone come out in an egg, please someone come out in an egg, please …) The other news is no one is going home this week. These sort of challenges have become less and less exciting the more and more evident it is that the girls come prepared. They all knew this would be a challenge and packed accordingly. I miss the old days where they had to think on their feet and creatively piece together a garment on the spot. Sure, the finished products are much more exciting now, but it makes the workroom a snore when all the pre-runway time is just watching them unpack. As a guest judge, Gaga was game, if a little subdued. She fired off a few good one-liners, shed some interesting background onto the ladies’ Gaga gown choices and even tried really hard to squeeze out a few very sincere tears of appreciation. I’m not sure what I wanted from her exactly, but I feel like it was more than failing to shine brighter than Michelle Visage at the judges table. Nina Bo’Nina was crowned the first Miss Charisma Uniqueness Nerve & Talent, with Eureka and Sasha as runners-up. Just when you think it’s safe to return to the Interior Illusions Lounge or whatever, turns out there’s a TWIST! We’ve got one more new queen! Or one new old queen! Who is it? I don’t know, I don’t read Reddit. But! We’ll all find out next week together, like a family. Now, our impressions of the individual girls’ performances tonight may be influenced by our first encounter with them at the NYC premiere, but you can scope out our totally subjective power rankings below: 1. The judges made the right call crowning Nina Bo’nina Miss Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent. She’s a true original, and she killed the runway. Her hometown look was quirky, but still artistic, and her Lady Gaga look honored Mother Monster while still putting her own spin on it. If this first runway is any indication, expect Nina to push the boundaries of each challenge for weeks to come. 2. There’s nothing we love more than “a wiener sandwiched between two buns,” so Shea had us gagging on her hometown headpiece. Her homage to Gaga wasn’t a total stunner (and the judges clocked her for not being detail-oriented enough). Still, I loved the creativity and attitude throughout. She’s truly here to slay. 3. I’m still a little concerned Sasha Velour’s drag is too over-thought, which was a problem for her over-accessorized hometown look. However, her entrance to the workroom and knockout “Applause” lewk showed she can let loose (in carefully considered situations). Let’s hope she can deliver more spontaneous delight as the weeks race on. 4. Eureka stepped up with a full hometown performance, not just an outfit, and I appreciated that. I was not as in love with her Gaga choice as the judges were. I thought it looked like a Walmart Halloween costume (which is very on-brand for Eureka, actually). It’s a crowded field though, so for Eureka to stand out at all is an achievement. 5. Perhaps Aja can borrow Eureka’s vacuum to pick up all those names she’s dropping. It’s not a great sign she’s already getting a little bit of an insufferable edit, but she’s got such a cool edge to her, it makes me think she’s going to keep things fresh. Lady Liberty was a snooze, but her Comme des Garçons one-size-fits-all dress was an inspired choice. 6. Thank goodness for the Globes gown, or Alexis Michelle would land much lower on this list. Her first outfit was a bit of a mess, and the reveal of her pop-up sail thing was like a very awkward stage fart. 7. I still have super high hopes for Peppermint. She landed firmly in the middle of the pack this week, but the potential is there. 8. It’s fortunate for Valentina that this week was all about looks, because, as I mentioned, I’m no fan of her performance. I’m not in a rush to be rid of Valentina, she seems fun enough, but 10 months tucked does not a superstar make. 9. Trinity missed an opportunity to pay tribute to Orlando with a simple, powerful “One Pulse” message. Instead, she opted for a pretty hideous airbrush visual of rollercoasters. Snooze. The Countess look was almost there, but the blood on the neck just didn’t work for me. It looked faker than fake. If you’re going to go for it, you gotta give us a wound. It just looked like she dribbled some merlot down her neck. I honestly think it would have been better with just the hair, the glove and no blood at all. 10. If Charlie Hides is known for her wicked humor, where was it? The pilgrim ensemble (both before and after the clumsy reveal) was a bore. Then, she played Gaga super straight. Where’s that celebrity skewering we’ve heard so much about? I may be way off the mark here, but there’s just something not clicking with Charlie for me. 11. My hypothesis is Kimora was trying to channel her inner pageant queen, but the result was a dead-eyed, charisma-free biker peacock? Maybe it was the parameters of the challenge (I feel like producers encouraged them to ham up the pageant aspect), but I just didn’t get to see enough of her out there. 12. What WAS Farrah’s Vegas outfit? I have to concur with the judges that it did not read Vegas at all. Then, when she attempted Gaga, it read more like Assassin’s Creed. I’d say she’s in an urgent place to prove her stuff. 13. Oh, poor, sweet Jaymes. I think you may be in over your head. That hometown get-up gave me pure Magnoooooolia Crawford, and that is never a good thing. Her attempt to channel Vogue was vague. It was neither a dead-on recreation nor a stylized satire in her point of view. Jaymes, you seem lovely, but it might be time to start to packing the puppets. How would you rank the queens?

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh has ditched his Dockers for another 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 5:47 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens

butter and jelly. Milk and cookies. Batman and Robin. Maize and blue. Jim Harbaugh and khakis. All are iconic combinations, but it appears the latter is undergoing a few changes right now. The Michigan head coach’s affinity for a pair of khakis has been so strong over the years that it’s become almost comical how much he likes the style of pant. Heck, he even got a commercial out of it a few years ago when he specifically started getting outfitted with Dockers brand khakis. Despite being a paid endorser though, it appears that Harbaugh has dropped the famous Levi’s brand version of khakis to attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind in another pair of pants. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Not only is the switch from Dockers to Lululemon result in a lot more comfort for the Wolverines coach, it’s probably a bit more of a hit to the ol’ wallet than dropping by Walmart for a pair of khakis off the shelf. It probably doesn’t make a huge difference for Harbaugh though given that he’s the highest paid coach in the country but it might result in a few more trips to the mall. Either way, what it does mean is that now we demand a new commercial featuring Harbaugh and khakis. After all, if you’re upping the clothing game, you’ve got to up the ad game as well. View 10 Comments Scroll Down For: Florida State planning new facility to catch up with Clemson Getty Images 9 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 2:54 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Florida State completed a major facility overhaul not even three years ago. But the thing about arms races is that when someone pulls ahead of you it means you are behind. And Clemson officially pulled ahead earlier this year with the opening of its glistening, slide-equipped new home. As such, Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that Florida State now has plans to construct its own standalone facility, going as far as meeting with an architect. “We need room. We need meeting space, player development areas. You’ve got to have those areas and also to show off your history. That’s what Florida State is known for, being a great football program,” Fisher told ESPN. “You can never stand still. If you’re not evolving and moving, people are going to bypass you. You’ve got to keep going. The great programs never settle. We’re always looking for that edge. It’s going to help recruiting. It’s going to help player development. We get a lot of guys that are three-and-out, so we’ve got to have space for them to get them developed as quickly as we can so we can get production out of them.” While saying that it’s a “competitive” race and not an arms race, Fisher also tried to sell that the plans for the ‘Noles’ new home were unrelated to Clemson’s new facility. “I don’t care what they’ve got,” Fisher said. “I’m worried about what we’ve got. If I don’t think it’s going to make a difference in our program for these kids to develop as people, students and players, I won’t ask. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I was taught if you need it, do what you’ve got to do to be successful but don’t waste. I’m not going to do that. But there’s things you’ve got to have to be successful and that’s the next step, in my opinion.” View 9 Comments Former Michigan TE Jake Butt says college players should be able to cash in on likenesses Getty Images 11 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 12:34 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) For the record, Jake Butt shouldn’t “be paid” in the strictest sense of the term — to receive a paycheck for services rendered. Rather, the former Michigan tight end believes players should be able to profit from their statuses as college athletes when the NCAA, its conferences and member schools are already doing the same. (Having an extremely marketable last name probably contributed to the forming of this opinion.) “Something needs to change,” Butt told ESPN.com at Michigan’s pro day. “I don’t want a check from the NCAA. I don’t know if that’s something that’s likely. But the big thing is they say you can’t use your name to benefit. I can’t go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny’s, I can’t go in there and get a free breakfast because I’m only getting that because of my name. “That’s not to say I can’t make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I’m a good guy, a really good guy — sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can’t accept anything free for that. They said I can’t go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can’t go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that’s only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and he can negotiate his price. It’s kind of ridiculous to me.” Butt was a victim of the cruelest twist in circumstances possible for a college athlete — a season-ending injury at the end of his final season. A senior, Butt was one of the top tight ends on the draft board before suffering a torn ACL in the Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to Florida State. The Mackey Award winner as the nation’s top tight end will be drafted next month, but the damage to his bank account resulting from the injuries is significant. Being able to profit from his own name and image would have served as insurance against the loss of value he suffered due to the injury. “I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can’t use my name to benefit off my likeness in college,” Butt said. “Why can I see ‘I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,’ I see those shirts and I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can’t.” View 11 Comments Baylor strength coach apparently no longer with the program Getty Images 1 Comment By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 6:49 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) It seems every bit of news related to Baylor football nowadays has to do with the school’s on-going sexual assault scandal but it appears there is one bit of information coming out of the program that doesn’t have something to do with that. A school spokesperson told ESPN on Friday that football strength coach Kaz Kazadi has been “reassigned to a role outside the athletic performance staff.” A report from the local ESPN Radio affiliate in Waco indicates that the move will eventually have the coach leaving the school altogether. Kazadi spent nearly a decade with the Bears and played a big role in the team’s on-field turnaround under the former coaching staff. Several former players took to Twitter on Friday to express their shock over the loss of one of the cornerstones of the team in recent years. After the hire of Matt Rhule this offseason, it isn’t too surprising to see some turnover among those staff members connected to the previous regime. Baylor’s new head coach brought most of his strength staff with him from Temple so it was probably only a matter of time before Kazadi moved on, though the timing of the quasi-announcement (the Bears started spring football last weekend) is somewhat interesting. Either way, it appears Baylor will have a new direction in the weight room going forward.

The Centre Daily Times is among the outlets reporting that a jury has found Spanier guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of children in a trial related to his role in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. In addition, Spanier was found not guilty on two other counts, one a similar child endangerment charge and the other a count of criminal conspiracy. The verdict comes after lengthy deliberations by the jury in the case, which took a turn last week when former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz plead guilty to child endangerment charges as part of the same trial. All three figure to be sentenced in the next few months. Prior to the scandal, Spanier was widely considered to be one of the most respected college presidents in the country and heavily involved in NCAA matters. However he was one of several key figures fired by the school as a result of covering up the actions of Sandusky, the Nittany Lions’ former defensive coordinator who was found guilty on 45 charges of sexually abusing minors. While the verdict is likely to be appealed, Spanier is nevertheless facing the prospect of joining Sandusky behind bars as a result of his own involvement in the scandal.

[Photo: Coprid/iStock] By Eillie Anzilotti03.22.17 | 12:30 pm Picking up a prescription at a pharmacy is often “sort of like going into a McDonald’s and ordering a Big Mac–you pay for it and you walk away 15 minutes later,” the Chicago Tribune reporter Sam Roe recently told ProPublica’s Breakthrough podcast. “There’s not a lot of chit-chat,” Roe said. “But the silence is [the pharmacists] breaking the law.” Roe was talking about an investigation that he and his colleagues Ray Long and Karisa King ran into the failure of drugstore pharmacists to warn customers of dangerous, sometimes fatal, interactions between prescription drugs. The Chicago Tribune ran the results of the two-year investigation in December; in the largest and most comprehensive study of this aspect of the industry, the reporters found that pharmacists missed dangerous interactions 52% of the time. This is significant, Roe said when speaking to ProPublica, because collecting a prescription is nowhere near as straightforward as grabbing a fast-food meal. Many commonly prescribed drugs–for instance, an antibiotic and an anti-cholesterol drug–though perfectly safe when taken alone, can be disastrous when combined. But when reporters from the Tribune went up to the counter to get them filled simultaneously, they were, more often than not, not even questioned, let alone warned. The investigation, the Chicago Tribune wrote, is “striking evidence of an industrywide failure that places millions of consumers at risk.” [Photo: Kwangmoozaa/iStock] Over the course of the study period, a team of 15 Tribune reporters visited 255 pharmacies in the greater Chicago area. The reporters consulted with two leading experts on drug interactions to decide which to test. One combination, of the muscle relaxant Tizanidine and the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin, could result in loss of consciousness; the interaction of the gout treatment Colchine and high-blood-pressure medication Verapamil causes multiple-organ failure and can potentially be fatal. A Chicago physician who treats elderly patients and knows the risks of drug interactions agreed to write the conflicting prescriptions for the reporters to present to the pharmacists. Independent pharmacies fared the worst, failing 72% of the time. But national chains were not far behind: CVS missed interactions 63% of the time, Target 62% of the time, and Kmart 60% of the time. As Americans lean more heavily on prescriptions drugs to treat health concerns—one in 10 people are on five or more drugs at a given time—the Tribune’s findings are alarming. By law, pharmacists are supposed to know and warn customers of dangerous interactions, Long told ProPublica’s Breakthrough podcast. “Pharmacies are supposed to be this important cog in the health care system, but they’re behaving, in many ways, as glorified vending machines,” he added. But the Tribune investigation shook the industry. Though speed is frequently cited as a reason pharmacists miss interactions–one Walmart employee told the Tribune that she fills one prescription every 2.7 minutes–both national chains and independent pharmacies are now pledging to overhaul their systems to better protect customers. CVS will revamp its computer warning system, which should automatically flag dangerous interactions when prescriptions are filled, and Walgreens, among other changes, has pledged to bolster pharmacist training. Independent pharmacies will implement similar strategies. Long told ProPublica that customers should already be noticing the effects of the investigation when they go to pick up a prescription, though the full computer-system upgrades may not yet be implemented. Customers should expect–and when not offered, demand–more robust and informed consultations before walking away with prescriptions. And the Tribune will keep its finger on the effects of its investigation. “We’ll have to periodically check in on the industry to makes sure they’re doing what they promised to do,” Long said.

Photographer: David Ryder/Bloomberg Despite several attempts to break into the $800 billion grocery industry and almost a decade in the business, Amazon has struggled to entice shoppers en masse to buy eggs, steaks and berries online the same way they've flocked to buy books, tablets and toys. (AP File Photo/Joe Nicholson) The new Amazon.com Inc. drive-through grocery location sits under construction in Seattle, Washington, U.S., on Wednesday, March 8, 2017. Amazon's goal is to become a Top 5 grocery retailer by 2025, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would require more than $30 billion in annual food and beverage spending through its sites, up from $8.7 billion -- including Amazon Fresh and all other food and drink sales -- in 2016, according to Cowen & Co. Photographer: David Ryder/Bloomberg   Spencer Soper and Olivia Zaleski Bloomberg     "Very wasteful" isn't a phrase usually associated with Amazon.com Inc., which is so cost-conscious it once removed the light bulbs from its cafeteria's vending machines. But after spending several months analyzing the online retailer's grocery-shipping hubs back in 2014, that's exactly how a mechanical engineering student described its approach to selling bananas. Workers at Amazon Fresh, the company's grocery-delivery business, threw away about a third of the bananas it purchased because the service only sold the fruit in bunches of five, the student concluded. Employees trimmed each bunch down to size and chucked the excess. The research paper by Vrajesh Modi, who now works for Boston Consulting Group, highlighted other problems: Poorly trained employees often stood around with nothing to do. Moldy strawberries were frequently returned by disappointed customers. Amazon's inspectors believed their corporate bosses didn't care much about the quality of the food. Such challenges linger for Amazon. Despite several attempts to break into the $800 billion grocery industry and almost a decade in the business, the company has struggled to entice shoppers en masse to buy eggs, steaks and berries online the same way they've flocked to buy books, tablets and toys. "Online grocery is failing," said Kurt Jetta, chief executive officer of TABS Analytics, a consumer products research firm. Only 4.5 percent of shoppers made frequent online grocery purchases in 2016, up just slightly from 4.2 percent four years earlier despite big investments from companies such as Amazon, according to the firm's annual surveys. "There's just not a lot of demand there. The whole premise is that you're saving people a trip to the store, but people actually like going to the store to buy groceries." Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos now seems to understand that he can't win the grocery game with websites, warehouses and trucks alone. The world's biggest online retailer sees brick-and-mortar stores playing a key role in a renewed grocery push, documents reviewed by Bloomberg show. And like it did with Amazon Fresh, the company is launching its newest projects in Seattle, its hometown. Last Tuesday, men in cherry pickers worked through driving rain to affix "Amazon Fresh" signs to a drive-in grocery location in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, where shoppers can stop and have online orders loaded into their cars. Crews were busy on a similar site south of downtown, readying canopies over parking spaces to protect customers from the elements as they pick up their shopping bags. The secretive company has yet to announce the projects, and crews have covered the Amazon signs in black fabric and paper. Late last year, Amazon purchased supply-chain software from LLamasoft Inc.- a major departure for a company known for its logistics prowess, and defying an internal mantra of "we don't buy, we build." And it more recently restructured how various grocery teams were managed to narrow their focus and set clear priorities, according to people familiar with the company's business. These changes come as Amazon breaks from its standard formula of shipping products in boxes out of jam-packed warehouses. Instead, it will invite shoppers inside its own grocery stores to smell the oranges, see the tomatoes and tap the watermelons. Ahead of a national rollout next year, Amazon is testing three brick-and-mortar grocery formats in Seattle -- convenience stores called Amazon Go, the drive-in grocery kiosks, and a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. The company may open as many as 2,000 stores, according to internal documents. The company has said little about its grocery-store plans, aside from a video about Amazon Go's no-checkout format that has racked up more than 8.7 million views on YouTube. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. Reports on its moves have dribbled out over the past several months, prompting occasional denials and retorts from the company. Seattle technology site Geekwire in August uncovered Amazon's mysterious drive-in grocery kiosk in Ballard. The New York Post in February said Amazon aimed to create "robot-run supermarkets" that would operate with only a few people. Bezos responded by tweeting to the Post: "Whoever your anonymous sources are on this story -- they've mixed up their meds!" Amazon's goal is to become a Top 5 grocery retailer by 2025, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would require more than $30 billion in annual food and beverage spending through its sites, up from $8.7 billion -- including Amazon Fresh and all other food and drink sales -- in 2016, according to Cowen & Co. Reaching that milestone would require a new wave of store and warehouse investments around the country, costing billions of dollars. That's an existential change for Amazon, which initially stayed away from perishable goods and has mostly avoided the overhead of physical stores since it started in 1994. "A bunch of smart people at Amazon have been thinking about re-imagining the next phase of physical retail," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon executive who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. "They want more share of the wallet, and habitual, frequent use of Amazon for groceries is the ultimate goal." For Amazon shoppers interested in buying groceries online, the company's current offerings can be confusing. Amazon Fresh is available in about 20 U.S. cities for those paying $14.99 a month. Amazon Pantry lets shoppers buy crackers, cookies, chips, coffee and other non-perishables for a delivery fee of $5.99 per box. Amazon's speedy drop-off service, Prime Now, offers items from local grocers in some cities, but no major chains. Its stick-on Dash Buttons let people order many household products -- including some groceries, but not fresh food -- with a finger tap. And Subscribe & Save offers discounts to Amazon customers who sign up for periodic delivery of laundry detergent, toothpaste, diapers, paper towels and other items frequently purchased in grocery stores. The various initiatives have been a source of increasing internal tension as employees on different projects compete to sell the same things, according to a person familiar with the matter. One problem saddling Amazon Fresh is the high cost of losses caused by food going bad, an issue it's never faced with books and toys. For conventional grocery sellers, browning bananas can be sold at a discount to smoothie-makers and bread bakers. Chicken breasts nearing their expiration dates can be marked down. With Amazon Fresh, such items must be discarded or are returned by frustrated customers, according to a person familiar with the matter. That has meant Amazon Fresh has lost money from spoilage at more than double the rate for a typical supermarket, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal operations. The main reason Amazon began delivering groceries through Prime Now was to hand that risk back to the local grocers to lower Amazon's costs. The company didn't originally anticipate the scope or difficulty of these problems because so few people working on its grocery push have experience in the industry. "Grocery is the most alluring and treacherous category," said Nadia Shouraboura, a former Amazon executive whose company, Hointer, has been working on redefining in-store grocery shopping for the past 18 months. "It lures inventors and retailers with shopping volume and frequency, and then sinks them with low margin." Beyond grocery, Amazon executives have also discussed opening consumer electronics stores to showcase its gadgets and better compete with Best Buy Co., according to three people familiar with the plan. For years, Amazon executives have discussed the downside of an online-only strategy, mostly with regard to a lack of places for shoppers to try out Kindle electronic readers, the voice-activated Echo speaker and its defunct Fire smartphone. Amazon considered holding events similar to Tupperware parties when it introduced its first Kindle in 2007, fearing the products would languish unseen, Jacobson said. The handful of bookstores Amazon has opened around the country double as gadget showrooms, similar to the Apple Store. Long term, a stronger grocery business could position Amazon to become a wholesale food-distribution business serving supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, hotels, hospitals and schools. But first the company has to find a way to get more people to think of Amazon when stocking their refrigerators and pantries. A group of Amazon executives met late last year to discuss the disadvantage Amazon faced compared with grocery competitors such as Wal-Mart and Kroger because of its lack of physical stores and customer apprehension about buying fresh foods online. They decided they needed something more to jump-start Amazon's grocery push beyond plans already under way for the Amazon Go convenience store, modeled for urban areas, and drive-in grocery pickup stations suited for the suburbs. They worked out plans for a third approach: grocery stores closer in size to a Trader Joe's than a Wal-Mart to offer easy access to milk, eggs and produce. Other items like paper towels, cereal, canned goods and dish detergent would be stocked on-site in a warehouse where they could be easily packed and delivered to shoppers at the location, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. It would also serve as a delivery hub for online orders. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who joined Amazon in 2015 and most recently worked on its Amazon Fresh and Pantry expansions, wrote about such a store prior to joining Amazon in an academic paper called "A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths." Ladd envisioned two-story buildings where shoppers browse produce, bread and other fresh items on the ground level while their orders for paper towels, canned goods and cereal are packed in a warehouse above. "The stores will have the capability to fulfill online orders placed by customers within a specific radius of the store," he wrote. "Amazon drivers and/or contractors will be assigned to deliver groceries." The executives decided such a store would be worth pursuing for Amazon Fresh and ordered further research about ideal locations, how to integrate the stores with grocery delivery, and the use of automation to reduce overhead. Site selection for this store's first model is happening now in Seattle, according to a person familiar with the plan. Meanwhile, the first wave of its new grocery experiment, Amazon Go, was unveiled in December and for now is only open to employees while the systems are tested. Cameras and sensors monitor shoppers who scan their smartphones upon entering, allowing them to grab items like sandwiches, yogurt, drinks and snacks and automatically pay for them without a checkout kiosk. Products are embedded with tracking devices that pair with customers' phones to charge their accounts. Weight-sensitive shelves tell Amazon when to restock. A patent filed by Amazon in 2014 suggests it could use facial-recognition technology to identify and then automatically charge in-store shoppers. In its video touting Amazon Go, the company said it was aiming to open the site to the public in "early 2017," and it hasn't provided an update to that timing. But the technology has been crashing in tests when the store gets too crowded and requires human quality control, people watching video images to make sure customers are charged for the right things, according to a person familiar with the plan. Beyond letting customers skip lines, the technology gives Amazon valuable data, said Guru Hariharan, founder of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Even if customers don't purchase everything they touch, there's value in understanding what shoppers consider but don't ultimately buy, he said. That makes it worthwhile for Amazon to work through the kinks in the technology. "It takes a lot of time and experimentation to work through unpredictable scenarios like a child picking up an item or a person wearing sunglasses or a face muffler," he said. At the same time, recent work and construction permits indicate the new drive-in grocery kiosk in Ballard could open any day. "Amazon wants to be the first thing any consumer thinks of when they need to buy anything," said Jim Hertel, a senior vice president at marketing technology company Inmar Inc. "Food is the largest retail category. They can't do what they want to do without grocery and they're definitely not going to give up."

Silhouetted by summer sun, he stood at the front door of my Vermont house. “No,” he said pointing to his work boots, heavy with mud and manure. “But can you help me?” Carlos was one of the estimated 1,000-2,000 undocumented, mostly Mexican immigrants employed on the state’s dairy farms. The actual number, like most of the workers who entered the country illegally, is hidden. Carlos had come to Vermont after a year working construction in Texas, where even gringo bosses speak some Spanish, and where he could blend into the large Latino diaspora. In contrast, Vermont was an alien world in which he stood out. But many Vermonters, including police and officials, quietly welcome and often protect migrant dairy workers like him. Immigrants form an essential part of the local economy, and truth be told, they also offer relief from a monotonously white population that tends toward tolerance and leans toward smugness. From field to truck to plate: how undocumented workers feed a city Read more I met Carlos several years back when, as part of an informal volunteer network, I ferried immigrants to medical appointments or to supermarkets, where they buy the kind of calorie-rich junk food that horrifies kale-crunching Vermonters. I helped filled out forms enabling them to wire money to family in Mexico, lending my name and return address, and wondering what the IRS would make of my sending thousands of dollars to small towns in Tabasco and Chiapas. After Vermont approved a special driver’s license not requiring legal status, I taught a few guys how to drive by US rules so they could shop for themselves, get a maple creemee at a roadside stand, and visit relatives and friends on other farms. Several had given me snippets of their tales, always without embellishment, self-pity or drama. But it was years before Carlos – bright and charming, but guarded – opened up.

Photograph: Terry J Allen The favor Carlos had come to ask that day was that I go with him for a “check-up”. “Well,” he hesitated, “to get tested for STI [sexually transmitted infections].” “Are you sick? Do you need to go immediately?” I asked. “No, I’m fine. I just want to get tested. Soon.” I phoned a local clinic, but it required one appointment for paperwork and another for testing. Two days interrupted during haying season is unthinkable for farm workers. When the grass is ready and there is a predicted stretch of sunshine, haying cannot be delayed. Carlos suggested saving time by going to a “doc in a box” at a strip mall, so I drove him to one. I asked the receptionist about the cost: “$100 for the visit.” As Carlos started taking bills from his wallet, I motioned him to stop. “And for the lab tests?” The young woman rummaged behind the counter. “Five hundred dollars, so $600 total,” she said with all the animation of one of Carlos’s cows. “You’re kidding,” I nearly shouted. “For standard lab tests?” “No way,” I told Carlos, who was probably deeply embarrassed by me. It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford it, but I knew how he sweated for that much money, and how the medical system jacked up prices for the uninsured. I phoned the community health center to compare costs, and the scheduler asked why didn’t I go to Planned Parenthood. It had never occurred to me that the organization served men. Except for a locked front door, security there appeared unobtrusive. Joining three pregnant women in the waiting room, Carlos and I made quite the intriguing couple: an ageing white woman and a handsome young Latino. When we came to the part of a form on income, Carlos asked me what to do. I said he could report whatever amount he wanted. No, he corrected, do they want hourly, weekly, or what? He knew what I had meant, but with no inclination to cheat, wrote $30,000 a year. The receptionist quickly scanned the paperwork. “We have a sliding scale,” she said, and, with obvious pleasure, told Carlos: “You just qualify for free services.” Vermont, she told me, is the only state fully covered by the Access Plan which includes birth control, annual exams, STI testing, and treatment and counseling for both men and women who are uninsured and earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level. The policy is concerned with the long-term economic benefit of preventing, diagnosing and treating the spread of communicable diseases that can lead to Aids, cancer, sterility and more. When Carlos returned from the exam room, he was assured, although a few tests were pending, that he was clean. I tossed him a bag of condoms the office distributes, and we all laughed. As we left, I spied him slipping a $60 donation onto the counter. In the car home, curiosity overcame discretion. I probed. He hesitated. And then his face lit with pleasure. “I have a girlfriend, and she said, ‘No sex until we are both tested.’” “Now, that is a great girlfriend,” I said. Smiling, we rode back under a cloudless sky to the hay awaiting harvest.

Photograph: Terry J Allen The last time Vermont had more cows than people, Eisenhower was president. Today there are 625,000 people and 129,000 cows. Without its Mexican farmhands, much of the state’s milk industry would probably dry up. Say goodbye to affordable Cabot cheddar; kiss Vermont-sourced Cherry Garcia sweet adios. And farewell to much of the $2.2bn in annual economic activity that dairy brings the state, and which makes up 70%-80% of its agricultural income. In the only state in which more than half of farm income comes from just one commodity, dependence on dairy is undisputed. A century ago, Vermont was 70% cleared agricultural land, 30% forest. Today, with farming in decline, that ratio is approximately reversed. Ruined by the cost of land and labor, many former farms have been drawn over by malls, ski resorts and summer homes. There are few jobs as miserable as trudging through frozen piss and excrement in the pre-dawn dark to milk and tend cows Nonetheless, production is up. Jerseys have been replaced by Holsteins that can churn out vast quantities of milk – 23,000 gallons a year – before their productivity fades and they are ground into hamburger or pet food, or buried in the fields they once fertilized and grazed. The switch to this high-yield breed, along with subsidies and the popularity of Vermont-branded products, has allowed some farmers to survive, and a few to thrive. What keeps farmers awake at night – besides the callous vagaries of weather and fluctuating milk prices that sometimes fall below costs – is the lack of cheap, dependable labor. The larger farms have hundreds of cows. With two milkings a day, 12 hours apart, the farm must be staffed 14-16 hours every day. Carlos’s typical workday starts around at 3am; after a midday break, he works another full shift. Farmers complain that many local workers cannot tolerate the long hours, low wages and punishing labor through blizzards, rainstorms and summer heat. Indeed, there are few jobs as miserable as trudging through frozen piss and excrement in the pre-dawn dark to milk and tend cows when the thermometer plunges to 20 below zero. Mexican workers are filling a gap and saving the farms. Carlos’s first job in the US was construction for a large company in a midsize Texas city. The hourly wages were comparable to dairy, but the potential earnings and the cost of living were not. Farm jobs for migrants include housing and utilities, isolation that brings fewer spending temptations, and an “opportunity” to work up to 90 hours a week. “It’s hard, hard work, but you came to America to make money and go back quick,” Carlos says. “When I first came from Texas in a van with my cousin and some others, I saw snow for the first time. The next day, Auntie Linda arrived. She speaks Spanish, and all the patrons know her. They all call her and say: ‘We need one guy, two guys.’ She was a grumpy old woman, a big curser. We laughed at her swearing, but we didn’t care. I’d like to talk to her today and thank her. She gave me a pair of boots. They went through the whole winter.” Auntie Linda, the human smugglers called coyotes and polleros (chicken farmers), the people who run stash houses, the van drivers who make interstate and cross-country runs and the farmers are all moving parts of a complex network powered by dollars and cellphones. A small, venal component is the sex traffickers, who, exploiting the loneliness and isolation of the farm workers, import women from cities and drive them to remote farms to “service” the workers at $60 a trick. “They just bring girls, Mexicans and Colombians, mostly Latinas, but sometimes [women] from here too,” Carlos explains reluctantly. “They just show up. It could be months between visits, or could be the next weekend. You never know. They never came to our farm, and I know one thing, I’m not paying for that.” I push for more information. “They say it’s expensive, good, and they like it.” And then, with exasperation and embarrassment: “Jesus, why are you asking me about this?” A prostitution ring in Vermont came to light after Alejandro Enrique Young-Hernandez was arrested in 2011 and convicted of conspiracy to transport individuals for prostitution. Although the crime could carry a 10-year sentence, he received two years’ probation, a $100 court fee and the loss of his right to own firearms. His fellow pimp, Jose Tomas Flores-Rocha, who delivered the women to the farms, was convicted of a lesser charge, transporting individuals for prostitution, but served 18 months.

Photograph: Terry J Allen “Are you afraid of immigration authorities?” I asked Carlos on the trip back from Planned Parenthood. “I used to think about it every day,” he said, “but now it doesn’t matter if they send me back, because that’s where I belong. I always tell my parents, I’m coming back this December, and they get a piglet to raise for a big party. And then I stay yet another year.” It is not only money, and perhaps a girlfriend, that link Carlos to Vermont, but also the farm itself. Self-reliant and smart, Carlos has advanced from just the hard, dirty work of tending cows. He has made himself valuable by learning to handle the farm’s large stock of trucks, manure spreaders, balers and other machinery. His wages rose to $11.30 an hour plus a $150 monthly bonus when milk quality tests high. “I work sometimes 70, often 80 hours a week, sometimes 90. Never, never 60 hours a week,” Carlos notes with pride. Farm labor, legal and not, is exempt from overtime pay requirements. When they arrive at a farm, the immigrants are provided social security numbers. “They are all fake,” says Carlos, matter-of-factly. “Somebody just gives you one.” To stay legal, farmers withhold and file taxes – the benefits of which the worker can never collect in social security or unemployment benefits. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump called CNN’s Erin Burnett “naive” for suggesting “illegal immigrants” pay taxes. But nationally, they contribute an estimated $11.64bn a year in just state and local taxes, with at least 50% of undocumented immigrant households filing tax returns, according to the non-partisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Vermont’s undocumented people pay almost $4m a year in state and local taxes and, at 7.9% of income, contribute slightly more than the effective rate for the top 1% of Americans. When I got here, I didn’t know English and it was rough for me, and for him. He would get mad if something was not done Carlos One of the few advantages of lacking a legal agricultural visa – which is tied to a specific employer – is that unauthorized farm workers can switch farms, relying on a grapevine to avoid abusive bosses. Carlos says that his patron, a tough taskmaster and a hard worker himself, “was always fair”. Their relationship, however, started badly. “When I got here, I didn’t know English and it was rough for me, and for him, I think. He would try to tell us what to do [in English] and he would get mad if something was not done how he wanted. It was always our fault. I couldn’t explain myself. I think that’s what got me to learn English.” Over time, the two men grew reliant on and genuinely fond of each other. “Now I know a little English and I can tell him what’s wrong. And he always jokes that: ‘I don’t know if I liked you better when you didn’t know any English.’ So like, yup, this is what it is. And he always pays us on time. “Some farmers never pay more than pay $7.50 an hour. I know a guy that the boss didn’t pay him, just fired him when he asked for money. But Migrant Justice went, and the farmer had to pay,” Carlos says, referring to a local activist group. That group and others have also intervened to address farm workers’ living conditions. Some share a room in the boss’s house, some live in poorly insulated and dilapidated trailers or crammed into filthy bunkhouses. The worst off sleep in the barn. “I know a farm where they almost sleep with the cows,” says Carlos. Carlos and the other workers at his farm have their own rustic, but comfortable, house with TV, wifi, cable, a stove and a refrigerator. It is these “free” accommodations, heat and other utilities, along with long hours, that facilitate the real goal: putting money aside for a better future for themselves and family back home. Despite one “really dumb” purchase of “that no-good Mustang” (he is, after all, a 22-year-old male), Carlos has been able to save and send back enough to buy land – “not much, build my house, buy 10 cows” – and help out his older siblings and parents. Fearing deportation, undocumented immigrants wary of reporting crimes Read more Out-of-pocket expenses, if the workers are lucky, are pared down to the food they cook for themselves, phone service and clothing. I’d drive guys to their store of choice, Walmart, where they bought up jeans made in Mexico that they said cost less than they would have back home. Once, I took a worker who was returning the next day to Mexico to the “fancy store”, JCPenney, to buy presents to bring his wife. The saleswoman stalked us nervously as we examined filmy lingerie and nearly intervened when he held a red and black lace bra up to a mannequin to gauge size. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Long hours facilitate the real goal: putting money aside for a better future for themselves. Photograph: Vermont immigration piece/Terry J Allen A week or so after the Planned Parenthood visit, I asked Carlos, promising anonymity, to talk about his journey north. He was 16, he said, just out of high school with a bit of technical school when he took the two-day bus ride from Tabasco to Reynosa, a bitter, hardscrabble border city, deep in poverty, guns, gangs and drug violence. There, he and his older brother met the man who might lead them safely to a job in America, into the hands of border agents, or to death in the desert. These coyotes ply the ragged edge of capitalism. Some are professional “guides” simply doing an illegal and dangerous job for which they expect high pay; some are con men bent on exploitation. “If you come to the border alone, you will always find a coyote,” Carlos told me, “but you never know if it is someone who is reliable or will just take your money.” One way to mitigate the risk of rip-offs and scams is by making arrangements ahead of time. Five years before, “my father made it to the states and knew which coyotes to trust”, said Carlos. In Reynosa, “someone would phone us and tell us the color of the car or truck, red or green, that would take care of us. But we never, ever communicated with the coyote himself in any way until the moment we were on the border and we met in a bus station parking lot. If you come to the border alone, you will always find a coyote, but you never know if it is someone who is reliable Carlos “My coyote was one of the better ones,” Carlos said. “But all of them, it’s just about the money.” And even the better ones cannot guarantee a successful crossing – even before Trump whipped up anti-immigrant fervor and enforcement zeal. “It’s a risk we all take,” said Carlos, “and you never know how it will end.” Before they left Reynosa, Carlos paid his coyote $500 and arranged for someone to deliver $1,500 once he reached a safe house in Texas, far enough from the border that he could blend in or move on. “They always need that money punctually, or it is dangerous. They can do anything to you.” In Reynosa, the coyote took Carlos and his brother to a series of houses. “When they are ready to cross the river, they gave me a life vest, and we start to walk. It had been raining a lot, so the river was very high. It was during the day, because in the night, there were others crossing.” The coyote led them to an inflatable boat and asked who knew how to swim. “I told them I didn’t, and that’s what you are supposed to say so they don’t throw you in the river.” The Rio Grande was swollen far into the trees on the US side, and the dozen travelers, including three or four women, plus the coyote, had to leave the boat, which couldn’t navigate through the trees, and walk through chest-high water. Carlos brought “aspirin and lemons, in case we run out of water”. The coyote gave them food to carry. “The meals, like beans, were all cans. And a lot of bread, tortillas.” Once on dry land, with the thwack of helicopters “always, always” beating the sky above, they walked rapidly, seeking cover while trying to evade sensors in the ground, cameras and law enforcement patrols. After several more hours, the group reached a road where “we met a little truck. And we drove through a normal neighborhood … to a house where there were about 30 women, men and children, not only Mexicans, but also Colombians and Hondurans. “They gave us food and a place to sleep. And some clothes and shoes, because ours were wet. You just take whatever fits you.” The next day, they boarded a truck that dropped them in the desert. The Border Patrol calls the area the Rio Grande or McAllen region. Spanish explorers had a more descriptive name: El Desierto de los Muertos, the Desert of the Dead. Carlos became quiet, reached for the glass of water, and stared at the table. Then, as if a switch had flipped, he began talking rapidly. “I walked for five days,” he said, and when he saw me wince, added with annoyance at my pity: “That’s nothing compared to people I know –15 days, 16 days in the desert, a month. That’s why people die, or they go with the wrong coyote, and then someone gets tired, they just leave them there. “I saw a woman who was exhausted, and she was in our group. The coyote said: ‘It’s her or all of us.’ She was in her 30s. He didn’t really want to leave her where no one would find her, so we went to a place where he thought the Border Patrol might pass. He gave her a bottle of water and left her there. She said nothing, didn’t even cry. “Hours after we left her, we started to hear footsteps like someone is behind us and thought it was immigration. It was her. I can’t explain it, how she did it. She was almost about to die when we left her. Somehow she came. “After three days, we ran out of water. I remember that was horrible, and then food was getting scarce. I was doing fine, but my brother, he was the one who was very exhausted, and a friend of mine too. But we continue and continue. And the coyote, he always says: ‘We just have to get to that light.’ He tries to give us hope. ‘We are so fucking close,’ he says, and: ‘Are you ready to make dollars?’ “We were just exhausted. I remember I got dizzy a little and felt like we are walking in the same way all the time. “And then we waited at the side of the road. Waiting and waiting and helicopters are always flying. And it was terrifying. Then a truck shows up and quick, we all ran into it.” I have never seen Carlos talk so freely, so long. “For hours, we couldn’t move. And that was horrible in the truck, all packed together. And all like this, like this.” He drew himself into a tight knot. “I still remember a child, maybe he was 14, crying. He says he just wants a little bit of water, but they can’t stop. ‘No, you are almost there. Almost there.’ “And then we got to a house, and there is a guy at a table, and he is phoning people, saying: ‘Hey, we got your son, your daughter.’ My dad sent someone with money to pick us up. And that friend took us to an apartment.” Eventually, through a network, Carlos found the construction job and stayed in Texas for a year, until he decided Vermont was worth a try. “So I have been here five years,” he said. “I never thought I would stay that long, but I got used to it. I like Vermont. The people are really nice, but,” he grinned, “the winter, not so much.” This story was based on conversations in Spanish and English, and one interview was aided by a bilingual interpreter.

(AP) — Municipalities that are collecting substantially lower property taxes than they used to from big-box stores must overcome opposition from business interests and their allies in the Legislature to tilt the tax assessing system back in favor of local governments. The retailers have been successfully reducing their tax bills in the Michigan Tax Tribunal since 2010, when the administrative court began agreeing that the real estate should be compared to "dark," or vacant, structures for tax purposes. Bipartisan House legislation reintroduced in the past week would restore fairness to the property tax appeals system, according to supporters who contend that the problem has reached crisis proportions especially in smaller communities unable to afford legal fights. "Most of these stores, if they're assessed $2 million less than what they should be, they're saving a hundred grand a year," the sponsor, Republican Rep. David Maturen of Vicksburg, said after helping to unveil the bill at the Michigan Municipal League's conference in Lansing. "Multiply $100,000 times every big-box store in this state and all of a sudden there's some major money out there. ... That should be going to police and fire and schools and every other service that's provided." He cited examples in Kalamazoo County, where he said Costco spent $17.5 million to open a new store but argued it was worth $4 million and Menards spent $16.5 million for a store while contending it was worth $5.6 million. The bill won overwhelmingly approval in the GOP-led House last year, 97-11, only to die in the Republican-controlled Senate. It would not necessarily have increased taxable values from existing levels, but it could have potentially prevented large reductions in future appeals, according to the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency. Municipal groups are leaning on lawmakers to address the "dark store" issue, but opponents include the powerful Michigan Chamber of Commerce and groups representing retailers, grocers and manufacturers. Amy Drumm, vice president of government affairs at the Michigan Retailers Association, said the measure is unconstitutional and would slant the tax appeals process toward assessors. Big-box owners discovered after the Great Recession that their stores had been "dramatically overvalued" by local assessors in Michigan and across the country, she said. She said Michigan property typically is based on the true cash value, which is defined in law as the usual selling price. "So we have to look at comparable sales, and most of these properties that are larger retail properties or manufacturing properties sell when they're vacant because that's when they go up for sale. You don't sell a thriving business typically," she said. But Rep. John Kivela, a Marquette Democrat, said the retailers — which he characterized as "large out-of-state corporations" — are exploiting a loophole while smaller Main Street competitor businesses still must pay higher taxes. "This is touching every corner of the state," he said, seeking to debunk a perception that the tax appeals primarily affect Upper Peninsula communities. He said it is "wrong" that businesses such as Wal-Mart, Menards and Home Depot are paying way less in taxes in Michigan than in the states where they are headquartered. The bill's critics question if such comparisons to other states are apples to apples. The renewed debate in Michigan, where the dark store strategy took hold before spreading elsewhere, comes as Wisconsin Republicans aim to close the so-called loophole. Indiana last year enacted a law to curb the tactic. But with the legislation likely to stall in the Senate Finance Committee if it clears the House again, municipalities' hopes may hinge on the Michigan Supreme Court. Justices in February ordered arguments in a dispute between Escanaba and Menards. The state appeals court in 2016 ruled for the city and reversed the Tax Tribunal's decision to use sales comparisons in a tax reassessment case instead of the cost of construction less depreciation, noting how deed restrictions prevent the reuse of many big-box store properties as retail space. Maturen's bill would limit the extent to which other similar properties could be used for comparison if they have deed restrictions. Deena Bosworth, director of governmental affairs for the Michigan Association of Counties, said the restrictions "artificially drive down demand for the property, thereby lowering the value." ___ Online: House Bill 4397: http://bit.ly/2odNUnA ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00.

After the lack of sufficient support among House Republicans forced them to cancel a scheduled vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, both men highlighted the need to focus now on rewriting the U.S. tax code. “So now we’re going to go for tax reform, which I’ve always liked,” Trump said Friday following the decision to cancel the vote. Health care represented the first big test of Trump’s ability to steer ambitious proposals through Congress — yet some experts say he’s seemed more interested in tax issues throughout his comparatively brief political career. “Tax reform has always been a bigger priority for the administration than health-care reform — when they were in campaign mode, tax reform was their big thing,” said economist Kyle Pomerleau, the director of federal tax projects at the conservative Tax Foundation. During a rally earlier this week, Trump repeated a theme from recent speeches, calling for “massive tax reform” — though details of the plan he’ll offer remain unclear. ‘Ambitious Plans’ During a press conference Friday, Ryan acknowledged that failing to repeal and replace Obamacare would make a tax overhaul more difficult, but not impossible, because his members have more consensus on taxes. He said he met with the president, as well as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on Friday to discuss a tax overhaul. “Now we’re going to move on with the rest of our agenda because we have big, ambitious plans to improve people’s lives in this country,” Ryan said. Trump’s tax proposals changed throughout his presidential campaign — by Election Day, his plan had moved closer to the tax blueprint that Ryan and other House leaders prefer. Both plans would consolidate the number of individual income-tax rates to three from the existing seven; the top rate would drop to 33 percent from 39.6 percent currently. On corporate taxes, Trump and Ryan have yet to forge an agreement — particularly on the controversial issue of “border adjustments.” Ryan favors replacing the existing 35 percent corporate income tax with a 20 percent tax rate on companies’ domestic sales and imports. Exports would be excluded. Border Adjustment That border-adjusted approach — which opponents say would increase consumer prices — has divided Trump’s White House advisers, and the president hasn’t yet announced a position on it. Supporters say higher prices on imported goods would be offset over time by a strengthening dollar. “One of our concerns about it is that if the currency moves, then the Wal-Mart shopper shouldn’t be impacted,” Mnuchin said during a Friday morning appearance at an event sponsored by the media company Axios. “But if the currency moves, that has an impact for our exporters. It’s a very complicated issue worth looking at carefully.” Mnuchin said the White House is committed to a tax overhaul that includes corporate and individual tax cuts. He added that the administration had been working on a tax plan for the past two months and it’s something “we are designing from scratch and running through a lot of scenarios.” Mnuchin has previously said tax legislation would be completed by Congress’s August recess. On Friday, he said he’s still optimistic about the August target but signaled a tax overhaul by the fall might be more likely. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also said Friday the White House will be taking the lead on pushing the tax overhaul — and that the president is working on that plan now. “When you see tax reform the first time, it will be the president’s plan and we’ll drive the debate on that,” Mulvaney said during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he remains committed to getting a tax overhaul completed before Congress’s recess in August and that he still wants to use the House GOP plan to achieve a meaningful corporate rate reduction. “We’re going to head straight into the next game, which is the biggest tax reform in modern history,” Brady said.

But there still seems to be a bit of haziness on where things are going. There was movement on some of the more high-profile initiatives of the session, whether tearing down the “liquor wall” or overhauling the state’s higher education system. At the same time, there were few signs of movement on the budget, the one thing lawmakers must get done every year, and the thing that some have pegged as a reason the session could head to overtime. At the same time, a longer-term project got underway, as the once-every-20-years Constitution Revision Commission held its first meeting — and promptly got into a scrape with House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’ Lakes, about when the next few get-togethers should be held. There were also issues of crime and justice to emerge, including the ongoing battle over an Orlando prosecutor’s decision not to seek the death penalty in capital punishment cases and one House Republican’s own brush with the law as he made his way home from the Capitol. The skirmish over the Constitutional Revision Commission has its roots in a stinging defeat of Carlos Beruff, now the panel’s chairman. Beruff months ago lost his attempt to win the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in a bare-knuckles battle against U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. By Monday, Beruff had undertaken another project that could have long-lasting effects on the state: chairing the panel empowered to recommend constitutional amendments directly to the voters, who will decide whether to adopt those changes in November 2018. Beruff, a Sarasota homebuilder and close political ally of Gov. Rick Scott, is the first chairman of a Constitution Revision Commission selected by a Republican. He pledged an open process as the 37-member body got down to work in a ceremonial meeting. “Every member of the CRC will have the opportunity to be heard and have the chance to fight for the issues they believe are important to this state,” he said. “Most importantly, though, we need to listen to the citizens.” Complaints from various corners accused Beruff of having no apparent experience in constitutional law, and also raised questions about his closeness with Scott. But even some Democratic members of the GOP-dominated commission seemed less than concerned. In fact, one of the first flashpoints around Beruff’s leadership of the commission came from Corcoran, a Republican whose relationship with Scott has become increasingly strained over the last several months. Of the four men allowed to pick members of the commission — Scott, Corcoran, Senate President Joe Negron and Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Jorge Labarga — the House speaker was the only one to place current legislators on the panel. Corcoran appointed five members. So when the first four public hearings were announced — all of them to be held outside of Tallahassee, and during the ongoing legislative session — Corcoran was not pleased. “Obviously … especially when you have such a once-in-20-year august body dealing with something that is of the highest impact, which is our Constitution, and you only have a limited number of members, 37, and immediately the first action is to disenfranchise one-sixth, I don’t think that’s a good start,” he said. A spokeswoman for the commission responded Friday, noting that videos of the meetings would be available online and more meetings will be held. “As a commission which meets just once every 20 years, commissioners have a responsibility to be accountable to the people of Florida and accomplish as much as we can in the short time we have,” said Meredith Beatrice. “The work before this commission is incredibly important. We will be working with all commissioners on additional public hearings to ensure the best possible outcome for families in our state.” TEAR DOWN THE WALL The nation’s most prominent Republican might be devoted to building a wall, but in Florida, some members of the Senate GOP were part of a push to tear one down. The so-called “liquor wall” — a Depression-era ban on liquor being sold alongside groceries — took a hit when the Senate narrowly approved a measure (SB 106) to get rid of the prohibition. The chamber voted 21-17 to approve the bill, as members argued over whether it might kill someone. And as two of the Senate’s more prominent Republican members got into a public fight on the floor. The issue has led to repeated legislative battles in recent years, pitting Walmart and Target, which want to stock liquor on shelves near other goods, against Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, which have stand-alone liquor stores as part of their corporate blueprints. In asking lawmakers to reject the proposal, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, said “large corporate citizens want us to do it (approve the bill) for their own economic purposes.” That prompted Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, to fire back in a speech that ended with him dropping a live microphone on his desk. “We talk about who is pushing it, but we know who is pushing against it too, Sen. Latvala. We know who’s pushing against it real hard,” Lee said. On the other end of the Capitol, House committees began moving forward with two marquee issues. First, they approved the latest version of legislation in the years-long battle over what comes next for the state’s gambling industry. The House Ways and Means Committee voted 11-7 to approve the proposal (HB 7037), aimed at creating a new agreement with the Seminole Tribe, even if a tribe representative recently called the proposal a “non-starter.” The bill would continue to allow the tribe to have exclusive rights to operate “banked” card games, such as blackjack, at five of its casinos. In exchange, the Seminoles would have to guarantee $3 billion in payments to the state — earmarked mainly for education — over seven years. But critics objected that the proposal gives short shrift to pari-mutuels. The measure would, among other things, ban popular and lucrative “designated player” poker-style games operated by numerous cardrooms throughout the state. “The pari-mutuel industry has been a friend to this state. They’ve helped provide a lot of dollars for a lot of things to happen. They by-and-large are getting treated less well than they deserve for the service they’ve rendered the state,” Rep. Joe Geller, D-Aventura, said. Sen. Bill Galvano, a Bradenton Republican shepherding the upper chamber’s proposal, was optimistic. “It’s only week three (of the 60-day legislative session) and at this point I am more focused on the fact that gaming bills are moving than the differences,” Galvano, who is slated to take over as Senate president in November 2018, said in a text message late Tuesday. On the education front, a House committee approved its version of a higher-ed reform bill, one that includes expanding Bright Futures scholarships and requiring state universities to begin using “block” tuition, some of the earliest movement on a priority of Negron, R-Stuart. Both bills would expand the top-level Bright Futures award for “academic scholars” to cover full tuition and fees for those students who qualify for the merit-based aid. But while the Senate would expand the scholarship for “academic scholars” to the summer semester, the House wants to expand summer support to all Bright Future recipients. There are also differences over the details of the tuition plan, which would replace the current per-credit hour charge with a flat per-semester fee. PUNISHMENT AND CRIME Outside the walls of the Capitol, the firestorm started by a Central Florida state attorney who says she won’t seek the death penalty continued to play out. Aramis Ayala, whose decision not to ask for capital punishment for alleged cop-killer Markeith Loyd started the dispute, accused Scott this week of abusing his authority by handing the case to another state attorney. Ayala, state attorney for the 9th Judicial Circuit in Orange and Osceola counties, asked a judge Monday to put a hold on proceedings in the case of Loyd, accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, and the execution-style killing of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton. In a five-page filing, Ayala argued that Scott lacks the power to strip her of her role as prosecutor. If a court interpreted state law to allow Scott’s action, Ayala wrote, the governor could supersede a prosecutor in any given case. “Giving the governor the tremendous and unfettered discretion to interfere in that decision making, would be unprecedented and could undermine the entire justice system in Florida,” she wrote. Scott defended his decision to appoint a different prosecutor. “So the first thing I did was I asked her to recuse herself. She said she wasn’t going to, so I moved the case to Brad King. Last week, she said she was fine with that. Today she’s changed her position. So the case has been assigned to Brad King, and that was the right decision,” the governor said. By the end of the week, another potential criminal case had grabbed attention. With a blood-alcohol level nearly double the legal limit, state Rep. Cary Pigman was charged with drunken driving after a traffic stop on Florida’s Turnpike several hours after a House session Thursday, according to a police report. Pigman, R-Avon Park, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. Calls to his legislative offices went to voice mail. STORY OF THE WEEK: The Constitution Revision Commission held its first meeting as it embarks on the once-every-20-years task of recommending changes to the state’s basic law. QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “This is Florida’s version of `To Kill a Mockingbird.’ And I appreciate the committee supporting this resolution so that these families can get some closure.”—Sen. Gary Farmer, D-Fort Lauderdale, on a proposal (SCR 920) that would apologize to families of the “Groveland Four,” a quartet of African-American men convicted under dubious circumstances of raping a white woman in 1949. Two of the men were killed in the aftermath of the alleged crime and two others served lengthy prison sentences. by Brandon Larrabee, The News Service of Florida Comments Name (required) Email Address (will not be published) (required) Website (enter your own site, if any; not northescambia.com) Your Comments: Have a comment on this story?

Rebecca Waechter doesn't need to listen to people talk about heroin and prescription opioid addiction to understand its far-reaching effects. She need only remember the night she almost died of an overdose in a friend's Fort Collins bathroom. Nine years after that near-death experience, the 35-year-old Loveland resident remains painfully acquainted with addiction's deadly toll. As she sifts through a small binder stuffed with wrinkled letters and old photos of friends and lovers alike, she utters a phrase no amount of practice makes easier: "no longer with us." She's lost track of the toll, though she estimates losing more than a dozen friends and loved ones to the deadly grip of opioid addiction. "It's terrifying to me," Waechter said, her voice tinged with frustration over the ignorance in places like Fort Collins of the prevalence of opioid and narcotic abuse. "It is next door. It's everywhere. It's here. "You don't need to travel anywhere to get it. It is everywhere. And it's cheap and just readily accessible. And people aren't aware." The number of people who die each year from a heroin or opioid prescription painkiller overdose in Colorado quadrupled between 1999 and 2016, when 442 overdose deaths were reported. That trend follows a similar quadrupling of opioid prescriptions issued nationwide between 1999-2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Politicians and public health experts across the nation have called this "epidemic" cause for greater access to treatment and restricted access to drugs. In Colorado, legislative proposals seek to establish a center for research of opioid prevention and treatment, and to create a medication-assisted treatment pilot program for opioid-dependent patients in Pueblo and Routt counties. The Larimer County coroner noted eight fentanyl, nine heroin and 14 prescription opiate deaths in 2016. Records from area health care providers show the number of people hooked on heroin has skyrocketed, and regional first responders now administer naloxone, an anti-overdose drug known by its trade name Narcan, hundreds of times annually. "In the past, you had a picture in your mind of who a heroin addict was. Now we're getting teenage children that are doing it," said Fort Collins Police Services Lt. David Pearson, who heads the Northern Colorado Drug Task Force. "You're seeing the demographics of the heroin abuse change." Residents like Waechter are becoming hooked on prescription pain pills, often after otherwise routine procedures or treatments. What follows for those who become opioid dependent is an increased tolerance and then, left in a desperate state of withdrawal, buying pills on the black market. From there, heroin — cheaper and less regulated — is just a step away. Health care workers are frustrated about how we got here. Criminal justice experts are bewildered. Community advocates are bothered about the stigma that accompanies heroin's rise in the Choice City. "There's an opioid epidemic in the country," said Larimer County Chief Deputy District Attorney Daniel McDonald. "I think it has definitely hit here. And it definitely goes beyond what your average person thinks about when they think about drug addiction." For some, like Ryan Patterson, addiction was too much, leading to his death in August. For others, like Piper Harris, the future isn't the priority. Getting through the day-to-day Methadone treatments is all she can think about. And for those like Waechter, the story continues to unfold with continued reminders of those "no longer with us." 'NO LONGER ON THE FRINGES' Summer Alameel will never shake the day she found the syringe. A Colorado State University master's student at the time, Alameel knew her boyfriend, Ryan Patterson, was struggling after the death of his father. He loved art and music and worked as a botanist after attending the Brussels American School in Belgium. He could always find the good in those he met, Alameel said. But in the depths of his despair, Patterson began experimenting with the leftover painkillers that had helped his terminally ill father dull the pain. "Before we knew it, those occasional escapes became our day-to-day reality," Alameel said, speaking to a crowd during a recent Coloradoan Storytellers event in Fort Collins. Soon Patterson couldn't do chores, hold down work or engage socially, Alameel said. And then one day, she looked under the mattress and in cupboards and on top of bookshelves. "Room by room, piece by piece, I discovered what I had been too scared to see. Ryan was using heroin. I was in such disbelief as I stood there looking at the syringe that I actually took a picture and sent it to a friend for confirmation," Alameel said. "This couldn't be heroin." It was. And it was destroying her life and that of her loving, educated boyfriend. Rehab and relapse followed. So did hospitalization for an antibiotic-resistant infection brought on by Patterson's heroin use. Alameel talked with him often, all the way to the end, and would tell him she believed in him, that she loved him. She visited him in the hospital, too. "I held his hand and I kissed his forehead and I told him how much I loved him. I hate that love wasn't enough to pull him through it. But the truth about heroin is it's bigger than love, it's bigger than willpower, it's bigger than anything," Alameel said. "Heroin is no longer on the fringes. It can happen to anyone." ALONE AND IN NEED Piper Harris enjoyed the escape the pills promised. Ever the outcast just trying to fit in with her Fort Collins neighbors, she dabbled with other substances early on. She swore off alcohol after it nearly poisoned her to death when she was in eighth grade — she said she blew a 0.4 blood alcohol content after she started drinking with the high school kids. She ended up in Turning Point, a program for youth struggling with mental health or substance abuse issues, and graduated from Rocky Mountain High School in 2010. But she soon got closer with her brother who had begun using heroin and methamphetamine. They were best friends, and the substance use was "just a phase," she said. She used with other people. That meant she didn't have a problem — the people who shot up alone were the ones with issues, she thought. Piper's brother died of an OxyContin overdose in 2010. It was the first significant loss she experienced. And then Dad died of cancer in 2012. Her spiral ensued. She started stealing money from her mom to sustain her habit and ended up with charges for theft and forgery on her criminal record. "What I hated the most is no matter how much pain I knew I was causing, I couldn't stop. It's indescribable, the feeling. No one chooses to go and lose everything and have to lie, cheat and steal to get your fix," Harris said. To Harris, addiction is form of cancer. It takes years to work through and sometimes never releases its grasp. After losing her job at Wal-Mart, Harris started treatment. She would make the trek to a Longmont Methadone clinic daily, where she'd pay $82 each week for treatments that wean addicts off of heroin. Other clinics exist, including one now in Fort Collins, but even with Medicaid, getting treatment was a challenge. While making her trips to Longmont, Harris completed a deferred sentence for the theft and forgery charges, which were dismissed earlier this month. Now 25, she wants to reduce her Methadone dosage. Methadone is still an opiate and she wants to be completely clean. Otherwise, she has been clean for almost six months and hopes one day to return to school, possibly to pursue a career in addiction therapy. The word "future" is returning to her vocabulary. "I barely know who I am anymore," Harris said. "It's a whole discovery all over again, and that's the piece that can get really hard. It's a huge process. It's not just about go get clean and then everything's dandy. You need those supports." SPIRALING INTO ADDICTION Rebecca Waechter, who nearly died after overdosing in a friend's bathroom, struggles to choose the starting point for a journey with addiction that spanned more than two decades and recently culminated with news she only could have dreamed of. Born and raised in northern Colorado, Waechter grew up in Loveland and graduated from Ferguson High School, which serves children at risk of dropping out of school. Childhood was rough, she admits, and included a teen pregnancy, an eventual emancipation and occasional experimentation with different substances. She grew up fast, found work and lived an otherwise normal life. The pain began shortly after she had her second child in 2005. It was a tough pregnancy, and she was prescribed opioid-based painkillers OxyContin and Dilaudid to fight the effects of a painful inflammatory disease. Alternative pain treatments were rare and costly due to insurance limitations, and Waechter soon became a functioning opioid addict, holding a job as a branch manager's assistant at a heating and cooling company. So began the trips to a mall in Denver — a pilgrimage recalled by multiple recovering addicts interviewed for this story. It was a long drive for a fix, but it was the only alternative to the deathly illness and debilitating pain of opioid withdrawal. Heroin dealers would seek Waechter out as she wandered the mall. An eight-ball of heroin — one-eighth of an ounce — cost roughly $200 and would be enough to last a few days. The drug was far cheaper and more euphoric than pain pills, but carried with it a stigma Waechter still describes as "disgusting." "I was very private in my addiction. There were only a few of my good friends that knew about it," she said. "I wasn't proud of it." She knew what she was doing wasn't logical. "It temporarily made me happy, and it got rid of my pain. I didn't feel pain," she said. "I didn't feel pain emotionally. I didn't feel pain physically. And mentally, it numbed me." Drugs came easy — her doctor prescribed them, she says, without adequate consultation or follow-up. As her tolerance for the drugs increased so did their cost, so Waechter sought out pills from friends of friends. Criminal charges weren't far off. Driving while ability impaired in 2006. Possession of a controlled substance in 2007. She lost custody of her daughter when child protective services got involved, questioning her fitness to look after youngsters amid her increasingly apparent prescription addiction. That was the truly devastating blow, she said. "I opted out of doctors and went straight to heroin," she said, adding, "It was like a string of events that just took a quick downward spiral." Waechter was staying with a friend March 12, 2008, at small house. They were having a small get-together and, in an effort to keep her addiction as private as possible, she went in to the bathroom to get her fix. She remembers standing up before the world went dark. "I was dead for seven minutes," she said. A friend gave her CPR. Someone called 911. When first responders arrived, they slid a needle into her vein to dose her with naloxone. Waechter awoke strapped to a backboard and surrounded by EMTs. "I was freezing. I mean, I was white and blue and I was so cold," she said. "But I was fine. Right as I came to, it was like, 'Get off of me! I'm fine. Leave me alone.'" She was whisked away to the hospital. The next day, she was arrested and booked into the Larimer County Jail, facing a felony charge for possession of a controlled substance. She spent several months in jail — a forced and debilitating detox — and was ultimately placed on an intensive supervised probation that lasted about four years. In the months that followed Waechter picked up odd jobs in Denver and was treated with Suboxone to ease off of her opioid dependency. The 2008 heroin overdose was the last time she used the drug, and she has been clean for about a year and a half. "It's stories like Becky's that make you want to be an addictions counselor," said Brooke Badberg, a program supervisor with SummitStone Health Partners who has worked with Waechter since her 2008 overdose and arrest. WHAT COMES NEXT Alameel hopes people take time to consider the various ways addiction destroys lives — it's not something reserved for those who live in the shadows. The love of her life couldn't survive its grasp. Harris continues to grapple with the concept of a future, stuck instead in the present of routine Methadone dosages and coping with isolation. Her dog, Tizzy, helps keep her company. But she's unsure when she'll get a degree and move on with life. And Waechter, now years removed from her near-death overdose, has watched as the nation's opioid issue takes its toll among her friends and family in northern Colorado. But her story is unfolding in ways she could only dream of weeks, months or years ago. She's optimistic she'll be able to use her past as a tool to help others — especially kids — by showing them that life can go on after even the roughest of starts. "A lot of it is just telling somebody that you love them and that you care about (them)," she said. "That's enough. They need that positive reinforcement. They need to feel needed. And a lot of kids don't get that. I didn't get that." Waechter learned this month that SummitStone Health Partners, where she has received counseling over the years, is taking steps that might result in her getting hired, trained and certified to be a peer services counselor. Once credentialed, she plans to return to work with the health care provider doing family counseling. She also expects she'll be able to work with teens at Ferguson High School. "That is my desire is to be a voice and to give back and contribute and to make it so they don't have to experience and live through what I did," she said. "And thankfully, I did live through it."

Trump won, get over it Ukraine’s genocidal famine remembered These businesses REALLY recycle If you are sitting down to do your family budget in order to deal with such necessities as paying for hydro, or perhaps wondering if your children will ever be able to afford a home somewhere even near the GTA, consider this. According to Forbes magazine, for the first time ever there are in excess of 2,000 billionaires in the world. Now go pour yourself a shot. Each year Forbes publishes its billionaires catalogue, which I for some sadistic reason find extremely entertaining to read. It’s not like I’ll ever see my name on that list. I’d have to win three U.S Powerball lotteries, just to make it to the bottom rung — barely. I suppose it’s like fantasizing about playing for the Blue Jays, and I’m nearly 64 with a back that occasionally deserts me. What does a billion dollars look like? Well, put a $100 bill in your hand and imagine 10 million more on top of it. You could spend $1,000 a day and it would take 2,739 years before it was all gone. Or give it to the Liberal Party of Ontario and wait a week. So who are the kings of currency? Once again, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates leads the way with an estimated worth of $86 billion. Warren Buffet, head of Berkshire Hathaway, made $14.8 billion last year, moving him back to second spot with $75.6 billion. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos raked in $27.6 billion and he’s now sitting at number three with $72.8 billion. Amancio Ortega, who along with his wife founded the fashion line, Zara, and owns a vast real estate empire, plus the Spanish soccer club Deportivo La Coruna, is worth $71.3 billion. That makes him the fourth wealthiest man in the world and the richest man in Europe. Rounding out the top five is Mark Zuckerberg, the man behind Facebook, worth $56 billion. And he’s only 32 years old. I’ll have to remember to “like” that on his Facebook page. There are also four billionaires in their twenties. (Lazy millennials.) The three wealthiest women are, at number 14, Lillian Bettencourt, with $39.5 billion. She owns one third of L’Oreal. Next is Alice Walton, daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, with $33.8 billion. Jacqueline Mars is worth $27 billion. She owns one-third of Mars Inc., as in Mars bars, which happens to be the world’s largest candy maker. Here at home — not my home, but Canada — David Thomson, the media giant, is the leader at $27 billion, good for twenty-fourth place. However, that’s according to Forbes. Canadian Business Magazine says he’s worth $39.13 billion. He bests Galen Weston’s $13.22 billion and the cheese dynasty Saputo family, with $10.61 billion. How about the leader of the free world, U.S. President Donald Trump, who, during his election campaign, claimed he was worth $8-billion plus? Well, according to Forbes, it’s now less than half that, apparently due to a changing New York real estate market. In the past year, Forbes says, he’s dropped from 324th to 544th place, with a current estimated worth of $3.5 billion. Mind you, that’s still a lot of rubles. Nyet?

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh has ditched his Dockers for another 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 5:47 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens

butter and jelly. Milk and cookies. Batman and Robin. Maize and blue. Jim Harbaugh and khakis. All are iconic combinations, but it appears the latter is undergoing a few changes right now. The Michigan head coach’s affinity for a pair of khakis has been so strong over the years that it’s become almost comical how much he likes the style of pant. Heck, he even got a commercial out of it a few years ago when he specifically started getting outfitted with Dockers brand khakis. Despite being a paid endorser though, it appears that Harbaugh has dropped the famous Levi’s brand version of khakis to attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind in another pair of pants. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Not only is the switch from Dockers to Lululemon result in a lot more comfort for the Wolverines coach, it’s probably a bit more of a hit to the ol’ wallet than dropping by Walmart for a pair of khakis off the shelf. It probably doesn’t make a huge difference for Harbaugh though given that he’s the highest paid coach in the country but it might result in a few more trips to the mall. Either way, what it does mean is that now we demand a new commercial featuring Harbaugh and khakis. After all, if you’re upping the clothing game, you’ve got to up the ad game as well. View 10 Comments Scroll Down For: Florida State planning new facility to catch up with Clemson Getty Images 9 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 2:54 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Florida State completed a major facility overhaul not even three years ago. But the thing about arms races is that when someone pulls ahead of you it means you are behind. And Clemson officially pulled ahead earlier this year with the opening of its glistening, slide-equipped new home. As such, Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that Florida State now has plans to construct its own standalone facility, going as far as meeting with an architect. “We need room. We need meeting space, player development areas. You’ve got to have those areas and also to show off your history. That’s what Florida State is known for, being a great football program,” Fisher told ESPN. “You can never stand still. If you’re not evolving and moving, people are going to bypass you. You’ve got to keep going. The great programs never settle. We’re always looking for that edge. It’s going to help recruiting. It’s going to help player development. We get a lot of guys that are three-and-out, so we’ve got to have space for them to get them developed as quickly as we can so we can get production out of them.” While saying that it’s a “competitive” race and not an arms race, Fisher also tried to sell that the plans for the ‘Noles’ new home were unrelated to Clemson’s new facility. “I don’t care what they’ve got,” Fisher said. “I’m worried about what we’ve got. If I don’t think it’s going to make a difference in our program for these kids to develop as people, students and players, I won’t ask. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I was taught if you need it, do what you’ve got to do to be successful but don’t waste. I’m not going to do that. But there’s things you’ve got to have to be successful and that’s the next step, in my opinion.” View 9 Comments Former Michigan TE Jake Butt says college players should be able to cash in on likenesses Getty Images 11 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 12:34 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) For the record, Jake Butt shouldn’t “be paid” in the strictest sense of the term — to receive a paycheck for services rendered. Rather, the former Michigan tight end believes players should be able to profit from their statuses as college athletes when the NCAA, its conferences and member schools are already doing the same. (Having an extremely marketable last name probably contributed to the forming of this opinion.) “Something needs to change,” Butt told ESPN.com at Michigan’s pro day. “I don’t want a check from the NCAA. I don’t know if that’s something that’s likely. But the big thing is they say you can’t use your name to benefit. I can’t go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny’s, I can’t go in there and get a free breakfast because I’m only getting that because of my name. “That’s not to say I can’t make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I’m a good guy, a really good guy — sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can’t accept anything free for that. They said I can’t go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can’t go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that’s only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and he can negotiate his price. It’s kind of ridiculous to me.” Butt was a victim of the cruelest twist in circumstances possible for a college athlete — a season-ending injury at the end of his final season. A senior, Butt was one of the top tight ends on the draft board before suffering a torn ACL in the Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to Florida State. The Mackey Award winner as the nation’s top tight end will be drafted next month, but the damage to his bank account resulting from the injuries is significant. Being able to profit from his own name and image would have served as insurance against the loss of value he suffered due to the injury. “I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can’t use my name to benefit off my likeness in college,” Butt said. “Why can I see ‘I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,’ I see those shirts and I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can’t.” View 11 Comments Baylor strength coach apparently no longer with the program Getty Images 1 Comment By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 6:49 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) It seems every bit of news related to Baylor football nowadays has to do with the school’s on-going sexual assault scandal but it appears there is one bit of information coming out of the program that doesn’t have something to do with that. A school spokesperson told ESPN on Friday that football strength coach Kaz Kazadi has been “reassigned to a role outside the athletic performance staff.” A report from the local ESPN Radio affiliate in Waco indicates that the move will eventually have the coach leaving the school altogether. Kazadi spent nearly a decade with the Bears and played a big role in the team’s on-field turnaround under the former coaching staff. Several former players took to Twitter on Friday to express their shock over the loss of one of the cornerstones of the team in recent years. After the hire of Matt Rhule this offseason, it isn’t too surprising to see some turnover among those staff members connected to the previous regime. Baylor’s new head coach brought most of his strength staff with him from Temple so it was probably only a matter of time before Kazadi moved on, though the timing of the quasi-announcement (the Bears started spring football last weekend) is somewhat interesting. Either way, it appears Baylor will have a new direction in the weight room going forward. View 1 Comment Former Penn State president found guilty of role in Sandusky scandal Getty Images 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 4:44 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Former Penn State president Graham Spanier’s day in court has come and has resulted in a guilty verdict. The Centre Daily Times is among the outlets reporting that a jury has found Spanier guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of children in a trial related to his role in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. In addition, Spanier was found not guilty on two other counts, one a similar child endangerment charge and the other a count of criminal conspiracy. The verdict comes after lengthy deliberations by the jury in the case, which took a turn last week when former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz plead guilty to child endangerment charges as part of the same trial. All three figure to be sentenced in the next few months. Prior to the scandal, Spanier was widely considered to be one of the most respected college presidents in the country and heavily involved in NCAA matters. However he was one of several key figures fired by the school as a result of covering up the actions of Sandusky, the Nittany Lions’ former defensive coordinator who was found guilty on 45 charges of sexually abusing minors. While the verdict is likely to be appealed, Spanier is nevertheless facing the prospect of joining Sandusky behind bars as a result of his own involvement in the scandal.

The cost for the console is $299.99, not including any games. “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” “1-2-Switch,” “Snipperclips – Cut it out, Together!” and “Just Dance 2017” are now among the few games available for the Switch. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, available April 28, is one of the games planned for future release. Many Nintendo fans are disappointed by the short the list of available games. The Nintendo Switch consists of a tablet-like console, which includes a screen and a kickstand for tabletop mode, a dock, which holds the console for charging and TV mode, and two controllers, called joy-cons. The joy-cons’ side controllers slide off the main console to become individual joysticks and can also be combined with each other to create a single traditional-style controller, allowing for single or multiplayer gaming. The joy-cons come with removable wrist straps which also feature larger L and R buttons. The right joy-con also has an IR scanner that can detect hand signals, such as rock, paper and scissors, a feature which does not have many, if any, in-game uses yet. The Nintendo Switch also has a motion sensor, a feature used in some of the games, such as “Breath of the Wild.” In this game, the player can tilt and turn the controller to change the orientation of items held by Link’s magnesis power. The Nintendo Switch is currently available in two color schemes: standard gray and the more rare “Red-Blue” version, as users call it, which features one neon red and one neon blue joy-con. The Nintendo Switch also allows for online gaming, which is free until the paid service launches in the fall.  Many users have experienced the occasional glitch or lag while playing certain games, particularly “Breath of the Wild,” as well as issues connecting to the internet. Things like these are to be expected with the release of a new console, especially one as complex and versatile as the Nintendo Switch. However, these issues do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the Nintendo Switch. Other than those issues, which will hopefully be fixed as time goes on with software updates and new games, the Nintendo Switch meets a lot of the expectations fans had for it. “My favorite thing about the Switch is the versatility, the capability to use it as a home console you can take anywhere you want,” said James Kessler, an Oswego State freshman. Kessler was among other gaming fans at Wal-Mart on the night of March 2 for the official midnight release of the Nintendo Switch. The Oswego GameStop ran out of pre-orders earlier that night, but Wal-Mart had yet to put theirs out. Oddly enough, there is a trend of licking the game cartridges, comparable to the cinnamon challenge or the salt and ice challenge, though not as hazardous to one’s health. A tweet from Jeff Gerstmann, co-founder of the game blog Giant Bomb, revealed the cartridges taste absolutely awful. A Nintendo spokesperson told the website Polygon that the cartridges are coated with the “most bitter chemical compound known to humanity” to discourage people, specifically small children, from swallowing them. Though some may view this as a smart idea, others feel that it is a bit ridiculous and unnecessary, considering that such things should be kept out of reach of small children. Though the Nintendo Switch is far from perfect and still has a ways to go, it has already made its mark as an innovation in gaming. Its ability to act as both a home console and a handheld game system makes it great for those who cannot bear to put their game down to go eat or to get to class or work on time or to go hang out with friends.

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh has ditched his Dockers for another 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 5:47 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens

butter and jelly. Milk and cookies. Batman and Robin. Maize and blue. Jim Harbaugh and khakis. All are iconic combinations, but it appears the latter is undergoing a few changes right now. The Michigan head coach’s affinity for a pair of khakis has been so strong over the years that it’s become almost comical how much he likes the style of pant. Heck, he even got a commercial out of it a few years ago when he specifically started getting outfitted with Dockers brand khakis. Despite being a paid endorser though, it appears that Harbaugh has dropped the famous Levi’s brand version of khakis to attack the day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind in another pair of pants. Just had a nice chat w/ Jim Harbaugh about his khaki game. He upgraded to @lululemon pants and says, "I'll never wear anything else." Smart. pic.twitter.com/uDny4Ceqc8 — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 24, 2017 Not only is the switch from Dockers to Lululemon result in a lot more comfort for the Wolverines coach, it’s probably a bit more of a hit to the ol’ wallet than dropping by Walmart for a pair of khakis off the shelf. It probably doesn’t make a huge difference for Harbaugh though given that he’s the highest paid coach in the country but it might result in a few more trips to the mall. Either way, what it does mean is that now we demand a new commercial featuring Harbaugh and khakis. After all, if you’re upping the clothing game, you’ve got to up the ad game as well.

But the thing about arms races is that when someone pulls ahead of you it means you are behind. And Clemson officially pulled ahead earlier this year with the opening of its glistening, slide-equipped new home. As such, Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that Florida State now has plans to construct its own standalone facility, going as far as meeting with an architect. “We need room. We need meeting space, player development areas. You’ve got to have those areas and also to show off your history. That’s what Florida State is known for, being a great football program,” Fisher told ESPN. “You can never stand still. If you’re not evolving and moving, people are going to bypass you. You’ve got to keep going. The great programs never settle. We’re always looking for that edge. It’s going to help recruiting. It’s going to help player development. We get a lot of guys that are three-and-out, so we’ve got to have space for them to get them developed as quickly as we can so we can get production out of them.” While saying that it’s a “competitive” race and not an arms race, Fisher also tried to sell that the plans for the ‘Noles’ new home were unrelated to Clemson’s new facility. “I don’t care what they’ve got,” Fisher said. “I’m worried about what we’ve got. If I don’t think it’s going to make a difference in our program for these kids to develop as people, students and players, I won’t ask. I didn’t grow up with a lot. I was taught if you need it, do what you’ve got to do to be successful but don’t waste. I’m not going to do that. But there’s things you’ve got to have to be successful and that’s the next step, in my opinion.” View 9 Comments Former Michigan TE Jake Butt says college players should be able to cash in on likenesses Getty Images 11 Comments By Zach BarnettMar 25, 2017, 12:34 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) For the record, Jake Butt shouldn’t “be paid” in the strictest sense of the term — to receive a paycheck for services rendered. Rather, the former Michigan tight end believes players should be able to profit from their statuses as college athletes when the NCAA, its conferences and member schools are already doing the same. (Having an extremely marketable last name probably contributed to the forming of this opinion.) “Something needs to change,” Butt told ESPN.com at Michigan’s pro day. “I don’t want a check from the NCAA. I don’t know if that’s something that’s likely. But the big thing is they say you can’t use your name to benefit. I can’t go into my favorite breakfast spot, Benny’s, I can’t go in there and get a free breakfast because I’m only getting that because of my name. “That’s not to say I can’t make friends with the owner because of the person I am. I’m a good guy, a really good guy — sociable guy, made a lot of friends. I can’t accept anything free for that. They said I can’t go down the street, the example one of them gave us is you can’t go to [get] tires and negotiate your price from $600 to $500 because that’s only because of your name. But Joe Schmo can go down the street and he can negotiate his price. It’s kind of ridiculous to me.” Butt was a victim of the cruelest twist in circumstances possible for a college athlete — a season-ending injury at the end of his final season. A senior, Butt was one of the top tight ends on the draft board before suffering a torn ACL in the Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to Florida State. The Mackey Award winner as the nation’s top tight end will be drafted next month, but the damage to his bank account resulting from the injuries is significant. Being able to profit from his own name and image would have served as insurance against the loss of value he suffered due to the injury. “I should be the example of why college athletes should be getting paid in college or why I can’t use my name to benefit off my likeness in college,” Butt said. “Why can I see ‘I Like Jake Butt and I Cannot Lie,’ I see those shirts and I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck in college. Who knows? Heaven forbid something happens in the NFL, can I really benefit off of it when it was at the most? No, I can’t.” View 11 Comments Baylor strength coach apparently no longer with the program Getty Images 1 Comment By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 6:49 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) It seems every bit of news related to Baylor football nowadays has to do with the school’s on-going sexual assault scandal but it appears there is one bit of information coming out of the program that doesn’t have something to do with that. A school spokesperson told ESPN on Friday that football strength coach Kaz Kazadi has been “reassigned to a role outside the athletic performance staff.” A report from the local ESPN Radio affiliate in Waco indicates that the move will eventually have the coach leaving the school altogether. Kazadi spent nearly a decade with the Bears and played a big role in the team’s on-field turnaround under the former coaching staff. Several former players took to Twitter on Friday to express their shock over the loss of one of the cornerstones of the team in recent years. After the hire of Matt Rhule this offseason, it isn’t too surprising to see some turnover among those staff members connected to the previous regime. Baylor’s new head coach brought most of his strength staff with him from Temple so it was probably only a matter of time before Kazadi moved on, though the timing of the quasi-announcement (the Bears started spring football last weekend) is somewhat interesting. Either way, it appears Baylor will have a new direction in the weight room going forward. View 1 Comment Former Penn State president found guilty of role in Sandusky scandal Getty Images 10 Comments By Bryan FischerMar 24, 2017, 4:44 PM EDT Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Former Penn State president Graham Spanier’s day in court has come and has resulted in a guilty verdict. The Centre Daily Times is among the outlets reporting that a jury has found Spanier guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of children in a trial related to his role in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. In addition, Spanier was found not guilty on two other counts, one a similar child endangerment charge and the other a count of criminal conspiracy. The verdict comes after lengthy deliberations by the jury in the case, which took a turn last week when former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz plead guilty to child endangerment charges as part of the same trial. All three figure to be sentenced in the next few months. Prior to the scandal, Spanier was widely considered to be one of the most respected college presidents in the country and heavily involved in NCAA matters. However he was one of several key figures fired by the school as a result of covering up the actions of Sandusky, the Nittany Lions’ former defensive coordinator who was found guilty on 45 charges of sexually abusing minors. While the verdict is likely to be appealed, Spanier is nevertheless facing the prospect of joining Sandusky behind bars as a result of his own involvement in the scandal.

Brady Says GOP Will Head Straight Into Tax Reform President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan say they’re ready to put a tax overhaul at the top of their agendas. After the lack of sufficient support among House Republicans forced them to cancel a scheduled vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, both men highlighted the need to focus now on rewriting the U.S. tax code. “So now we’re going to go for tax reform, which I’ve always liked,” Trump said Friday following the decision to cancel the vote. Health care represented the first big test of Trump’s ability to steer ambitious proposals through Congress -- yet some experts say he’s seemed more interested in tax issues throughout his comparatively brief political career. “Tax reform has always been a bigger priority for the administration than health-care reform -- when they were in campaign mode, tax reform was their big thing,” said economist Kyle Pomerleau, the director of federal tax projects at the conservative Tax Foundation. During a rally earlier this week, Trump repeated a theme from recent speeches, calling for “massive tax reform” -- though details of the plan he’ll offer remain unclear. ‘Ambitious Plans’ During a press conference Friday, Ryan acknowledged that failing to repeal and replace Obamacare would make a tax overhaul more difficult, but not impossible, because his members have more consensus on taxes. He said he met with the president, as well as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on Friday to discuss a tax overhaul. “Now we’re going to move on with the rest of our agenda because we have big, ambitious plans to improve people’s lives in this country,” Ryan said. Trump’s tax proposals changed throughout his presidential campaign -- by Election Day, his plan had moved closer to the tax blueprint that Ryan and other House leaders prefer. Both plans would consolidate the number of individual income-tax rates to three from the existing seven; the top rate would drop to 33 percent from 39.6 percent currently. On corporate taxes, Trump and Ryan have yet to forge an agreement -- particularly on the controversial issue of “border adjustments.” Ryan favors replacing the existing 35 percent corporate income tax with a 20 percent tax rate on companies’ domestic sales and imports. Exports would be excluded. Border Adjustment That border-adjusted approach -- which opponents say would increase consumer prices -- has divided Trump’s White House advisers, and the president hasn’t yet announced a position on it. Supporters say higher prices on imported goods would be offset over time by a strengthening dollar. “One of our concerns about it is that if the currency moves, then the Wal-Mart shopper shouldn’t be impacted," Mnuchin said during a Friday morning appearance at an event sponsored by the media company Axios. "But if the currency moves, that has an impact for our exporters. It’s a very complicated issue worth looking at carefully.” Mnuchin said the White House is committed to a tax overhaul that includes corporate and individual tax cuts. He added that the administration had been working on a tax plan for the past two months and it’s something “we are designing from scratch and running through a lot of scenarios.” Mnuchin has previously said tax legislation would be completed by Congress’s August recess. On Friday, he said he’s still optimistic about the August target but signaled a tax overhaul by the fall might be more likely. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also said Friday the White House will be taking the lead on pushing the tax overhaul -- and that the president is working on that plan now. “When you see tax reform the first time, it will be the president’s plan and we’ll drive the debate on that,” Mulvaney said during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he remains committed to getting a tax overhaul completed before Congress’s recess in August and that he still wants to use the House GOP plan to achieve a meaningful corporate rate reduction. “We’re going to head straight into the next game, which is the biggest tax reform in modern history,” Brady said.

(Getty Images) By WashingtonPost Published Sat, Mar 25, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL By Matt O’Brien Why were Republicans rushing to vote on a health-care plan that they’d barely finished drafting, that budget scorekeepers hadn’t had a chance to fully evaluate, and that, insofar as people did know about it, was widely despised? In part, it’s because their plan was so unpopular and because it got more unpopular the more people learned about it. But it’s also because only by rushing to reshape a full sixth of the American economy without knowing exactly how they would be reshaping it would Republicans be able to use health care to pave the way for the rest of their agenda, including tax reform. In other words, the GOP didn’t want to let a detail like tens of millions of people losing their health insurance get in the way of two tax cuts for the rich. Here’s what we knew about the Republican plan. The latest version that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had a chance to analyze would have, over the course of 10 years, cut taxes by $1 trillion, disproportionately benefiting the rich; cut Medicaid spending by $839 billion, exclusively harming the poor and sick; and cut the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance subsidies by about $300 billion, mostly hurting older people of modest means. Add it all up, and the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have lost their health insurance as a result. Not only that, but premiums would have increased 15 percent to 20 percent more than they otherwise would have in the next four years before so many older people were priced out of the market that premiums would have started to come down, and deductibles, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, would have been an average of $1,550 higher. In short: The GOP would have made insurance more affordable for younger people by making it unaffordable for older people and worse for everyone. This wasn’t just a matter of higher premiums and higher deductibles, though. Trumpcare also would have repealed the “essential health benefits” that plans are required to cover now. States would have been allowed to write their own rules, so, depending on where you lived, insurance companies might have been able to sell you “insurance” that didn’t cover hospitalizations, prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health care and preventive care, and also imposed annual and lifetime limits on your benefits. People who couldn’t afford insurance that actually, you know, insured them might have bought these skimpy plans with their skimpy tax credits-why not use them on a fake something instead of a real nothing?-but neither the CBO nor they themselves likely would have thought of this as being covered. The surprising thing, then, isn’t that as few as 17 percent of people approved of the American Health Care Act. It’s that as many as 17 percent did. But there’s a reason the GOP was pushing a bill that would have taken everything people don’t like about the health-care system and made it worse. That’s the fact that it would have allowed them to pass two permanent tax cuts for the rich. Anyone, you see, can pass a tax cut that expires after 10 years. But if you want to make it last-and you don’t have 60 votes in the Senate-then you need to find a way to pay for it (or at least look like you did). Taking health insurance away from poor and sick people would have done just that for the Obamacare taxes, which primarily hit people in the top 1 or 2 percent. Indeed, data from the Urban Institute shows that the combination of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the poor that was the GOP health-care plan would have been a reverse Robin Hood that redistributed income from people making $50,000 or less to mostly those making $200,000 or more. Now, the crazy thing is that this first tax cut for the rich (in the form of Obamacare “repeal and replace”) would have made a second one (this one coming in the form of “tax reform”) look more affordable. That’s because, due to parliamentary rules, tax revisions can’t lose any revenue outside the 10-year budget window if it’s going to be permanent. The question, though, is lose revenue compared to what. If Republicans had repealed the Affordable Care Act’s $1 trillion worth of taxes before they revised taxes, that’s $1 trillion less they’d have to come up with to make it look like money wasn’t being lost. Now, without those phantom savings, tax restructuring, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) admitted, will be “more difficult.” Not that it was ever going to be easy. After all, the $1 trillion they were trying to save with a “border adjustment tax” seems to be on political life support, since every major retailer, including big GOP donors such as Walmart, is opposed to it. And, as you might have guessed, there aren’t an extra $2 trillion of savings lying around for them to replace the ones they thought they were going to get from this and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Which is to say that Republicans will either have to scale back their ambitions for how deeply they will cut taxes or how long they will. Whatever they choose, though, the top tax rate isn’t going to stay under 30 percent. And for the GOP, that’s the real tragedy of 24 million people keeping their health insurance.   Click here to see the comments. Add yours now!

In part, it's because their plan was so unpopular and because it got more unpopular the more people learned about it. But it's also because only by rushing to reshape a full sixth of the American economy without knowing exactly how they would be reshaping it would Republicans be able to use health care to pave the way for the rest of their agenda, including tax reform. In other words, the GOP didn't want to let a detail like tens of millions of people losing their health insurance get in the way of two tax cuts for the rich.

If Republicans had repealed the Affordable Care Act's $1 trillion worth of taxes before they revised taxes, that's $1 trillion less they'd have to come up with to make it look like money wasn't being lost. Now, without those phantom savings, tax restructuring, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) admitted, will be “more difficult.” Not that it was ever going to be easy. After all, the $1 trillion they were trying to save with a “border adjustment tax” seems to be on political life support, since every major retailer, including big GOP donors such as Walmart, is opposed to it. And, as you might have guessed, there aren't an extra $2 trillion of savings lying around for them to replace the ones they thought they were going to get from this and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Which is to say that Republicans will either have to scale back their ambitions for how deeply they will cut taxes or how long they will. Whatever they choose, though, the top tax rate isn't going to stay under 30 percent. And for the GOP, that's the real tragedy of 24 million people keeping their health insurance. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UUDPov Illustration: Ajay Mohanty ALSO READ ITC's Deveshwar, the reinventor of a multinational ITC Q2 Preview: Modest cigarette growth to drag topline ITC net rises 10.5% on tobacco biz growth India doubles its slots on list of Asia's best universities Name change for ITC has been a part of its metamorphosis. Till 1948, it was Imperial Tobacco Company. In 1969, the company got its first Indian chairman, Ajit Narain Haksar, and the ‘Imperial’ in the company’s name became India and in 1974, it became plain ITC. But for the company’s longest-serving chairman, Yogesh Chander Deveshwar, ITC means India’s Trademarks Corporation.   In February 2017, Deveshwar stepped down from his executive role and will continue to be ITC’s non-executive chairman. Sanjiv Puri was appointed chief executive officer.   After graduating in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Deveshwar joined ITC in 1968, and became chairman and CEO in 1996. In a stint spanning more than two decades as CEO, Deveshwar grew the company’s net revenues nearly 15-fold to Rs 36,475 crore, and its profit after tax 37 times to Rs 9,845 crore; total shareholder returns grew at a compounded annual rate of 23.3 per cent between 1995-96 and 2015-16. From fewer than a hundred SKUs in 1996, the distribution highway now handles over 1,500 SKUs of multiple businesses, directly servicing over two million retail outlets across trade channels in 100,000 markets.   But that’s the ITC story in numbers. Deveshwar’s biggest achievement is that the ITC of today is more than just a cigarette maker. The company is now not just defined by its cigarette brands — India Kings, Classic and Goldflake; it is also identified by Sunfeast (cookies and biscuits), Bingo! (snacks) and Aashirvaad (staples and ready meals). The new FMCG businesses, nurtured over the last decade or so, have crafted a portfolio of 25 mother brands, commanding a consumer spend of more than Rs 12,000 crore.   The Aashirvaad brand has crossed the Rs 3,000 crore mark, Sunfeast is valued at over Rs 2,500 crore while Bingo!, Classmate and Yippee have exceeded Rs 1,000 crore each.   As Deveshwar said at his last annual general meeting in the joint capacity of chairman and CEO, “Compared to the size of ITC in 1996, the non-cigarette businesses alone represent a size akin to creating five ITCs of that time.”   ITC’s non-cigarettes businesses have grown seventeen-fold in the last two decades and registered a net segment revenue of Rs 23,000 crore. The share of cigarettes in the total revenue earned has steadily been coming down too — from 56 per cent in 2012-13 to 42 per cent in 2015-16. Financial analysts grumble that the non-cigarettes businesses don’t enjoy the profitability of the cigarettes business. Maybe so, but it is in sync with Deveshwar’s philosophy of “building for the future”.   But perhaps Deveshwar’s pride is neither in growing the non-cigarettes business, nor in creating Rs 1,000 crore-plus brands. It’s in creating world-class Indian brands. Deveshwar has always lamented that Rs 50,000-60,000 crore go out of the country in terms of royalties every year, and has even gone to the extent of congratulating Indian brands like Patanjali, which have made a mark.   “India First”, “Country before Corporation” and such mottos have since grown to aspirational levels. Deveshwar pioneered sustainability and ITC became one of the first companies to make triple bottom line performance — financial, social and environmental — a core purpose of its business strategy.   It wasn’t easy getting where ITC is right now in the non-cigarettes business. Diversification, per se, wasn’t new for ITC. Since the late 1960s, which is when Deveshwar had joined ITC, almost every ITC chairman has tried his hand at diversification. The only years that Deveshwar was missing from ITC was between 1991 and 1994, when he led Air India as chairman and managing director. And by the time Deveshwar took charge of ITC in 1996, most of its diversification initiatives had either failed, or were faltering.   So, Ajit Narain Haksar had opened ITC’s first hotel in Chennai, the ITC Welcomgroup Hotel Chola, in 1975, followed by an entry into the paperboards business. Jagdish Narain Sapru led the foray into financial services and took the iconic Bukhara restaurant to New York, apart from setting up the edible oils business, ITC Agro Tech. Krishan Lal Chugh set up the trading company, ITC Global Holdings Pte, but his stint was more memorable for a public spat with the British multinational, British American Tobacco (the single largest shareholder in ITC), over a foray into the power business, which the multinational had blocked. BAT had even tried to take control of ITC, but that didn’t work out.   The biggest challenge for Deveshwar, however, was to restore the reputation of the storied Virginia House, corporate headquarters of ITC, tattered by an investigation by the enforcement authorities under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, against 14 members of the then current and past management, including two chairmen. A retrospective excise demand of Rs 803 crore, amounting to three times the annual profit of ITC at the time, was made on the very first day that Deveshwar took charge.   The challenge, as Deveshwar told shareholders recently, was to steady the ship first and articulate a “superordinate” vision for the company. And this he proceeded to do very effectively.   Much to the displeasure of BAT, Deveshwar stuck to the diversification script even though there were exits from financial services, edible oils and overseas restaurants. Non-cigarette FMCG, hotels and information technology were identified as the new areas of growth.   From 12 hotels in 1996, ITC has grown to over 100 properties across four brands — ITC Hotels, WelcomHotels, Fortune and WelcomHeritage. There’s a lot more coming in the hotels space: 10 owned hotels are in various stages of construction in the luxury and five-star segment, while 30 owned/managed hotels are on the drawing board in the mid-market to upscale segment. And this at a time when most peers have gone the asset-light way. The mantra, here too, is to look at the long-term.   In 2000, ITC launched its most awarded initiative, the e-choupal. Always dreaming big, Deveshwar wanted to do a Walmart with e-choupals, leveraging the internet to empower small and marginal farmers by linking them directly with buyers. Though constrained by regulations, it has worked wonders for the foods business, which is ITC’s biggest success in the non-cigarettes FMCG segment. In foods, ITC is at number three with revenues of Rs 7,100 crore, but in the next couple of years, it’s eyeing the top slot.   But that’s part of a bigger target to grow the non-cigarettes FMCG business to Rs 100,000 crore by 2030. The basket of non-cigarettes FMCG products is therefore constantly expanding. The latest entrants are Sunfresh (dairy whitener) and, at the premium end, Fabelle (chocolates) and Sunbean (coffee). But Fabelle made many rounds to the ITC board before it was finally approved — the idea again was to come up with a world-class product.   The goalposts have, therefore, been moved by Deveshwar for his successor Sanjiv Puri. The aim now is to make ITC a multinational corporation.   As Deveshwar said at the last AGM as CEO, “If we can build Indian companies to be globally competitive, nothing like it. Indian companies can become multinational companies (MNCs). That is our aspiration, making ITC one such MNC.” While Puri will be the person to make it happen, Deveshwar, ITC’s longest-serving chairman, will continue to be the guiding force.

Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Related Stories Ontario man wanted in stepson’s death arrested in Walmart parking lot, police say Ontario man sought in murder of stepson St. Catharines reeling as manhunt for stepdad heats up Ontario man accused of killing stepson nabbed A slate grey sky hinted darkly that the heavens were on the verge of weeping. And those tears were reserved for Nathan Dumas as hundreds of friends and family gathered in Fonthill to say goodbye Friday. His mom called him a “true superhero” who only wanted to help others. The seven-year-old was critically injured last Friday — allegedly by his stepfather — and died the next morning. “It goes to show you what a beautiful boy he was that so many people came together to celebrate his life,” his heartbroken mom Whitney Dumas said. “If you knew him it was easy to say he was an old soul and a purist, always helping others in a time of need, no matter what the consequences or repercussions or how mad his mom was. He never thought twice about standing up for what he thought was right.” The service — at the Pleasantview Funeral Home — featured a video montage. Snippets of a lovely life, of Nathan playing with his brother and sister, learning archery with his grandfather and improvising a song while washing the dishes for his mother. Dumas said that Nathan — a Grade 2 student at Harriet Tubman Public School in St. Catharines — was a “true empathist.” “He always knew when someone was sad or needed help. He would be the first one to the rescue. As his friends have said many times, he was a true superhero,” she said. It was his mother who found him minutes after his step-father, Justin Kuijer, left the home with Dumas’ van, saying he going to get a cup of coffee. Dumas had recently broken-up with Kuijer because of his escalating depression. Cops say after Kuijer fled, a man walked into an RBC, stabbed a female employee and drove off in a grey van. What followed was a five-day manhunt that ended in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Kenora after a citizen tipped off cops. He is charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder. The former roofer appeared in St. Catharines court Thursday. Kuijer remains in custody and his next appearance is scheduled for April 19.  Sad goodbye for little Nathan Dumas  Postmedia First posted: Friday, March 24, 2017 07:08 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, March 24, 2017 07:26 PM EDT A slate grey sky hinted darkly that the heavens were on the verge of weeping.
