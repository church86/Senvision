The Google Home assistant will be available starting November 4, this is when Google will ship the pre-ordered units, and this is when retailers should stock them and sell them online. Android Police reports that one of its readers actually saw the Google Home available for sale at their local Walmart. According to that reader, a Walmart employee would not sell him the Google Home device, likely when they tried to scan it at a register. Huge retailers like Walmart and Best Buy usually receive items before they are released, likely with specific instructions as to when they are to be available for sale. But it appears that whoever stocked, tagged, and priced the Google Home units on the shelf was not aware of an actual release date. Google Home is the companys first home-assistant device which will let you control Philips hue, activate IFFTT recipes, play music from Google Play or Spotify, as well as answer questions with the Google search engine at its disposal. Youll also be able to control your Chromecast and ask it to play videos from YouTube, or TV shows and movies from Netflix.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart has removed books featuring photos of child nudity from its website. The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were not sold in Walmart stores but were available at Walmart.com. Last week, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization, launched a petition to remove those and other books and magazines the group says are offensive. “The books were in violation of our prohibited items policy and were removed as soon as they were brought to our attention,’’ Walmart said in a statement Monday. “We’re refining our policies and filters to better flag and block these types of items in the future.” Sturges has produced books featuring art photos of nude adolescents for decades. In 1990, The New York Times reported, the FBI raided his studio and confiscated his cameras, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He continued to work. A variety of his art books are on sale on Amazon's website. Dawn Hawkins, NCOSE’s executive director, applauded the change. “This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation,’’ she said in a statement. The group says it is also seeking an end to the retailer selling Cosmopolitan magazine, which is says features sexually suggestive content that can be easily viewed by children shopping with their parents, and primers for the sex trafficking of women that NCOSE says are still sold online. "We are continuing communications with Walmart executives,'' Hawkins says, "and we hope Walmart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials," . 301 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f6n4KX

Many residents are excited for the retail option, and the more than 200 jobs the store will create, while others remain fearful the store will hurt small businesses and offer only low-wages to its workers. Just another chapter for this region, that's how one local historian and journalist summed up the opening of Walmart's new super store in Derby. Development, he says, that started with the Interstate coming through. "Since then there has been a steady flow of businesses setting up here -- and this is just another chapter -- and now the Derby Road, for good or bad, is the commercial center for Orleans County," said Scott Wheeler with Northland Journal. He says there are still people who worry about the box store's impact on local down town stores. "A lot of people look at downtown Newport and wonder what's going to happen to Newport with Walmart," Wheeler said. One person who is convinced Walmart will be good for downtown Newport, is Newport Mayor Paul Monette. He is the new wireless manager at Walmart. "I think it is going to help downtown Newport in reality. I have looked at Littleton and also St. Albans, and I have seen how their downtowns have really thrived after Walmart," Monette said. Monette says he was laid off from his teaching job, so he -- like over 200 other people -- applied at the big box store. "We have hired a little over 250 now -- going for 350. We have had a really big turnout as far as applications, so it has made the hiring process fairly easy," said Tony Lane, a Walmart Manager. Stocking is now underway at the 176-thousand square-foot store. Hundreds of thousands of boxes are being unpacked around the clock, and stacked on shelves until the store opens for one stop shopping. "I think it will be good to just go to one store and get everything you need, and my daughter is working there," said Denise Gandreau, a nearby resident of Beebee Plain. Walmart officials say they have hired 11 assistant managers and two co-managers -- those are salaried positions. Everyone else will be paid by the hour starting at minimum wage -- $9.60. A grand opening is scheduled for November 16th.  Doors open at 7a.m. Related Stories: Wal-Mart groundbreaking marks major milestone in Derby Derby Wal-Mart project receives Act 250 approval Developer files Wal-Mart application in Derby Plans for Derby Walmart move forward Derby Walmart gets greenlight Local NewsMore>> 2 St. Albans teens accused of leading police on chase 2 St. Albans teens accused of leading police on chase Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 8:06 PM EST2016-11-15 01:06:47 GMT Two St. Albans teenagers are accused of leading police on a high speed chase.

(NYSE: WMT) came under fire recently from an anti-pornography group for selling photo books the group says depict nude children and contain other exploitative materials. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) sent a letter to Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon last week expressing its “grave concern” about the company’s distribution and sales of this material both in the company’s stores and at the walmart.com website. In a press release Monday, NCOSE said that Wal-Mart has stopped selling photography books by Jock Sturges that feature nude children. NCOSE is an organization founded in 1962 as Morality In Media. The group changed its name in February 2015 “to better describe the organization’s scope and mission, which is to expose the seamless connection between all forms of sexual exploitation.” Dawn Hawkins, executive director of NCOSE, said Monday: Walmart.com is no longer selling Jock Sturges’ photography books featuring eroticized child nudity. This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation. Our petition campaign asking Walmart to remove these Sturges’ books, in addition to explicit magazines like Cosmopolitan and books like Pimpology that give instructions for sex trafficking women, received thousands of signatures within the first 24 hours. We are continuing communications with Wal-Mart executives, and we hope Wal-Mart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials. In its letter to McMillon, NCOSE called on Wal-Mart to remove Cosmopolitan magazine from its worldwide distribution and website along with books by photography books by Jock Sturges which the group said shows “naked young girls, boys, and adolescents with frequent exhibition of pubic regions.. NCOSE also requested a “complete review and removal from Walmart.com of any other sexually explicit and objectifying material.” The group extracted a pledge from Wal-Mart last year to ensure that Cosmopolitan magazine would be covered by blinders to prevent viewing by children. To date, NCOSE says, it continues to receive complaints that the magazine remains for sale at Wal-Mart checkout lanes.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 31, 2016 at 4:05PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are two of the world's leading discount retailers with remarkably different strategies regarding human resources. Wal-Mart has always been harshly criticized for paying insufficient wages, while Costco rewards employees with above-average pay and superior benefits. But Wal-Mart is borrowing a page from Costco's playbook, offering higher salaries and better working conditions. And that new approach is generating benefits for the company in terms of sales growth. Judging by recent financial reports from Wal-Mart, it looks as if what's good for employees can also be good for customers and investors. Wal-Mart is going the Costco way, but only partially Wal-Mart launched a series of bold initiatives in February 2015. Among other things, the company raised its minimum wage to $10, and wages for department managers increased from $12 to $15 an hour. According to an article in The New York Times, Wal-Mart has raised its average pay for full-time nonmanagerial employees to an average of $13.69 an hour, a 16% increase since early 2014. It's not just about wages, as the company is also offering improved opportunities for education and professional development. Wal-Mart has developed an onboarding and training program offering potential career paths for employees who are looking to move beyond entry-level positions. Associates in these programs receive hands-on training in areas such as merchandising, retail fundamentals, teamwork, and people skills. Those who successfully complete these programs get to climb the corporate ladder toward jobs with higher responsibility and better pay. Wal-Mart is also offering better conditions for associates in areas such as work schedule and benefits. The company is allowing employees to choose between more predictable or more flexible time schedules, according to their own needs, providing more control and ownership over their work and personal time. In addition, Wal-Mart is improving benefits related to healthcare, sick leave, and education. Chances are that Wal-Mart will never completely close the gap versus Costco when it comes to wages in particular and human resources policies in general. It's worth noting that Costco raised its minimum wage by $1.50 an hour, from $11.50 and $12 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour, this past March. That was the first minimum-wage increase from Costco since 2007, and the decision probably reflects the fact that other companies in the industry started raising wages, so Costco needs to do the same to stay ahead of the competition. Costco has a unique corporate culture in the retail industry, and its business model is quite particular. Since Costco operates completely under the warehouse retail model, the company makes more revenue per employee than other industry players, so Costco can naturally afford higher wages than Wal-Mart. Nevertheless, the fact remains that Wal-Mart has changed its strategy. As opposed to trying to increase profit margins by paying the lowest possible wages it can get away with, the company is offering better working conditions to improve customer service and keep operations running smoothly. This new approach to human resources is generating promising results. The move is paying off  During fiscal 2014, Wal-Mart suffered from declining comparable-store sales and negative traffic figures in the U.S. in every quarter. But things started to improve in fiscal 2015, and the recovery is quite noticeable nowadays. Comparable-store sales at Wal-Mart U.S. grew 1.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. The company has produced positive comparable sales in the U.S. over the past eight quarters, while traffic has remained in positive territory over the past seven quarters in a row. According to CEO Doug McMillon, one of the main reasons sales and traffic are moving in the right direction is that the customer experience is improving, which is clearly related to having a friendlier and more motivated workforce. In McMillon's words: "We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout, and friendlier service." Wal-Mart is facing increasing costs, not only because of higher investments in employees, but also because the company is aggressively expanding its online retail capabilities. These initiatives are putting downward pressure on profit margins, but management is doing the right thing by prioritizing revenue growth and competitive positioning above short-term profit margins.  Employees aren't just an expense item on the income statement; they're one of the most important resources a business can have. As it turns out, investing in wages and other benefits can many times generate attractive returns for shareholders. Andrés Cardenal has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home spotted in a Walmart store before market release By R Padla - October 31, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Your home is about to get smarter and more “wired” as Google Home is now available from Walmart. Well, it’s not yet official but the device has been sighted on the retail store even before the commercial launch. We’re guessing some employee made an honest mistake of putting the units on the shelves. That’s interesting since a Xiaomi Mi box was only spotted in a Walmart branch ahead of official market availability. Official release of the Google Home is November 4. Walmart already has the product so we know the scheduled release will be followed. Thing is, Walmart went ahead. Interestingly, the product isn’t available for sale yet when the source of this story tried to buy one. Google Home costs $129. We know Google is slowly moving the Google Cast system to Google Home. We also know it can be integrated with Spotify and other similar apps. Google Home with the Google Assistant directly rivals Amazon Echo and Alexa. Alexa may be more popular these days, being integrated with several products and services left and right, but the Google Assistant is more widely used. There’s also the fact that it’s from Google so the search function will be relevant and accurate. Google Home is also expected to be integrated with other services and products especially that it’s finally integrated with IFTTT and a channel is now open.

Posted on October 31, 2016 By Dana Williamson BURNS FLAT—WANTED: Missionary. Must be friendly with outgoing personality. Must love people, know the Bible and yearn to share the love of Jesus with others, praying for them and inviting them to church. Apply at Walmart. While it is unlikely that Walmart or any retailer would pay for an ad like this. If they did, Hazel Fleming would fit the bill perfectly. A member of Burns Flat, First for nearly 30 years, Fleming spends a part of most days at the Walmart in Elk City, just a few miles down the road from her home church. “Because she’s done such a great job witnessing to folks there, we’re going to commission her as our ‘Walmart missionary,’” said Carl Thionnet, interim pastor. Carl Thionnet, director of missions for Concor-Kiowa Association, and interim pastor at Burns Flat, First, stands in front of the church building where he was baptized as an 8-year-old. The original structure was maintained as the church built on to it with a new worship center and educational space Thionnet, director of missions for Concord-Kiowa Association, has been interim pastor at Burns Flat, First since the first Sunday in July. During that time, Sunday School attendance has grown from about 30 to more than 70, and the church has baptized nine people, with Sept. 11 designated as “Baptism Day.” One of those baptized was a lady Fleming met at Walmart and invited to have coffee. Fleming asked her several questions, including if she liked Sunday School and if she was saved. Her answer to the latter question was “I try to be.” Fleming encouraged the woman, who was a Jehovah’s Witness, to attend Sunday School, which she did for a few weeks before coming to a Wednesday night service. After that service, Thionnet talked with her, and she accepted Jesus as her Savior. Some of the others baptized were preteen prospects who had made professions of faith at camp and Vacation Bible School, but who had never had any follow-up. “Our members started making follow-up visits and found several who wanted to be baptized,” said Thionnet. He said the mother of one of the boys who was baptized had just died, and he was crushed because she wouldn’t be able to see him baptized. “Church members stepped in and helped the family anyway we could, and since they didn’t have any place to hold the funeral, we had the services here at the church.” Fleming, who is the church’s pianist, said she started going to Walmart after her husband died, because “that’s where the people are.” “I would go drink coffee there and get involved with people,” she explained. “Everyone has a story, and God showed me how to pray for people in the check-out line. Everybody needs encouragement and a smile.” Fleming said she is especially drawn to women with broken hearts, those who have known tragedy.  One of the people she has been ministering to is a woman who works in the meat department and has cancer. Her grandson was recently baptized in the church as a result of Fleming’s witness. Occasionally the tables are turned on Fleming, and she is the one ministered to. She was recently on crutches, and a man in the congregation noticed her using her crutches to get to the piano. “Someone began taking out my trash, and I thought it was our pastor at the time,” Fleming recalled. “Then one day, while I was in line at Walmart, this man said to me, “I’m your mystery man.” “That turned heads in this small town,” laughed Fleming. “I didn’t know the man, but later learned he attended our church. He is a one-armed, born-again Catholic, and was helping me because I was on crutches.” Thionnet said since he has been interim, the church has been through the Connect>1 Evangelism Campaign’s 3151 Challenge, and he preaches a lot about reaching people. Thionnet has a special place in his heart for the Burns Flat church because that is where he was saved as an 8-year-old boy. He grew up in Burns Flat and attended school there. “There are enough people in Burns Flat to make a difference,” he said. “The success we’ve had over the last few months is because everybody is working together.” He said they are in the talking stages of starting a new Sunday School class for young adults, as a result of four young couples who have started attending. “I’m having fun, and it’s exciting to see people taking hold of what we are trying to do,” Thionnet said. Fleming gives credit to Thionnet for encouraging members to be involved with people. “He might be out driving around and stop and talk to someone and pray with them,” she noted. “Brother Carl is approachable. He listens to people, and they are comfortable with him.” The two seem to have a mutual admiration for each other. “Much of what has happened over the last few months is because God has gifted Hazel with a desire to talk to people and tell them about Jesus,” Thionnet said.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 12:00PM In this segment from the Market Foolery podcast, Mark Reeth and Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser consider the ongoing expansion at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company is boosting its busy season staff expansion by 20% at a time when brick-and-mortar rivals are either holding their headcounts steady or shrinking them entirely -- a clear demonstration of how well Amazon continues to disrupt the traditional retail world.   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 13, 2016 Mark Reeth: Let's move on to Amazon. Amazon made headlines today. As the holiday season approaches, a lot of retailers out there will hire seasonal workers. Amazon has announced it's going to add 120,000 seasonal positions this year. That's up from 100,000 last year. That growth rate speaks volumes, I think, to how Amazon has been successful about upsetting status quo with those old school retailers. For instance, you look at Target and Macy's, Target is going to hire 70,000 additional workers in its stores. That's the same as last year. Macy's is going to hire 83,000, that's down from 85,000 last year. Amazon increased its number by 20%. Again, it boggles the mind to think about how much Amazon has disrupted retail, but then you see numbers like this and suddenly it makes a lot of sense. Suddenly, it's all clear. Jason Moser: You know, a little bit more than a year ago, we were talking about the fact that Amazon had surpassed Wal-Mart in market cap. Amazon had become a bigger company by market capitalization than Wal-Mart, which was interesting from a number of different perspectives. One I kind of couldn't get over was the fact that Wal-Mart still does about four times the revenue that Amazon does today. Now, that gap is closing very quickly, but when we were talking about that 14, 15 months ago, all of a sudden Amazon has almost doubled the market cap of Wal-Mart. This is a very good example of that the market is a forward-looking mechanism that we always talk about. The market doesn't care as much about what you've done as it does about what you tell us you're going to do. When we look at Amazon, for example, we know that every holiday season, Jeff Bezos sees that as nothing but pure opportunity. The estimates for Amazon's revenue for this coming holiday are close to $45 billion in sales. Now, that's about 25% up from last year's numbers. That's right in line with when you're growing your sales at that rapid of a clip, particularly considering what Amazon does, you need to have the staff there to be able to fill that void, packing boxes, shipping stuff out, and all of that. I think the benefit that Amazon has here is they've always been very clear from the beginning that they want to be the world's most customer-centric company. That seems like an easy thing to say, but as you know, as I know, I think probably anyone out there that has ever worked in customer service in any capacity, customer service is really hard. I mean, it's really hard because you're working with a unique individual every single time. Their situation is unique to them and you want to try to make it the best experience possible for them. Now Amazon is focused on doing this on grand scale. Now, they know that customers really care about a couple of things: low prices and getting that stuff shipped to them as quickly as possibly. Lucky enough for Amazon, they do both of those things really, really well. That's why they staff up so heavily during the holiday season is because you're going to see I think over the course of the next 10 to 20 years, really ... Again, e-commerce is so young even though it's what we're used to, you think about it, my kids, for example, 10 and 11 years old now, they've never really known a world without e-commerce. I think that ... I like to look at their behavior in a lot of cases and try to sort of see how the investing world may look over the course of the next 10, 20 years and every time I look at them and their behavior, it just screams "buy Amazon, buy Amazon" because they've got a piece of everything, whether it's e-commerce, entertainment, music, cloud computing, and it just keeps on growing. Now, we see they're talking about establishing a little bit more of a physical infrastructure, possible bookstores, and/or convenience stores. It just goes on and on. We go back to talking about how important culture is and leadership and Amazon's success is certainly because of the people that work there, but Jeff Bezos is the man that really has executed on this vision and I think as long as he's around, you've got to really feel pretty good about Amazon's chances.

The price is correctly listed at $129 and it shows up in store, at least at the one location where we have a picture, nera other smart home products such as the Nest smart thermostat and products from Ecobee. While I’m sure many of you are about ready to take a trip to your local Walmart location, you may want to hold off. Apparently, Walmart employees are not allowed to sell Google Home to customers until November 4. I wouldn’t get my hopes up that employees can sell it to you “by mistake” either. Walmart likely has a block in the point-of-sale system for selling Google Home units until Friday. At the very least, this early stock of the Home in stores should help many with deciding on whether to order online and likely wait a few days to get their orders or just buy in store.

In the U.S., Feeding America estimates that 70 billions pounds of food is wasted annually—up to 40 percent of all food that's grown and transported throughout the country. Walmart, one of the world’s biggest grocery suppliers (it’s number one in the U.S.), acknowledged a need to combat the problem and started selling ugly fruits and vegetables—produce with surface defects that is still edible— at select stores in July. But the company reportedly has a long way to go to achieve a more sustainable anti-food waste operation.  CBC recently conducted investigations at two Walmart locations in Toronto, Canada and over the course of 12 visits found that employees tossed heaps of produce, baked items, frozen foods, unexpired meat and dairy and even unopened water bottles. According to the report, most of the food was still in its packaging, meaning the food couldn’t be composted and other components couldn’t be recycled. Several current and former Walmart employees confirmed the practice to CBC.  When asked about the trashed food, Walmart spokesman Alex Roberton told CBC that the company needed to do something to fix the problem. "For sure, there are mistakes being made and one thing we need to do is tighten up the execution of our in-store processes for the food that is going into the bins," said Roberton. "We need to be more certain that that is food that needs to be thrown out." RELATED: Texas Walmart serves up extreme deep-fried State Fair foods Roberton said that the company hopes to eliminate all food waste that’s winding up in landfills but right now, some food items are donated to local shelters or food banks --but would not specify how much. The company is also planning a "customer value program" to reduce prices on certain fresh items that are approaching their best-before dates.  Regarding the tossed food, however, Walmart first told CBC that the food was likely unsafe for consumption for a variety of reasons. If a refrigerated item is left out for even a short period of time, it has to be tossed for safety reasons. Still, Roberton acknowledged that doesn’t solve the haphazard disposal of perishables and packaging materials.  "If we're putting food that's good to eat in the wrong bin, then that's a mistake we need to correct," says Roberton. "And that's one of the areas that we need to focus on improving. Walmart has 407 locations across Canada and is one of the nation’s top five biggest grocery stores.

Traffic fatalities are up across the country, rising 7.2 percent from 2014 to 2015 – the largest single-year increase in 50 years. There are certain areas that are more dangerous than others, as AxleGeek found when they analyzed data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The analysis looked at cities throughout the U.S. with the most car fatalities per 100,000 people. Birmingham landed at number four on the list. Alabama's largest city had 19.3 auto fatalities per 100,000 residents in 2015. More than 12 percent of the total fatalities related to alcohol. Birmingham wasn't the only Alabama city on the list. Montgomery came in at number 34 with 12.5 traffic fatalities per 100,000 residents. Thirty-two percent of the city's total auto fatalities were related to alcohol. While Alabama had two cities make the list, Florida had a whopping five in the top 10 alone. Pompano Beach, Florida came in at number one, followed by Miami Gardens, Davie, Tampa and Lakeland. Eight other Florida cities - Fort Lauderdale, Miami, West Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Clearwater, Orlando, St. Petersburg, Palm Bay – were in the top 50 spots for fatal accidents. Welcome to Monday's Wake Up Call. Let's see what's going on: Walmart under fire for selling 'pornography' The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is hitting back at the nation's largest retailer for selling what it calls pornography. In a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, NCOSE said thequestionable material is available both in stores and via its website. Among the items noted in the letter are photography books by Jock Sturges, and books such as "Pimpology" and "The Pimp's Bible." NCOSE previously asked Walmart to cover up "Cosmopolitan" magazine in checkout lanes due to its content. Now, it's asking that the magazine be removed from Walmart stores and website. Powder sprinkled in orchestra pit halts opera A Dallas man brought a performance by New York's Metropolitan Opera to a halt after he sprinkled a white powder into the orchestra pit. The "powder" turned out to be the ashes of friend the man described as his "mentor." Roger Kaiser, 52, said he sprinkled the ashes at the opera house in recognition of his friend's love of music. His actions, however, led to the show bring cancelled and a response from the NYPD counter-terrorism squad, who tested the powdery substance. Police said Kaiser may not face any charges if the substance proved to be what he said it was. Manure dumped at Ohio Democratic office Law enforcement officials are trying to determine who dumped a large truckload of manure outside the headquarters of the Warren County, Ohio Democratic Party. The pile was first discovered early Saturday morning. The incident was caught on surveillance video but no arrests have been made. The pile was about 15 to 20 feet wide and 3 feet high. A similar manure dump occurred at the same office in 2012. Warren County is an overwhelmingly Republican area, with nearly 69 percent of its residents supporting GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Melania Trump to deliver campaign speech Melania Trump, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, will deliver her first campaign speech on Thursday. Melania Trump will be in Pennsylvania for a rally, the campaign announced. It's her first appearance on the campaign trail in months, after taking time off following her address at the Republican National Convention, when she was accused of plagiarizing part of a speech by First Lady Michelle Obama.

Online shopping continues to cut into sales of brick-and-mortar retailers on this list. Indicative of this is the fact that this year’s largest hirer of seasonal workers will likely not be Wal-Mart but Amazon, which is set to hire 120,000 seasonal workers — double Wal-Mart’s holiday hires last year. Most of these seasonal workers will be let go when the shopping season ends. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 13 companies hiring the most employees this holiday shopping season. Americans have historically done much of their holiday shopping at department stores such as Macy’s and Wal-mart. In recent years, however, online retailers such as Amazon have become a popular alternative. According to a study published this year by consulting firm Deloitte, 47% of consumers plan to spend as much online as they will in stores. Click here to see the retailers hiring the most for the holidays.  The increasing popularity of online shopping is apparent during the holidays, by far the busiest shopping period of the year. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, kicks off the holiday shopping season with the biggest single day for retailers. However, some have been staying at home, waiting for online deals the following Monday, or Cyber Monday, as it is now called. To cover the expected additional sales, Amazon plans to hire 20,000 more seasonal workers than it did last year. The growing popularity of online shopping is also largely responsible for the increased seasonal hiring at shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS. According to John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, “The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online.” With the continued success of e-commerce, brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling. Macy’s profits declined by 30% last year, and J.C. Penney has reported a net loss in each of the past three years, shaking shareholder confidence. Macy’s stock is currently trading at less than half its 10-year high, and J.C. Penney stock has lost nearly 90% of its value over the last decade. To identify the retailers adding the most seasonal jobs for the 2016 holiday, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the announced holiday hires of top retailers based on revenue in the Retail 100. Because their businesses are so closely related to retail, we also examined seasonal job additions at FedEx and UPS. Financial data were obtained from financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when available. Store counts are all customer-facing U.S. locations operated by the company. Editor’s note: In an earlier version of this piece, it was implied that Wal-Mart had begun to hire new workers to fill positions as “holiday helpers.” Rather, the company is reassigning other current staff to fill these positions. These are the retailers hiring the most this holiday season.

By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch October 31, 2016, 5:15 AM Holiday helpers and “theater”: Retailers go big this season Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email A battle is raging for consumers’ wallets this holiday season, and it’s going to involve glamour, red curtains, selfie booths and price wars. Brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are doubling down on their preparations for the season, rushing to snap up temporary workers to make shoppers’ sugarplum dreams come true. With consumers coming off their first year of household income gains since 2007, retailers are counting on them to boost their holiday spending by anywhere from about 4 percent to10 percent this year. That could lift the season’s sales to their highest level since the recession. At the same time, consumers are increasingly shopping online, taking advantage of free shipping offers and price discounts from Amazon (AMZN) and the like. That’s raising the stakes for big retailers to create unusual experiences inside their stores as a way to lure consumers away from their computers and smartphones.  Play Video CBS This Morning How rise in online shopping and returns is hurting retailers The New Year could bring uncertainty to the nation’s retailers. Holiday sales at brick-and-mortar stores grew, but less than expected last year, ... Walmart stores will have “holiday helpers,” or workers parked near the checkout lines who can fetch forgotten items, and selfie booths, while Target plans “elements of theater” in its stores, as well extra staff and a special area for holiday trimmings. “What we see the leading retailers doing is creating emotional experiences in their stores,” said Steven Barr, PwC’s U.S. retail and consumer leader, earlier this month. “I like to say that a website can’t give you goosebumps.” Barr said stores have realized that shoppers respond to experiences, such as in-store beauty bars where friends can visit together while shopping, or product demonstrations. That’s clearly a lesson that Walmart and Target have absorbed and will trot out this holiday season. “In all of our stores from Nov. 5 through Dec. 17 (excluding Nov. 26), we’ll offer demos of the latest top toys so parents can try before they buy and see what’s most exciting to their kids,” said Target spokeswoman Erin Conroy. “Guests will see elements of theater -- like spotlights and red stage curtains -- and the word ‘spectacular’ woven throughout the store.” Target is pinning some of its holiday hopes on a store-within-a-store concept called Wondershop. which will feature roughly 2,000 new products with a focus on “holiday trim.” (Think wrapping paper and ribbon.) It has also invested in remodeling 82 stores where it sees the most demand for order pickup, a service that lets consumers pick up an item in the store after ordering it online. Of course, there’s also the battle over prices. Starting in mid-November, Target will offer $10 off a $50 purchase in departments that will rotate each week, such as grocery or home. Walmart, which has been rebuilding its image under CEO Doug McMillan, says it’s also offering competitive deals. Addressing a recent complaint of poor service, the company said it’s deploying an “army of holiday helpers” who will assist shoppers while they’re in the checkout line. It’s also hiring Santas to make 23,000 appearances during the holiday shopping season.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Wal-Mart, Target each take cue from the other for holidays 10/31/2016 - 2:00 AM EDT NEW YORK >> Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season. After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise.

MICHELLE SINGLETARY: Still suffering torment over your financial security? Let it go. BUSINESS IN BRIEF: Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Fox & Roach, Realtors/Trident gives back Chester County Chamber recognizes Vanguard's top execs Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." ON SERVICE: Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. ON PRICE: Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. 1 2 next  last »

Police say the incident happened around 10 p.m. at the Walmart at 14000 Worth Avenue. The video shows two men picking up the victim, possibly a younger African-American man, and shoving him into the trunk of a car right outside of the store. Once the victim is locked in the trunk, the suspects get inside of the car and drive away. According to police, additional surveillance video shows the suspect vehicle driving next to the victim before the incident and that the victim seemed to be talking with the suspect driving the car. Witnesses told police that the victim and suspects might have been “play fighting” before the victim was forced into the truck. Detectives are asking witnesses with any information about the incident to call police at 703-792-6500. 38.648596 -77.297226 Filed in: News Topics: abduction Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email The News 3 App Center Get the latest news and live radar on your phone!

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Roman Catholic lay organisations have called out two major American retailers for selling costumes for this year's Halloween that are supposedly offensive to priests and nuns. According to a report from Life Site News, the Catholic group called American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) recently issued a statement calling as "immoral" and "horrible" two Halloween costumes being sold on the websites of Amazon and Walmart. The two costumes being questioned depict a sexually excited priest and a pregnant nun. American TFP Vice President John Horvat said these costumes are "obscene" and "sickening." "Amazon and Walmart are selling Halloween costume sets that are directly targeted to offend Christians and mock religion," Horvat told Life Site News. The American TFP has also launched an online petition to condemn Amazon and Walmart's marketing of these offensive costumes, and calling these major retailers to pull out these products from the market. In the online petition, which has so far garnered about 17,000 signatures, the Catholic group noted how these two mega retailers have removed some products in their line — including those that offend Muslims, homosexuals and transgenders — because of public outcry. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights meanwhile called on Amazon and Walmart to treat the clergy with the same respect and consideration as it extends to other groups. Catholic League president Bill Donohue expressed concern on how the two retailers seem to have "no problem" offending Church workers. "There are no excuses for what Amazon is doing, but Walmart is worse," Donohue said. "It likes to tout itself as a "Christian-friendly" store, yet when it comes to Catholics, it drops its guard.

The decline of my part of Ohio shows why ‘Some people here would vote for a Disney villain if they ran on the Republican ticket.’ A campaign sign in East Liverpool, Ohio, October 2016.

Some of them are my neighbours. I live in Meigs County, Ohio, which will probably vote for Trump if history is any indication. Its population, of 23,500 or so, has a per capita income of around $18,000, and 20% of my neighbours live below the poverty line. It’s one of those places where the coal dried up a few decades ago. And, however depressing it sounds, it’s better than it was. Inside a Donald Trump rally: good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate Read more The house my children will grow up in was built in 1900 by their paternal great-great-grandfather. It’s belonged to the family ever since, each generation building on as needed from its original single room. There are a few houses like that in the family, and we moved into this one mostly because we wanted our kids to grow up as he had, running barefoot through the woods and catching tadpoles in the stream behind the house. Meigs is still an old, old place like that. It’s not uncommon for friends our age to live in houses recently made available by a family death. We buy groceries from a general store, but it’s miles to the nearest gas station or supermarket. Some people here would vote for a Disney villain if they ran on the Republican ticket – party affiliation is an inherited trait in many families – some just like Trump. He “says what he’s thinking”, his supporters say, which baffles many observers, given what the man says, but makes perfect sense if you realise that most of my neighbours don’t pay nearly as much attention to politics as I, who’s writing this and you, who are reading it. Many people are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff they’ve heard about him but accept it as a necessary evil: the main thing is to tell Washington elites that they’re not safe in their sinecures any more, that the common man is about to have his day. It’s all gone too far off the rails. Pomeroy, the county seat, lies just over the river from Mason, West Virginia. Walmart tried to come to Pomeroy but the council voted against it because they didn’t want to lose the small businesses lining the main street. The company went to Mason instead and pointedly positioned its store at the end of the bridge; Pomeroy’s intentionally quaint riverfront downtown now features a rundown laundromat, some bars, a liquor store, empty storefronts and a few improbably expensive shops. All the tax revenue from the Walmart goes to Mason. People talk about economic insecurity and usually they’re imagining some angry white man upset that someone somewhere (probably a minority, and a woman to boot) is getting more help than him. But I picture that Walmart, where it didn’t really matter what the people wanted. They made their stand; they got run over anyway. That’s a fair description of life in a place like this one. People who admire Trump for his business acumen are simply pointing out that no matter the ambiguity about his balance sheets this is a man who flies around on a gold-plated jet, which to someone making a few hundred dollars a week seems like unimaginable wealth. Our society values a human based on their material worth; why then are we surprised when many people define “winning” and “valuable” and “admirable” accordingly? Trump is a Rorschach test of America’s fears. To the ageing population here, his slogan about making America great again brings memories of last century, when the downtown bustled and anyone could make a solid living, assuming they weren’t too lazy to present themselves at the mine. It wasn’t ever an easy life, but it wasn’t ever this hard either. It’s difficult to remember, given everything that has happened since, but Trump exploded on to the stage with the first primary debate by telling us that the political system really is as rigged as we’d feared: that politics is about who you can buy and sell, whose influence you can tap. We have all known it; Trump said it. And that’s where he built his base. It’s been three years since I wrote a post online about America’s poverty trap that went viral and led to a book deal. I now have the luxury of paying attention to the world around me. But when I look at my hands I see the scars from knives and slicers and hot grease, and I remember the rage that I could not name after a decade and a half of low wages and no hope, because we all say that we live in a meritocracy and we all know it’s bullshit, but it keeps people sinking regardless. It was bound to happen that a candidate running on fear would take us this far into the realm of the unacceptable An unfortunate fact of capitalism, or at least the kind we practice in the western world, is that we below are turned against each other. There is political value in racial strife. As long as we can teach white people to hate nonwhite people, then we don’t have to worry about poor people realising they outnumber the rich ones. Racists came to love Trump because he speaks openly of the racial strife that politicians have been exploiting and stoking for decades to great electoral effect. That’s what people mean when they complain about political correctness, after all. You’re supposed to hate and fear a bunch of people but not talk about it, which is nonsensical except in the lens of politics, where perception matters far more than substance. Facebook Twitter Pinterest What a Donald Trump campaign rally reveals about America Trump can behave as badly as he wants. It’s no worse than people expect from the power elite. America, as seen from Meigs County, is a place where bankers can unfairly foreclose on your house and then get paid by Washington for doing it – and then Washington will demand you sign the bill. His business shenanigans don’t register as shocking because it’s assumed that to get even close to that level you’ve already sold your soul; that’s just how it works. None of the bankers went to jail, and now the banks pay Hillary Clinton the equivalent of 37 years of the median wage in this county per speech to lecture for them. The year 2016 will be political shorthand, in the way you can say “2008” and people think of Lehman and Bear and bailouts. There will be Before, and After. This year is forcing us to grapple with a lot of realities we’d been conscientiously avoiding. Trump will still walk away from this thing a winner by his lights if Clinton wins – not leader of anything, with a reputation left in pitiful dirty tatters, but as head demagogue. He’ll have millions of adoring fans and a revenue stream. He will avoid responsibility for what is to come. Pain and rage and fear and hate are all closely connected; unleashing them all in an unexamined pulsating mass of conspiracy-laden megalomania was ill-advised at best. We have already seen violence, and we will see more. It was bound to happen eventually that a candidate running on fear and division would take us this far into the realms of the unacceptable. We can’t stop it now. The only thing we can do – the thing we must do, if we are to save ourselves – is begin to understand that if the system is broken, it’s broken for enough of us that we can together insist on changes that suit the populace, instead of merely those candidates and donors who can afford to buy all the rivals they see on a primary stage. Few people think Trump will fix anything but a lot are willing to vote for him. Because whatever you think of him, he’s not a vote for the status quo.

Provided Nikki Schreiber-Settles, left, and her mother Barbara Schreiber are the new owners of the historic Yellow Dog Cafe and Bar in Worden. Provided 1 of 2 i By Tobias Wall twall@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story An east coast-style soft pretzel joint wants to set up shop in Belleville. Philly Pretzel Factory plans to serve oven-fresh pretzels out of the Walmart at Green Mount Commons. Chief Development Officer Tom Monaghan said the company likes the prospect of being close to Southwestern Illinois College and within a shopping center. “The pretzels are great for students on-the-go while grocery shopping or headed to class,” Monaghan wrote in an email. “We’re excited to continue adding locations across Illinois, and we have seen great success in our Walmart stores. Belleville is a natural next step for our development process.” The Philadelphia-based chain currently operates around 150 franchised locations, mostly in Philadelphia and up and down the Atlantic coast but also as far inland as Indianapolis, Ind. and Copperas Cove, Texas. It’s not clear yet when the Factory could open. Monaghan wrote that the company is “actively seeking local franchise partners who are ingrained in the community.” Prime Shiloh ground changes hands The wheels are in motion for commercial development at the Three Springs at Shiloh after years of the 133-acre property sitting idle. Dierbergs Markets Inc. recently purchased the Three Springs at Shiloh development site, according to paperwork filed with the village of Shiloh. The purchase price has not been disclosed. The Shiloh Committee at Large unanimously approved Dierbergs’ request for an ordinance draft and setting of a public hearing during its meeting Oct. 24. The village board will vote on the measure Nov. 7. Currently, Three Springs at Shiloh has only one anchored tenant, American Eagle Credit Union, at 1153 Blue Springs Plz., which opened three years ago. The multi-use development was earmarked for commercial development since its inception in November 2008, but little movement has been made to attract businesses to the prime location — the intersection of Frank Scott Parkway and Green Mount Road. Two Sears stores to shutter The Sears Appliance and Hardware store at 2300 Troy Rd. in Edwardsville will be closing on Nov. 5, according to store manager Ken Campbell. He and the store’s 21 employees were told in September, he said. The Edwardsville location is not a big-box Sears, but a smaller hardware and appliance store. Another Sears Appliance and Hardwards — located at 501 Beltline Rd. in Collinsville — also will close. A manager at that location said the store’s last day would be in early December. Employee becomes owner of historic Worden bar The Yellow Dog Café & Bar — a mainstay in Worden since it was built in the late 1800s — has a new owner. But Nikki Schreiber-Settles is no newbie. She’s been a server and bartender at the joint for years. With the help of SIUE’s Metro East Small Business Development Center, Schreiber-Settles officially took over in May. “The SBDC is incredibly valuable to small business owners. If anyone hasn’t yet taken advantage of this no-cost service, it is truly their loss,” Schreiber-Settles said. “It’s a real landmark,” said Barbara Schreiber, Nikki’s mother and business partner. “The Yellow Dog was first built back in the late 1800s when the railroad was going through. It has been known by that name ever since. There are Worden residents in their eighties who say they can’t remember it ever being called anything else.” The Yellow Dog, located at 124 East Wall Street in Worden, is open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., with the kitchen closing at 9 p.m. On Saturday nights, closing time is 3 a.m. Tobias Wall: 618-239-2501, @Wall_BND Tobias Wall i Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Metro-East News Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:44 Man nearly burned inside of exploding car, escapes inferno Pause 2:39 Newly-elected St. Clair County Coroner Calvin Dye Sr. 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 4:04 Blinded Belleville policeman Jon Brough talks about his struggles, triumphs 2:48 Red sweater Internet sensation Ken Bone reflects on debate, celebrity 1:56 Ken Bone casts his ballot Tuesday morning in Shiloh 1:14 Tammy the cat is good with kids and would make a great addition to your family 1:07 Edwardsville football coach talks playoff loss to Glenbard West 3:06 Mascoutah volleyball team celebrates third-place win at state 0:23 Slow motion: Did Mater Dei score winning points or not?

Gwen Ifill, pioneering broadcaster, PBS host, dies at 61 News Maryland Baltimore County Owings Mills As Owings Mills Mall disappears, questions loom about what will take its place New development revitalizing Owings Mills New development is revitalizing Owings Mills. (WJZ) New development is revitalizing Owings Mills. (WJZ) Pamela WoodContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Thirty years ago, Owings Mills Mall was posh and had a Saks Fifth Ave. Soon it could have a Walmart. At the opening of the Owings Mills Mall in 1986, politicians cracked champagne bottles on the brass stair rails and pink and turquoise feathers rained down from the skylights onto a throng of shoppers below. With a Saks Fifth Avenue department store and specialty retailers selling furs and designer clothes, the mall was celebrated as the high-end centerpiece of the emerging, affluent suburb. Thirty years later, workers have encircled the mall with screened fences and are tearing it down. Owings Mills Mall is now seen as a spectacular failure. Yet its demise hasn't slowed interest and retail growth in an area of the county still seen as an emerging hub. Even as tenants left the mall, developers were building the adjacent Metro Centre with office and retail space, and new apartments grew up next to the Metro station. About a mile and a half away, the sprawling Foundry Row center on Reisterstown Road opened last month with more than 350,000 square feet of retail space, anchored by a Wegmans grocery. At the opening of the Owings Mills Mall in 1986, politicians celebrated it as the high-end centerpiece of the emerging, affluent suburb. Thirty years later, workers have encircled the mall with screened fences and are tearing it down. Read more. Brian Gibbons, whose Owings Mills-based Greenberg Gibbons Commercial is redeveloping Foundry Row from the former Solo Cup factory, says he's "very bullish" on Owings Mills — an area with a median household income of more than $71,000, according to census data. The countywide median is $66,900. Kimco, the New York-based owners of Owings Mills Mall, say they're high on the area, too, and are planning to build a new open-air shopping center in its place.  Find out the latest news in Baltimore commercial development. But they've been mum on what tenants might be included, heightening concern amid residents, county officials and others who see the mall site's fate as critical to the future of Owings Mills. Baltimore County Councilman Julian Jones recently convened a pair of community meetings over rumors a Walmart superstore might anchor Kimco's new center. Jones, a Woodstock Democrat who represents the mall area, said residents told him loud and clear they don't want a big Walmart — especially because there are already two Walmarts in the area in centers that could suffer or close if another opens. Walmart officials have said talk about a possible new store in Owings Mills is "speculation," and declined to comment further. Jones said he's "not very impressed" with what Kimco has revealed so far, and has urged them to build a high-quality project. "I want something nice," he said. "Whatever happens, we're going to live with it for the next 30 years." Still, he said, "the important thing for me is to make sure whatever happens there, that it be successful. "Right now I'm trying to work with [Kimco] to achieve the primary objective, which is to get it developed." A spokeswoman for County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said the county hopes Kimco will "aim higher than a Walmart superstore." "The county executive has communicated directly with Kimco on many, many occasions in recent weeks and months," spokeswoman Fronda Cohen said. "He really has told them he wants them to … create a quality development for the people of Owings Mills." The Owings Mills "fashion mall" opened to great fanfare 30 years ago, but the 1992 murder of Christina Marie Brown shook the public's confidence in the mall area. Brown, 28, was shot to death as she walked along a path from the mall to the Metro station. Nigel Antonio Carter, then 17, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. The mall declined in the years that followed. High-end retailers left, to be replaced by mid-range stores. Saks Fifth Avenue left Owings Mills in 1996, followed by Sears in 2001 and Lord & Taylor in 2002. By September 2015, only a few stores remained. Kimco closed off the interior sections of the mall, leaving only Macy's and JC Penney open for business. Those stores closed, too, and demolition began this year. As far back as 2011, Kimco proposed working with then-owner General Growth Properties to "de-mall" the site and redevelop it. Kimco eventually gained sole control of the property and received preliminary approval from the county for an open-air center. No permits have been granted, but plans filed with the county show four possible variations. All involve two main rows of shops and vast parking. One plan includes a 12-story office tower and garage; two others include a gas station. No tenants have been named. Kimco officials have declined to answer questions, but said in a statement the company is "considering several different retail alternatives, including a new open-air power center concept that will enhance the available shopping options and compliment the surrounding community." The company said it is "encouraged by the considerable interest we've received from potential retailers at this early stage." Civic activists say they recognize high-end stores failed at Owings Mills Mall, but they don't think a Walmart-type store is right, either. Mark Stewart, president of the Reisterstown-Owings Mills-Glyndon Coordinating Council, says he wants to see something akin to Hunt Valley Towne Centre, where Greenburg Gibbons turned a moribund mall into an outdoor center. Stores should be nice, he said, but the mall experience proved consumers in the area won't support expensive retailers. George Harman, a past president of the Reisterstown-Owings Mills-Glyndon Coordinating Council who ran for county executive in 2014, noted the demise of Owings Mills Mall is not unique. Malls around the region and across the county have closed or undergone redevelopment. "It's really a shame to see the transitioning of all the malls," he said. But he noted that many, including Hunt Valley, have rebounded. Harman said there's room for "middle-of-the-road" restaurants and stores such as a Lowes or a Dick's Sporting Goods. "Mid-range is what I think Reisterstown, Randallstown and Owings Mills are looking for," he said. Baltimore Rising, a group that promotes economic development in the region, has opposed a big-box concept at the site. The group is calling on Jones to introduce legislation limiting store size on the property that could eliminate big-box retailers. The group's founder, Les Cohen, declined an interview request. Rival developers see promise at the mall property, but say they worry Kimco's plan will fall short. Gibbons, CEO of Greenberg Gibbons, said his company wanted to buy the site, but was rebuffed by Kimco. He thinks the mall property is ripe for a mix of homes, shops and offices, creating a "walkable community" linking to Metro Centre next door. "It's very important that whatever happens to the mall is complementary, and we don't take a step back," Gibbons said. Howard Brown, chairman of Owings Mills-based David S. Brown Enterprises, said he also tried to buy the mall property. His company is developing Metro Centre, and built a road connecting his project to the mall site. Kimco declined to comment on whether Greenberg Gibbons and David S. Brown attempted to buy the mall. Brown said a big-box, strip center is not what people want, and won't become the community focal point Owings Mills needs. With the explosion of online shopping, he said, customers aren't interested in browsing in giant stores. In-person shopping is moving to smaller stores, he said. Brown said he would rather see the former mall site become mix of single- and multifamily housing centered around Main Street-type shopping, with a park or pond as a neighborhood amenity. "The last thing it wants to be is boxes facing boxes," Brown said. "That's passé." Brown thinks county officials should take a role in nudging Kimco to be creative, possibly with legislation guiding what can be done with the property. "They have an opportunity now. The mall is gone," Brown said. "The county has an opportunity to create a walkable, bikeable downtown."

It was September 16 that Nintendo officially released this Pokemon GO accessory. According to IGN, Nintendo has since apologized for product shortages as fans of the game are going to Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them only to find out the game accessory has been sold out. “We launched the Pokemon Go Plus accessory on September 16th to provide a more comfortable play experience for Pokemon Go. Demand far exceeded our expectations and production has not caught up, leading to product shortages. We apologize to the consumers and distributors affected by this. We are planning to expand production as needed, and will continue to produce and ship additional units.” Nintendo has reassured Pokemon GO players that they will continue to produce and ship additional accessories until they meet the demand. Unfortunately, some Pokemon GO players may just be forced to wait as Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them slowly restock their shelves with additional accessories for the game. Kimishima on how Pokemon GO has boosted Pokemon 3DS, working to remedy Pokemon GO Plus shortages https://t.co/ATzUBWsT6d pic.twitter.com/AAmxhpcdAm — Nintendo Everything (@NinEverything) October 27, 2016 The question some Pokemon GO players have at this point is simple – is there a way to see if Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them have Pokemon GO Plus in stock before taking a trip to the store? These players are hoping to find out if Toys R Us and/or these other local stores have the game accessory in stock in order to avoid wasting a trip to the store only to find out the store does not have the accessory in stock when they get there.

Nintendo never told customers where Pokemon GO Plus was being sold, but any video game store or store with a video game and electronic department is a safe bet. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/py5Kj_NtXuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Most of the stores that sell the video game (such as Toys R Us, Walmart, or GameStop) will have store locators on their official websites. These store locators can be used to find stores near you. The store locator will also provide you with the phone number. Just give a few of the stores a call. If you find a store that has one in stock, see if they can set it aside for you. Impatient Pokemon GO players, who are not having any luck by checking local stores such as Toys R Us, can also resort to purchasing the game accessory online. It is, however, important to keep in mind that third party vendors selling Pokemon GO Plus through websites such as Amazon are going to be selling the accessory for more than retail price because of the demand. It is not uncommon for these vendors to purchase game and game accessories such as Pokemon GO Plus when they are in high demand and selling them at higher than retail price because they know some fans will be willing to pay more to get their hands on the product as soon as possible. Latest Pokémon GO Update Breaks GO Plus Accessory, Fix Already In The Works https://t.co/J3PxEC8ya9 #Mobile pic.twitter.com/7pXOis6V9J — Nintendo Life (@nintendolife) October 26, 2016 According to IGN, one of the biggest features Pokemon GO Plus will offer to players is not requiring the application to run on your phone in order to play the game. With this accessory, players do not have to stare at their screen or run the application. This will allow the battery on your smartphone to last longer and it makes it a lot easier for players to be aware of their surroundings while playing the game. In order to use the accessory with this special feature, you just have to open the application, sign into your account, and then put your phone on screen lock in order to conserve the battery power. Then, Pokemon GO Plus will notify you when there are Pokemon or PokeStops nearby. This way all players will have to do is press a button to collect the item or Pokemon that is nearby. Don't forget trainers, starting tomorrow October 30th, the #PokemonGo Plus accessory will return @ToysRUs stores! pic.twitter.com/X6uIVnkXnt — PokéSteal (@PokeSteal) October 29, 2016 Pokémon GO Plus restocks hitting Toys"R"Us on October 30th according to new Holiday Toy Guide. pic.twitter.com/GLYNAHHEq0 — Pokémon GO Wire (@PokeWire) October 24, 2016 For Pokemon GO players who have yet to get their hands on this gaming accessory, the Toys R Us Holiday Toy Guide revealed that all Toys R Us stores would be restocking their shelves with additional accessories today – October 30. Did you manage to get your hands on Pokemon GO Plus before it went out of stock in your area? Did you pay retail price or did you hop online and pay an inflated price to get your accessory?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Woman sues Wal-Mart, debt collection service for 'robocalls' Sunday Oct 30, 2016 at 2:01 AM Nicki Gorny @Nicki_Gorny A Citrus County woman is suing Wal-Mart and a debt collection service it contracted based on the “ceaseless barrage of daily calls” she claims to have received. Sandra Laurentano, of Homosassa, argues in a complaint filed this month in the Ocala division of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida that Wal-Mart and Central Credit Services violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act through the “robocalls” it employed to contact her. Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 to ban the automated or pre-recorded calls, which it cast as a “nuisance” and “invasion of privacy.” An attorney for Laurentano indicated in the complaint that Wal-mart and Central Credit Services placed approximately 200 calls to her phone between November 2015 and October 2016. These apparently sought to recover a $350 debt. The complaint alleges that, through these calls, the defendants “intentionally harassed and abused (Laurentano) on numerous occasions by calling several times during day, and on back-to-back days, with such a frequency as can be reasonably expected to harass.” The complaint also references the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It calls for a jury trial and award of statutory, punitive and actual damages. Laurentano is represented by the Consumer Protection Firm, based in Tampa, according to court records. — Contact Nicki Gorny at 352-867-4065, nicki.gorny@ocala.com or @Nicki_Gorny.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 A La Carte: Philly Pretzel Factory opening next year in local Wal-Marts Saturday Oct 29, 2016 at 8:27 PM Natalie Morris Correspondent The PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY hopes to enter the Illinois market with two locations operating in Springfield by summer 2017. “We like to say we’re looking for the pretzel mayor of Springfield,” said Tom Monaghan, chief development officer for the Philadelphia-based chain. “Illinois, specifically Springfield, has been identified as a target market and now we’re looking for franchise partners.” Desired locations already have been identified even while the soft pretzel business -- known for its “hot outta the oven” slogan -- is hunting prospective partners. Monaghan said the goal is to open sites inside Springfield’s Wal-Mart locations on North Dirksen Parkway and Sixth Street. Philly Pretzel Factory already has store-in-store locations in 31 Wal-Mart Supercenters.  The factory menu offers all things pretzel, including hand-twisted soft pretzels; mini pretzel nuggets known as Rivets; pretzels stuffed with hot dogs, spicy sausages or Philadelphia cheesesteak; pepperoni pretzel melts; and cinnamon coated pretzel twists. Founder Dan DiZio was only 11 when he began selling soft pretzels, organizing a crew of neighborhood kids to hawk his breads at busy intersections throughout Philadelphia. DiZio and partner Len Lehman opened the first brick-and-mortar location in 1998 in Mayfair, Pennsylvania. Today there are more than 150 locations throughout a dozen states. Philly Pretzel Factory isn’t the first dining chain to publicly announce interest in Springfield in an effort to locate franchise partners. Management for two pizza chains announced plans in 2015 to open in Springfield in an effort to drum up franchise partners. To date, neither the Wisconsin-based TOPPERS PIZZA nor the Georgia-based YOUR PIE have identified a location or named opening date. However, Monaghan said Philly Pretzel Factory historically identifies franchise partners within 60 to 90 days of announcing a target market. * Online ordering is now available at PIE’S THE LIMIT’s newest location at 1710 S. MacArthur Blvd. Customers can either order through the restaurant’s website at PiestheLimit.com or text “LIMIT” to 33733. The service already was available at the original location in Parkway Pointe, which celebrates its first anniversary this month. The MacArthur Boulevard business opened in September. The Springfield-based, fast-casual pizza model is owned by Vic Lanzotti and Chris Hanken. The local businessmen just announced the site for their first Pie’s the Limit location outside Springfield. A store is scheduled to open in Champaign at 2510 Village Green Place at The Crossing in the spring of 2017. * Construction is nearing completion for a NANCY’S PIZZA in Litchfield just off Interstate 55. This will be the third location opened by the locally based franchisee Next Gen, which began in May with a Springfield location at 2301 W. Monroe St. A second Nancy’s Pizza -- providing delivery and carry out only -- opened in O’Fallon, Missouri, recently. The newest location in Litchfield at 13 Thunderbird Circle will be a full-service restaurant with seating for 80 and a beer and wine list, similar to the Springfield site. A late November opening is planned. * DANENBERGER FAMILY VINEYARDS has tickets on sale for a limited-seating, regional pairing dinner Nov. 10. The four-course meal features meats and coffees from BUNN GOURMET, PEASES chocolates and beer and wine from the New Berlin vineyard and ROLLING MEADOWS BREWERY. The menu offers fall spice cured pork belly, espresso-and-sea salt dusted sirloin, rack of lamb and coffee cake with salted caramel ice cream. Wine or beer is served with each course. Cost is $150 a couple. Reservations required. Call 488-6321 extension 203. * The pumpkin may already be carved, but trick-or-treaters can decorate their own Scary Face pumpkin for free on Halloween at IHOP. The classic pancakes come with whipped cream, a strawberry nose and Oreo cookies and candy corn on the side for young diners to complete a signature jack-o-lantern. The special pancakes have been available throughout October, but are free Monday for children 12 and under from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. IHOP is located in Springfield at 2600 Sunrise Drive and 4001 Wabash Ave. * Area restaurants offering Thanksgiving specials will be featured in the Nov. 13 A La Carte column. Businesses interested in participating should submit information by Nov. 9. -- The A La Carte column highlights restaurant openings closings, renovations and relocations, as well as personnel changes and business news.

The area is surrounded by dozens of smaller businesses, and instead of seeing Wal-Mart as competition, a lot of them were counting on the extra traffic to increase their own bottom line. Tiffanie Lucas is one of them. A few weeks ago, she opened Ms. Tiff's 1 Stop on West Broadway. From snacks to dinner, she has it all. "I cook hot food in here. It is really what sells the best," she said. Business has been a little slow, but Lucas was counting on a big boost when Wal-Mart opened just across the street. "A lot of people don't make their way down here, but if there's a Wal-Mart, you know, you come out of the woodwork for Wal-Mart," Lucas said. "So [it] probably would have brought a lot of people to stop and check us out." On Friday, Wal-Mart pulled the plug on a plan to build a store at 18th and Broadway. City leaders blame it on a lawsuit. "As far as this particular Wal-Mart is concerned, we had no idea that they would back away," Attorney Steve Porter said. Porter filed the lawsuit on behalf of a group opposing the superstore but says his clients had an issue with the makeup of planning commission and design, not Wal-Mart. "We just wanted a legal planning commission, and we wanted the land development code to be followed," Porter said. In fact, Porter believes there were other factors that killed the super store, not the lawsuit. "I think the onus is probably mostly on Wal-Mart," he said. "They probably changed their strategy. That's probably the major reason, actually." Ironically, on Friday afternoon, the Kentucky Court of Appeals dismissed the lawsuit. "I thought it would help grow this community right here a lot," Lucas said. Right now, Lucas is working on a plan B. She believes it will be difficult to top the kind of traffic Wal-Mart would have brought. "It would have brought a lot of foot traffic from people catching the bus, because there are four bus stops right here, from the car traffic, to the employees." The land is owned by the developers, not the city. No one has said what the next move will be now that Wal-Mart is out.

(Photo: CBS8) San Diego Police shoveled out Wal-Mart gift cards between $50 and $100 each for a total of 48 guns handed over in Palm City over the weekend, and garnered some interesting NFA items. Among the haul of 22 handguns, 16 rifles and 10 shotguns were what CBS8 described as “an antique Winchester, a fully automatic rifle, two sawed-off shotguns and two handguns with their serial numbers filed off. ” The video after the jump details one of the shotties– a whippet style bolt-action gun– and shows what looks to be a heavily patina-ed 1892 Winnie as well as some gratuitous shots of the cane gun. While cane guns are not illegal, and the one turned in at the event looked to be an old C&R Remington, they do fall into Title II Any Other Weapon categories and having a modern one without the proper NFA paperwork is kinda frowned up, especially in California.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 12:00PM In this segment from the Market Foolery podcast, Mark Reeth and Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser consider the ongoing expansion at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company is boosting its busy season staff expansion by 20% at a time when brick-and-mortar rivals are either holding their headcounts steady or shrinking them entirely -- a clear demonstration of how well Amazon continues to disrupt the traditional retail world.   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 13, 2016 Mark Reeth: Let's move on to Amazon. Amazon made headlines today. As the holiday season approaches, a lot of retailers out there will hire seasonal workers. Amazon has announced it's going to add 120,000 seasonal positions this year. That's up from 100,000 last year. That growth rate speaks volumes, I think, to how Amazon has been successful about upsetting status quo with those old school retailers. For instance, you look at Target and Macy's, Target is going to hire 70,000 additional workers in its stores. That's the same as last year. Macy's is going to hire 83,000, that's down from 85,000 last year. Amazon increased its number by 20%. Again, it boggles the mind to think about how much Amazon has disrupted retail, but then you see numbers like this and suddenly it makes a lot of sense. Suddenly, it's all clear. Jason Moser: You know, a little bit more than a year ago, we were talking about the fact that Amazon had surpassed Wal-Mart in market cap. Amazon had become a bigger company by market capitalization than Wal-Mart, which was interesting from a number of different perspectives. One I kind of couldn't get over was the fact that Wal-Mart still does about four times the revenue that Amazon does today. Now, that gap is closing very quickly, but when we were talking about that 14, 15 months ago, all of a sudden Amazon has almost doubled the market cap of Wal-Mart. This is a very good example of that the market is a forward-looking mechanism that we always talk about. The market doesn't care as much about what you've done as it does about what you tell us you're going to do. When we look at Amazon, for example, we know that every holiday season, Jeff Bezos sees that as nothing but pure opportunity. The estimates for Amazon's revenue for this coming holiday are close to $45 billion in sales. Now, that's about 25% up from last year's numbers. That's right in line with when you're growing your sales at that rapid of a clip, particularly considering what Amazon does, you need to have the staff there to be able to fill that void, packing boxes, shipping stuff out, and all of that. I think the benefit that Amazon has here is they've always been very clear from the beginning that they want to be the world's most customer-centric company. That seems like an easy thing to say, but as you know, as I know, I think probably anyone out there that has ever worked in customer service in any capacity, customer service is really hard. I mean, it's really hard because you're working with a unique individual every single time. Their situation is unique to them and you want to try to make it the best experience possible for them. Now Amazon is focused on doing this on grand scale. Now, they know that customers really care about a couple of things: low prices and getting that stuff shipped to them as quickly as possibly. Lucky enough for Amazon, they do both of those things really, really well. That's why they staff up so heavily during the holiday season is because you're going to see I think over the course of the next 10 to 20 years, really ... Again, e-commerce is so young even though it's what we're used to, you think about it, my kids, for example, 10 and 11 years old now, they've never really known a world without e-commerce. I think that ... I like to look at their behavior in a lot of cases and try to sort of see how the investing world may look over the course of the next 10, 20 years and every time I look at them and their behavior, it just screams "buy Amazon, buy Amazon" because they've got a piece of everything, whether it's e-commerce, entertainment, music, cloud computing, and it just keeps on growing. Now, we see they're talking about establishing a little bit more of a physical infrastructure, possible bookstores, and/or convenience stores. It just goes on and on. We go back to talking about how important culture is and leadership and Amazon's success is certainly because of the people that work there, but Jeff Bezos is the man that really has executed on this vision and I think as long as he's around, you've got to really feel pretty good about Amazon's chances.

Many residents are excited for the retail option, and the more than 200 jobs the store will create, while others remain fearful the store will hurt small businesses and offer only low-wages to its workers. Just another chapter for this region, that's how one local historian and journalist summed up the opening of Walmart's new super store in Derby. Development, he says, that started with the Interstate coming through. "Since then there has been a steady flow of businesses setting up here -- and this is just another chapter -- and now the Derby Road, for good or bad, is the commercial center for Orleans County," said Scott Wheeler with Northland Journal. He says there are still people who worry about the box store's impact on local down town stores. "A lot of people look at downtown Newport and wonder what's going to happen to Newport with Walmart," Wheeler said. One person who is convinced Walmart will be good for downtown Newport, is Newport Mayor Paul Monette. He is the new wireless manager at Walmart. "I think it is going to help downtown Newport in reality. I have looked at Littleton and also St. Albans, and I have seen how their downtowns have really thrived after Walmart," Monette said. Monette says he was laid off from his teaching job, so he -- like over 200 other people -- applied at the big box store. "We have hired a little over 250 now -- going for 350. We have had a really big turnout as far as applications, so it has made the hiring process fairly easy," said Tony Lane, a Walmart Manager. Stocking is now underway at the 176-thousand square-foot store. Hundreds of thousands of boxes are being unpacked around the clock, and stacked on shelves until the store opens for one stop shopping. "I think it will be good to just go to one store and get everything you need, and my daughter is working there," said Denise Gandreau, a nearby resident of Beebee Plain. Walmart officials say they have hired 11 assistant managers and two co-managers -- those are salaried positions. Everyone else will be paid by the hour starting at minimum wage -- $9.60. A grand opening is scheduled for November 16th.  Doors open at 7a.m. Related Stories: Wal-Mart groundbreaking marks major milestone in Derby Derby Wal-Mart project receives Act 250 approval Developer files Wal-Mart application in Derby Plans for Derby Walmart move forward Derby Walmart gets greenlight Local NewsMore>> 2 St. Albans teens accused of leading police on chase 2 St. Albans teens accused of leading police on chase Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 8:06 PM EST2016-11-15 01:06:47 GMT Two St. Albans teenagers are accused of leading police on a high speed chase.

Lehigh Valley Craft Beer: Tastings, new places opening, upcoming events & more LV Business Cycle Retail Organic foods that aren't worth organic prices Morgan QuinnOf GoBankingRates.com Organic foods that aren't worth organic prices Once upon a time, you could only find organic food in health food stores. Now, you can buy organic everywhere, from Wal-Mart to the corner gas station. And while there are many benefits to eating organic foods, the biggest downside is often the cost. According to Consumer Reports, organic foods are 47 percent more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Organic foods are usually pricier because of costs that go into getting certified and maintaining organic farming practices. Not only does it take more time to raise food in this way, but farmers can't cut corners by using pesticides to kill overgrown weeds or control infestations. Moreover, organic foods spoil faster because they aren't treated with waxes or preservatives, so farmers have to absorb greater losses. While some organic produce is safer than its non-organic counterparts, that isn't the case for all your favorite fruits and vegetables. So, before you blow this month's grocery budget, check out these organic foods that aren't worth their organic price tags. FRUITS WITH INEDIBLE PEELS When it comes to fruits with inedible peels - like avocados, oranges, melons, bananas, mangoes, pineapples and kiwis - you don't have to buy organic to indulge. While fruits with soft or edible peels should always be organic, it's generally safe to eat non-organic fruits with inedible peels, because pesticides usually don't get transferred to the fruit inside.

Republicans have promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act pretty much since the law’s enactment in 2010. The biggest difference between organic and non-organic avocadoes are the prices: Organic avocados cost about 30 cents more per pound. Additionally, organic cantaloupe is about 50 cents more per pound, and bananas are about 10 cents more. While it's okay to buy the conventional versions of these fruits, you should still wash the peels before cutting into them to avoid transferring potentially harmful residues that can linger on the outside. VEGETABLES WITH THICK SKINS Thick-skinned vegetables like onion, cabbage, sweet corn, eggplant and sweet peas don't necessarily have to be organic to be healthy. Just like fruits with inedible peels, vegetables with thick skins don't absorb as many pesticides. Additionally, people remove many of the "dirty" layers before consuming the produce. Layers of onion and cabbage have to be peeled away before the veggies are cooked and consumed; sweet corn needs to be husked; sweet peas must be shelled; and eggplant has a tough exterior that needs to be cooked down to consume. Carrots even make the list of safe veggies, if you take the time to peel the skins, where pesticide residue can linger. On the other hand, experts advise eating organic versions of vegetables without peels, as well as those with soft exteriors. Many of these foods are listed on the Environmental Working Group's 2016 "Dirty Dozen" list, which includes celery, spinach, sweet bell peppers, cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Along with being safe to eat, non-organic vegetables with thick skins are significantly cheaper than their organic counterparts. For example, organic sweet corn costs anywhere from 10 percent to 200 percent more than the conventional variety. QUINOA Once a niche ingredient, quinoa has become a popular source of protein. However, you don't need to buy organic quinoa to partake. Because quinoa has a natural coating that tastes bitter to pests, farmers don't need to spray this crop with pesticides. Most quinoa packagers remove the coating during production, but it's wise to give the grain another rinse before you cook it. Non-organic and organic quinoa have the same nutritional profiles; it's actually the color that makes the difference. While red and white quinoa have similar calorie counts, vitamins and minerals, red quinoa is a better source of riboflavin - it has a whopping 15 percent of the daily value per serving, based off a 2,000 calorie diet. The cost of quinoa, organic or not, has skyrocketed in recent years due to limited supply from importers, according to the Washington Post. Currently, Eden Organic red quinoa costs $12.59 a pound, while regular red quinoa from Roland is about $9 a pound. Since this is one of the foods you don't need to buy organic, you can enjoy significant savings - and health benefits. MAPLE SYRUP Organic and regular maple syrup are produced in basically the same way and usually don't require pesticides or fertilizers. Both non-organic and organic maple syrup producers are required to have state licenses and be inspected by the USDA. Currently, a 25-ounce container of organic Crown Maple Syrup costs nearly $38, while the same amount of MacDonald's Maple Syrup is about $16. That's a $22 difference. Because there is little nutritional value in buying organic, maple syrup lovers should consider saving their money. SEAFOOD If you see organic seafood for sale, be wary - there are no federal regulations that make seafood organic. And since organic seafood isn't regulated, that means it might not have been tested for toxicity. Hence, you're paying a pretty penny for a potentially false claim. Labeling farm-raised seafood as wild-caught is an issue that dates back at least a decade. In 2005, the New York Times ran a story revealing that fish sold as wild salmon by several high-end New York City markets was actually farm-raised and selling for as much as $29 a pound, while actual farmed salmon sold for $5 to $12 a pound. The USDA is working to create guidelines that would allow for the sale of certified organic seafood, but that could be a few years away. For now, if you want to eat seafood that's safe for you and your family, look for varieties that are low in mercury, such as salmon, trout and catfish, and focus on buying seafood that's caught using sustainable practices. EGGS Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to buy organic eggs to enjoy food that's free of hormones. Unlike other farm-raised animal products, like dairy, beef and lamb, it's illegal to give hormones to chickens. Experts disagree on whether factory eggs have a higher risk of salmonella contamination than the farm variety. Currently, hens that lay organic eggs must be free range, which means they are not housed in cages and have access to the outdoors. Additionally, they must be fed an organic diet and receive no antibiotics. When it comes to nutritional value, it's actually the hen's diet that matters most - not its organic status. Instead of paying for organic eggs, look for eggs that have high levels of omega-3s, a status that comes from improving a hen's diet and increasing time spent outdoors. Buying conventional eggs will also help you save at the grocery store. Organic eggs run about $6 a dozen, while non-organic options are about $3 a dozen. SPICES Think twice about paying double for those organic spices. One of the world's most expensive spices, saffron is more expensive per ounce than gold. And when it goes organic, the price skyrockets. Compared to regular saffron, which runs about $1,000 per pound, organic saffron costs a budget-busting $3,100 a pound. Since you're not liable to eat a lot of saffron, the risks in eating the non-organic version is minimal. Other common spices are more affordable than saffron, but the organic label will still set you back. Simply Organic Grind to a Salt is about $10 for 5 ounces. Morton salt, meanwhile, costs less than a dollar for 26 ounces. And Simply Organic garlic powder is about $4.75 for just over 3.6 ounces, while McCormick garlic powder is only $3 for just over 3 ounces. Moreover, NPR reported that organic spices can actually be unsafe for consumers. In 2012, a number of large grocery retailers recalled organic celery seed because a batch tested positive for salmonella. It's not uncommon for organic spices to become contaminated with bacteria and insects because, in order to comply with organic standards, they aren't treated with radiation to kill pests. Even if you buy regular spices instead of organic ones, you might spend a pretty penny for just a tiny jar. To save money stocking your spice cabinet, experts recommend grinding spices up yourself.

Amazon or Google? In 2012, a Forrester report found that 30% of all online shoppers start research products at Amazon. Wordtracker even went so far as to say that “Amazon has not only topped Google as the number one shopping search engine, but has attracted droves of individual and corporate sellers to its marketplace.” Apparently, not much has changed since that time. A recent study at the start of peak season for ecommerce has revealed that online retailer Amazon has taken a huge lead and become the first place consumers go to find products. The study, run by personalization platform company BloomReach and Survata found that approximately 55% of customers use Amazon before any other site when searching for products online. This was the second annual “State of Amazon” study. While the company’s gains are impressive, it’s nothing short of what consumers and researchers have come to expect from the retail giant. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Wal-Mart as the most valuable retailer in the US, and its numbers only continue to grow. In the past, many more people would first turn to a search engine such as Google, but the number of services that Amazon offers puts the company at a distinct advantage for the coming holiday season. The study BloomReach’s second annual “State of Amazon” study surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers over the 2016 Labor Day weekend and revealed surprising results. While 55% of consumers reported going to Amazon before any other retailer, search engines and other retailers lost equal ground, pulling in only 28% and 16% of consumers, respectively. The company’s lead has only increased since BloomReach’s inaugural “State of Amazon” study, conducted in 2015. BloomReach conducted a similar study in April, which revealed that Amazon already possessed 53% of consumers’ first product search. As it turns out, Amazon is involved in nearly all online shopping experiences. In fact, approximately 90% of consumers will conduct a search on Amazon even if the product they want is on another retailer’s site. “Amazon continues to be the first destination when consumers want to find a product, driven largely by a perceived superior end-to-end experience,” said Jason Seeba, BloomReach head of marketing. “Online shopping is all about relevance and convenience, and comparison shopping has never been easier – especially with mobile growth.” The retailers Amazon’s grip on the public doesn’t stop at general shopping, either. With the holiday season creeping upon us, the online retailer is expected to be the first destination for almost all online holiday shopping. Approximately 94% of consumers reported plans to complete their holiday shopping on Amazon, as well. While retailers are feeling the pinch of Amazon’s incredibly high consumer numbers, that doesn’t mean they’re entirely knocked out of the game. In fact, a majority of survey respondents said that other retailers were better at tailoring their websites and product recommendations. Roughly one in five respondents reported that quality was their biggest concern while shopping at Amazon. It’s relatively easy to buy some objects, but others face a high rate of counterfeit complaints. In fact, the biggest complaints came from customers who used Amazon’s relatively new “marketplace” feature. In an effort to compete with Etsy, another online retailer, Amazon created a third-party space for consumers to interact in much the same way they do on Etsy. However, the growing artisan community came into Q3 2016 with a strong lead over Amazon’s Marketplace. Wal-Mart Amazon may have some fierce competition online from the Etsy artisan community, but other retailers are struggling with their ecommerce for the holiday season. Wal-Mart in particular is making a big push to expand their online presence as holiday season creeps ever closer. However, investors are still looking for proof that the payoff will be worth all of the time and money in the end. The company stated that it plans to spend approximately $11 billion in its next fiscal year on ecommerce initiatives while still focusing on remodeling its stores. Wal-Mart, while its ecommerce spending might be alarming, isn’t new to this type of investment. In fact, its US online sales are second only to Amazon, the company it’s currently attempting to surpass. As one of the most successful brick-and-mortar franchises in the nation, Wal-Mart certainly doesn’t have anything to fear as far as holiday sales go. The biggest issue for the company is whether its investors will see the current ecommerce spending necessary to compete with Amazon.

Five most important search marketing news stories of the week The shoppers Whether it’s brick-and-mortar retail shopping or it begins on a search engine, holiday creep has arrived. In fact, by the time Labor Day rolled around this year, nearly half of American parents had already started their holiday shopping. Retailers like Macy’s and Best Buy have already started their holiday advertising campaigns, even going so far as to deck out their stores in red and white holiday garb. According to data from last year’s Rubicon survey, only 42% of parents had started their holiday shopping by September. This year marks a significant increase in their data, although other studies reveal that Rubicon’s numbers may run a bit high. According to a CreditCards.com report from 2015, only about 14% of American consumers had started thier holiday shopping by September. However, their most recent survey showed the same upward trend in those consumers choosing to shop earlier in the year. American parents are expected to spend approximately $1,711 during the 2016 holidays, according to Rubicon. And as the BloomReach survey suggests, most of them will be headed to search engines and Amazon for their initial searches. According to the BloomReach “State of Amazon” study, when holiday shoppers have an idea of what they want, 59% will start on Amazon and 24% will start on a search engine. However, even a Google search is likely to direct consumers to Amazon before any other retailer. Amazon’s presence in the e-commerce community hasn’t gone unnoticed by consumers, either. In fact, one in five consumers revealed they were concerned about the company’s dominance relative to other retail outlets. In conclusion Amazon, while a powerhouse in the ecommerce community, still has a few issues of its own to work out. For one, its artisan-only Marketplace doesn’t offer the kind of authenticity and service that sites like Etsy do. Consumers are not only concerned with counterfeit products, but with the company’s dominance over the online community. Nevertheless, the company hasn’t pushed search engines or other retailers completely out of the holiday shopping game. A good chunk of consumers still turn to search engines before they conduct an Amazon search, although most search engines direct them to Amazon before other retailers. Holiday shopping season has arrived, and although Amazon has its faults, 53% of consumers still report having left another website in favor of Amazon. This year’s holiday shopping trends just may mark a huge milestone for the company. Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

SBUX stock is seeking growth in China's tea market By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 31, 2016, 9:26 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ Recent Posts: Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty ESPN Strangles Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock AGAIN View All Posts Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) growth has slowed. The Seattle-based coffee roaster had been one of the current recovery’s big stars. You could have gotten Starbucks stock for under $10 per share in 2009. If you made that trade on SBUX stock, you’d have had two shares, each worth $60, at the start of 2016, plus a stream of dividends that now yield 1.5%. Source: Adrianna Calvo via Stock Snap But 2016 has been a different story for investors. Starbucks stock is down roughly 11% so far this year. Year-over-year growth is down, and while it is squeezing out more profit on sales, debt levels are rising and traders are finding the price-to-earnings multiple of 30 a bit rich. SBUX has been trying some things — it is rolling out huge stores called “roasteries”, it’s serving beer-and-wine at night, and there’s a “secret menu” of barista-created drinks. But these are not moving the needle. Most stores are too small to handle an extensive line of food. The U.S. market seems saturated and Tim Horton’s is now joining the fray. So as CEO Howard Schultz prepares to announce full-year earnings on Thursday — analysts are hoping for 56 cents per share of earnings for the fourth quarter on sales of $5.69 billion — he is rolling out a new growth story. 7 Fantastic Stocks That No One Talks About It’s in China. SBUX Stock: The Story Is Tea Starbucks is still considered exotic in China. The company has about 2,400 stores there which represent luxury, modernity and American values to Chinese consumers. Now, under Belinda Wong, a former McDonald’s Corproation (NYSE:MCD) executive, SBUX plans to double its store count to 5,000 by 2021. To make the new stores work, Starbucks must become more of a Chinese experience. For that, Wong is betting on tea, a product that originated in China but whose culture has been ailing lately. The Chinese tea market is estimated to be 10 times bigger than its coffee market, but it’s a utilitarian drink, often plain leaves with water from a thermos. Wong plans to infuse fruit flavors in the product, bring in more modern tea-making products and integrate the Teavana brand, which began in Atlanta, into China’s SBUX stores. The idea is to raise tea’s image, justifying a higher price. This is precisely what Starbucks did with coffee in America, where a drink that used to go for less than $1 can now cost over $5. Teavana will be going into all of the company’s 6,200 stores in the Asia-Pacific region with flavored tea-drinks, a variety of tea bags to take home. This includes one drink with both coffee and tea, separated by milk.

Ree Drummond's 'The Mercantile' store opens Monday morning. Ree made a name for herself 11 years ago when she started ‘The Pioneer Woman’ blog. That led a cookbook, then a TV show, a cookware line at Walmart and now The Mercantile. Ree’s new shop, deli and bakery in Downtown Pawhuska. “If someone had told me what would result from my starting a blog, I would have laughed. But that's why life is so fun, man. You just pop popcorn and watch and see what happens,” Ree said. Ree and her husband Ladd, also known as the "Marlboro Man," bought 102-year-old Osage Mercantile building in 2012.  They've spent past fours years rehabilitating the building and letting their plans evolve into what The Mercantile is today -- a general store, deli and bakery. And a true labor of love. When you walk into The Mercantile, or The Merc, as Drummond affectionately calls it, you’re greeted by a smiling face from Drummond's staff and country music, like Willie Nelson, playing over the speakers. “I really want it to be a place where people feel happy and welcome,” she said. The Mercantile is the talk of Pawhuska these days, as excitement builds ahead of Monday’s grand opening. And Drummond has done so much making sure everything is just right, she’s worked herself sick.  “We've had many late nights. Five nights ago this store was just a bunch of stacks of random products and we had no idea what we were gonna do with it, so this is how I lost my voice,” she laughed while pointing at her store. But scratchy voice and all, Drummond and her team got it done and they left no detail unturned. “It's very special to me,” she said. “All of the [stuffed] animals have a bandana around their neck that say Drummond Ranch because they’re all animals that are on Drummond Ranch – coyotes, armadillos, eagles, raccoons.” The newly renovated historic building is a shoppers dream with something for everybody. “I’m a little bit of a middle child. I don’t want people to be bored in my presence,” Drummond said. “I wanted people to walk into the store and say, ‘Oh look at that. Oh wow, look at that.’” She’ll sell one-of-a-kind dishware, houseware, clothing, jewelry, leather bags and ‘cowboy stuff,' you name it. Drummond said she’s been buying merchandise since March. She hand-picked everything in the store. “I had to love it. I had to want it and I basically had to be crazy about it in order for it to be in The Merc and I just basically obsessed over what I was going to put in the store,” Ree said. One of her favorite products, she said, are the finger puppets, specifically the one made to look like Abraham Lincoln. “The products in here, there's such a mix. There are things for kids, there are things for kids-at-heart,” she said. She said the deli and bakery are dearest to her heart, they will serve up some of the Pioneer Woman specialties. “Food is what I love. I’ve obsessed over the food,” Ree said. “I had a lot of fun with this.”  Drummond seems to have fun in everything she does, which is why fans from all over the country want stop in. The city predicts well over 1,500 out-of-towners will visit every day.                  Kay and Jim Graham drove in from Alaska because they follow The Pioneer Woman and her family on TV and online.                  “We love it,” Kay Graham said.  “It's an all-American family living off the land and making the land work. They've just done a marvelous job,” Jim Graham added. Others have come in from California, New York, Connecticut, Florida and Indiana, just to name a few – proof The Merc is already putting Pawhuska on the map.                  “It's a true blessing for our community,” city manager Mike McCartney said. “There's not enough years for me to be able to create what this one business will create for us.” The Pioneer Woman now employs nearly 200 people between The Mercantile and her distribution warehouse in town.  The city manager said it’s hard to predict the true economic impact, but said it will be well into the millions and great enough to turn back the clock on the sleepy, little town. “What's getting ready to happen is gonna bring us back to probably where we were in the 20s when it was really roaring,” McCartney said. The Pioneer Woman won’t take all the credit, she said there are other business owners in town who have the same vision and see Pawhuska’s potential just like her.  “Pawhuska is a little bit of a sleepy town, but I will say, it has changed so much from 10 years ago. There are some young people that have moved here. We've got some shop owners that aren't from Pawhuska, but they saw something special in this town,” she said. “Even apart from what I'm doing, there's a little bit of momentum going on anyway, so it almost seems like the timing is almost preordained.” But as for numbers and how many tourists she’ll bring to town, she’s not focused on that. “I'm bad at math and I don't sit around and say 'We need this many people to do this and this.’ I've been concentrating on making the store as great as it can be and as unique as it can be,” she said. “I think if I get too mired in goals and objectives, I would stop having fun and I think the fun it what this place is all about.” The fun she’s having is in every detail. The rustic charm reflects Drummond's Osage County roots, a part of her she loves sharing with the world. “People who drive in, who have never been to this area say, ‘I just thought Oklahoma was flat and boring and then I drove into Osage County.’ They just can't believe the sweeping views,” she said. But it’s the kindness of the people in town, some of the best you’ll ever find, that will keep folks coming back to Pawhuska she says. “I may be the reason people come to visit, but I won't be the only thing they want to stay and see,” Drummond said. “I feel like people will come and then they'll come back. I want them to come visit, but I want them to come back and bring a friend.” The Pioneer Woman said she plans to be at The Merc as much as she possibly can. The deli is set to open Monday morning at 6 a.m. The shop on the other side will open a few hours later.  The Pioneer Woman is also on Facebook and The Mercantile has its own Facebook page as well.  NewsMore>> TPD Releases Dashcam Footage Of Fatal Standoff TPD Releases Dashcam Footage Of Fatal Standoff The Tulsa Police Department released dashcam video showing the end of a tense standoff that took place last month near 41st and 177th East Avenue.

CDT October 31, 2016 Thursday morning's trip to Wal-Mart at the corner of  Hulen  Street & Oakmont Blvd. didn't end how Samantha Herrera expected. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT WORTH, Texas -- Thursday morning's trip to Wal-Mart at the corner of Hulen Street and Oakmont Boulevard didn't end how Samantha Herrera expected. "It was crazy. I'm still shaken up from it," said Herrera. While she and her mother were about to leave the parking lot just after 11 a.m., they noticed an older woman that looked scared. She flagged them down for help. "She said a man had just grabbed her wallet," said Herrera. Mother and daughter started driving around the parking lot looking for the man. Samantha started recording with her cell phone just in case they could catch a picture of him. Turns out, she did more than that. "We saw him by the Wendy's, so we pulled up and I just decided to get him," she said. "I told him, 'You're not getting away, you're not.' This [the victim] is somebody's grandmother." She ended up tackling 60-year-old Bobby Montgomery to the ground and held him there until Fort Worth police arrived on scene to make an arrest. The woman victim told Samantha she was the store to buy dinners for a local Thanksgiving effort to help feed the less fortunate at Saint Andrew Catholic Church. "The lady cop just told me, 'Pound it. Good job.' She doesn't see this often: ladies chasing guys down," said Herrera. Montgomery was booked into jail on a theft charge.  Herrera says she was just glad to help.

And some metro council members say it's because of financial racism. "It was financial racism by this city's government who said I'm not going to do anything to help," Kelly Downard, Louisville Metro Council District 16, said. Walmart backed out of store plans on Friday based on various business decisions and extensive delays.  One of those likely being a lawsuit that was filed against the store regarding its layout and design. Councilwoman Mary Woolridge says she invited the people who filed the lawsuit to come to today's press conference, but they didn't show.  "You stopped this project. You've put this project on hold, but what do you have to offer this community ... not a darn thing ... and I am angry," Woolridge said.  Council members say the mayor and his administration could have done more to keep Walmart from leaving.  The store would have created about 300 jobs.  Related Stories:  Walmart backs out of planned west Louisville store Copyright 2016 WDRB Media.

Published Oct 30th, 2016 12:52 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Looking for ways to speed up and automate the pickup of online non-food orders (general merchandise), Walmart U.S. is testing a giant device that’s a cross between a huge Coke machine and bank ATM at Store No. 1 on West Walnut Street in Rogers. The machine sits inside the store’s front door on the side of general merchandise. The bright orange collection device ascends into the store’s ceiling and has a television monitor on its front side. The machine is physically connected to the store’s back room inventory. There is a kiosk positioned next the automated pickup machine where shoppers sign in by typing their last name. Shoppers are prompted to verify their order then an order number in receipt form is dispensed from the kiosk. The shopper scans the order receipt into the reader on the large automated pickup machine. The order will then be dispensed from the machine much like a can of soda. The process should soon be fully automated, but the machine now requires a Walmart employee to help a customer with the process, according to a store employee. This is a first test round of machine-dispensed orders by the retail giant. The test follows lockers that were in some stores. Walmart U.S. executives have said the retailer is trying to make pickup of general merchandise orders more convenient. The retailer had previously located the pickup desk at the back of the store near the electronics department. Staffing that pickup counter was complicated as there was no check-in required on the part of the shopper. Long wait times at the pickup desk have been a common complaint among users. Walmart unveiled in June its pickup kiosk and waiting area at the front of the supercenter on Pleasant Grove Road in Rogers. At that time Walmart executives demonstrated the kiosk sign-in process by logging in their last name. But the plan at that time was to have the customer sit in a small waiting area until an employee brought their order up from the back of the store. The newest online pickup test by Walmart U.S. sits inside the retailer’s supercenter on West Walnut Road in Rogers, Ark. However, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran wants to see more employees out in the store helping customers. The retailer hopes automation and consolidating more services is a way to best manage employee numbers and also provide more customer convenience. The newest version of “Walmart Pickup” could be virtually automated if the customer feedback is positive. “Our free Pickup service is a popular way for people to save time and money. We know speed and convenience are important to our customers and we’re always looking for new ways to bring it to them. We are excited to be one of the first companies to test this new technology and are looking forward to hearing feedback from our customers and associates,” said corporate spokesman Kory Lundberg. Walmart said millions of items are shipped to its stores for pickup each week and the retailer is continually seeking to make the process more convenient. The retail giant said the use of lockers and pickup waiting area in the front of store are all part of ongoing tests from which it will gather customer feedback.

The county has been without a full-service grocery since 2008. Greg Kocher gkocher1@herald-leader.com i By Greg Kocher gkocher1@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Garrard County has been without a full-service grocery for eight years, but that’s about to change. Larry Thornberry, who has a Save-A-Lot store in Richmond, confirmed Saturday that he plans to build a new store in Lancaster. Groundbreaking will be Nov. 21 on a lot on U.S. 27 across from McDonald’s. The 15,000-square-foot store will open in June or July 2017, Thornberry said. Lancaster hasn’t had a full-service grocery since Lynco closed in 2008. The city does have Dollar General and Family Dollar stores and several convenience stores, and while they offer many items found in a grocery, they don’t sell fresh produce or have a butcher department. Many Garrard residents drive a short distance to a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Stanford, in Lincoln County south of Lancaster. There’s another Wal-Mart in Danville, 12 miles to the west. Those two stores have a nearly 72 percent share of the Garrard County retail market, according to a 2014 study conducted by Associated Wholesale Grocers, a retailer-owned cooperative. Thornberry said he wasn’t intimidated by the larger stores.   “We’ve been in Richmond since 1939, and we’ve been next to Wal-Mart and we’ve been next to Kroger, and we’ve survived,” Thornberry said. “Save-A-Lot has a good program, and we can compete with the big boys to a certain extent.” Elected officials have long held that Lancaster could support a store, and they pointed to the 2014 study that estimated weekly sales for a store. “To have a full-service grocery store right in town is something that we need,” Garrard County Judge-Executive John Wilson said. “We’re glad to have them.” Greg Kocher: 859-231-3305, @HLpublicsafety Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:43 A wildfire burns near Pineville Pause 1:05 The dream of an Appalachian Wildlife Center 1:21 Georgetown's first Pride Festival brings community together 0:31 What if your bathtub water looked like this? 2:39 Families of drug addicts sharing 'horrific experience' to raise awareness 1:28 Friend remembers Mark Sawaf as 'real fun person' 1:34 Will high-speed internet save Eastern Kentucky? 1:07 Andy Beshear on UK's lawsuit against student newspaper 2:15 Chalk artist recreates 151 Pokémon on EKU's campus 2:17 Mother Teresa's legacy: Eastern Kentucky convent carries on her work 1:41 Mother Teresa's 1982 visit to Eastern Kentucky Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 4 days ago Drone video of forest fire in Jackson 4:26 4 days ago Drone video of forest fire in Jackson 0:43 11 days ago A wildfire burns near Pineville 1:05 13 days ago The dream of an Appalachian Wildlife Center View more video State Owen County to lose major plant, 411 jobs, officials say Wildfires close road and part of national forest in Red River Gorge Men in Laurel County arrested after 15 pounds of marijuana found in trunk Comer sworn in as Kentucky's newest congressman House swears in 3 new members, more coming soon Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Paper Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Replica Edition Delivery Vacation Stop Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Options Advertising Contact Us Place a Classified Ad Local Shopping / Coupons Special Publications Digital Solutions Media Kit Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Paper Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Replica Edition Delivery Vacation Stop Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Options Advertising Contact Us Place a Classified Ad Local Shopping / Coupons Special Publications Digital Solutions Media Kit More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Martin Weil and Clarence Williams October 29 Follow @martyweilwapost A person was shoved into the trunk of a car Friday night in front of a Walmart store in Northern Virginia and then driven away in a possible abduction, Prince William County police said. The incident occurred in front of the store on Worth Avenue in the Woodbridge area about 10 p.m., police said. Surveillance video showed two men getting out of a dark, shiny four-door sedan in front of the store. One goes to open the trunk. Then the two men are seen again, moving toward the car, the apparent victim between them. As they grab, pull and push him toward the car, he lurches backward for a moment, in an apparent effort to get away. But they renew their grip and wrestle him into the trunk headfirst. They close the trunk, get into the car and drive away. Police said additional surveillance video, taken earlier, showed the car driving alongside the victim. The victim appeared at the time to be speaking with the driver. In addition, witnesses said the victim and his apparent abductors had possibly been “play-fighting” before the incident. Descriptions of the possible abductors, provided by police, appeared sketchy. No motive in the incident could be learned, nor was information available about the people in the surveillance video. local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

(WKRN) – A Cheatham County man spent a mandatory 12 hours in jail for a crime he didn’t commit. It all began earlier this month when Charlie Green was charged with assaulting his soon-to-be ex-wife after she made a call to 911. In that call, Green’s estranged wife Kaitlyn told the dispatcher that he and his new girlfriend showed up unannounced. When asked if they physically attacked her, she responds by saying, “Yes, they did, my husband and his new girlfriend.” Deputies arrived to investigate, and the 26-year-old victim reportedly had marks on her arm and neck. After gathering statements from others at the home who claim they witnessed the attack, Green was arrested and spent 12 hours in jail. Charlie Green (Courtesy: Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office) Upon his release, the father-of-two pleaded his case to Sheriff Mike Breedlove, insisting he was innocent and that he had proof. That’s when the sheriff began investigating. “I hear that every day. There was something different about this gentleman. He was adamant and he practically begged, ‘Please look at the surveillance video,'” Breedlove told News 2. According to the sheriff, at the very time Green was allegedly assaulting his soon-to-be ex, he was actually at Walmart in Ashland City and there is surveillance video to prove it, as well as receipts with time-stamps. After leaving Walmart, Green went to a nearby laundromat. Kaitlyn Green (Courtesy: Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office) “Physically, there was no way,” Breedlove said. “He was at two different locations – businesses and had surveillance to back it all up. It was all a fabrication. It truly was an innocent man who had to sit 12 hours in jail.” Detectives then brought Kaitlyn Green and her witnesses in for questioning, which is when Breedlove determined they fabricated the story. News 2 spoke with Green on Monday and she told News 2 she did it to protect her two kids. “Whenever we split, he threatened to take my kids and I felt like if I could keep him away from me and keep him away from my children, he wouldn’t be able to hurt me or my kids,” she explained. She added she knows what she did was not the best plan of action and she said she won’t do it again. Green and her two friends have since been filed with filing a false report, while Charlie Green’s domestic violence charges were dropped. “I really appreciate all his hard work and what he did for me,” Charlie Green said.

The Royal Canadian Legion is notifying the public after receiving a report of fraudulent poppy sales. Legion member Chuck Kidd told the Herald they received word on Saturday (Oct. 29) that a person had been walking around the Walmart parking lot selling poppies. “Well you don’t sell poppies to begin with,” Kidd said. He said they are not sure who this person might be or if there are any other reports of this occurring. The poppies that uniformed members of the Legion distribute are available at tables set up outside Extra Foods, Save-On-Foods and Walmart. Poppies are also available at local businesses in town. While people are welcome to give a donation, they are not required to purchase a poppy. Kidd said they notified the RCMP of the alleged activity. RCMP Const. Tracy Dunsmore told the Herald it seems morally unethical to sell poppies, but isn’t sure that it’s technically a crime. “If they’re representing themselves as [Legion members] and they’re telling people that they’re giving the money to the Legion and they’re not then there’s a possible case of fraud,” Dunsmore said. “If you are buying a poppy ensure that the money is going towards the Legion,” she said. The Legion’s poppy fund campaign raised about $13,000 locally last year. The funds raised are used exclusively for veterans and dependents for their ongoing medical issues and needs.   This story was updated on Nov.1 to include comment from RCMP Const. Tracy Dunsmore, and additional comment from Kidd stating that the Legion is unaware of any other reports of this activity or who the person in question might be. featuredfraudnewspoppiesRoyal Canadian Legion Tweet Pin It Related Posts Police still investigating stolen ...

 Future of Payments: Four Trends to Know in Payment Processing Andrew Meola Oct. 31, 2016, 4:33 PM 2,840 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII The payments industry has been evolving rapidly, especially in the last few years with the growing shift to digital.  The global payments ecosystem is constantly changing as new startups try to change the way we move money around the world. Mobile wallets and the increased importance of card security to reduce fraud are some of the major trends that are shaping the future of payments processing. Below, we've compiled a list of these types of innovative payment processing that will mark the future of the payments industry, and provided examples of each. Four Trends in Payments Processing Mobile Wallets Mobile wallets could be the single biggest transformation in payments processing if they take off in the way that many analysts expect. Retailers are particularly excited about mobile payments because they can offer valuable insights about customer transactions that companies can use to enhance the shoppers' experience. The speed of mobile payments can also help increase foot traffic in stores, which in turn would generate more sales. In 2014, Apple was the only major mobile wallet on the market. But in 2015, Google and Samsung launched their own mobile wallets, and Walmart, Chase, and other major players joined the market. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, expects in-store mobile payment volume to grow from $75 billion in 2015 to $503 billion in 2020. Digital Remittance Migrants have been sending money to their families and friends in their home countries for decades, but the digital shift is making that process easier than ever. And while digital still just holds a small portion of the global remittance market, growth at digital startups is tremendous. In 2014, $583 billion were remitted across borders in 2014, and the World Bank expects that number to climb to $636 billion in 2017. BI Intelligence notes that digital accounted for 6% of all remittances in 2014. But digital's share is growing thanks to the work of startups. Xoom, founded in San Francisco in 2001, grew 53% between 2012 and 2013 and 30% between 2013 and 2014. It now makes more revenue from digital than legacy company MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. BII Payments Security The U.S. has a major problem with credit card fraud, which cost retailers $32 billion in 2014. To mitigate this, card networks strongly encouraged merchants to upgrade to EMV security, which is the standard in other parts of the world. EMV cards have an embedded microchip for extra security. In October 2015, fraud liability shifted to merchants from card issuers. And today, interest in EMV terminals is rising. Small business owners had been one of the most hesitant groups in terms of upgrading to EMV, but that has changed as of the third quarter of 2016. In Q3, more than half of all small businesses had upgraded, up from just 31% one year earlier. mPOS Mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) devices were extremely disruptive when they first debuted because they provided a sleek and easy way for all merchants to accept card payments. Today, consumers expect merchants everywhere to accept cards, so mPOS terminals have become even more important. BI Intelligence forecasts that there will be 27.7 million mPOS devices in circulation in the U.S. by 2021, up from just 3.2 million in 2014. Retailers will be the biggest group pushing the mPOS ecosystem to these new heights. Square, one of the more popular credit card processing companies in the U.S., is evidence of this. Large sellers (those who have more than $125,000 in annualized sales) represented 42%, or $5.25 billion, of Square's gross purchase volume in Q2 2016, up from just 8% in Q2 2011. More to Learn Mobile shopping trends are pointing to m-commerce as the wave of the future for shoppers. But mobile shopping is just one aspect of the broader payments ecosystem.

Legacy remittance firm MoneyGram announced “solid improvements to key financial metrics” in its Q3 2016 earnings report on Friday, noting growth across the board despite geopolitical and economic headwinds in key receive markets. However, the firm’s tempered growth points to an ongoing need for innovation if MoneyGram wants to remain competitive with peers and upstarts in the digital space. The firm’s transaction-based revenue continues to grow solidly, with a 5% constant currency increase in the quarter driven by non-US and US outbound transfer, which had the highest growth rate of any region. It’s likely the firm is looking to capitalize on high-growth areas, because MoneyGram just extended its partnership with Walmart in order to make it easier and cheaper for US customers to send funds to Mexico. That might drive more users to MoneyGram and increase volume, which could further accelerate the segment. But though digital growth continues to outpace the firm’s overall success, the segment continues to slip. This could put the firm behind on previously set goals. MoneyGram’s digital revenue grew 12% year-over-year (YoY), and now represents 13% of all money transfer revenue. This represents a continued slowing in the segment, which grew by 17% in the previous quarter and by 71% in Q3 2015 a year ago. MoneyGram noted that it’s a result of “grow-over” of its successful website re-launch. But the firm has been aiming to have 15-20% of its money transfer revenue derive from its digital segment by 2017, a goal that it seemed to be on track to meet but could be slipping on. MoneyGram digital will need significant innovation in order to lift the segment and stay competitive. Legacy peers are seeing strong digital growth, and at the same time, digital upstarts are increasing their offerings to become more competitive. MoneyGram is seeing some success with its site, which continues to drive new customers, but will have to continue to invest in high-growth areas, like it recently did with mobile improvements and third-party partnerships, in order to stay towards the top of the ecosystem. Every year, migrants send hundreds of billions of dollars worth of remittances back to friends and family in their home country. And there's a massive industry that facilitates these payments — and has for more than a century. The legacy remittance industry has been long dominated by cash, which requires physical locations where customers can hand over or pick up money. Building out those retail networks is a huge investment. It's left just a few players, called Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), controlling a bulk of the industry. But these companies' comfortable hold on the industry is now being challenged by digital remittance startups. Digital-first remittance companies are competing on fees and usability, and capitalizing on the way people's expectations have changed with the advent of digital and mobile channels. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on digital remittance that sizes the total remittance market, company-specific market share, digital's market share, and digital's growth at major remittance firms. It also assesses how disruptive digital startups have been by comparing their fees with market leaders, and by juxtaposing their business models with those of legacy companies. Here are some of the key takeaways: Digital's share of the global remittance industry is still fairly small at 6% — but growth is extremely fast at digital-first startups and legacy companies. Fourteen year-old Xoom makes more revenue from electronic channels than 75 year-old MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. Startups are undercutting incumbents' fees in certain corridors; however, legacy firms have matched prices in many major corridors. Legacy firms' businesses are already responding to the threats posed by digital by lowering fees and adjusting business strategies. However, they face lower margins if they continue to compete with startups on pricing. In full, the report: Sizes the remittance market and calculates major remittance companies' market share. Estimates digital's share of the market vs. cash. Quantifies digital's impact at remittance startups and legacy firms. Breaks down the business models employed by each type of remittance company, and determines which ones are in a better position for growth. Compares transfer fees in various corridors to assess the competitiveness of each firm. Explores other platforms that could completely upend the industry from the outside. Determines how legacy remittance companies will fare in the digital age – the answer may surprise you.

My intention is to inform the public about critical facts that are missing from the discussion about the taxation of the marijuana industry, and why they should view with skepticism the major claim of Proposition 205 proponents; namely, that the legalization will bring in additional tax revenue, particularly for schools. The marijuana industry in Arizona has failed to follow basic state law regarding the listing and reporting of their business personal property in Arizona. What is business personal property? Basically, every business owns personal property that they utilize to operate their business. This can range from basic things like computers, office furniture and storage racks to specialized equipment that a marijuana growing facility might use like grow boxes, air filtration systems, misting and drip systems, special lighting. These items all have value and must be reported to the county assessor in the county that they are located each year. The law requiring the listing and reporting of business personal property is a self-reporting, or “on-your-honor” system, which law-abiding businesses in this state comply with. Businesses as large as Intel, Discount Tire, Wal-Mart, and then on down to those smaller “mom and pop” business owners do their best to accurately and timely report business personal property to my office. In fact, there are nearly 10,000 separate business personal property accounts listed with the Maricopa County Assessor’s Office. Marijuana business owners, growers and dispensaries, on the other hand, have failed to file anything since they became legal to operate in 2012. By my best estimates, there are approximately 50 dispensaries in Maricopa County, and not a single one has complied with the law. Why does this matter? Because nearly 70 percent of taxes collected from the assessment of business personal property taxes goes to fund local education. This means that non-compliance by the marijuana industry in Arizona in listing their business personal property and their subsequent failure to pay any taxes whatsoever is impacting the education of our children. After the Great Recession, with leadership from Governor Ducey, Arizonans approved Proposition 123 to get over $1 billion in new funding to schools. Yet, at the same time state leaders are looking for ways to obtain more dollars for schools, the marijuana industry shirks their legal obligations to pay their fair share of taxes on the personal property used in the creation of a product still illegal under federal law. I hear talk by the marijuana industry that the passage of recreational marijuana will bring more tax dollars into Arizona, and also that the passage of Proposition 205 will legitimize what has previously been a black market business. My response is, how can we trust the marijuana industry, which will be, by law, comprised  of the same actors already in business, to act like legitimate business owners when they have evaded their responsibility to follow the law like everyone else? There is an old saying that bears repeating here: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.” Arizonans would be wise to remember this when they decide how they vote on Proposition 205. I, however, refuse to be made the fool by the marijuana industry and will vote “No” on November 8.

Sol Saguaro October 27, 2016 , 1:50 pm at 1:50 pm PS Paul Petersen is identified as a Republican politician by a Maricopa Co. GOP voters club: http://gop.scwclubs.com/candidates/. One wonders, does he or doesn’t he support Donald Trump, who hasn’t paid taxes — probably in AZ as elsewhere — for the last 18 years? One might expect a tax assessor to be consistently hard on these issues. Where’s Petersen’s renunciation of Trump? Nowhere. More hypocrisy. Dave K October 31, 2016 , 11:02 am at 11:02 am The crooks that support this prohibition are truly getting desperate and they care little about protecting people in Arizona. They ignore that many in Arizona already use marijuana and that our underground market is controlled by some of the most violent criminals in the hemisphere, the Mexican drug cartels. These folks do not ask for ID’s and they also make available fentanyl, cocaine, crystal meth, ecstasy, and black tar heroin to our kids. Call me crazy but it makes sense to me to have marijuana sold by legal retailers who do not sell other drugs and ask for ID’s. This is working to decrease underground sales in Colorado. While they fight marijuana that has never killed by overdose in all of human history they ignore the fact that more Arizonans die of opiate overdose deaths than die of traffic accidents. We need to focus our priorities on those substances that do kill Arizonans. “The elimination of the unregulated black market is often cited by legalization proponents as a benefit of creating a legal, commercial marijuana market. In Colorado and Washington, those black markets have persisted to an extent, frustrating regulators and providing fodder for legalization critics. The new report suggests, however, that the black market is being significantly reduced by legalization, and that those reductions will continue.” http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-colorado-marijuana-industry-20161031-story.html Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Radford Theatre is hosting the live-action Rocky Horror Picture Show Saturday night at 11:59 p.m. Rocky Horror Picture Show was filmed in 1975 , and is about two conservative newlyweds who get trapped in a house full of transgenders. It was supposedly the worst film of that time, so people made jokes about it, talked back to the movie, used props to throw at certain scenes (like rice at the wedding), and basically “interacted” with the characters. Since then, it has been a tradition to play late at night near Halloween weekend. Tickets are $8.50 and will include an audience participation kit. For more information, visit http://www.radfordtheatre.com/showtimes.html St. Albans Sanatorium is open Fridays and Saturdays for their “Haunted House: A Nightmare to Remember” program from 7:00 p.m. to midnight. Prices are $15 per person. Parking is free and there is as free shuttle service running from Matt Hogan Outdoors (located near Walmart). For more information, visit http://www.stalbansnightmare.com/tickets/ On Halloween night, the sanatorium is having a “Halloween Ghost Hunt.” Registration starts at 7:00 p.m. and the investigation is from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tickets are $50 each. For more information, visit http://stalbans-virginia.com/public-paranormal-investigations/ Catholic Campus Ministries (CCM) in Radford are having a “St. Jude’s Feast Day Festival” on Sunday from noon to 3:00 p.m. Games, activities, lunch, and live music are provided by CCM. This will take place at St. Jude Catholic Church on Tyler Road. More about this is on http://ru-ccm.wixsite.com/catholic/upcoming-events Downtown Radford is hosting the 2016 Radford Trick or Treat Trail and Harvestfest on Monday, October 31st from 3:30 – 6:30 p.m. Businesses participating will have a flyer in their window. Enjoy popcorn, games, and music for free. This is supported by the Radford Chamber of Commerce and the flyer is located at https://www.pinterest.com/pin/560276009877594152/ The Christiansburg Parks and Recreation Center is hosting a “Halloween Truck or Treat” on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Admission is free. During this, the center is hosting the 2016 Huckleberry Hustle 5K and 1 Mile Fun Run – “Getting Scary on the Huckleberry” from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. Awards are given to the most creative costumes (medals) as well as the top three winners of the race, winning $100, $50, and $25 respectively. Free breakfast is offered to the racers. The flyer for the two events is the picture above and can be found on http://www.christiansburg.org/DocumentCenter/View/6022 Sinkland Farms in Christiansburg will be open the last time this year for their pumpkin festival on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, they will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Tickets are $10 each for adults over 16 and $5 for children age two-16. The New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg is having a Trick or Treat event on Monday from 6-9 p.m. Go around to the stores and collect candy! The mall asks adults to not wear masks. If you want to stay in for the weekend but still want to be in the Halloween spirit, you can have a 24-hour horror movie marathon with friends or by yourself. Netflix has a wide variety of horror and thriller movies just for this sort of occasion such as Hush, Curse of Chucky, The Secrets of Emily Blair, The Ouija Experiment, and Hellraiser. There’s also a browsing option on Netflix for classic Halloween movies. This option includes movies that aren’t as scary, such as Hotel Transylvania 2 and Sharknado, movies that are scary, such as Hush and Hellboy, and some freaky TV series such as American Horror Story and Bates Motel. You can also stay with the spirit by reading ghost stories and/or horror fanfiction, and making some ghostly recipes like spider pizzas decorated with olives. Since Halloween is on a Monday night, you can simply stay in, study, and munch on all the candy you like. It is Halloween of course.               Posted by Alexis Gardner on Oct 31 2016.

ELIHU SPENCER 31 October 2016 Next Article 2016 SAMPLE BALLOT Typography Font Size Default Reading Mode In dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, I realized that it is times like these that you really appreciate all that we have as a community. I, for one, was amazed at how seemingly effortlessly we all evacuated and that we only encountered a few bumps as we all began to return home.  Communities are tested when a tragedy occurs, and Hilton Head Island, Bluffton, Beaufort County and the rest of the Lowcountry have been tested once again. And, once again, the full character of what we are came shining through. Notwithstanding our normal tendencies to cluster in our “tribes” or private gated communities, all of Hilton Head’s population has come together with the singular goal of getting our island back to normal. Since this is primarily a column dedicated to addressing issues surrounding business or the economy, let me examine how we can leverage the tragedy that was Matthew into something positive for our community. Hilton Head is truly a community of locally owned businesses. Once you get beyond the plethora of big corporation-owned grocery stores and banks, it is really difficult to find big chain stores. On the island, we’ll soon have even fewer big-box stores that, in some communities, have forced local businesses to close. I am actually thanking Wal-Mart for moving Sam’s Club to Bluffton. As we work to recover after Hurricane Matthew — an effort that is likely to take months or even years — it is important that we support our local business community. Obviously, Hilton Head Island’s economy is primarily driven by tourism and real estate, but its unique character is founded in places like Coligny Plaza, the traffi c circle-to-beach corridor and all the quirky shops scattered around the island. We even have a local hardware store, Grayco, and a local bank, CoastalStates Bank, and we might just be the only 40,000-population town in the county that can say that. While our families and homes were the first concern following Matthew, our local economy is a close and intertwined second.

Your participation and support of this effort is crucial in order for this initiative to succeed. Please say: YES count on me to be part of making the Lowcountry strong again. Sign at www.shopmorelocal.org   Local support for local businesses right now is particularly important because these companies can’t rely on visitors during this time of year. During this period of recovery, money is going to be spent on cleanup and rebuilding. Federal recovery aid and insurance payments are going to flow into our community, and this money will undoubtedly attract less-than-reputable roofers, builders, tree services and other contractors looking to make a fast buck. It is important to check to make sure whatever companies you use are insured and have secured a business license from the Town of Hilton Head Island. Even more importantly, consider the benefits of keeping these dollars local and hiring local companies. The benefits of “shopping local” — even for services such as roofing repair and tree removal — can’t be overstated. First, and foremost, these businesses are owned by our neighbors, and money spent locally stays local. Other reasons to shop local include assuring that local merchants continue to bring unique products and services to our community so we can avoid the need to travel to make purchases. We all, or at least most of us, are transplants to Hilton Head. We came to enjoy the robustness of this community — shopping, entertainment, incredible beaches — with most of the benefits of a larger city. This is just a reminder that after the experience of Hurricane Matthew, it is time to come together and support our neighbors as we go through the rebuilding process.

According to the police report, around midnight Jonathon Curry, 25 of Portage was driving along Sterling Creek Road, then Willowcreek Road at 5 mph, stopping every 20 feet. Curry finally pulled over in the entrance to Wal-Mart and was stopped by police. Curry allegedly told police he was playing “Pokemon Go” on his phone and had to simulate he was walking by driving slowly and stopping. The officer also detected an odor of marijuana coming from Curry’s car. Curry allegedly admitted he had smoked marijuana at his home before leaving home to play “Pokemon Go” and get some food at a local fast food restaurant. During the inventory of the vehicle, police also found an unlabeled prescription bottle containing four tablets of indomethacin, a prescription drug. Curry was transported to Porter County Jail after being taken to a local hospital for tests, and charged with possession of a legend drug and operating while intoxicated.

Updated October 31, 2016 9:14AM SHARE ALSO SEE Amazon Amazon Fresh Amazon Prime E-Commerce Mobile Commerce Grocery Delivery Jeff Bezos Amazon wants you to order your turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce online this Thanksgiving -- its latest effort to make its Prime subscription service a central part of food shopping, much the way it's done for other consumer goods. Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon -- which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 -- is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. Humble Beginnings Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program -- $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program -- started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." Ever-Expanding Prime Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. On Thursday, Amazon said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 percent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion. The third quarter is a seasonally light one compared to the bustling holiday quarter coming up. © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung October 31 Follow @b_fung (Barta IV) AT&T's recently announced deal to acquire Time Warner reflects massive changes in media and technology. Although regulators could challenge the acquisition or slap conditions on it that may limit how AT&T can use its new assets, the purchase hints at a future where a single company can monetize the same customer multiple times over, just through the customer's routine use of the Internet. Other Internet providers have made stabs at building this kind of business model. Verizon, for example, wants to do something similar with Yahoo and AOL. But if AT&T succeeds — and that's still a big if — it will be that much closer to turning its subscribers into virtual cash machines, going to them over and over to grow its revenue base. Here are a few ways that could work. Sell connectivity At its core, AT&T is a network company. Its main job until now has been to sell you access to communications, such as phone or Internet service. These services act as conduits to the information or media you can find once you're hooked as a subscriber. This business model is not going away. In fact, it is what allows all the other business models to follow. It is also the easiest to describe, because selling data plans is the most directly observable way in which AT&T makes money from consumers like you and me. Sell content  On top of selling you the network, companies such as AT&T increasingly want to sell you the content that travels over those networks — including shows like “Game of Thrones” or “Westworld.” Historically, these types of shows were only available on cable TV. But thanks to the Internet, accessing this content just becomes a matter of network capacity. And guess who does networks? AT&T. Because AT&T's merger with Time Warner could allow the telecom giant to control HBO's entire content catalogue, any money the premium channel makes could belong, ultimately, to AT&T. That includes the $15-a-month subscription fee that HBO charges for its Internet streaming app, HBO Now. HBO has been called the “crown jewel” of Time Warner, and AT&T knows it. Suppose you're an AT&T Wireless subscriber and you pay for HBO Now. In the wake of a successful merger with Time Warner, this would allow AT&T to double-dip into your wallet. Sell advertising This is the big one. Advertising, particularly of the targeted variety, forms the cornerstone of the entire Internet economy. And Internet providers want a big slice of it. To compete with other ad heavyweights like Google and Facebook, Internet providers need to collect and use behavioral data. That means analyzing your browsing history, your app usage history, your location history, your financial information and other data that can help build a picture of who you are as a consumer. And since your Internet provider is collecting a lot of this information anyway simply to provide the basic function of getting you where you want to go on the Internet, its perspective is, why not use that data for advertising? Armed with these insights, a company, such as AT&T, could approach a company, such as Walmart or Best Buy, and say, “I can reach this demographic for you. Do you want to advertise with us?” And if Walmart or Best Buy said yes, they could put their ads on any number of sites or channels owned by AT&T. As a result of the Time Warner merger, that could include platforms, such as TBS or CNN. Targeted ads promise to “feature prominently” and in some cases represent “the whole ball of wax” for telecom companies in the new digital economy, according to Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson. Things get even more intricate from here. Not only could the ads be targeted to a specific demographic, but thanks to a technique known as cross-screen advertising, a particular customer could see the same ad on their TVs that they do on their phones and their tablets. AT&T's tests show that cross-screen advertising can boost a company's sales by as much as 87 percent. If ads are about repeated messaging, this approach may be the purest — and most lucrative — form of it yet. Federal regulators voted last week to limit how Internet providers can use your data, in a victory for privacy advocates. Still, many consumers may voluntarily opt in to the advertising, particularly if they're offered financial incentives in exchange. Sell your data A company, such as AT&T, could put your data to work for its own advertising business. But it could also benefit by sharing your data with marketing firms and other third parties who can use that information themselves. Data brokers who traffic in behavioral insights are often invisible to the average consumer, but what they know about you can affect your choices, such as the types of credit you're offered. A network company with deep insights on its subscribers could sell the data to a third party. All of these different business models entail monetizing different aspects of the customer relationship. Under the right circumstances, a telecom company could theoretically use a customer as a cash machine by: 1. Selling her a mobile data plan 2. Convincing her to pay for premium content on top of that plan 3. Watching how the customer engages with that content 4. Showing them ads tailored to her engagement 5. Selling that engagement data to third parties That doesn't even begin to contemplate any potential cross-promotions or special bundles of content and service designed to lure even more customers into the ecosystem. Nor does it go into possible licensing deals with other businesses that could allow, for example, AT&T to charge other firms for the use of DC Comics' intellectual property, such as Batman or Superman. The upshot is that by melding content and distribution, telecom and cable companies likely envision a whole constellation of business models that may form the foundation for a new digital economy, one that orbits largely around them. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Answer Man: Dogs OK in grocery stores? Osborne light tweak? John Boyle , jboyle@citizen-times.com 1:10 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 Service dogs are allowed in grocery stores, but most establishments don't allow dogs otherwise. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Today’s batch of burning questions, my smart-aleck answers and the real deal: Question: I want to know if dogs are legally allowed inside grocery stores? Yes, I’m sure they are allowed if they are service dogs. But, increasingly, I see pets sitting in the cart riding through the store. I even saw someone with a spider monkey in Walmart — gross! I have a dog. I love my dog. But I don’t want his nasty butt sitting on or near my food. If dogs who are not service dogs are not supposed to be in grocery stores, what action can I take to stop it? My answer: Go to the pet food aisle and create a trail of dog bones leading out of the store. Clarification: this might not work with the spider monkey. Real answer: I'm looking for this issue to get more and more contentious, as America's love affair with its pampered pets only seems to get deeper every year. At Ingles Markets, which operates about 200 stores in six Southeastern states, Chief Financial Officer Ron Freeman said they do indeed allow service animals inside stores. "We do ask customers with service animals to keep them out of shopping carts and to be considerate of other customers," Freeman said. "Our store managers are always available to help if issues arise." Bringing Fido the non-service dog in to help pick out the brisket is not so cool, though, even though the law leaves some wiggle room. "When we inspect facilities within a grocery store, we look at the permitted area space (example: area behind the deli, meat market, etc.)," said Jessica Silver, environmental health director for Buncombe County Health & Human Services. "No animals are allowed in those spaces. We do not regulate the open area of the grocery store." Even though the state doesn't ban animals from non-food-handling areas, most businesses that handle food have a policy about dogs, and most are not going to allow non-service animals inside for the reason above. So, if you're having an issue at a store, speak up. "I’d recommend someone who’d want to stop this practice to make a complaint with the store manager or the North Carolina Department of Agriculture," Silver said. The North Carolina Food Code states "live animals may not be allowed on the premises of a food establishment, except under several exceptions." Those exceptions include patrol dogs accompanying police or security officers in offices and dining, sales, and storage areas; sentry dogs in outside fenced areas, and service animals accompanying persons with disabilities in areas that are not used for food preparation. In part, the statute states the animals in these exceptions are allowed as long as the owner does not permit them to physically contact food, serving dishes, utensils, tableware, linens, unwrapped single-service and single-use articles or other food service items that may result in contamination of food or food-contact surfaces. They also can't be in physical contact with employees engaged in food preparation or handling. Dogs and cats are allowed in outdoor dining areas, provided that the animals are physically restrained and do not pass through any indoor areas of the food establishment. The code also notes that nothing in the law prevents food establishments from prohibiting non-service dogs and cats in outdoor dining areas or other areas. Question: Why is the green light on Osborne Road at Merrimon active for such a short time period? The light stays green only long enough for three, sometimes four, cars to pass through before it turns red. I realize that there isn’t a lot of traffic on that road, but most times during the day there are usually about a half-dozen cars at the intersection. I have noticed several times that drivers will ignore the changed light and speed through the red light. My answer: I've seen so many cars run red lights in this town that I'm pretty sure people actually have crossed the Rubicon and now assume "red means go." The only solution is to exclusively drive a tank. Real answer: "We have reviewed the operation of this intersection and determined that the traffic signal is functioning properly," said Anna G. Henderson, traffic engineer with the North Carolina Department of Transportations' Asheville office. "However, there may be times when too much space is left between vehicles, which causes the signal to change before all drivers have had a chance to proceed. As a result, we have programmed the traffic signal to stay green longer during vehicle gaps to help Osborne Road drivers get through the signal each cycle." This is the opinion of John Boyle.

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Route 50 Plan Changes Sought To ‘Make The Corridor More Commercially Viable’ Oct 27,2016 by Charlene Sharpe SNOW HILL – An update of the county’s commercial design standards and Route 50 corridor plan could help increase development along the well-traveled highway into Ocean City. Since February, a committee of county officials, planning professionals and area business people has been working on revisions to the county’s design guidelines and Route 50 corridor plan. The changes are meant to bring the documents, which were created in the 1990s, up to date and at the same time resolve any problems identified with them in recent years. “The corridor plan addresses the county’s identified most intense commercial development territory and as such, the commissioners have appointed a diverse group of individuals tasked with making timely recommendations that will make the corridor more commercially viable,” said Merry Mears, the county’s director of economic development. The committee, formally known as the Design Guidelines and Route 50 Corridor Plan Task Force, has been meeting monthly to go through the documents and make improvements to them. Ed Tudor, the county’s director of development review and permitting, says the original guidelines and corridor plan were written before the Walmart was built on Route 50. “Things have changed,” he said. The guidelines address commercial development in the area and the corridor plan outlines requirements for the service road that will eventually link properties between Holly Grove Road and Seahawk Road. “The goal is to review those items and make them more user friendly while still achieving the overall objectives of both,” said Mark Cropper, a local attorney and member of the group. As they come from different backgrounds, task force members have shared a variety of viewpoints on the documents and what they mean for different parties. In a meeting last week, task force member John Peters, who works for the Cordish Company, said increased requirements equated to higher costs for developers. “The cost of developing those pad sites [near Walmart] is becoming astronomically high,” he said. Another member of the task force, Steve Engel of Vista Design, voiced concerns about buffers and parking requirements. Others discussed inter parcel connectors and access points. Cropper, who routinely represents developers, believes the group’s meetings have resulted in significant improvements to the corridor plan. “I believe it will make developing along that corridor more attractive for those that in the past have had unpleasant experiences trying to do so,” he said. “This at least is a signal to developers that we’re open for business.” Mears agrees. “Worcester County is now in the position to grow this area substantially, and it must be done responsibly, with significant input from the business community,” she said. “I’m encouraged by the cohesiveness of the members involved, and I look forward to the outcomes of our work.” The group’s revisions are expected to be complete next month. The changes will then be sent on the Worcester County Commissioners for their approval. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Charlene Sharpe Charlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

But depending on your age, there are better investment options than others. I recently wrote a piece discussing a few of my favorite Exchange Traded Funds geared for all investors. Now I am working through different age groups and pointing out some of my favorite ETF's that are more focused on each age group based on where investors are in their life cycle and their interests. A month ago I published a piece geared toward 20-year-olds, and today we are going to focus on ETF options that fit better for those in their 30's. By the time you turn 30, a few things have or will soon likely happen in your life. You will have begun progressing in your career, you are making more money than when you were in your early 20's, you may be a home owner or planning to become one, you either have started a family or again have plans to do so, and lastly maintaining your health. With those three things in mind, I have found a few ETF's that play into those life changes. The first is the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (PACF:RTH). I have spoken about RTH before; it's one of my favorite ETF's regardless of age, but I think it fits well in a 30-year-olds portfolio. When you're in that age bracket, you most likely have a higher income. Therefore you can spend a little more money on material things, and you don’t likely live with mom and dad anymore. You may even own a home or at the very least want your place to look and feel more adult-ish. When I last spoke about RTH, it was in a piece on how to play the housing boom. RTH owns a lot of retail stocks that benefit from new home construction or just people moving in general. Whether it’s a purchase or just changing locations, when you move into a new place most likely you are going to buy some new stuff; new shelves, rugs, towels, furniture, who knows. But what we do know is places like Amazon.com, Target, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowes, Costco Wholesale, sell that kind of "adult" stuff. But, RTH isn't just a play on housing, it’s a play on you buying stuff in general, remember higher income through progressing with your career. RTH holds retail companies that whether or not you know it, you probably shop at on a weekly basis. Furthermore, buying shares of RTH now, and then regularly over the coming years will help you build a solid position in companies that you will probably be shopping for the next 40-50 years. (I know that sounds like a long time when you're only 30 something.) So start owning a little piece of those places you spend your hard earned money now and maybe it won't hurt so much when you do overspend at those places. The next ETF is the PowerShares Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF (PACF:PEJ). This ETF owns a group of stocks that fall under the leisure and entertainment industries. Regardless of whether you have or haven't started a family, you are always doing something new, these companies that garner the bulk of your disposable income. Whether it's general travel, restaurants, and bars, amusement parks, or even casino's, just to name a few, PEJ focuses on four things when picking stocks to hold; the strength of a company's fundamentals is the company relevant to current times, valuation metrics, and its risk level. PEJ typically holds around 30 stocks that and has an expense ratio of 0.61%, a little high, but is good for those 30-year-olds who travel a lot and have an adventurous lifestyle. By sector PEJ is broken down as 31% airlines, 26% restaurants and bars, 10% hotels and cruise lines, 8% casinos and 8% leisure & recreation. PEJ has been around since 2005 and is currently yielding 0.53% while boasting an 11.7 average price to earnings ratio for the stocks it holds. And lastly, for those 30-year-olds that want to keep that 20-year-old body, The Health and Fitness ETF (BATS:FITS.IV) focuses on companies that are geared toward healthy, fit lifestyles. FITS is an investment play in the healthy fitness related shift we are seeing take place in the world today. It currently holds 74 stocks with some of the top holdings consisting of Adidas AG, Nike, Foot Locker, Under Armour, Lululemon, and Dick's Sporting Goods. Despite FITS inception date of June of 2016 and currently only having net assets of just $2.57 million, with more American's getting active and a larger push toward healthy living, FITS investors could see significant returns over the next few decades. The fund also boasts a yield of 0.73%, which will cover the expense ratio of 0.5%. Furthermore for those 30-year-olds with little one playing sports, owning small pieces of Nike, Adidas, and even Dick's Sporting Goods may make it easier when you spend money on the growing array of activities your kids are involved with. While the list above is not a full combination of what a 30-year-olds portfolio should look like, these ETF's should help get you started or make excellent additions to your current holdings. Perhaps you're not a 20 or 30-year-old; no problem check back soon to find out what ETF's fit your age group.

Now fair pay must become the norm Gavin Kelly From Ikea to BrewDog, Britain’s good employers see workers as a resource to be invested in, not a disposable commodity. The rest must follow suit ‘When Ikea decided to embrace the real living wage, it did so as part of a wider commitment to hours-security and workforce training.’ Photograph: Kumar Sriskandan/Alamy Monday 31 October 2016 11.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 31 October 2016 14.54 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Today’s announcement of this year’s increase in the living wage – to £9.75 an hour in London (previously £9.40) and £8.45 in the rest of the UK (£8.25) – will help the growing numbers benefiting from the fair pay benchmark. For a full-time worker it amounts to earning an extra £5,000 a year in the capital, and nearly £2,500 elsewhere, compared with a person on the government’s legal wage-floor (£7.20). That’s a big, life-changing difference. I’m paying my staff a real living wage – not George Osborne’s version | Martin Whitlock Read more It’s a difference, though, that has been partially obscured, not least in the eyes of the media, by the recent rebranding of the minimum wage – reincarnated as the “national living wage”. Many assumed that the ensuing terminological muddle would result in the demise of the voluntary (real) living wage, in a case of death by imitation. Well, it hasn’t worked out that way. The number of living wage employers has doubled since George Osborne first announced his revamping of the minimum wage. That’s a tribute to the employers and campaigners involved. But we need to keep this success in perspective: 6 million workers get paid less than the benchmark. Why, though, are ever more companies signing up? Polls of employers reveal a mix of motives. For some, committing to the living wage is a symbolic act that helps make good on standard corporate mantras about the workforce being a prized asset. Others highlight the desire to aim higher than merely avoiding breaking the law. And, of course, many are simply attracted by the reputational halo-effect that surrounds the living wage. All are welcome. Yet something else is going on too. For a growing number of employers it is the start of a wider shift in their business model: away from viewing workers as a cheap and disposable commodity, and towards one which sees them as a resource that needs to be invested in. An unlikely example is the rethink underway at Walmart, the most iconic low-paying employer in the US. Its management eventually came to realise that acting on declining sales, dirty stores and disappearing customers required a motivated workforce. Pay levels were raised from rock-bottom, training boosted and predictability of working hours increased. It’s still early days, but customer satisfaction and sales have both risen too. It’s a tale with echoes in the UK. When Ikea decided to embrace the real living wage – resulting in a pay-rise for thousands of workers – it did so as part of a wider commitment to hours-security and workforce training. Likewise when the small but rapidly growing craft brewery BrewDog took the same step, not only did two-thirds of the staff get a pay rise but zero-hour contracts were ditched as well. The result? Staff turnover plummeted and employee satisfaction has soared. The scale of the change that some employers are embarking upon, together with the living wage’s greater coverage, brings with it new responsibility. Now, more than ever, it needs to be – and be seen to be – a robust and credible benchmark. That’s why the Living Wage Commission, created to oversee the rates, has reviewed the underlying methodology and the data on which it relies. Its view is that the benchmark must, above all else, tell employers and employees the minimum that needs to be paid if households are typically to reach an acceptable, if modest, standard of living. The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not This means it must be rooted in an assessment of the cost of living as determined by the price of a basket of goods and services that the public itself deems to be essential. Consequently the contrasting methodologies that hitherto set the living wage rates in London and the rest of the UK have been aligned. When the price of this basket goes up, upward pressure on the living wage results. The corollary is that the living wage won’t be driven by other factors that people may be concerned about, such as wider trends in earnings or inequality. These technical but vital improvements occur at a time when the living wage campaign faces new challenges and opportunities. Over the coming year a spike in inflation, expected slower growth and Brexit uncertainty may make potential employers more cautious. Yet to dwell on the problems is to misjudge the moment. A diverse set of factors – concern over the “left behind” following the Brexit vote; a surge in unease about conditions at work following the Sports Direct scandal; the stunning success of the Fight for $15 movement across America; and, just possibly, the change in personnel in No 10 – suggest the campaign for fair pay may be moving with the tide. This isn’t vain hope. Whether it’s the bold decision of the Scottish government to pay all care workers the living wage, or that by the London mayor to expedite its coverage to all Transport for London’s sub-contractors, there is undoubtedly momentum. Across England a new generation of city mayors are about to be elected on a hazy if heartfelt agenda of “shared growth”. They, too, will need to be champions of fair pay. The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not. Building an economy that works for all requires reinforcing change on all manner of things from the welfare state to the fiscal stance. But policy alone won’t suffice. We also need to create a shared civic norm about what constitutes decent pay in the 21st century. On this, progress is being made.

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Comments (246) Lonnie Philpott says: November 26, 2014 at 6:29 am Not much different at UPS. Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage. Terry Lamb Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 1:53 pm I think this author has been smoking something! Here it is, MLK day and the USPS just 2 packages at my front door. I get excellent delivery service no matter how they ship my order so go boycott all you want! [Reply] Numnutz2005 Reply: February 22nd, 2015 at 6:23 pm Thats imposible dude….usps delivers NO packages on MLK day so if your going to lie at least make sense. Their holiday schedule is posted on their site too. [Reply] Mike Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 4:13 pm I work for USPS. We worked MLK day. Amazon packages go 365 except christmas and thanksgiving. Whether we deliver mail or not that day, Amazon goes. Paul Reply: October 12th, 2015 at 10:34 am its Columbus day, my carrier just made a delivery from amazon, spoke with carrier, she told they are required to deliver all amazon packages, my regular mail was not delivered today William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:36 pm Speak for yourself Mike. I can’t get a package delivered by the Post Office. I think it is mainly because my carrier is too lazy or too stupid to do his job. I NEVER use the Post Office to mail a package. Some of them couldn’t pour piss out of a boot. [Reply] Jo Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 8:10 pm You don’t know what you are talking about, William Doores. Calling a carrier lazy or stupid…? Grow up a-hole… sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:49 pm This idiot William Doores needs to go to work at USPS and see what it is all about☺ Noah Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 5:07 pm My thing is if I wanted to go out and get something I purchased on amazon I would’ve just gone to the store. What I see is packages going straight to the post office for pickup so I can sign for them here as if I couldn’t do that if the mail man brought it here anyway. [Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option. I told my Postal manager that 2 Amazon Prime packages were not delivered. He just laughed! [Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K. Miehl Reply: December 19th, 2015 at 1:13 am I have lost 2 packeages for my Christmas orders within 2 weeks !!!! This has never happened to me before, with Amazon using UPS for delivery. This is Frustrating and Unbelieveable !!!! >:( [Reply] Vinny d Reply: February 12th, 2016 at 4:17 pm Placed order on Amazon. Product coming from Vegas to Connecticut USPS said delivery Febuary 11. Was sent feb 8. Just got email it’s in California. I’m dropping Amazon [Reply] Dr. Clark says: November 26, 2014 at 6:34 am I’ve noticed a few other things. Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!! THIS WHOLE COMMENT SECTION SOUNDS LIKE MY TWO 5TH GRADERS Steven Palmer Reply: December 5th, 2015 at 7:36 pm Just purchased 2 separate items. I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me. [Reply] Dennis Rogers says: November 26, 2014 at 9:10 am Amazon prime is slow delivering some packages such as book up to a week and a half, I recently recieved an email thanking me for purchasing a program on amazon fire tv which I did not want when I tried to cancel the order I was informed it would cost $35.00 for something I did not order. Amazon and I do not do business at this time. [Reply] John Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 11:10 pm This the worse service I’ve ever had ordering from anyone. I order some compression shirts which I didn’t know coming from Korea , still in route two weeks later and was told I have 31 more days to wait. when ask for my refund I told when I get my stuff back you get your money back. which I’m sure will take 2 more months are longer. Make sure you read delivery date. Not shipping date. [Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change. [Reply] Ben Ther says: November 26, 2014 at 10:35 am I applaud Amazon for going with USPS. I am much more likely to purchase more from them because of it. And returns that you have to pay for is totally reimbursed. You’re not out anything. This is one area that could use some tweaking. It is aggravating to have to return something at your own expense but you don’t lose out in the end. Get over it, Floyd Brown. What this really is is right wing propaganda. I prefer USPS over any other shipper. [Reply] D Reply: December 12th, 2014 at 3:37 pm That doesnt work for everyone and some areas, including mine, have a terrible USPS system and no matter what I do, nothing changes. When Amazon shipped with UPS, everything was FINE. Now the problems are starting…Having to go to pick up my packages at the local PO. Missing packages that say delivered but end up being, you guessed it, at the local PO, etc…Never once did I have a problem with UPS. It has nothing to do with “right wing”. Whatever that is supposed to mean. [Reply] William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:40 pm I’ve had the same problem. Post Office sucks! [Reply] Vera C Reply: July 16th, 2015 at 8:40 pm YUP this has happened to my boyfriend. He ordered from Amazon and paid extra for next day shipping. The tracking showed delivered but there’s NOTHING. It also happened when my friend bought me a hardrive through Amazon with expedited shipping and tracking showed that it was delivered but there was absolutely NOTHING in my mailbox nor anything at front door, porch, ANYWHERE! ! And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AROUND AND DIDN’T ACTUALLY CHECK ALL YOU DID WAS WALK IN AND RIGHT BACK OUT OF THE DOORS!! … no manager was available to complain to. .. USPS F***ING SUCKS! ! AND IS ALWAYS LOSING PACKAGES! !! ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS IS ALWAYS on time and I’d any delays.. you would know. .. customers are always able to know where their packages are with UPS. … I’M SO SICK OF LOSING PACKAGES THAT ARE BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON!! It almost seems like a scam. Especially when you have paid extra for expedited shipping! And suddenly never receive it but tracking shows delivered! ! Soooo shady!! [Reply] NotRightWing Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 10:10 am Why would this be “right wing propoganda” and why do you prefer USPS get the business? THAT sounds like liberal ideology to me. Allow me to clarify.. The US Post Office is NOT a government agency. they are quasi govermental. That means they skirt federal taxes (oops, liberals should be groaning). UPS and FedEx pay enormous amounts of federal taxes (yay!). So please help me understand your glee over an inferior service handling packages? [Reply] Ron Reply: July 12th, 2015 at 5:02 pm I’m a liberal and I despise USPS. I’ve already complained to Amazon about the decline in service since they dumped UPS and switched to USPS. Postal carriers are the worst. FedEx and UPS employees are far better and give far better service. And it has nothing to do with political ideology. Remember, the postal service was “privatized” years ago.

I am disabled and cannot get to the mailbox every day. I used to enjoy getting everything delivered to my front door. Now I have to deal with a crammed mailbox and trips to the post office to collect packages that cannot fit in the mailbox. I have been a huge customer of Amazon Prime since it was initiated but if these USPS deliveries continue, I will be canceling it. [Reply] MARK says: November 26, 2014 at 10:53 am My experience is that if it doesn’t fit in the mailbox, it’s either rubber-banned to the front of it, or left on the doorstep.

[Reply] joel says: November 26, 2014 at 11:22 am Another problem with Amazon is that there is always a minimum $4 shipping charge (and state tax). You can usually get the same item on Ebay for basically the same price with no shipping charges and tax free. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:22 pm it’s not tax free just because you weren’t charged tax when you bought it. your state still charges you that tax, they just count on you to pay it yourself. which you’re not doing. you’re not getting it tax free, you’re dodging taxes. [Reply] Rand A. Martin says: November 26, 2014 at 12:16 pm I have been employed at the USPS since 1974. I always leave packages at the door. The only exception is inclement weather (I leave my personal cell number so a customer can call me for a re-delivery the next day) or someone has requested that the package not be left. If you want your packages left at the door, simply go to USPS.com and request that the carrier leave the package. Now that isn’t so hard, is it? [Reply] Kit Reply: December 20th, 2014 at 3:46 pm Rand you can suck it. The post office does not follow instructions. They should go out of business. [Reply] Windy Reply: December 23rd, 2014 at 9:12 pm My mom and dad both work at the post office. My delivery man rams my Amazon packages into my mail box, and I have extreme difficulty getting them out. The door is also left wide open because the package is hanging out four inches or more. I can send you a picture of this. It infuriates my mom who takes the extra time to put a package on the front porch (which I have). My mail man is lazy. Yes, we have reported him twice, and he still does not care. [Reply] Jeff Reply: March 23rd, 2015 at 7:18 am I’ve gone to my local post office a number of times — to request that my letter carrier manage to deliver my packages and other mail to me, instead of my neighbors. I’d also prefer that my neighbors’ mail not end up in my mailbox. Lately I’ve come to think of myself as an unpaid USPS employee, who has taken on the job of re-delivering packages mis-delivered by my carrier. This, despite having mailbox at my curb with two-inch-high letters with my street number. UPS messes up, too, just not as often. [Reply] Hon Kevin Madison Reply: April 11th, 2015 at 4:00 pm Rand, we are not complaining about PROFESSIONAL POSTAL CARRIERS (1 in a 10), the lazy carriers and contract carriers who just stuff the attempted delivery slip in our mailboxes and don’t even attempt a delivery to our residence!! It is maddening. Our previous carrier was AWESOME and he was so frustrated with USPS he quit after a decade of working for USPS. It must be maddening absolutely maddening for good carriers like you to have your reputations tarnished by the lazy idiotic carriers who don’t care. God Bless You! [Reply] Frederic Hilnbrand says: November 26, 2014 at 1:35 pm I have never had a problem getting my orders from Amazon. EVER!! The last package that was ordered last 11/18/14 arrived on 11/23/14. Their prices can not be beat by Wal-Mart or anyone else. So as far as I am concerned I have NO problems and usually my shipping is free. I do not see a reason not to continue to do business with them. Maybe what you are ordering is something that they do not stock and has to come from someone else. If and when I have a problem then at that time I will contact them and see what they do. [Reply] Luke says: November 26, 2014 at 4:03 pm Fantastic. UPS has one of the worst services. On Monday I ordered a product from Amazon at around 1:00pm. I was expecting a two-day delivery (I’m a Prime customer). Guess what? The package came next day at around 5:00pm. Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:38 pm Hey Postman, how can I get my mailman to deliver? My Amazon Prime membership now gets me Delivery notices that show delivered but no package. Then if I go to the USPS site it says left at mailbox, which is on a main state highway. The new carrier I have can’t even close the door on the mailbox let alone bring something to my porch like the old carrier did. [Reply] Windy Reply: December 23rd, 2014 at 9:14 pm My post man does the same thing!! He is so lazy. He stuffs a package in my mail box that I have difficulty removing. The door will also not close because the package is too big and sticks four inches or more out. I have reported him twice with no luck. [Reply] Jonathan says: November 26, 2014 at 6:55 pm What is your source for Amazon dropping UPS? I too received a package from Amazon prime via UPS. A light weight package too 2.5lbs. [Reply] Poloko says: November 26, 2014 at 8:18 pm I have been more than thrilled with the service USPS provides with my parcels ordered on Amazon. Never had to make a trip to the post office and most packages arrive within 2 days. My Amazon orders have increased 100% since USPS began delivering them. If your packages go back to the dead letter room at the post office then you have a problem with your post office not USPS as a whole. [Reply] William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:45 pm I think many of the positive responses are being made by Post Office employees. Some of them just out and out lie like saying the package was delivered when it was not. It’s no wonder they are going broke. Good riddance. By the way, don’t tell me to call their supervisor, they don’t answer their phone. [Reply] Robert Pierce says: November 26, 2014 at 9:31 pm My amazon packages shipped via USPS were at my door next to others that came UPS. Overall I’ve had more issues with fed-ex and UPS shipments than USPS. I also recall UPS and Fed-ex failing amazon last Christmas while USPS met the demand. [Reply] Constitutionalist says: November 27, 2014 at 5:04 am I was happy to see this article and that somebody else loathes what Amazon has done. I used Amazon frequently and have been shopping elsewhere now as the delivery time, with their free shipping and use of the USPS, deliveries are usually about 8 days now to my rural address. With UPS, it was 4 to 5 days which is ok to me. [Reply] jen jen says: November 27, 2014 at 6:45 am I boycotted Amazon because they support the big government Democratic party. [Reply] kenneth says: November 27, 2014 at 7:04 am I not sure what is going on with the usps in your city, but the usps is has been delivering most of my amazon purchase for a while now.

This is great news for me that the bulk of shipping will be carried out by usps. [Reply] Tom says: November 27, 2014 at 9:55 am Mr. Brown: sounds like your typical USPS hating republican.

[Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things. Since 2006, the Post Office has been legally required to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees at a cost of around $5.5 billion a year. The only business or branch of the government forced to do this. And none of the is taxpayer money. [Reply] Chas Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 2:40 pm Going with USPS major mistake, at least in my area. Prime 2 day takes 3 to 5 days using USPS. I’ve had a number of packages that “track your package” says it will be delivered by such and such day by 8pm, no way USPS delivers that late. Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door. If it won’t fit in the mailbox, it goes back to the post office. I am disabled and cannot get to the mailbox every day. Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint. Annette, it may be different from your experience however, please do a few Google searches and it will become clear to you that this is a problem for thousands of us. Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer. [Reply] Jesse says: November 28, 2014 at 9:15 am I loved amazon, but now it seems like every order comes from USPS. I have never not had a bad experience with USPS. Unless they stop sending it with them and go back to the old way I will not continue my subscription and just get off my lazy butt and go pick the stuff up at the stores. [Reply] Jan says: November 28, 2014 at 9:21 am I haven’t had much trouble with Amazon, I get my kindle e books from them. Never a problem. Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS.

Pete [Reply] Denny says: December 4, 2014 at 10:17 pm I completely agreed. Just had 154 dollars refunded because the post office marked the items as delivered and I never got them. I decided not to purchase the items again and hit the stores. They are not only going to lose money but also customers. [Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost.

Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all. I guess i’ll have to pay the extra for overnight in hopes to get it in 3 days or so! [Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.). It gets messed up if you do it before the item arrives at your local post office. UPS and FedEx accounts provide similar features. It doesn’t cost anything to sign up. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 6:19 pm Amazon makes the USPS deliver rain or shine even when the front porch is not covered enough to keep parcels out of the rain. Amazon parcels are not brought back. [Reply] FlyEagleVA says: December 10, 2014 at 2:08 am Been a Prime subscriber for around five years. Can’t remember when something wasn’t delivered as promised. Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised. [Reply] jason says: December 10, 2014 at 2:28 pm I agree. Ever since they dropped UPS. I’ve had UPS come into my apartment and hand deliver me my package now I have to wait outside in the friggen cold to get my parcel which is ridiculous I’m a disabled person and this is irritating… [Reply] Melissa Craig says: December 12, 2014 at 8:20 am I don’t know why you are having a big issue, My mail carrier delivers directly to my door and gives me packages, and delivers on Sunday during the holiday. We love both our UPS and USPS carriers deliver well. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:46 pm Wish mine did. The old carrier was awesome, this new one is sooo lazy. He can’t even close the doors on the mailboxes. [Reply] Chris says: December 12, 2014 at 9:17 pm “Dead letter room”??? You don’t know much about the post office do you? I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late. And we deliver them on Sundays and holidays. And I have only seen one amazon package that required a signature. [Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area. Don’t like my packages being stolen from my front steps, but marked as delivered on the web site. [Reply] samiup says: December 16, 2014 at 5:05 pm I have noticed a difference. and it is a significant one. USPS delivered my package at 3pm,-when i was at work- the notice they left did not say much, no re-delivery attempt… i went to their website in order to ask for re-delivery, USPS web site was not working as i could not pick up a date from the calendar tool after filling up a long form… Then i said, OK maybe ill just pick it up, their office closes at 4:00 pm… WOW! now what should i do now? take a half day off from work to go to USPS everything i order from Amazon? pretty pathetic. Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile.

[Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

I used to order and then go to my UPS Online account to have my packages held for pickup. Now since they use the US Mail., I have had 5 packages turn up missing. This is horrible. After my amazon prime membership ends this year I am done with Amazon. Also size of package is not the issue. I have ordered……. 1 Sony PS4 bundle with 3 games. It came in a large box via US Mail… [Reply] Chris H Reply: February 14th, 2015 at 9:00 pm I too have had way too many issues with USPS in our area.

[Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

[Reply] So...When Will Amazon Start with USPS... says: January 21, 2015 at 8:23 pm I just ordered a 1.4 ounce package from across the U.S. and Amazon shipped it via UPS Ground. *facepalm* So I’d like to know when Amazon will start capitalizing on this USPS relationship? [Reply] Anthony D says: January 23, 2015 at 1:39 am I live in an apartment building in NYC. USPS can enter the apartment complex and happily leaves all packages next to my mailbox without asking, if they do not fit inside.

I live in Columbia SC where there is a warehouse. Some of my packages, now that the USPS is involved, leave the Columbia warehouse, are shipped to Concord and then back to Columbia to me. What sense does that make? USPS is the worse and I for one, hope they become obsolete altogether. [Reply] Tricia says: February 6, 2015 at 7:04 am I have my Amazon packages delivered to my employer’s street address because UPS cannot get into my building at home. Unfortunately for me, my employer also has a P.O. box so now that USPS is being used, instead of delivering to the street address they mark all my packages as delivered and put them in the P.O. box room and isn’t physically delivered to me until the third day. Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS. However Amazon tricks you into thinking you are paying $100 for prime getting free 2 day shipping, while the truth is that Amazon is actually only shipping it normal mail or slower. They get away with it because they have so many warehouses everywhere. But it is false advertising.

[Reply] LW says: February 18, 2015 at 8:49 pm USPS is certainly NOT better than UPS for me. The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers.

I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered. She had been fired they said and it looked like the packages were going to be taken home. No way to know how many end up in dumpsters or worse. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear.

I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

[Reply] Jon Heibeck says: April 4, 2015 at 7:35 pm I just figured this out (yea, I’m slow). I canceled my Prime membership and submitted an email to Amazon stating I will no longer buy anything through their company. I’m even blocking Amazon from my search results. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:10 pm sorry, I doubt Amazon cares about you. Bezos is beholden to his shareholders, not to you. It’s always hilarious to see capitalists complaining about capitalism though! You have a nice day now. [Reply] Justin H says: April 5, 2015 at 4:24 pm Honestly, my experience with USPS shipping through Amazon has been mostly positive. There have been a few times I had to wait an extra day because I wasn’t home when the package arrived. But mostly I just have things shipped to my office – which is open 7 days a week. To be honest, I feel that Amazon’s deal with the USPS has added value to my Prime membership. Sure they might have kinks to workout, but I think it’s a good thing in the long and short run. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:15 pm I’ve noticed many fewer products are being allowed to go to Amazon Lockers, at least in my case. I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter. It’s hilarious to see them complaining about, well, capitalist practices! Carry on cappies! [Reply] Robert says: April 11, 2015 at 4:08 am I used to buy everything at Amazon. I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office. Once they made that notation, I have not had any further issues with the 2 day shipping. Nothing is taken to the Post Office anymore. I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

[Reply] Shay says: April 17, 2015 at 3:02 pm Well, I have been ordering from Amazon lately as my company as a reward program and I get gift cards for free for Amazon. Everytime I have order, UPS delivers my packages and they have always been early. They will just leave them on my doorstep, or sometimes they will deliver in the evenings when I am home, so I accept them in person. My local UPS driver is polite, friendly, and is always on time. I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

Put the orange slip in your mail box a few days before you expect your package to arrive and put up the flag.This way you will never get a re-delivery slip and your package will be EXACTLY WHERE you want it and on the correct delivery date. I hope this helps… [Reply] Hari says: April 29, 2015 at 10:11 am There are always some caveats to a deal. I have been using Amazon for almost a couple of years now and all of a sudden I saw them delivering on Sundays, which took me by surprise. There are a couple of times when I thought it would be delivered to my door step but it ended up in my mail box but I have made it a part of my routine to check my mail box. My experience has been a little different, as they still left the bigger boxes outside my door step. Atleast the good part is that Amazon has joined hands with a sinking business and hope this helps USPS employees from losing their jobs. [Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue. But more and more they are using USPS. Bad move amazon. There’s a reason why nobody uses them. Shouldn’t your partnerships be strong ones? This is a step backwards and a bad business move. [Reply] phototristan says: May 6, 2015 at 1:28 am USPS consistently forgets to deliver Amazon packages and never even leaves a notice. I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments! I recommend everyone reading complain to Amazon about USPS’s terrible service. This is the only way they can begin to realize how bad USPS is. [Reply] R says: May 7, 2015 at 5:42 am Amazon has betrayed one of their core customer bases with this move. Amazon has been a lifeline for those of us in rural areas, but the Postal Service leaves packages OUT ON TOP OF OUR RURAL MAIL BOX, and a few times, on the ground in torrents of rain, so most of the time, it’s either destroyed or stolen. So after all these years of depending on their wonderful service, we have no choice but to stop using them entirely. Shame on Amazon for not giving a rat’s rear about this. [Reply] Shannon says: May 29, 2015 at 3:48 pm I have Amazon Prime and LOVE it. USPS used to deliver my Prime Pantry, but it’s gone back to UPS and FedEx. Frankly, USPS did a better job, my LaCroix mineral water cans exploded with each delivery on UPS, none with USPS. Our mailman always brought those big heavy boxes to my front door and rang the bell, and would often wait to see me open the door from the curb to wave as he left. I now get deliveries on Sundays as well. No more trips to Walmart or Target for dry and household goods, pet food and MORE! [Reply] Judy says: June 1, 2015 at 10:35 am So I ordered something on Thursday, and the package was to be delivered on Friday (overnight delivery). My package was scanned to Brooklyn, NY 11214 where I leave on Friday morning, and then was sent to NY, NY 10014, then NY, NY 10199 and than to Brooklyn, NY 11256 (this all happened between Friday and Sunday), finally this morning my package was scanned at Brooklyn, NY 11214 my area code and I am still waiting for delivery. I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment. Gave me a $5 credit toward a future purchase, and then extended my membership by one month. Highly disappointed in their decision to make a deal with USPS because they are notorious for not delivering mail timely if at all. Disgusted with the way my package was handled.

Dead Letter pile if you’re not home?! Nonsense! USPS unlike UPS will decipher if it’s safe to leave your package, where we should leave it, who with, and if we are unable, we will leave a notice. We will not just cram it in to your mailbox. We will not just toss it on the porch leaving it in front of God and everybody… Say do you own stock in UPS?!

I live in a development where my USPS mail comes to a group of mailboxes. If and only if the item won’t fit in the mail box will USPS deliver to my door. Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing. No we WON’T deliver to your house. When my prime expires, I won’t be renewing. Amazon has lost my business. [Reply] Tim Scott says: June 16, 2015 at 3:39 pm USPS has entirely stopped delivering parcels to my townhouse. Instead, they place “Attempted Delivery” cards at our mail house. BS!

[Reply] bruce says: June 29, 2015 at 8:16 pm I am a Rural Carrier for USPS and UPS and FED_EX leave parcels at the mailbox because they are too lazy to bring them up the steeper driveways. I always bring them up and leave by front door or garage. Maybe instead of calling your carriers idiots or other names offer them a cold water and ask them to leave the parcels by your door. If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is! [Reply] jamie says: June 29, 2015 at 9:30 pm I am a letter carrier in a small town. Half of the Amazon packages we deliver are straight off the UPS truck. I asked the driver why and he said residential deliveries arent worth our time. That is the company you want delivering your packages? Also, in my town we deliver straight to your door, no matter how small or large the package. We deliver 100 percent of the Amazon packages everyday in my town. The writer of this article has no knowledge of how the post office works. Dead letter room. The dumbest thing I have ever heard. Do some research. USPS: Cheapest and most reliable. [Reply] matt Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 5:16 pm Thank you for beating me to this!!! I love how he writes the post office couldn’t survive without Amazon.

It is also one of the most reliable companies in the world. [Reply] Nikki says: July 2, 2015 at 5:53 pm My UPS and Fed Ex deliveries are delivered right to the door always. The Post Office hangs everything in a sack swinging off my rural mailbox out on the road. It is over a city block away from my house and they leave stuff there in a plastic bag in the pouring rain or whatever. I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you. I ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered on Sunday, 10/25/2015. Well, it never made it, but that is par for the course when the USPS is involved. So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS. Imagine that, delivered to WRONG address, the the USPS drivers ASKS ME if I received it ok. Hey – who is the delivery person here, anyway?!

[Reply] Sammy says: November 29, 2015 at 9:44 pm I used to love Amazon. I have purchased over 800 orders from them over the last 10 years. USPS is so terrible. I have had numerous packages lost this year. I got 100% refunds, but it is such a pain now that I would prefer to have guaranteed commercial shipper NOT USPS. [Reply] Samuel says: December 2, 2015 at 2:24 pm Sorry to hear about your deliveries… I’m a carrier at USPS and I deliver all my packages day-of. And if they aren’t home I will text the customer and ask if it’s ok to leave with a neighbor or on their back porch. I notice the new help we hired really seems to bring back a lot of packages and mark them “dog.” Umm, bro, they don’t have a dog… [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:48 pm OK So I go to the Amazon Website, Purposely pay more for an item because it says if you want it tomorrow order within the next 3 hours and pick next day delivery. Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…? I’ve been told of delivery attempts that never happened as you don’t come near my house without my dogs barking. USPS has tried to stick me with Postage Due… Bad Move, Amazon. [Reply] Me says: December 5, 2015 at 11:28 pm This year every freaking UPS package has had issue and been delayed. They got re-scanned and delayed one business day when they showed out for delivery at 6am (NW Houston) all my USPS packages have been early or on time. Every now and then they put small packages in my mailbox. Most the time they drop them at my front door ring or knock at the door. Not sure why you guys are having issues with USPS but it’s services has been better than UPS for me. [Reply] Me Reply: December 7th, 2015 at 10:57 pm UPS just delayed again out for delivery. I was home all day working, they never showed up and went back to the center again. No reason listed, just delayed. UPS is crap. [Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time. [Reply] JW says: December 12, 2015 at 6:02 pm This situation is also very bad for me as the USPS does not deliver to my address. This is what I see when I try to track a package from Amazon that gets transferred to USPS. But the address isn’t incorrect. The USPS just doesn’t deliver to it. UPS and FedEx deliver to it though. 9:05 AM Undeliverable – Incorrect Address Elgin, TX, US 7:04 AM Package arrived at a carrier facility Elgin, TX 6:23 AM Package has been transferred to the USPS and will be delivered by your local postal office Elgin, TX 2:43 AM Shipment departed from Amazon facility San Antonio, TX, US [Reply] Greg A says: December 23, 2015 at 3:19 pm I live in West metro Atlanta and since they started using the USPS more, I’m ordering A LOT less from Amazon! Our postal delivery in my area is nearly third-world level. Horrible drivers and delivery people. It’s common for stuff to be delivered very late (5:30pm+) if you’re lucky – on some days, my street gets no mail delivery at all. I for sure am NOT going to be renewing my Prime membership. [Reply] Mark says: December 25, 2015 at 10:49 pm UPS is the worst company and their employees that work in the hubs have worked Sundays for years and been away from their families for years because of the Amazon volume which UPS handles less than adequately both in delivery and the treatment of packages. The best thing for Amazon would be to leave UPS for good! [Reply] Puddy says: December 26, 2015 at 4:32 pm I have stopped using Amazon. I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon. [Reply] Tristan says: January 13, 2016 at 9:20 am Then why has my package sat for over 24hr with no progress on weekdays? [Reply] Stephen Matrese says: January 14, 2016 at 3:14 pm I am disabled and use online shopping frequently. Amazon has cancelled my (and several family member) account(s) today because I dared to report EVERY package that wasn’t delivered (I have observed a 25% on-time delivery rate with USPS and a 80% ever eventually receive it rate from Amazon).

[Reply] Jill Parkins says: January 18, 2016 at 9:26 am I ordered from Amazon and it was to be delivered by USPS yesterday. I got a text from Amazon saying that delivery was attempted and the receptacle was blocked and the carrier left a notice. I was home and the receptacle was not blocked and there was no notice. My daughter was watching out the window for a friend at the time they claim to have attempted delivery. They never came. Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day. I have never had an item lost or damaged by USPS be it shipping or receiving. Cant say the same thing about UPS. [Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Lucas Jackson/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of We've written about the 'pink tax' before. It's that pesky additional charge companies add on to products or services when they're made for women instead of men -- think the extra few dollars women's shampoo and razors cost when compared to the same brand's versions for men.  You might think the easiest solution to this problem is just to use men's razors and deodorant, but it's not always that simple. Personally, I'm loyal to a few pink/feminine labeled products, and I refuse to make the switch! I love the scent of Herbal Essences 'Be Happy' shampoo, and the Gillette Venus razor just works for me. After spending two years extreme couponing through college and watching sale prices like a hawk, I finally mastered a strategic shopping plan that allows me to get the best deals on personal care items while still remaining loyal to the brands and products I like. Here are my four best ways to save on personal care items that carry the pink tax. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Buy in bulk. If you happen to find your favorite products at  Costco or similar warehouse clubs, you can save a lot of time and money buying in bulk. Purchasing an industrial bottle of shampoo decreases the per ounce cost, and a year's supply of razor cartridges are not only convenient to have on hand, but also are usually paired with a few razor handles. I also like to shop at online retailers such as  Boxed, which doesn't require a annual membership, but still offers prices competitive with the warehouse clubs.

As the holiday season approaches, you'll start to see more and more seasonal gift sets for sale at stores like Target and Walmart. For example, bath and body gift sets at Target go on sale for 50 percent off right before Christmas (down from $9.99-15), and they usually have other promotions happening that can be stacked with this sale. Make sure you check both their  Cartwheel offers and their  coupon page to get the best deal. Take advantage of Amazon's  Subscribe & Save first order discounts. Amazon's Subscribe & Save program enables shoppers to schedule regular deliveries of the household products they need, like toilet paper, dish soap or toothpaste. It's a nice service when used normally, but there's a way to hack the system that can save you big time on these products, month after month. This hack works throughout the year, and is great for items you need on a monthly basis. Here's the deal: Amazon frequently offers a coupon for a set dollar amount or percent off and free shipping on your first Subscribe & Save order. This is in addition to the 5 percent discount you'll already get for subscribing. Let's say you've got your eye on the  Gillette Venus Spa women's razor, which costs $8 at Walmart and comes with two cartridges, so it should last you around two months. If you buy it on Amazon Subscribe & Save and use the $3 off coupon for first-time users (which they offer almost monthly), you can get it shipped to your door for as low as $3! Cancel your subscription after your first delivery, and you automatically qualify for the same first order discount in the future! I've bought razors using this trick three times this year, and have ended up getting them for as low as $1.50/cartridge plus a fresh new handle every time. Sign up for store loyalty programs. My favorite game to play is what I like to call 'the drugstore game' at Walgreens. They offer two reward programs, a points-based program and register rewards. Both programs reward you for buying products throughout the store (including name brands) and give you a set dollar amount in the form of points to use on a future purchase. I often see these rewards on items such as Kotex and Playtex tampons, which are charged a nine percent "luxury" tax in 39 of the 50 states according to a recent article on  Retail TouchPoints. I don't know about you, but I find nothing luxurious about buying a $7 box of tampons every month. About every three months, I see a sale price overlapping with coupons and one of their reward programs, and when this happens I can score a box of my preferred brand of tampons for as low as $0.49! I recommend trying to never pay more than $2 for the 16-count boxes or $3 for the 32-count boxes.

When consumers began online shopping in 1994, most of them could hardly imagine that offline stores might disappear. Online shopping was a mere subsidiary to offline stores, selling only a few items then. However, the volume of e-commerce has grown explosively over the past 20 years, blurring boundaries between online and offline. A sense of crisis in the retail business is different from the past. Mobile platforms dominate more than 40 percent of e-commerce sales, being the key to online-to-offline (O2O) commerce. Amazon, the world's top e-commerce firm, has twice as many customers than offline No. 1 Walmart which has over 6,000 stores worldwide. In Korea, the sales of online markets between January and August this year hit 42 trillion won ($37 billion), rising 21 percent year-on-year, according to Statistic Korea (KOSTAT). If the current growth rate continues, its sales this year will reach 65 trillion won, about 5 percent of Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) for the year. This figure surpasses Korea On-Line Shopping Association's (KOLSA) early estimate of 60 trillion won. In 2001, the same figure was 3.3 trillion won. On the other hand, the growth of offline retail, conducted at department stores and discount chains, has been slow since 2013. Although saturating offline stores and governmental regulations on retail giants are some of the causes for the slump, a more important reason is the rapid growth of the online market. A virtual reality Nike shop located in Hyundai Department Store, Pangyo. /Courtesy of Hyundai Department Store Retail giants stepping into online To survive this trend, retail giants, the main concern of which are offline stores, began to expand their online platforms, as their offline channels have been left behind by fast growing e-commerce firms, such as Gmarket and Coupang. Korea's largest retailers ― Shinsegae, Hyundai and Lotte ― have been focusing on the O2O business platforms which combine online markets with their existing retail networks. They have adopted the latest technology with their O2O businesses. Shinsegae Department Store released a mobile application "SHOP@" in February, promoting it as a "department store to be enjoyed by the eyes." This application offers a panorama of the department store and shows dressed images of models, as well as photos of products which have been commonly offered by online shopping malls, including its own "SSG.com." Unlike other e-commerce applications, SHOP@ customers can feel like they are in the store, because photos of products are taken as they are displayed at the offline store. More than 400 brands at Shinsegae Department Store are displayed by the application, as Shinsegae employees have taken pictures of the products and directly uploaded them to the application. Hyundai Department Store opened a virtual reality (VR) men's wear store at the Jungdong store, Gyeonggi Province, Oct. 9. Customers can look around the department store and see mannequins dressed in whole outfits by accessing Hyundai's online shopping mall "thehyundai.com" and following the arrows on the screen. If customers want to visit a certain brand shop, they just need to click the door icon and check details of the products at the VR store. Hyundai opened VR stores of Nike and Adidas at its Pangyo store, Gyeonggi Province, on a trial basis in July. The stores offered a full 360-degree view of the offline stores providing simple information of products. Hyundai Department Store plans to offer a 360-degree view of each product and to open a full VR department store by 2019. A Hyundai Department Store official said, "Our department store will provide different experiences, shifting offline stores to online." Lotte Department Store introduced a 3D foot scanner in July. The Swedish-made scanner measures a customer's foot size and analyzes conditions of the customer's foot. Shoemakers can recommend and make the most suitable shoes for the customer. More than 1,800 customers had their feet scanned and over 800 ordered shoes as of September. Once their feet are scanned, customers can use the data at both online and offline stores. "Our department store has a 3D virtual fitting room and foot scanner, as examples of our new omni-channel service which connects online and offline," a Lotte Department Store official said. "We will develop mobile applications for our customers to buy clothes and shoes with their smart phones." Fighting fire with fire Although retail giants are expanding their online platforms, they are also finding ways to attract customers to their offline stores. Those giants are developing offline stores through experience which is hardly achieved in online markets. Heads of retail giants have recently stressed the importance of experience, targeting customers who seek to spend their leisure time shopping. "Shopping malls with experience are the future of offline stores," said Hyundai Department Store CEO Kim Young-tae during the press conference at the opening ceremony of Hyundai City Outlet Dongdaemun in March. "Online shopping malls only display the products, but offline stores enable customers to touch and enjoy the products during their shopping." Shinsegae Group Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin said, "Customers want to gain both products and value, staying longer at a place where they have a reason to visit," at the opening ceremony of Starfield Hanam in September. Lotte Mart CEO Kim Jong-in emphasized last year that discount chains should provide customers with new lifestyle experience. He said Lotte Mart will find an answer from "a space" which online malls lack. The latest technologies enable customers to experience offline stores without actually being there. Shinsegae Starfield Hanam attracts customers with "VR Fitness" at Sports Monster. Customers can enjoy scientific digitally-based exercises, such as VR fitness and bike-racing, at the recreational space. "Sports Monster and Aqua Field are advanced concept entertainment spaces that Starfield Hanam has been preparing for a long time," a Shinsegae official said. "We expect those spaces to become new attractions, providing our customers with differentiated value through various exercises and experiences which they have never seen." Lotte Department Store introduced the "Smart Shopper" service at its grocery stores at the Bundang store on Oct. 4. Customers can go shopping with barcode scanners and they do not have to push their shopping carts. If they scan items with their "Shopper" scanners, products are automatically added to their virtual cart. Customers can check added products on "Order Viewer" screens installed at several places in the store and can remove unnecessary items at automatic counters. Purchased items can be delivered to their home. Smart Shopper enables customers to check the actual products at offline stores, while resolving inconveniences of carrying them home. Duty free shops aim to provide experiences for customers with technology as well. HDC Shilla Duty Free plans to make an IT converged duty free shop, if its bid to open a new duty free shop will be successful. A state-of-the-art duty free shop with merged reality (MR), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies is the company's goal. The duty free shop plans to show hologram images, installing media walls and digital signage in the lobby. Examples in other countries Meanwhile, retail giants abroad have already gone through similar changes amid the crisis of offline stores. In 2014, British retailer Tesco unveiled its VR store which enables customers to look around the virtual store and purchase goods from there. The U.S. retailers Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom introduced smart mirrors for virtual dressing last year. The North Face stores in the U.S. have provided extreme VR experiences to attract customers to offline stores. If customers select clothes and wear VR devices, they can virtually wear selected clothes and experience extreme sports, such as jumping off a 128-meter cliff in the Grand Canyon. jaehyuk@ktimes.com 1. 160,000 Koreans in US illegally to face deportation under Trump presidency 2.

No need fo rthis with Skinny Tan Spray tan firm InnovaDerma (LON:IDP) was glowing again as it confirmed a move into the US and a swing into profit over the past twelve months. Skinny Tan, a lotion to ‘colour skin and reduce the visual appearance of cellulite’, will be stocked by NYSE-listed GNC in 655 of its 6,000 stores nationwide. Online US retailers Quidsi, a part of Amazon, and Jet.com, a subsidiary of Wal-Mart, will both also stock the product. Joseph Panetta previously with Left of Center and Swatch has also been appointed to head up the US business. Overseas expansion paid off last year, as sales into the UK through Superdrug and Korea via leading largest beauty store chain Olive Young saw Skinny Tan revenues rocket. Revenues in the year to June rose to A$8.4mln (A$1.05mln) while Innovaderma posted a profit of A$0.47mln (loss of A$ 0.7mln). Haris Chaudhry, executive chairman, said trading had continued to be strong since the end of the year with further brand extensions to be announced shortly. “New product development remains a key focus for us and we will be rolling out brand extensions, together with new products, for international markets this year and next.  "We are trading profitably and the Board looks to the future with confidence and optimism."   Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Philip Whiterow Register here to be notified of future IDP Company articles View full IDP profile Related Articles Sphere Medical expected to land distribution partner in 2016 February 25 2016 The company's nominated adviser said a partnership deal should be signed by the end of 2016 Faron sees healthy appetite for City fundraiser September 20 2016 The absence of a discount suggests there is a healthy appetite for the equity.

Some people call trade agreements essential, while others insist they put the U.S. at a disadvantage. What the country seems most focused on now, during the races for president and U.S. Senate, is the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership – it would link 12 Pacific-rim nations. But decades ago, NAFTA - the North American Free Trade Agreement was all the rage. WUWM reports on how some Milwaukeeans describe NAFTA’s impact here. Both Democrats and Republicans approved NAFTA; it took effect in 1994. Its primary goal was to allow the easy sale of goods between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, by eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers. Michael Rosen says you don’t have to travel far to understand NAFTA’s impact on southeastern Wisconsin. Rosen teaches economics at Milwaukee Area Technical College. “I see AO Smith abandoned and I see America Motors now a Walmart and I see Allis Chalmers now a shopping center and I see countless factories on the 30th Street corridor that are abandoned, weeds are growing. What I see is the fact that this state has lost much of its industrial base and the working people in this community, have lost the jobs that both made Milwaukee a vibrant, powerful city and that gave them a good standard of living,” Rosen says. And Rosen says that reality has impacted African Americans here the most. “African American workers were disproportionately employed in manufacturing in the Milwaukee area,” Rosen says. Still, Rosen says it’s too simple an explanation to say that NAFTA alone has caused Milwaukeeans to lose jobs and wages. What has also happened - technology has improved, global trade has grown and other countries have become more competitive. Robert Gardner is president of M.E.Dey Company Incorporated. It works with local firms that trade goods across North America. “The whole idea behind NAFTA is being able to maintain the profitability of the manufacturer here,” Gardner says. Gardner says it makes no sense for some plants to do production work here because costs are too high. “They have to find competitive means to stay afloat,”Chakrabarti says That’s Avik Chakrabarti, a professor of economics at UW-Milwaukee. He says many consumers choose low-priced products from other countries. “If consumers were to buy goods made in Milwaukee, made in the United States, then this problem would be less severe. But with a large section of our consumption coming from foreign goods, our companies don’t have a choice,” Chakrabarti says. Chakrabarti says just as with most things, there have been local winners and losers under NAFTA. Wisconsin exports have increased, including agricultural products and construction machinery. According to the Business Roundtable, a Washington D.C.-based group that advocates for business-friendly policies, Wisconsin’s exports to Canada and Mexico have jumped by $8.2 billion since the start of NAFTA. Robert Kraig says many workers here have taken the hit. He’s is executive director of the group Citizen Action Wisconsin.  “If you’re looking at manufacturing, there has, in fact, been a net loss. For the whole state, it’s around 130,000,” Kraig says. One statement many candidates have made to Wisconsin voters this campaign – if the country does engage in trade deals, they must benefit workers here. The Business Roundtable estimates that in 2014, in Wisconsin, nearly 900,000 jobs were directly or indirectly tied to trade.

Coren October 31, 2016 I hear you know something about technology. (Lucas Jackson / Reuters) Share Written by Michael J. Coren October 31, 2016 Last year, Sean Gourley got an email from an acquaintance: Would he be interested in joining the board of a $30-billion oil and gas company? The 36-year-old had never sat on a public board before, and had no particular knowledge of the industry. He had just left his first company, the data analytics firm Quid, and his second was still taking shape. Still, the physics PhD flew from San Francisco to Houston to interview, and, in September 2015, took a seat on the board of Anadarko Petroleum. “They wanted someone with a familiarity of data analysis and a more quantitative approach,” Gourley tells Quartz. “So much of business has become very data-driven. … A lot of [companies] are smart enough to realize they need that knowledge.” Tech-savvy 30 and 40-somethings have become prized in boardrooms because they have something the S&P 500 desperately needs: insight into how companies can exploit digital technology. Software and internet-driven change is transforming most industries, and the bosses at America’s biggest corporations, for whom the average age is about 57, have struggled to keep up. Fresh faces are rare on corporate boards. The average S&P 500 board member is 63.1, about two years older than a decade ago, reports SpencerStuart, an executive recruiting firm. That’s made corporate leadership is increasingly out of step with the business landscape around them, said Susan Stautberg, CEO of WomenCorporateDirectors. In the 2000s, “people began to see the impact and the cost of falling behind on technology,” she tells Quartz, and the search for tech-focused directors began. The boardroom search for young tech talent took off after Clara Shih took a spot on Starbuck’s board in 2011. The then 29-year-old engineer had started her own social-media startup after rising through the ranks of Silicon Valley’s top companies, and Starbucks needed help as Facebook and Twitter gained influence. Now, major companies have hired a wave of tech-oriented directors under the age of 50, reports SpencerStuart and BoardEx. Company Age Name Current Job Wal-Mart 31 Kevin Y. Systrom CEO and Co-Founder of Instagram Scripps Networks Interactive 34 Wesley W. Scripps founder of Forlio Designs Starbucks 34 Clara Shih CEO of Hearsay Social Anadarko Petroleum 36 Sean Gourley CEO of Primer Nike 42 Michelle A. Peluso CEO of Gilt PayPal Holdings 42 Wences Casares CEO & founder of Xapo NIKE 42 Michelle A. Peluso CEO of Gilt PayPal 42 Wences Casares CEO of Capo Michael Kors 43 Jane Thompson Former SVP of match.com Bank of New York Mellon 44 John M. Hinshaw EVP operations at Hewlett-Packard The rush to appoint board members with accounting experience after the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act offers some parallels. Since 2003, the number of S&P 500 boards with a financial expert has risen from 21% to 100%. Technology board members decades younger than their colleagues may become the norm. Companies’ wish list for the next generation of board members reads like a mirror image of today’s business environment, SpencerStuart found, with technology expertise second only to finance. Bringing a new generation—especially one known for its rejection of traditional business hierarchy—into the boardrooms of America’s old-line corporations has its difficulties Gourley arrived at Anadarko with a deft touch for big data. He wanted to apply Silicon Valley’s analytical approach to a 57-year old company that specializes in drilling and shipping natural gas. Learning about a sector that his new colleagues had worked in for decades was “one of the hardest things I’ve had to do,” said Gourley. “Everyone else is a whole lot older than me, you could say they are definitely from another generation,” he said. “But they also have a large amount of experience that I don’t have. I’m very conscious of that.” Gourley’s primary role is to look at how the company can apply new data analytics tools. “When the time comes, they expect you to know what’s what, and push back about what you’re doing with this technology,” said Gourley. “You need to be able to call bullshit when needed, and share your experience.” To be effective, he’s had to break down barriers to get better information by talking with employees intimidated by his role. “The way people of my generation do management, it’s comparatively very, very flat and informal compared to a lot more formal management at these other companies,” said Gourley. But the education has been a two-way street, and Gourley has seen many things Silicon Valley firms could learn from more staid corporations. The knowledge of financial instruments, capital markets, global logistics for massive projects, and negotiating with governments were among the most important. “Silicon Valley wishes it could do all that,” he said. “We are very, very naive at some level with our usage of those tools.” Companies may be tempted to simply recruit a director from a flashy technology company, and call the problem solved. That would be a mistake, says consulting firm McKinsey. “For one thing, there aren’t enough of them to go around,” the firm reports. More importantly, digital knowledge and experience “must go beyond one or two tech-savvy people.” And that’s where corporations really need to improve. Only 5% of public boards in the US have a designated technology committee, while Fortune 100 companies aren’t much better at 15%. Short of having a full committee, companies can’t risk not having tech expertise at the board level.“I would say that it will be very rare in five years time not to have someone like this on the board of a major American company,” said Gourley. A broader cultural shift is farther off, though. “Before I got there, they told me, ‘This final bit you may not like, but you’re going have to wear a suit and tie. We’re a little old-fashioned,'” said Gourley, who broke out his suit for the first time since arriving in Silicon Valley several years earlier. On arriving at the first meeting, dressed as advised, board members were surprised. “‘What are you doing wearing a suit?’ they asked me,” said Gourley. “‘We thought you’d give us a chance a to loosen up.” Though he still wears a suit to meetings, Gourley said he’s “working on changing this one.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

While there is more to Christmas than gifts, no one wants to look in their children’s eyes and say Santa Claus won’t be visiting this year. Many organizations step up each year to try to help low-income families provide gifts for their children.  One of the most well-known is the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve’s Toys for Tot’s program. The program began in 1947 by Major Bill Hendricks USMCR in Los Angeles and has grown to a nationwide program.  Locally, Toys for Tots has operated for 17 years and is coordinated by Robin Clark, who also manages the Clearfield Ministerium’s Food Pantry. Clark said the Clearfield County Toys for Tots program serves the entire county.  It is important to make sure children know they matter because “they are our future,” she said. Last year, more than 1,500 local children received gifts through Toys for Tots.  Clark said they expect the number to grow and have already been receiving applications through the Web site since August. She explained they try to give each child at least four gifts as well as crafts, stocking stuffers, candy canes and more, and one group that has been helping is the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Woodland. But more help is needed.  Clark said while Toys for Tots serves children from birth to age 13, they really have a need for toys for children between the ages of 7 – 13 years, especially the 7- to 8-year-olds. Local merchants throughout the county have donation boxes for new toys, and organizations are holding toy drives to help out. One thing that really makes a difference is monetary donations, and Clark said any amount helps.  All of the money is sent to Quantico, Va., and then placed in a special account specifically for Clearfield County and the money donated for Clearfield County is used specifically for local children. Those interested in making a donation can send it to the office located at Trinity United Methodist Church, 121 S. Second St., Clearfield in care of Robin Clark. Another need is for volunteers to help between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21.  She said they need volunteers for every aspect of the program, from sorting toys, to packing them, to handing them out. You can contact Clark at 814-765-1672 or 814-577-8778 for information, or stop by the church to talk with her. What if you’re a family that needs some help this year?  Clark said applications are already being taken online.  Visit toysfortots.org, and click on “Find Your Local Toys for Tots Program.”  Select your state, and then location (Clearfield), which takes you to the local page. There you can sign up, make a donation or even volunteer your business to be a drop-off site.  Phone applications will start Nov. 1 and that information will be posted on the site, or you can contact Clark at the phone numbers listed above. To fill out an application, you will need your child’s social security number or medical card and you will need their birth dates, as well.  The applications submitted online go straight to Clark. “We couldn’t do it without the Marines and volunteers,” Clark noted.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah More Utah students may get access to breakfast in the classroom By Wendy LeonardDeseret News@wendyleonards Published: Oct. 30, 2016 7:25 p.m. Updated: Oct. 30, 2016 10:28 p.m. 9 Comments SALT LAKE CITY — More than half of the kids getting free or reduced-price lunch at Utah schools are forgoing breakfast — at least the one their schools are offering at no extra charge. Low participation rates in breakfast served at schools is something the state has struggled with for a while, ranking dead last among other states in recent years. And it isn't because the kids aren't hungry. "The expectation to get kids to school early when parents are trying to fit that into an already hectic schedule is hard to overcome," said Marti Woolford, with Utahns Against Hunger. The group has been advocating for serving breakfast in the classroom, where all kids have access to it without the stigma of "being poor," she said, or having to get to school early to partake. Six of 21 elementary schools in the Salt Lake City School District are already serving breakfast in the classroom. It makes a visible difference in the attitudes of students. "There is a much more calm atmosphere in the mornings," said Katie Kapusta, a supervisor over child nutrition for the district. "Everybody is more calm and ready to learn after eating." After getting staff and teachers on board, because more time and effort is required of them, Kapusta said, fewer students have been late to class and there may be academic benefits as well. Nationally, students who are served breakfast at school have fewer disciplinary problems throughout the day, show improved test scores, require fewer nurses visits, among other positive outcomes. In the short time Salt Lake City has been executing breakfast in the classroom, Kapusta said the main benefit has been that "kids are ready to start the day and ready to learn" after eating. The program can only be offered at schools where 75 to 80 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, because the federal government reimburses the cost for those lunches, providing a little leeway for breakfast. And to be effective, research has found that breakfast has to be made available to all kids in a classroom setting, instead of singling out only those who are eligible, which also ratchets up the cost. Utah was recently selected as one of 10 states where eligible districts can apply for funding to help get the program off the ground at their schools. Partners for Breakfast in the Classroom, a consortium of national education and nutrition organizations, will provide grants to some 45 schools throughout Utah, where finances may have been keeping expansion of school breakfast programs from happening, or where breakfast served before school in the cafeteria isn't reaching all the kids who need it. The group will distribute $7.5 million from the Walmart Foundation to applicants across the nation. Partners will work with state affiliates and change how school breakfast is delivered by offering it to all students at no charge and moving it from the cafeteria to the classroom. At Backman Elementary School in Salt Lake City, students begin their school days in the cafeteria, where they can select from available options, all of which meets nutritional requirements for a healthy breakfast. Kapusta said students choose from fruits, whole grains and a selection of low-fat milk options. They take their selections to their classrooms and eat at their desks. Some teachers conduct activities or read announcements during that time to make the best use of it, she said. Everything is prepackaged for food safety and easier cleanup. Grants from Partners for Breakfast in the Classroom have already helped 36 school districts in 18 states feed more than 63,000 additional students a school breakfast. The group believes improving participation in school breakfast programs will boost learning and health among children. "A nutritious breakfast sets the stage for a great day, so students are not starting off hungry and can retain what they are taught," said Heidi Matthews, president at the Utah Education Association. She said a lot of Utah students could benefit. Utah School Employees Association President Jerad Reay said breakfast in the classroom has been proven to increase attendance and decrease tardiness. There are also fewer behavioral and discipline problems to deal with when kids have been properly fed. "Those benefits are what the students in Utah deserve," Reay said. A handful of districts in Utah have already started offering breakfast in the classroom, instead of before school in the cafeteria, where eligible students may be giving up time to socialize with peers or prepare for their school day to participate. In addition to some Salt Lake City schools where breakfast is being served in the classroom, other schools are making changes that are making a difference for students. Logan School District has made breakfast free for any student, regardless of their socioeconomic status, but it is still made available in the cafeteria. And in the San Juan School District and other southern Utah schools, teachers and staff routinely ask whether kids have eaten when disciplinary problems arise, resorting instead to proactively dealing with the issue. "It seems to take care of the behavioral problems," Woolford said. Sure, some children may end up eating two breakfasts, but she said making sure everyone has access to a healthy breakfast is most important, as sometimes the one offered at school may be "more nutritious." The grant funding, with no limit depending on the needs of each district, will assist with the upfront costs associated with starting a breakfast in the classroom program, including the purchase of necessary equipment, increasing awareness of the program in the community, short-term food and nutrition services staffing, as well as training for staff and teachers who will help implement it. "An important piece of changing the way you serve school breakfast is getting staff on board and them wanting it to be successful," Woolford said. It's a change in routine for many schools, and helping the transition go smoothly will likely warrant long-term success of the program. "I expect to see our participation rate go up," she said. "Maybe not enough to get out of last place, but enough that more kids are getting the nutrition they need to effectively learn."

But two co-workers got an IT employee to break into Avila’s computer to re-upload a sneering, pointing picture of Trump, according to the lawsuit. “One co-worker told Alexandra that Mr. Trump was saying ‘(Expletive) you!’ specifically to her,” the lawsuit says. The harassment only got worse for Avila, who was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent. The people Avila worked with at Sedgwick Claims Management Services in Coralville bombarded her with racist memes, embarrassing her on group chats of more than a dozen people, the lawsuit says. O ne pictured a Hispanic man in an oversized sombrero. “No books,” it said. “Only Manuels.” Avila’s co-workers signed her up to volunteer for Trump’s campaign, according to her lawsuit. Once, a supervisor asked the team to vote on what food they wanted for a congratulatory potluck. “Alex can’t vote,” a co-worker replied. “She’s an undocumented immigrant.” Avila started working in 2012 for Sedgwick Claims Management Services, which administers employee benefit programs for other companies. “At Sedgwick,” the Memphis-based company likes to note, “caring counts.” Sedgwick employs 14,000 people in about 275 offices in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Ireland, according to company literature. Avila worked in Sedgwick’s Iowa office in Johnson County, where less than 6 percent of people identify as Hispanic, according to census data. Every day, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Avila handled family leave requests for Wal-Mart employees. She was fired last November. Her harassment and discrimination lawsuit was filed a week ago and names her company and two former supervisors as defendants. The supervisors did not respond to requests for comment Sedgwick Claims Management Services said in a statement to the Washington Post that “we are aware that a suit has been filed by Alexandra Avila, a former colleague in our Coralville, Iowa, office. Before her dismissal for cause in 2015, Ms. Avila never reported any such activity to management or our colleague resource team. Sedgwick consistently maintains fair employment and workplace harassment practices, and we are confident the facts will prove Ms. Avila’s case has no merit.” Avila’s alleged workplace troubles paralleled Trump’s political rise: According to the lawsuit, the harassment started in earnest after Trump announced he was running for president in June 2015. During a speech declaring his candidacy, he made incendiary comments about Mexicans and immigration. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” the man who would become the Republican nominee for president said. “ ... They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” “With the political climate the way that it is, it’s a little more charged,” said the principal of the Iowa school whose players were taunted. Dan Marburger, the principal at Perry High, told CNN that some of his students, at a school with an unusually high percentage of minorities for that part of the state, feel that “this inflamed rhetoric is happening and it’s OK. No one is stopping it. ... They see it in a presidential campaign and now it’s OK for everyone to say this. It’s almost a sense that you feel that you don’t belong in your own country.” The only Hispanic person on her team of about a dozen, Avila was born in California and moved to Iowa as a child, her attorney said. Trump’s comments about Mexicans bothered Avila, and she confided in her co-workers, according to the lawsuit. “Alexandra’s co-workers knew she was upset by Mr. Trump’s bigoted remarks, so they needled her about them,” the lawsuit says. The ensuing harassment took all forms — a snide undocumented immigrant comment here, a dancing Trump GIF there, according to the lawsuit. Avila told supervisors about the comments and messages, but they did not take action, the lawsuit says. Sometimes, they laughed too. “It just kept getting worse and worse,” Avila’s attorney, Paige Fiedler, told the Post. “She tried to pretend that these things weren’t bothering her for a while because she had to work with these people. She’s not someone who likes to make waves ... Until she got fired, I don’t think she ever would have gone and complained outside the company” The lawsuit says Avila was fired after a supervisor claimed she lied on timecards, although the suit says her supervisors’ attitudes toward Hispanics factored into Avila’s termination. The lawsuit claims that she and other employees often worked overtime or through their unpaid lunch break and that a supervisor told them “to find a way to get all their work done and that they were not allowed to write down any overtime hours.” The 2015 meeting where Avila was fired marked the first time she had heard about the timecard issue, the lawsuit says. She was terminated and escorted out of the building; her now-former employers said they would send her personal property to her home, the lawsuit says. Even though she was fired, the harassment did not stop, Avila claims. When the company mailed her a box with some of her belongings, a piece of paper was included that read: “Just call me La Trumpa.” On the back of the paper, someone had written: “Illegal immigrants can’t vote or work. Good luck finding a job.” In January, the lawsuit alleges, Sedgwick employees “continued to harass Alexandra on her Facebook page — greeting her with ‘Hola Alex’ and inviting her to a rally to see Donald Trump, ‘the next president of the United States.’ ” Avila is suing for harassment and discrimination based on race and national origin. Her attorney said she also is entitled to damages for wage theft and emotional distress. Fiedler said Avila sobbed as she recounted how she had to replace her daughter’s picture on her computer’s desktop over and over again: “The fact that they went into her computer and they replaced this beautiful, beautiful picture of her child and they replaced it with a photo of Donald Trump yelling and shaking a finger at her, really struck her and makes her feel violated,” the lawsuit says.

Susan Tripp Pollard — Bay Area News Group By Annie Sciacca, Bay Area News Group Posted: 10/30/16, 5:00 PM PDT | # Comments Dean Miller, of Concord, views holiday items Thursday at Orchard Supply Hardware in Pleasant Hill. “It jump starts people” said Miller in response to the early holiday displays. Susan Tripp Pollard — Bay Area News Group While many people may still be trying to nail down their trick-or-treating game plan, retailers in the Bay Area are way ahead: They’re pulling out the winter holiday decor and merchandise. Home improvement retailers have had their holiday lights on store floors for weeks. Crate and Barrel’s Walnut Creek store had Christmas items out next to its Halloween display by the third week of October. Palo Alto’s Stanford Shopping Center will have Santa Claus photo opportunities as early as Nov. 4. On Nov. 5, San Jose’s Santana Row will launch its “Holiday Makers Market,” and social media was flooded with posts from shoppers at Costco and Walmart stores who spotted sales on Christmas lights and other merchandise as early as September. AFTER THE TURKEY Martinez resident James Malkson said he remembers a time when retailers waited mostly until around Thanksgiving to unveil their Christmas and winter displays and merchandise. Now, he said, it seems to go up earlier each year, pointing to Christmas decor on display in Concord’s Sunvalley mall during the last week of October. Call it the “creep” part of the season, as in “Christmas creep” — that time of year when Christmas decor and merchandise creeps onto store shelves amidst the autumnal displays. Many people rail against it, citing pressure from stores to start their holiday buying too early, but retailers insist they would not begin so early if there weren’t demand. And studies show that many shoppers do like to get a head start on their holiday buying. People started inquiring about holiday hours and events at Sunvalley mall weeks ago, said Kim Trupiano, marketing director for the shopping center. Building the Christmas display often begins in the summer and takes a few weeks to put together inside the mall itself, Trupiano said. This year, it will be unveiled Nov. 11, which is when the mall will kick off its Santa program and other holiday events. MUCH PREPARATION For San Jose-based home improvement retailer Orchard Supply Hardware, preparing the holiday merchandise is a year-round project, said the company’s seasonal merchandise manager, Pam Burke. Burke begins forming ideas for the holiday merchandise a year ahead, gathering design ideas for themes and seeing what’s popular in different countries. The stores set up their holiday light products, which make up roughly half their seasonal product sales, as early as August. Decor products like artificial trees and table settings go up starting in September, and the stores typically complete their holiday set-up by the end of October, Burke said. “People say, ‘Oh, gosh, it’s too early,’ but if it’s something unique that they don’t see, they want to buy that early,” Burke said, noting that each year her team comes up with new themes for the displays and decor. So far, holiday merchandise sales are up 20 percent over the same period last year, she said. Advertisement According to the National Retail Federation’s holiday spending survey, approximately 40 percent of holiday shoppers say they begin their holiday shopping before Halloween, citing early bird shopping as a way to spread out their budgets and avoid holiday crowds and stress. Another 41.5 percent say they begin their holiday shopping in November, and 18.7 will begin sometime in December. A separate study from advertising technology company Rubicon Project found that nearly half of parents (47 percent) began their holiday shopping this year before Labor Day. OVERLOOKING THE SPIRIT Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at San Francisco’s Golden Gate University, said that for some people, there is an angst associated with retailers getting an early start on holiday preparation because they worry about the “spirit” of the holiday getting overlooked. “I think people wonder if retailers are manipulating the meaning of the holiday, in some way,” Yarrow said, noting that those who either abhor or embrace the early start to the holiday shopping season often have the same motivation: avoiding the commercialization of the holidays. Some want to get an early start to avoid the crowds and chaos, while others don’t want the pressure of shopping so early. Janie Peterson, who lives in Benicia and often shops in the East Bay, said she does not like the general “commercialization” of the Christmas holiday, but she does like that an early start to the season means she can get her holiday shopping done early and avoid the crowds later on. Malkson, in spotting the Sunvalley mall’s Christmas decor, was less forgiving. “Gee, can’t we get by Thanksgiving first?” Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on?

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:13PM Image source: Getty Images. For years, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) defied every logical expectation for an established fast-casual restaurant. In 2014, comparable-store sales (comps) grew 16.8% -- an almost unheard-of pace for a company its size. The first half of 2015 was more of the same, with comps up 10.4% and 14.1% during the first and second quarters, respectively. But during the summer, stories surfaced out of the West Coast about norovirus and E. coli outbreaks related to Chipotle. It didn't stop there: The food-related illness outbreak spread across the country before dying down by December. By then, the damage was done. And the company has been trying to recover since. Comps have been down by over 20% each quarter since late 2015, and shares are off 50% from their 2015 highs. Motley Fool analyst Brian Stoffel has already declared that he'll be selling the stock when trading rules allow. But John Maxfield has no plans for selling his stake anytime soon. Below, Brian presents his core argument for selling his shares, while John has a chance to respond to Brian's concerns. Food safety is a catalyst, not the cause Brian Stoffel: I was a longtime -- and vocally supportive -- shareholder of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM). I loved the company's commitment to all stakeholders and its aggressive role in bringing healthy eating into the nation's consciousness. For a long time, the approach worked very well for shareholders. Until it didn't. Starting in 2013, the competition started crushing Whole Foods' growth ambitions. Costco, Wal-Mart, and, most notably, Kroger came out with their own in-house organic options. For the general public, this was a win-win: People are eating healthier food that is more responsibly grown for less money. But for Whole Foods shareholders, it hasn't been pretty. Comps have been negative, and the company's shares have lost over 55% of their value since hitting 2013 highs. In short, Whole Foods really had no sustainable competitive advantage -- people will get their organic goods wherever they are offered. While lots of people are worried about the food safety issues at Chipotle, I actually think that's a catalyst for the stock's long-term downtrend, not the cause. Instead, I'm worried about Chipotle playing out in much the same fashion that Whole Foods did. Chipotle was the first national chain to focus on ethically sourced food made fresh in-house, with a very simple menu to boot. That first-mover status led to massive investor gains. But there's nothing to stop the competition from copying the exact same thing. Already, similarly focused competitors are cropping up like wildfire, while more entrenched players shift their menu focus. This isn't to say I think Chipotle is doomed. I believe it will survive just fine, and they can surely count on me as a customer moving forward. But trading at 52 times trailing earnings -- and 36 times estimates for next year -- I just don't think the stock is worth what it's trading for right now. A Chipotle bull's response John Maxfield: What sticks out to me in Brian's argument is the distinction between the food-safety issues being a catalyst for a potential long-term downtrend in Chipotle's stock as opposed to being the cause. I find that to be extremely insightful. But I nevertheless disagree with it. To say that the food-safety issues Chipotle has experienced over the past year are a catalyst is to suggest that they are merely contributing to an otherwise independent downward trend. The cause of that trend, if I'm interpreting Brian correctly, is the encroachment of competitors. It'd be silly for me to claim that competitors won't move into Chipotle's space. We've seen this with Qdoba, a subsidiary of Jack in the Box, but also with the proliferation of fast-casual chains such as Noodles & Co. and Panera Bread. But there's plenty of space for all of these companies to thrive. This is particularly true when you consider the enormous amount of market share that Chipotle and its fast-casual competitors can continue to steal away from fast-food giants such as McDonalds, Wendy's, and Burger King. Additionally, Chipotle is still at the beginning of its lifecycle as a food chain. It's building roughly 200 new locations a year. Its same-store sales will almost certainly begin growing once again in the first quarter of next year. It has yet to expand internationally in a meaningful way. And it has a number of additional arrows in its quiver that it can deploy to boost sales at existing restaurants -- most importantly, introducing breakfast and desserts. Image source: Chipotle. Let me also point out that Chipotle's management has proven to be extremely adept at capital allocation, buying back nearly 7% of its outstanding common stock since its share price plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year. As William Thorndike notes in his excellent book, The Outsiders, it's this skill that underlies the most successful CEOs in the United States since World War II. In short, I understand why people are concerned about Chipotle's future. But as a great investor once said, one objective when buying stocks is to be "fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:13PM Image source: Getty Images. For years, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) defied every logical expectation for an established fast-casual restaurant. In 2014, comparable-store sales (comps) grew 16.8% -- an almost unheard-of pace for a company its size. The first half of 2015 was more of the same, with comps up 10.4% and 14.1% during the first and second quarters, respectively. But during the summer, stories surfaced out of the West Coast about norovirus and E. coli outbreaks related to Chipotle. It didn't stop there: The food-related illness outbreak spread across the country before dying down by December. By then, the damage was done. And the company has been trying to recover since. Comps have been down by over 20% each quarter since late 2015, and shares are off 50% from their 2015 highs. Motley Fool analyst Brian Stoffel has already declared that he'll be selling the stock when trading rules allow. But John Maxfield has no plans for selling his stake anytime soon. Below, Brian presents his core argument for selling his shares, while John has a chance to respond to Brian's concerns. Food safety is a catalyst, not the cause Brian Stoffel: I was a longtime -- and vocally supportive -- shareholder of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM). I loved the company's commitment to all stakeholders and its aggressive role in bringing healthy eating into the nation's consciousness. For a long time, the approach worked very well for shareholders. Until it didn't. Starting in 2013, the competition started crushing Whole Foods' growth ambitions. Costco, Wal-Mart, and, most notably, Kroger came out with their own in-house organic options. For the general public, this was a win-win: People are eating healthier food that is more responsibly grown for less money. But for Whole Foods shareholders, it hasn't been pretty. Comps have been negative, and the company's shares have lost over 55% of their value since hitting 2013 highs. In short, Whole Foods really had no sustainable competitive advantage -- people will get their organic goods wherever they are offered. While lots of people are worried about the food safety issues at Chipotle, I actually think that's a catalyst for the stock's long-term downtrend, not the cause. Instead, I'm worried about Chipotle playing out in much the same fashion that Whole Foods did. Chipotle was the first national chain to focus on ethically sourced food made fresh in-house, with a very simple menu to boot. That first-mover status led to massive investor gains. But there's nothing to stop the competition from copying the exact same thing. Already, similarly focused competitors are cropping up like wildfire, while more entrenched players shift their menu focus. This isn't to say I think Chipotle is doomed. I believe it will survive just fine, and they can surely count on me as a customer moving forward. But trading at 52 times trailing earnings -- and 36 times estimates for next year -- I just don't think the stock is worth what it's trading for right now. A Chipotle bull's response John Maxfield: What sticks out to me in Brian's argument is the distinction between the food-safety issues being a catalyst for a potential long-term downtrend in Chipotle's stock as opposed to being the cause. I find that to be extremely insightful. But I nevertheless disagree with it. To say that the food-safety issues Chipotle has experienced over the past year are a catalyst is to suggest that they are merely contributing to an otherwise independent downward trend. The cause of that trend, if I'm interpreting Brian correctly, is the encroachment of competitors. It'd be silly for me to claim that competitors won't move into Chipotle's space. We've seen this with Qdoba, a subsidiary of Jack in the Box, but also with the proliferation of fast-casual chains such as Noodles & Co. and Panera Bread. But there's plenty of space for all of these companies to thrive. This is particularly true when you consider the enormous amount of market share that Chipotle and its fast-casual competitors can continue to steal away from fast-food giants such as McDonalds, Wendy's, and Burger King. Additionally, Chipotle is still at the beginning of its lifecycle as a food chain. It's building roughly 200 new locations a year. Its same-store sales will almost certainly begin growing once again in the first quarter of next year. It has yet to expand internationally in a meaningful way. And it has a number of additional arrows in its quiver that it can deploy to boost sales at existing restaurants -- most importantly, introducing breakfast and desserts. Image source: Chipotle. Let me also point out that Chipotle's management has proven to be extremely adept at capital allocation, buying back nearly 7% of its outstanding common stock since its share price plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year. As William Thorndike notes in his excellent book, The Outsiders, it's this skill that underlies the most successful CEOs in the United States since World War II. In short, I understand why people are concerned about Chipotle's future. But as a great investor once said, one objective when buying stocks is to be "fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

X TV preview: Making Ireland Click, Bublé at the BBC and more David Puttnam steps into his new role as Ireland’s Digital Champion; supercrooner Michael Bublé steps up to the mic Sun, Oct 30, 2016, 12:39 Kevin Courtney The president’s daughter: Hayley Atwell in Conviction, Wednesday, Sky Living, 9pm         Ireland’s Fittest Family Sunday, RTÉ One, 6.30pm Once again it’s time for 12 superfit families to test their mettle, stay the course and aim for that €15,000 prize. This year, the challenges are even more challenging, the terrain even rougher and the courses even more gruelling. They’ll be coached by four sporting legends: ex-Clare hurling manager Davy Fitzgerald, Cork camogie star Anna Geary, Munster and Ireland rugby legend Alan Quinlan and – joining the coaching team this year – former Irish international soccer star Stephen Hunt. (Can’t wait to see what the couch- potato families on Gogglebox Ireland make of this.) Making Ireland Click Monday, RTÉ One, 7.30pm Oscar-winning film producer David Puttnam has a new role to play these days. The political activist and member of the House of Lords, who lives in Skibbereen, is Ireland’s Digital Champion (apparently, that’s a thing), and he’s on a mission to get Irish people digitally literate. Digital technology has taken over nearly every aspect of our lives, but not everyone is driving along the same information superhighway. Some are still tootling along on the digital side-roads, and Puttnam is hoping to get everyone in Ireland up to speed on the fast-changing technologies that are fast changing our lives. In the first episode, Puttnam meets the “non-liners”, people who have resisted the pull of the new technology, and sees how older people are in danger of being left behind in the rush to living our lives online. Unarmed Black Male Wednesday, BBC Two, 9pm In April 2015, police officer Stephen Rankin arrived at a Walmart store in response to a report of shoplifting. Within minutes he had shot and killed black teenager William Chapman. This 90-minute documentary brings us inside the trial of Rankin, who was charged with first-degree murder. In 2015, a total of 306 black men were killed by police in the US, but just 14 police officers were charged with any wrongdoing. Made by award-winning filmmaker James Jones, this documentary promises to be a powerful indictment of law enforcement in the US. ADVERTISEMENT Television’s Opening Night: How The Box Was Born Wednesday, BBC4, 9pm In a unique experiment, Dallas Campbell, Prof Danielle George and Dr Hugh Hunt join forces in an attempt to restage the very first official broadcast on British Television, exactly 80 years after it made history. The inaugural BBC transmission was made from Alexandra Palace in London on November 2nd 1936. But there are no recordings of the event - so, to find out just went on, the team will attempt to piece back together every aspect of show from scratch – from the cogs, gears and electron beams of the new technology to the dancing girls and other variety acts that were broadcast that historic night. Conviction Wednesday, Sky Living, 9pm She was only the president’s daughter . . . Hayley Atwell stars in this new legal thriller series as brilliant young lawyer Hayes Morrison, whose father was once the US president. She’s trying to get out from under her dad’s shadow and make it on her own terms, but she’s also battling a few demons, and when New York district attorney Conner Wallace uncovers one of these, he blackmails her into working for the Conviction Integrity Unit, which investigates possible wrongful convictions. Atwell is best known as Marvel’s Agent Carter – can she make this another memorable role? The jury’s out. Bublé at the BBC Thursday, BBC One, 8pm With Christmas on the way, it’ll soon be time to dig out our well-scratched copy of Michael Buble’s festive CD. But if you can’t wait until December to hear the dulcet tones of the Canadian crooner, you can catch him in a one-hour special, Here, Claudia Winkleman puts aside her Strictly shoes to interview Bublé about becoming a father and how he got started in his career, and the singer performs his many hits in front of a live studio audience, backed by his band and a 30-piece orchestra.

From Burma to Buffalo Life in a new jungle Refugees like Swoin Paw struggle mightily with language and culture disparities By Jerry Zremski / News Washington Bureau Chief Photography by Derek Gee / News Chief Photographer Swoin Paw could not understand much of what the “IRS agent” with the foreign accent said when he called, demanding $9,500. But he knew what the caller meant when he threatened jail. Within hours, the slim, scruffy, sad-eyed refugee from Burma paid $8,200 to a fraudster. “I didn’t understand,” Swoin Paw, who is now 40, said through an interpreter at his home in Buffalo’s Riverside neighborhood. For Buffalo’s refugees from Burma, acclimation is a struggle. Few speak English: Like Swoin Paw, they say they work too long and too hard to find the time to learn it. Many find American ways as foreign as the language, particularly when it comes to disciplining children. Victims of violence in the country they fled, they isolate themselves in the country they moved to, forming their own community groups and churches where they speak their own languages and preserve their old customs. In a recent survey of 240 adult refugees from Burma conducted by a University at Buffalo professor, respondents identified much more with their native culture than with America. Click on any photo to view the associated gallery. “A lot of the people, they don’t even write their own language,” said Smiler Greely, who told his own refugee story in the 2010 film “Nickel City Smiler.” “They don’t really know what to do here. They grew up in the jungle.” When that fraudster called Swoin Paw in spring 2014, saying all those foreign things in a foreign language with a foreign accent, Swoin Paw ran upstairs to fetch his neighbor, May Say. She was 18, and had dropped out of Riverside High School after getting pregnant. She spoke English. May Say picked up the phone and listened. The caller sounded foreign, she says. And he sounded serious. “My God,” May Say told Swoin Paw. “You owe money for back taxes. And if you don’t pay, they are going to put you in jail.” From left, Smiler Greeley chats with Aung Kaung Myat, Law Eh Sey and Eden in the hallway outside the council chambers at City Hall after a meeting of the Common Council Police Oversight Committee at which the community challenged their treatment by police, March 10, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Swoin Paw had only $5,000 in savings. Don’t worry, May Say said. Her family had $2,000. On the spot, she decided to give it to Swoin Paw. Swoin Paw called another friend, who agreed to chip in $1,200. Over the next few hours, following the caller’s instructions, Swoin Paw and his neighbor drove from one store to another, from a CVS to a WalMart to a Walgreens to a Rite Aid, to wire the money in chunks to the “IRS agent” with the 202 area code. The caller insisted that May Say stay on the line the whole time. She did – until they got home and told Swoin Paw’s wife, Eh Sher Paw, what was happening. She had heard of such schemes and knew it must be a fraud. She told May Say to hang up. Eh Sher Paw, a stout, round-faced woman given to smiling in spite of it all, said through an interpreter that she was angry at her husband. “But I didn’t want him to feel hurt, so I just held it in,” she said. “And then I cried.” Telling his story while sitting on the floor of his bare-bones living room, which he had meant to renovate with the money he lost to the con man, Swoin Paw looked as if he wanted to cry, too. None of this would have happened, he said, if he had known English. A decade after his arrival, Swoin Paw’s English vocabulary is small – which makes him a typical refugee. Isok Kim, the assistant professor of social work at UB who surveyed the refugees from Burma, found that 79 percent had poor English skills. The local agencies that resettle refugees in Buffalo offer classes, and refugees generally are required to take them if they are not yet working. But dozens of refugees said they stopped taking classes because they had to work. That traps them in low-wage jobs. Swoin Paw tends to the plants in the greenhouses of Wheatfield Gardens. “So many of them don’t read, they don’t write,” said Eh Knyaw, president of the Karen Society of Buffalo, which represents the city’s largest ethnic group of refugees from Burma. “In a case like that, you can only be a dishwasher.” Henry Zayamoe, a baby-faced 23-year-old who is now fluent in English, recalled getting hopelessly lost during his early days in Buffalo because he couldn’t read street signs. Other refugees said they dread calls from doctors or their children’s teachers because they don’t understand what is being said. Dozens of refugees from Burma and other countries line up every day at the Hope Refugee Drop-in Center on West Ferry Street, waiting for a translator to read their mail to them or help them fill out forms for government benefits. Henry Zayamoe, 21 when this photo was taken in 2015, a refugee from Shan State, Burma who moved to Buffalo one year ago, participates in a class project during social studies class in the Making a Connection (MAC) program, a program for refugee teens designed to help them achieve advanced English skills and a GED for students who would age out of traditional high school before earning enough credits for a diploma, Wednesday, April 1, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Swoin Paw was napping on his living room sofa on a Friday afternoon in April 2013 when he heard a young boy’s cries. His 9-year-old nephew had pushed his 6-year-old brother down the landing on the stairs. Swoin Paw did what he said his father would have done. He yelled at the 9-year-old and slapped the boy on the face. Swoin Paw then tended to the 6-year-old to make sure he was all right. The older boy did what he learned in school. He called 911. Minutes later, a squad car arrived at Swoin Paw’s house. According to the police report, officers found “fingerprints embedded on the child’s neck” and sent the 9-year-old to Women & Children’s Hospital for treatment. The officers arrested Swoin Paw. At the city lockup, he donned an orange jumpsuit, waited and prayed. Until an interpreter arrived, he didn’t know why he was there. His sister bailed him out, and records in the case show the charges were dismissed after six months. Prosecutors and defense attorneys often agree to such a resolution when circumstances warrant no further legal action. Swoin Paw keeps an eye on the children playing on the porch of his Riverside home, Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Dozens of adult refugees interviewed for this series said they struggle to learn a new way of raising children. It’s not that the refugees routinely beat their children. The county’s Child Protective Services office has noted nothing disproportional about the number of cases from the Burmese refugee community, said Albert Dirschberger, Erie County’s commissioner of social services. “There is a cultural difference,” said Lisa Bloch Rodwin, chief Family Court judge in Erie County. “What’s acceptable in many foreign cultures is not acceptable here.” Mu Te, a delicate refugee from Burma in her early 30s, learned that the hard way on a summer day outside her Black Rock/Riverside home six years ago. Her daughter, then 5, biked into the busy street, so Mu Te ran out and grabbed her and beat her. When the little girl fled, Mu Te threw a rock at her. A neighbor called the police. Mu Te – who was pregnant at the time – was jailed for a week and later served probation. “This was 100 percent lack of knowledge,” said Mu Te, crying. “I didn’t understand the rules and regulations here.” The rules and regulations here say that as soon as parents leave a mark on a child’s body, they can be charged with a crime. Kids in school are warned about child abuse. That leads to murky child protection cases where a child calls 911 out of anger rather than abuse, said Myra Dahgaypaw, a refugee from Burma who serves as policy adviser for the U.S. Campaign for Burma in Washington, D.C. “The kids always threaten their parents with 911. And sometimes they call, and parents have to go to jail for these reasons,” she said. “How do we cope with this kind of problem?” Thaw Sit Naing, 3, left, and Nansu Nadoo Nadee, 3, get acclimated with the staff as they arrive with their mothers for a parenting discussion at the Jewish Family Services, March 9, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Like most refugees, Swoin Paw lived a hard life far away that defines him. In Thailand, he was arrested three times – for working. He grew up in a village that escapees from Burma set up in western Thailand. There are many such villages, each a collection of bamboo huts that makes the nearby refugee camps look new and neat. The Thai government considers the villagers illegal immigrants. When he got old enough, Swoin Paw did menial farm labor, even though it was illegal. So Thai police arrested him again and again. The last time he spent a month in jail, sleeping on a dirt floor in a barracks with 200 other inmates. That was enough. In 1997, Swoin Paw and his wife moved to a refugee camp west of Bangkok. And when the United States and Thailand struck a deal to allow refugees from the camp to be among the first from Burma to move to America, Swoin Paw and his wife applied. His life now is much better, he said. He works, his kids are in school and there is enough money to keep the family fed and clothed. “In Thailand,” he said, “we had nothing.” Men walk into a village of displaced Karen exiles called Kyout Sat outside of Mae Sot, Thailand, Monday, April 27, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Buffalo’s refugees from Burma fled a military government that tried to wipe out ethnic minorities. “I’m coming from a not very civil society, and here is a very civil society,” said Myo Thant, a political prisoner in Burma who came to Buffalo after winning asylum in the United States. “I’m not going to fit in right away.” Separated by different languages and cultures, Burma’s ethnic groups – the Karen, Karenni, Chin, Burmese, Arakanese and Rohingya, plus several others – typically form their own community organizations and religious groups. And it is there that the refugees find community in Buffalo. Hundreds turned out in February for Chin National Day in North Buffalo. One group of young men and women danced in elaborate red-and-white costumes. Another group of dancers, all men, wore shorts, long plaid sashes and red headdresses with feathers. “The Chin culture and the American culture are just very different,” said Joshua Thawng Lian, president of the Chin Society of Buffalo. Many refugees find more frequent refuge in the churches they have set up in Buffalo. Swoin Paw and his wife socialize mostly with a few close friends from the Karen Baptist Church. He said the church is filled with people just like him, people working hard to support their families, good family men and women. Their children have friends from outside the Karen community, but Swoin Paw and his wife said they fit in best with people who share their language and understand their experiences. The church, they said, feels a bit like home. Swoin Paw, sits on the floor of his living room, Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Editor's note: The Buffalo News is using the name "Burma," rather than "Myanmar," because refugees generally refer to the nation as Burma, as does the U.S. government. Burma's military regime revived the nation's ancient name of Myanmar in 1989 in hopes of defusing ethnic tensions. In addition, refugees will be referred to consistently by their full names in this series.

PHOTO COURTESY ALLIANCE FOR FAIR FOOD Story of farmworkers’ struggle coming to Centro Tuesday Sun, 10/30/2016 - 5:40am Anita Miller It’s not everyday a recent Presidential Medal winner passes through San Marcos.  Nor is it everyday the White House bestows the accolade, practically unparalleled in prestige, to a grassroots group of low-wage farmworkers, of all things for “extraordinary efforts at combatting modern-day slavery.” Yet Tuesday evening, Lupe Gonzalo, an organizer with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a community group of tomato pickers hailing from Guatemala and Mexico, working in Florida’s agricultural fields — will grace San Marcos with a talk about the colossal success of her organization in fighting a range of abuses once rampant in the industry, earning them White House recognition last January. The CIW’s “Campaign for Fair Food” — triumphant efforts to persuade a dozen multi-billiondollar companies to improve pay and work conditions for tens of thousands of tomato harvesters — is compellingly documented in the award-winning film FOOD CHAINS, which Cinema Club will screen at 7 p.m. at Centro Comunitario Hispano on Tuesday. Gonzalo will speak afterward. Gonzalo, a longtime leader of the CIW, will be in San Marcos as part of a statewide tour to educate supporters about her group’s attempt to get Wendy’s to join their Fair Food Program; Wendy’s is the only of the nation’s five largest fast-food retailers to not yet sign on.  Following numerous high-profile, slavery prosecutions in Florida’s fields — involving more than 1,200 forced-labor victims since 1997 — and sustained consumer campaigns, CIW has managed to prompt companies like Walmart, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut and McDonald’s to sign legally-binding agreements that boost wages and enact a strict workplace code of conduct to protect farmworkers’ human rights. Texas State University’s food-service provider, Compass Group, is another company that joined the Fair Food Program in 2009. Last year, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the CIW, upon presentation of the Presidential Medal: “Those of you know Florida’s tomato sector already know about the risks of forced labor, and some farm workers in Florida are in the fields for 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They live in deplorable conditions. They suffer beatings and sexual harassment, and many are paid hardly anything for the tomatoes that they pick. But thanks to the Fair Food Program, the tomato workers in the fields do not have to face these abuses. The CIW has organized communities, stood by tomato workers for more than 20 years, and changed the face of this industry. They’ve pioneered a zero tolerance policy that puts workers and social responsibility at the absolute center.” For several years, Gonzalo has also helped organize a weekly meeting of farmworker women in Immokalee,  a rural town almost entirely comprised of men.  She and her colleagues have spearheaded multiple protests led by farmworker women and dozens of spirited children outside of supermarkets and fast-food companies that refuse to join Fair Food efforts. Gonzalo is also a popular deejay on Radio Conciencia 107.7 FM, a low-power station broadcasting through the Everglades, with programming over the years consisting of deejays speaking Spanish, Haitian Creole and a few indigenous Mayan languages.   The radio was credited with rescuing lives during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 — providing crucial emergency information to farmworkers in their native languages while coordinating an urgent carpool to move scores of trailer-park dwelling residents to safety. Gonzalo will speak Tuesday on Texas State campus at 3:30 p.m. in the Philosophy Dialogue Room (Comal 116) as part of an Honors Non-Violence course, in addition to her talk after the Food Chains screening that same evening at Centro, where newly constructed altars for Dia de los Muertos are available for viewing.   • Submitted by San Marcos  Cinema Club   Section:  News Advertisement Search the site Search Tweets by SanMarcosRecord Popular content Today's: Trump’s message resonated unheard San Marcos High School’s Air Force JROTC supports HCWC with donation Kissing Tree Golf Course construction underway Hays County Brown Santa gearing up for holiday toy and food drive Downtown protest Related Articles Wayne G.

Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon – which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 – is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It’s a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. “Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them,” said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It’s a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it’s expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation “gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas,” Sebastian said. Humble Beginnings Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program – $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program – started earlier this month. Amazon doesn’t disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it’s probably not. Rather, it’s a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. “They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they’re clearly leveraging that loyal membership base,” Sebastian said. Amazon’s monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. “I think they’ve gotten to the point they can be more flexible,” Sebastian said. “It’s an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they’ve gained some efficiencies.” Ever-expanding Prime Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it’s worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. “If you become a Prime member you buy more from us,” he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. “That’s what closes the loop from the business angle,” he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters.

Wish is raising again, and giving late-stage investors protection Posted Oct 28, 2016 by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Tesla’s Powerwall 2 packs over twice the energy storage Wish, a San Francisco-based e-commerce mobile app that’s taken off in the U.S. and Europe by selling watches, clothing and other items extremely cheaply, is raising a new round of funding, a new filing shows. (The research company CB Insights spied the filing first.) Neither the size of the round nor the valuation are included, but the filing shows that Series F investors coming into the round are receiving liquidation preferences that will allow them to get paid ahead of earlier investors — which isn’t uncommon in later-stage funding rounds. A survey released in August by the law firm Fenwick & West — one that analyzed the venture financings of 195 Silicon Valley-based companies over the second quarter — showed that senior liquidation preferences were featured in 30 percent of financings. Wish’s CEO, Peter Szulczewski, is notoriously press shy, but he came to a StrictlyVC event hosted in February by this editor and shared numerous details about the business, which previously raised $600 million from investors and was reportedly last valued at $3 billion. (According to the app-analytics firm App Annie, it’s also the second-most popular shopping app in the U.S., and the 39th most popular app overall.) We published our notes after that February interview; in case you missed them, we’re republishing them here, below. On his background: Szulczewski, a computer scientist by training, noted that he’d spent 6.5 years at Google solving “really big matching problems” before cofounding his company, ContextLogic, from which Wish evolved. The idea was to build a next-generation, mobile ad network to compete with Google’s AdSense network, whose tech was “relatively stale” at the time, in 2011. Szulscewski and his cofounder, Danny Zhang, realized they were “pretty bad at business development,” though, so eventually pivoted to Wish. Wish began as an app that asked people to create wish lists, then the company approached merchants, letting them know a certain number of customers wanted, say, a certain type of table. Things took off from there, he said. On the merchants Wish works with and the types of merchandise it sells: “We thought that being more relevant and showing the right recommendations would be critical; what we didn’t predict was the types of products and the types of merchants. “Because shopping on smartphones is relatively new and sort of an impulsive experience, the average order value tends to be relatively low. I don’t think people are comfortable with buying a $5,000 TV on their phone. I think even $300 is high, as most people want to compare prices, read through reviews, etcetera. People were willing to spend $20, $30, $50, but not much more than that [which we learned]. “Another part of our hypothesis that did work was that we’d be so good at relevance that these merchants would ship these things directly from their distribution centers and factories, and we’d cut out all the middle men. But were naïve [about who would do this]. A brand like Nike isn’t going to do that; it would be undercutting all its other retailers and its brand, on which it spends a lot of marketing dollars. “[On the other hand], if you’re an unbranded merchant who’s selling a dress or a wall mount, you just have your manufacturing and shipping costs, and those are the people we work really well with and why we have such good prices. We know who’s interested in fishing, and our merchants can reach them for free. The value proposition for the consumer is really cheap stuff. For merchants, it’s, ‘Hey, I don’t have to do anything. I just upload a CSV file or do it through an API or enter it manually, and I just start seeing sales.’ “The two biggest biggest retailers in the world are Walmart — which sees revenue of half a trillion dollars a year, primarily from U.S. customers — and the Alibaba subsidiary Taobao, which is the biggest platform in China. And both focus on value-conscious consumers. [That’s because] the median household in the U.S. is around $52,000 a year. In Europe, it’s even lower.” On how big the company is, and how much of each transaction it takes: “Last year, [gross merchandise sales] was single-digit billions. It took us just under three years or so to get there. We do charge a take rate of 15 percent. Part of the reason is we do a lot more than, say, Alibaba, which doesn’t charge a take rate. “Take your local merchant in Shenzhen, where the majority of the world’s goods are manufactured, both branded and unbranded. That merchant has no idea how to sell to people in the Netherlands, France, Brazil, the U.S., Australia. He also has no idea how to communicate with those customers, so we take care of all of that. What merchants get in return [is] suddenly, they get an additional audience of more than a billion smartphone users who don’t really cannibalize their existing market.” In explaining how Wish, which ships many things for a $1, is able to do that: “We’re shipping little things – not TVs or motorcyles or bicycles. And it turns out it’s relatively cheap to do that. Even by air, it will cost $1 or $2 unless the item is unusually heavy or large. [Largely we rely on a partnership between the USPS and China called ePacket.]  I think most countries have these kinds of treaties. I’m not sure what percentage of our goods use the program, but it’s really efficient. Everything is shipped by air and it’s surprisingly cost effective.” If that program went away? “From what we’ve heard, the partners involved are very happy with it. If it goes away, it goes away for everyone, so the prices would probably rise for everyone. But we also have interesting back-up solutions even if it does.” On how long it takes customers to receive their goods: “In the U.S., the average time is 13 days or so. Across the world, it’s maybe a little higher. In certain countries like Brazil where logistics aren’t as optimized and there may be much more regulation around imports, it could be as long as 30 days on average, so it really depends on the market.” Answering which are the best-selling products on the platform: “Initially, it was a lot of fashion. Then we got make-up, home décor – cheaper or smaller items. What’s really taking off now is a lot of hobby stuff. Certain parts for cars, for example. Things for people who are into fishing gear, paintball, surfing, photography, drones. So a lot of different sets of users are coming who don’t need a branded good but need something that works, like fishing bait.” In response to a question about about non-discretionary items and whether we’ll see Wish take on Amazon more directly by selling items like paper towels: “The answer is yes and that’s starting to happen. There’s one package of like 20 toothbrushes that costs $3 dollars that we’re selling tens of thousands of every month. Paper towels are too large and too heavy to ship out of China but maybe we have a partnership with someone here who ships it out of their warehouse and we offer it that way. So we are thinking about non-discretionary more and more and it’s starting to creep into our platform.” Addressing reports that Wish has talked with Alibaba and Amazon and they want to buy the company for billions of dollars (which Szulczewski largely dodged): “We realized early on that unless you set out to build a really massive, self-sustainable business, you’re just not going to be able to do it. Basically, really big companies have these people in corp dev, god bless you [laughs], but there’s this asymmetry, which is like: the founders’ time is the most precious commodity that you have. You only have 24 hours a day. But there are corp dev people at these companies who have an infinite amount of time to spend with these founders… We want to build a self-sustainable business. We think that just like Alibaba, just like Walmart, we can get to hundreds of billions [of dollars in market cap]. I think both those companies were built on the same premise of saving time and money for their consumers. We’re doing the same thing on your phone.” On whether JD.com, China’s second biggest e-commerce player, is now an investor in Wish: “I was at Yuri Milner’s house for some kind of dinner party, and I met Richard [Liu], who’s the founder and CEO of JD, and I find their business fascinating; it’s the exact opposite of what we do. [Editor’s note: Unlike Wish and Alibaba, which directly connect buyers and sellers, JD is more like Amazon, buying branded goods from manufacturers, storing the inventory in its own warehouses and, once purchased, delivering the goods quickly – often the same day.] I think JD has the best logistics in the world. They have 80,000 employees delivering these goods. And we’re the exact opposite, so we struck up an relationship and we could probably learn a lot from them, and they could probably learn a lot from us, because we’re not competing because they’re not really doing anything outside of China and we’re not entering China, at all. So we really like them and yes, they invested $50 million in the last round.” On the company’s priorities going forward: “We take a tech-driven approach to curation and it’s slowly evolving to be more pretty and I think we’ll get there. But every time we try curation — the algorithm, in terms of conversion — it just destroys any kind of curation. It’s an order of magnitude difference. So we’re always trying things and maybe there’s a way to algorithmically curate [a prettier] interface. So that’s always been a priority for us. “[Another priority is] customer purchase experience, which is, ‘Hey, maybe for some of the products where we can forecast the sales really accurately, you should be able to get them in less than three days.’ That’s probably possible for half the GMV if we’re running at scale. “We’re also focusing more on customer support, which was, last year, up until November, horrific. Now it’s getting better.” Addressing how much repeat business Wish sees: “If you think of the rise of Taobao, they’re at 50 purchases per user per year. Amazon is at 15, by the way, which I’ve heard from many people and I think is accurate [information]. I think JD is somewhere below Amazon – they don’t give me that kind of data. “We’re at 5 purchases per year and that’s growing relatively quickly. We’re not something you use every week but we certainly want to be. As think as long as we can provide the most bang for the buck for consumers, we’ll get there.” On educating Chinese merchants, who not accustomed to thinking about the lifetime value of customers: “It’s true that consumer expectations in China are very different. Like, if you order a red sweater and you get a blue one, [shoppers are] like, ‘Eh, next time.’ So we have a lot of merchants that have only sold to Chinese consumers and we have to educate them that it’s not okay to ship a blue sweater because you don’t have any red sweaters in stock. [Laughs.] “We also have to educate them on what ‘counterfeit’ means. We have to literally tell them that you can’t just put an Apple logo on something and sell it, that that’s wrong. Some genuinely don’t know that. They’re like, ‘It’s my factory, I can do what I want.’ “I think there are more engineers on the platform team, working with merchants, than there are on the consumer-facing product team [because it’s] more important to educate and work with the merchants to create a win-win situation.” On how the company has managed to see so much traction: “Two years ago, the merchants were like, ‘I’ll try this. I don’t know what the hell it is, but I hear other merchants are making money, so I’ll give it a shot.’ And if you tell them, ‘Hey, if you take this inventory and put it in the U.S. or Germany or Spain, you’ll make more money,’ they’re like, ‘No. You’re the fifth thing on my mind. There’s Amazon, Taobao, my own e-commerce site.’ But after you have two or three years of these merchants getting meaningful revenue and sales and it’s growing month over month, then you get their buy-in. Then it’s, ‘Okay, now you’re the third thing on my mind.’ Then, ‘Now you’re the second.’ ‘Now, you’re the first or second; how can I get more sales?’” Pictured above: Hans Tung, a managing director at GGV Capital and board member at Wish, and Wish cofounder and CEO Peter Szulczewski. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Wish Founded 2011 Overview Wish is the leading mobile commerce platform in North America and Europe.

A Political and Literary Forum Menu Close Search Close Support Boston Review Become a Member Class & Inequality How Not to Argue for Basic Income Brishen Rogers Oct 31, 2016 14 Min read time Topics: politics economy labor Share: Robots for Basic Income demonstration, Zürich / Photograph: Generation Grundeinkommen “Change is inevitable; progress is optional” is a favorite quip of Andy Stern, who was president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) from 1996 to 2010. He took that adage to heart. Indeed part of his appeal to my generation of union organizers—who witnessed firsthand the weakening of labor over the last three decades—was his call for new models of unionism that would restore it as essential to a good society. Stern’s new book, Raising the Floor, thus reflects a startling reversal. After leaving the SEIU, Stern spent half a decade talking to venture capitalists, CEOs, and worker advocates who were trying to envision the future of work. He came to believe that “unions, as important as they had been, were no longer the only or even the best way to achieve what would matter most to American workers in twenty-five years.” What happened? The putative robot revolution. Stern, along with many business leaders and economists, believes that as robots and learning machines infiltrate more and more fields, there will be substantially less work to go around. This has led a growing chorus in elite foundations and Silicon Valley to embrace a policy traditionally associated with the left: a universal basic income (UBI). Stern joins the crowd, proposing a UBI of $12,000 a year, a level that will eliminate grinding poverty without discouraging work and liberate citizens to care for children and elders, start companies, get more education, or volunteer in their communities. Drawing on his experience pushing through Obamacare and working on the Simpson-Bowles commission, Stern also suggests that conservatives and progressives in D.C. could unite behind that proposal, and he maps out funding options. The fight for basic income has found surprising support from a growing chorus of elite foundations and Silicon Valley. I greatly admire Stern’s political creativity and his willingness to challenge labor movement orthodoxy. Several years ago union staffers contacted me looking for “big-think” ideas around low-wage worker organizing and economic inequality. I too suggested a UBI, among other things, but was told that idea was a nonstarter. Union members who work for a living would not want their dues spent on policy innovations for non-workers, they seemed to feel, and in any event the union had far greater and more urgent challenges to address. I found that response frustrating, and still do. If designed appropriately, a UBI would be an excellent antipoverty program and would reduce economic insecurity for those above the poverty line. I am less sold on Stern’s broader political vision. Like many others in the future-of-work debates, he presents UBI as an urgent policy solution to a problem—massive technological unemployment—that has not yet materialized. Also like many others, he signals a willingness to cut welfare benefits in order to get conservatives on board. These tropes of mainline debate are unfortunate. They alienate progressives who might otherwise favor a UBI and cast the policy as a one-stop solution for economic inequality, which it is not. Mainline debate may also be politically naïve. Both to pass a UBI and to ensure its long-term viability, we need to limit rather than enhance market ordering. • • • Roughly speaking, there are two schools of thought about the risk technology poses to employment. The first says that we are at an inflection point in our economy or even in the history of capitalism, one driven by the use of advanced information technologies to remake ever more swaths of economic activity. Stern stands firmly in this category. So does journalist Martin Ford, whose Rise of the Robots (2015) is an excellent primer both on the underlying technologies and on their impact on blue-collar and white-collar jobs. The basic transformation, according to this camp, is driven by the automation of routine tasks. This process is, of course, as old as the steam engine; what’s new are the steadily lower cost of processing power, the gathering and analysis of enormous data sets generated by global internet use and mobile computing, and breakthroughs in computer science that enable new sorts of machine learning. The results include robots far more supple than those that populate assembly lines and AI processes that can mimic a wide variety of human judgments. An oft-cited study by two Oxford professors estimates that such developments could displace 47 percent of all U.S. employment over the next twenty years. As Ford makes clear, the threat extends to many jobs that have in the past seemed immune to automation, including those in warehouse work, food services, customer support, translation, and of course taxi, bus, and truck drivers—who, importantly, are the largest source of male employment in many states. In fact, Ford argues, even doctors, lawyers, journalists, consultants, and other white-collar workers are vulnerable. Automated document review has changed litigation practice significantly in recent decades, and IBM’s Watson, the self-learning machine that won Jeopardy in 2011, has now spawned a product that claims to do much of the basic legal research through which early-career associates at large firms cut their teeth. If it works well, we may see less hiring by such firms. The other school of thought, perhaps best exemplified by the work of MIT labor economist David Autor, points out that we’ve had this debate many times before—from the Luddites in the 1810s, to John Henry in the 1870s, through 1960s’ fears of computerization that even Martin Luther King, Jr., voiced in one of his final speeches. Each time, however, technological progress has led to creative destruction rather than ending work as we knew it. At the end of the Civil War, over half the country’s population labored on farms; by 1950 only around 12 percent did. The transition to an industrial society was very painful, but displaced agricultural workers typically could—and did—find jobs. The transition to a service economy over the last forty years has also been wrenching, but again opportunities have shifted, not evaporated. The threat of automation may focus the mind, but technology is already harming workers in a thousand smaller ways. Autor also asks that we acknowledge the limits of automation. Tasks that require tacit knowledge or emotional intelligence cannot be regularized as easily as assembly or data analysis can. Jobs requiring such skills may change thanks to technology, but they are very unlikely to vanish—including jobs in childcare, elder care, education, social work, personal services, and customer-oriented positions in hotels and restaurants. Lawyers and law schools will adapt to any artificially intelligent legal research tools by emphasizing other core lawyering skills such as writing, advanced legal analysis, and client counseling. Some of the more breathless writers on automation—not Stern or Ford—even imagine a future in which robots perform installation and maintainence tasks in homes and businesses. That prospect strikes me as extremely unlikely, since by definition houses and offices have different physical spaces, fixtures, wiring systems, and the like, making task regularization extremely hard, at least in the foreseeable future. As is probably clear, I am more sympathetic to the second school of thinking about technology and jobs. While the threat of automation may focus the mind, it seems to me far more likely that advanced technology is harming workers through a thousand smaller, different cuts. Lower communications and monitoring costs make outsourcing, subcontracting, and offshoring easier, severing the legal and social links between firms and their workers. Big data analytics help retailers predict the bare minimum their suppliers will accept for goods, driving down profits and workers’ wages. The network effects in two-sided market platforms give firms such as Uber enormous power to drive down compensation for drivers or to terminate them without due process. Background checks can uncover minor criminal histories or financial difficulties that eliminate applicants from consideration. Algorithmic scheduling leaves baristas and fast food workers without predictable hours. And all this plays out against the backdrop of globalized trade and investment, financialization, and the erosion of the welfare state, all of which shift market risks to workers. The result is that those with jobs are increasingly divided into haves and have-nots. The haves include those in the professions along with a small number of well-compensated managers at leading firms who develop production strategies. The have-nots comprise a growing number of freelance knowledge workers hired on a project-by-project basis and an enormous number of less skilled service workers. The have-nots are losing out along multiple axes: they lack decent compensation and reasonable hours; their work is precarious; and they have no formal representation in the workplace or the economy. Needless to say, women, people of color, non-citizens, and the poor suffer the most. Panic over automation just makes matters worse, allowing brick-and-mortar firms to resist worker demands for higher wages or paid sick leave: if workers start to ask for too much, the market reasoning goes, robots will look more and more attractive. The future of work is already here, in other words, and it looks grim. • • • If this is right, a UBI would be a godsend even if unemployment falls. By placing a floor below earnings, it would alleviate dire poverty and protect workers against the existential risks that accompany job losses today. It would also make it easier to move between jobs, relocate for work, or take time out of the workforce for training, education, caregiving, or just a salubrious break. Perhaps most important, it would sever the link between work and welfare, enabling all to obtain basic resources without the shame of an adversarial application process. And as Stern argues, if workers have a guaranteed minimal income, they’ll be better able to stand up for themselves at work—and in voting booths and civil society. But a standalone UBI can only do so much for workers, as Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols elucidate in their contribution to this debate, People Get Ready: the Fight Against a Jobless Economy and a Citizenless Economy (2016). McChesney and Nichols survey the same landscape that Stern and Ford do, but they argue that the challenge we face runs much deeper than automation. Their target is three decades of deregulated markets, which have created an oligopolistic political economy. Thanks to the weakening of antitrust enforcement and the explosive growth of tech companies with characteristics of natural monopolies, a handful of firms now dominate many industrial sectors: Walmart, Target, and major grocers in retail; Apple, Google, and Facebook in consumer tech; Amazon, Uber, FedEx, DHL, and UPS in logistics; fast food brands and restaurant chains in food service. That the finance sector sits atop this pyramid should by now be a matter of judicial notice. Without powerful unions or the support of the state, workers can’t hope to counteract such firms in either the economic or the political sphere. The technological determinism of many UBI proponents only reinforces the neoliberal state. In my view, our current path of technological development will only make matters worse. For one thing, robots themselves will become an important capital investment. As Ford notes, Uber’s move toward autonomous cars may heavily centralize car ownership, since many consumers will no longer feel a need to have an automobile. But Ford doesn’t follow that argument to its conclusion: that if one company controls urban transportation, that company may become politically untouchable. What’s more, Uber’s power pales in comparison to that of some other Silicon Valley firms. At a recent conference I argued that Google could soon become a state-within-the-state. Several technology policy experts laughed—not because they thought I was being dramatic, but because they felt we crossed that Rubicon some time ago. The massive investments in data-gathering and processing necessary for advanced machine learning make it the provenance of a handful of firms, who will then control who can use their AIs, and how. McChesney and Nichols therefore propose broad structural reforms to create a more egalitarian political economy: rejuvenating antitrust enforcement to break up large firms, treating certain essential companies as public utilities, limiting the activities of financial firms, reforming campaign finance laws, and creating multiple paths through which citizens can build and exert countervailing power, including rejuvenated unions. And they call for nothing less than a basic restructuring of our economy to ensure that everyone enjoys basic goods—food, water, education, health care, child care, transportation, and wifi—by making them the state’s responsibility rather than leaving them to market forces. We need more of this kind of thinking in the future-of work-debates. A stand-alone UBI looks remarkably tame in comparison—a variation on the traditional tax-and-transfer welfare state rather than a fundamental redistribution of property rights. In fact, McChesney and Nichols dismiss a UBI as little more than a means to bolster consumerism. If we’re going to have a major fight over work and welfare, they say, we should “fight for a world where [our] concerns are central, and not struggle to be extras in a world of, by, and for the rich.” That’s absolutely correct, but it shouldn’t rule out a UBI, which could be layered atop a liberal economy or a social democratic economy. Nothing in the policy precludes a more fundamental rethinking of social and political relations. Still, McChesney and Nichols are right to highlight some very problematic aspects of mainstream UBI support. • • • Many UBI proponents embrace market ordering and consumer welfare to the detriment of democracy and social equality. Historical support for the policy among neoliberal giants Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman is a frequent reference point, including by Stern, and leading advocates have often suggested that a UBI would enable labor market deregulation. While Stern endorses minimum wage hikes and enhanced collective bargaining rights in the short term, he echoes deregulatory logic in places, at one point stating that a UBI would make “a minimum wage less necessary.” The underlying argument is now canonical within welfare economics and legal scholarship: taxation is a more effective means of redistribution than regulation is, and it doesn’t contract markets the way regulations can. Policymakers can therefore ensure both efficiency and equity through market ordering and transfers. We must fight for a UBI as one component of broad structural reform to create a more egalitarian society.  But that argument has glaring flaws. Applied to minimum wage laws, it disregards the emerging consensus among leading economists that raising the wage within historical limits will not reduce work opportunities. It also disregards the close relationship between economic power, political power, and social power that McChesney and Nichols highlight. And in some cases it just plain misses the point. As I’ve argued elsewhere, minimum wages do far more than just alleviate poverty. They help undermine status hierarchies and relationships of domination in the workplace, bolster the state’s legitimacy with workers, encourage norms of shared sacrifice, and deter certain very punishing forms of work. Such laws will be even more important if a UBI is limited to citizens; otherwise non-citizens will perform all menial work for meager wages, as citizens ascend to a sort of rentier class. Support for a UBI coupled with labor market deregulation makes sense, however, if one thinks that markets are the optimal form of social cooperation—or at least the best we can realistically hope for—and if one distrusts the regulatory state. The technological determinism of many UBI proponents only reinforces this worldview by suggesting that employment regulations encourage further automation. A similar faith in market ordering and skepticism toward democracy may explain Stern’s rejection of a “participation income”—a basic income conditional on performing some volunteer work or civic service. Such a program, he writes, would spark “endless debates on what we, as Americans, should value and do, instead of leaving those issues up to the more efficient, free-choice mechanism of people simply spending their money.” But isn’t that precisely the debate we should be having? Depending on its institutional design, a participation income could emulate workfare and poor laws, or it could be radically democratic. Moreover, even if we were to opt for a UBI rather than a participation income, there is no reason simply to shunt all social choice processes thorough the market. We could also encourage deliberation around social goals, including priorities for state funding and what sorts of goods should be provided by the state, the market, and the civic sector. To be clear, I don’t think Stern has completely given up on democracy or egalitarian politics. But he is operating within mainstream UBI debate, which tends to endorse or at least presuppose a neoliberal state—one limited to creating and policing competitive markets—and is therefore prone to overemphasize entrepreneurship. Norms of shared responsibility, in this worldview, should not be enforced by the state, nor should the state concern itself too much, if at all, with “private” relationships like employment. This vision is both morally unappealing and contrary to lay conceptions of economic fairness, which affirm social equality and reciprocity among citizens. A distributive scheme that taxes income while leaving underlying property rights intact will be unstable, moreover, since those bearing the tax burden will surely resist it with all their substantial power. • • • These are not minor concerns. They get at deeper problems with our faith in markets: social organization always involves politics, and what looks like spontaneous ordering is always enabled and constrained by institutions. As Karl Polanyi showed, the most acute moments of conflict over technological progress occur when it enables economic practices to outrun social practices. But the solution is not to buy off a hoard of displaced workers armed with pitchforks. Rather, it is to fight for a UBI while rebuilding a robustly democratic state that can enact broader progressive reforms to tax and welfare policies, subject large firms to far greater oversight, and protect workers and the unemployed in the here and now. Such reforms aren’t just good policy but also good politics, since they can help rebuild faith in the state. A standalone UBI simply cannot. How about we shelve "basic income" and demand jobs for all at living wages instead? —Reader Comment Join The Discussion On Facebook Love Boston Review? Then you’ll love our new membership program!

(Photo: DANIEL SATO/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Getting some of the best and brightest computer programmers in the country to consider a job in Wilmington can be a challenge, at best. Even the biggest city in the nation’s second smallest state barely rates against more alluring destinations such as Boston, New York City and Silicon Valley. Throw in a few Murder Town headlines and selling young coders on the city can seem near impossible. That’s why some of the leading voices in Delaware’s burgeoning tech scene are turning to the promise of bragging rights and cash prizes. And it appears to be working. Nearly 200 programmers from around the country are expected to put their skills to the test during this weekend’s finals of the inaugural OpenBracket Delaware coding competition at the Grand. STORY: Delaware jobless rate holds for third-straight month STORY: Delaware public records gold mine: new open data portal The live problem-solving challenges devised by the Palo Alto startup HackerRank will begin Friday afternoon and continue through a Saturday evening block party on Wilmington’s Market Street. “There’s going to be two bands, a light show and just real party atmosphere,” said lead organizer Ben duPont, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. “We want this to be as cool as possible to really showcase what the city has to offer.” While the coders will be competing for a $15,000 grand prize, some of the state’s top financial institutions will be competing for them. Sponsors such as JPMorgan Chase Co., Chatham Financial and Capital One are planning to host events at restaurants along Market Street where they plan to pitch themselves to the assembled whiz kids. “We are viewing this as a prime opportunity for our technology recruiting efforts,” JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick said. “We’re not only sponsoring events that can help spotlight career opportunities at our company, but we’re also trying to showcase parts of Wilmington, such as the Lower Market area, that people might not otherwise experience.” Delaware entrepreneur and venture capitalist Ben duPont  (Photo: NEW CASTLE COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) Events like OpenBracket Delaware are examples of Wall Street’s new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools along with people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from anywhere else, including gifted dropouts. Banks also need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can’t possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree and still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. Gregory Furlong, for example, spent five years working 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a local Best Buy. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So the 30-year-old enrolled in Zip Code Wilmington, a 12-week coding boot camp co-founded by duPont. The school’s coursework incorporates HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and its competitors promise to suss out talent in the rough like Fulong. “This is purely about skill,” said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. “Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts.” The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. “Finding people through alternate channels, we weren’t doing that five years ago,” said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan’s global technology division. “Now we absolutely do it, because we’ve seen it work.” There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart.

The firm announced in late 2015 it will add 1,800 Delaware jobs by 2019.  (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL) HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients. Finance firms aren’t the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. “The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job,” said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. “There’s a lot left to luck.” Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can’t show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they’ve been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers’ code. In 2012, they were accepted into a Silicon Valley startup incubator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. HackerRanks’ competition model has certainly caught on with programmers. More than 7,000 coders applied to compete in OpenBracket’s initial online trials last month. Less than half of the prospective competitors were able to complete the intensive logic problems. But about 35 recorded a perfect score. Those programmers and about 150 others were offered stipends of $200 to $500 to attend the finals in Wilmington this weekend. “Ideally, we want these jobs to be filled with students from University of Delaware, Wilmington University and Zip Code Wilmington,” duPont said. “But it also doesn’t hurt if we can get these folks to move here and help establish Wilmington as a world-class coding and software technology hub.” Bloomberg reporters Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell contributed to this story.

Brands CEO Creed: We'll Keep Growing in U.S. Yum China listing in New York ring-fences volatile division Carving out China businesses could unlock value, analysts say Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Global consumer companies trying to find a business model for China’s burgeoning domestic market will be watching closely as one of the oldest Western brands in the country starts a new strategy. Yum! Brands Inc., which opened its first KFC restaurant in China in 1987 and also operates Pizza Hut outlets, has been losing market share thanks to a food-safety scare, changing tastes, increasing local competition and a host of other challenges that foreign companies face in China. It carved out its China operations into a separate company, Yum China Holdings Inc., which begins trading today in New York. Ring-fencing the business, the largest independent restaurant company in China with 7,000 outlets and more than $900 million cash on hand, offers Yum a number of advantages in dealing with a fast-changing market. Yum’s example could provide a road map for other global consumer brands in the world’s most populous nation. Yum China has issued 386 million shares at $24.36, which puts its valuation at around $9 billion, according to New Jersey-based research firm Edge Consulting Group LLC. The stock rose about 2 percent to $24.85 as of 9:59 a.m. in New York, while Yum Brands gained 0.7 percent to $62.49. “When their China operations get so big and are clearly catering just to the China market, splitting off could unlock a lot of value for shareholders,” said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. “If I were an activist hedge fund investor, I would be looking at carving out brands within large conglomerates that are China plays.” Doing so allows Yum’s management of the China business to tailor its operations and products more swiftly to changing local conditions, such as the menu preferences of diners in different parts of the country, mobile-based payments systems, hiring and other factors. It also helps tap Chinese investors willing to pay high premiums for a stake of an international brand’s China operations. Yum sold a combined $460 million stake in its Chinese business to Primavera Capital Group and an Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. affiliate, Ant Financial Services Group, in September. For a quick wrap of analyst commentary today, click here. In recent years, Yum has ceded market share to local competitors because it was slow to react to market changes, said Rein. “They didn’t make corporate decisions quickly enough, such as in adopting mobile payments, or adapting to consumers wanting more premium offerings,” Rein said. “Their ability to deal with the more complex environment here was held back by the lack of knowledge, the slowness of the U.S.” Localization of offerings at KFC and Pizza Hut outlets in China will be an important component of the firm’s strategy for the country, Yum China Chief Executive Officer Micky Pant said at a briefing Tuesday in Shanghai. The company plans to increase investment in new outlets across its brands and does not plan to raise more capital, he said.

Photographer: David Bartruff/Corbis via Getty Images An activist hedge fund investor upset with the company’s handling of its China business is how Yum China came into being. After a food-safety scandal in 2014 and cheaper local competition torpedoed Yum’s sales and profit in China, Corvex Management founder Keith Meister in mid-2015 urged the company to  split off its Chinese operations -- which contribute about half the group sales -- saying that the move could generate an additional $16 a share in value for the Louisville, Kentucky-based company. Yum’s total share of China’s market for fast-food chains dropped to 30 percent last year, from 40 percent in 2012, according to data from Euromonitor International. While sales have been growing again in China in the mid-single digits since late last year, the company has suffered from consumers shifting to healthier options and domestic chains sprouting up with more variety. Volatility Reduction Unlike Yum’s U.S. operations, where most of its restaurants are run by franchisees, Yum China directly operates over 90 percent of its outlets and plans to triple the number to more than 20,000 in the long term. Yum’s spinoff would reduce volatility for its remaining business, while “giving investors with a higher risk tolerance access to a more pure-play China growth story,” said Jonathan Morgan, an analyst for Edge Consulting. “China’s economic slowdown could induce other U.S.-listed restaurant stocks to spin off their China businesses, to protect their core businesses.” So far, companies with China consumer arms have often chosen instead to sell the division to a local competitor and take a stake in that business instead. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in June sold its e-commerce platform Yihaodian to China’s second-largest e-commerce company, JD.com Inc., for a 5 percent stake in JD. In August, Uber Technologies Inc. surrendered after a year-and-a-half battle with Didi Chuxing and agreed to sell its business in China. It departed the country in exchange for $1 billion in cash and a 17.7 percent stake in Didi. McDonald’s Corp., meanwhile, is seeking to sell its 20-year mass franchise rights for China and Hong Kong for a reported $2 billion. Starbucks Corp. is the only other major U.S.-listed food and beverage chain in China beside Yum, which owns and operates its outlets, numbering 2,400 stores across 110 cities. China, Starbucks’ largest international market, represents the most significant opportunity for the company, said a company representative. The company has no intention to change its operation model in the market, according to the spokesperson. Jackpot Valuations “What we’ve seen across various industries is that foreign players eventually pull out or find a local partner,” said Hong Kong-based S&P Global Ratings’ restaurant and retail analyst Shalynn Teo. “It’s the local market knowledge and local relationships that determine which foreign businesses survive in China, and local players will always have an edge.” With Chinese investors paying a premium for market share, such deals can prove attractive, said Peter Fuhrman, CEO of Shenzhen-based investment bank and advisory firm China First Capital. “As long as Chinese investors are offering jackpot valuations, Western companies will all want to look hard and long at selling up,” he said. Those that don’t face the need to tailor their businesses to China’s widely diverse and morphing consumer market. Only from March this year did KFCs in China began accepting WeChat Pay; they started accepting Alipay mobile payments in July last year. Yet the country leads the world in the use of such transactions, with four out of 10 Chinese consumers using mobile payments at physical stores, research firm EMarketer  estimated. Starbucks stores in China still do not accept Alipay or WeChat, only Apple Pay, a decision which costs them 5 to 10 percent of sales, estimates China Market Research Group’s Rein. Starbucks launched its own mobile payment system in China in July, allowing customers to pay with preloaded Starbucks Gift Cards via their mobile devices, according to the company. As China’s consumer market continues to grow, more overseas companies may consider following Yum down the path of segregation. “Four out of 10 spinoffs do not generate a return in the first year of separation,” said Edge Consulting’s Morgan. “How Yum China performs will help U.S.-listed companies evaluate their strategic options in China.” — With assistance by Rachel Chang Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Sal Pizarro/Staff) By Sal Pizarro | spizarro@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: October 31, 2016 at 2:55 pm | UPDATED: November 1, 2016 at 11:00 am Mel Cotton’s Sporting Goods has long billed itself as the place “where successful adventures begin,” but after 70 years, the San Jose store’s own adventure will be ending soon. On Monday, the store announced that it will be closing by the end of the year because the land beneath it has been sold to a developer, according to a news release from Mel Cotton’s. Al Sousa, 51, of San Jose, has been shopping at Mel Cotton’s Sporting Goods since he was a kid and was disappointed to hear the store would be closing at the end of 2016. “You don’t want to say it’s devastating, but it kind of is,” Sousa said. (Sal Pizarro/Staff)  While legions of loyal Scouts, camping families and hunters will eventually find somewhere else to buy their tents, skis and camouflage jackets, it’s definitely the end of an era. “You don’t want to say it’s devastating, but it kind of is,” said Al Sousa, of San Jose, who bought two kayaks at the West San Carlos Street store on Monday. “My dad brought us here when I was a child to get camping stuff, sporting goods, hunting and fishing gear.” What he’ll miss most, Sousa said, is the personal touch and the knowledge the store’s employees had. “The people here have always been like family to the customers,” Sousa said. Many of those employees were sharing memories of their own Monday with customers who were browsing through winter clothing recently put on the racks. Home from World War II, Mel Cotton — yes, kids, he was a real guy — started his business in 1946, back when “sporting goods” meant fishing rods, hunting rifles and tents. Ironically, Cotton told Leigh Weimers in a 1999 Mercury News profile that farmworkers, not recreational campers, were the biggest customers for his tents, as ranchers needed a place to house their employees. When the store moved to its present location in 1955, the 25,000 square-foot outdoors emporium was called Mel Cotton’s Tent City. Mel Cotton’s Sporting Goods, which first opened in 1946 and moved to its familiar home on West San Carlos Street in 1955, has been the outdoors gear store of choice for generations of South Bay families. (Sal Pizarro/Staff)  As suburbia and suburban interests grew around San Jose, Cotton began selling team sports equipment along with selling and renting ski boots and equipment — a market that got a big boost thanks to the popularity of Squaw Valley and the Winter Olympics that were held there in 1960. Youth groups like Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and 4-H Clubs also had long-running relationships with the store. “Ever since I was a boy, Mel Cotton’s was nice enough to give anyone who said they were a Scout a 10 percent discount,” said Eric Heckman, a San Jose financial adviser who is also a leader with Cub Scout Pack 116. “My two oldest sons got their backpack personally sized and fitted there, but sadly my youngest son will have to go somewhere else for his first Boy Scout backpack.” Stan Cotton, Mel’s son, took over the business in 1994. An avid sailor, Mel continued to travel with his wife, Dorothy, who died in 2002, and turned his attention to philanthropy, especially for the South Bay’s Jewish community. He died in 2008. Competition from stores like REI, Sportmart and even Walmart took its toll on the independent retail operation over the years. The opening of the massive Bass Pro Shops on Almaden Expressway in South San Jose last November was seen by many as the death knell for Mel Cotton’s. Last year, the land on which both the store and a neighboring plumbing and heating operation, O.C. McDonald, sit was under consideration for a housing development. But that plan, which would have included a new space for the store, was rejected by the San Jose City Council, which wanted to preserve the property for commercial use. “Since the business has maintained profitability, despite less than optimal weather conditions and new competition in the area, the owner explored all options to attempt to keep the business going,” the store said in a news release Monday announcing its closure. San Jose Planning Director Harry Freitas said that all the proposals approved for the site entail commercial and light industrial uses, but not residential. “We all will miss Mel Cotton’s and its history in San José, he said. “We had hoped for a proposal that would have kept it in place. ” It appears some sort of development will again be proposed — a hotel is the hot rumor. And whatever rises on the corner of Race and West San Carlos streets may be in the city’s best interests, but it won’t be the same. “Although the store will no longer be open, we hope that the sense of spirit and community that the store has stood for will live on,” the store’s news release said, encouraging customers to share their memories on its Facebook page (www.facebook.com/melcottons), which will continue “long after the building is torn down.” Tags:  Around Town Sal Pizarro Sal Pizarro has written the Around Town column for The Mercury News since 2005.

Chatter on social media in the city has shown residents are talking about a lack of pumpkins in the run-up to Halloween. Numerous residents have indicated that every major grocery store in Lloydminster reportedly sold out of the larger pumpkins which are usually made into the seasonal decorations. In an effort to confirm whether or not the pumpkin supply has truly dried up in the Border City, 106.1 The Goat called each major grocery store in Lloydminster this afternoon. According to the customer service desks of Safeway, Sobey’s, the Lloydminster Co-op Marketplace, Walmart, and the Real Canadian Superstore, the pumpkins are gone, and the shipments are finished. However, if you’re in desperate need of a pumpkin for tonight’s trick or treaters, both the Vermilion Co-op and Harps Family Foods still have some in stock. According to the stores, the Co-op had “five bins full” and Harps had exactly five large pumpkins.

RestaurantNewsRelease.com Restaurant News and Press Release Distribution Home About Contact Privacy Policy Submit Release Melinda’s Ketchups Sweep the Scovies; Hot Sauces Take Top 2 Awards Monday, October 31st, 2016   Mango, Garlic sauces claim top honors in ‘World’s Most Competitive Fiery Foods Contest’ Dallas, TX  (Restaurant News Release)  The 2017 Scovie Awards judging panel of top culinary experts honored Melinda’s with five awards at its annual competition recognizing the best spicy and savory food products in the business. The Scovie Awards (the Academy Awards for all things spicy) ranked Melinda’s spicy ketchups first, second and third place. That’s right, it was a clean sweep! Melinda’s Ghost Ketchup claimed the top spot, followed by Habanero and Jalapeño. All of Melinda’s Ketchups now come in plastic, upside-down squeeze bottles, making it even easier to get those award-winning flavors on your favorite dishes. “It’s a shame they didn’t award fourth and fifth places too, because our Chipotle and Black Pepper Ketchups feel left out!” said David Figueroa, Melinda’s Co-founder and Head of Brand Marketing. The accolades didn’t stop there. Melinda’s Mango Habanero Hot Sauce took top honors in the all-natural hot sauce category, followed by Melinda’s Garlic Habanero in second place. “We knew we were taking a bit of a risk putting Melinda’s up against all the new and trendy craft brands that have been popping up everywhere, but we were confident that our perfect balance of heat and flavor would be rewarded,” said Figueroa. “Sweeping the ketchup awards, and nearly doing the same in the all-natural hot sauce categories, is such a tremendous honor. We cleaned up!” Dave DeWitt, founder of the Scovie Awards and the National Fiery Foods and Barbecue Show, noted that 131 total companies from 34 states and five countries (USA, Canada, Hungary, Croatia and Australia) entered the 2017 competition. Melinda’s spicy ketchup product line was first introduced to the market in 1998. Its recipes combine fresh chile peppers and real cane sugar instead of the High Fructose Corn Syrup favored by the mass-market brands. And as with all its quality products, Melinda’s ketchups are Kosher-certified and contain no artificial preservatives or colors, zero gluten and no GMOs. Melinda’s hot sauces are derived from vegetables and fruits – unlike most sauces that are primarily vinegar – and expertly crafted to perfectly balance heat and flavor. Melinda’s packs the heat at four different levels – X for Hot, double X for Extra Hot, triple X for XXXtra Hot and four X for the XXXX Reserve – giving fans the options that are best for them and what they’re cooking. The company’s extensive product line features Passionately Crafted Pepper Sauces™ with exotic ingredients from around the world. Flavors range from tangy and mild – like Garlic Habanero and Mango Habanero – to downright incendiary, including Red Savina, Ghost Pepper, Naga Jolokia Pepper and Scorpion Pepper. Melinda’s upside-down squeeze ketchups are available at Central Market and Walmart stores, and are expanding rapidly at retailers nationwide. Melinda’s pepper sauces are served at thousands of restaurants and retailers from coast to coast, including Whole Foods, Kroger, Albertsons, Central Market, H-E-B and Walmart. To find a retailer or restaurant with Melinda’s near you, visit Melindas.com/store-locator. About the Scovie Awards The Scovie Awards Competition accepts entries for two months during the summer and the judging is held the Monday of the week between the New Mexico State Fair and the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. The judging, which is not open to the public, consists of 80 to 100 judges, mostly food professionals, who sample products in coded cups in a “blind tasting.” They fill out judging forms and rate the products according to eye appeal, aroma, flavor, and heat scale.

(Ted S. Warren/AP) Ballot Question 2 is the most expensively fought voter referendum in Massachusetts history. Proponents and opponents of efforts to lift the cap on charter schools in the state have already raised an astonishing $33 million. The donations for and against Question 2 are more than the $30 million spent on all ballot questions in 2014. Those massive amounts have raised a lot of questions about who's financing these efforts. On the no side, 99 percent of the funding came from teachers unions. On the yes side, three-quarters of the funding came from five nonprofit groups, which are not required to disclose their donors. The largest backer of Question 2 is a New York-based organization called Families for Excellent Schools. We requested to speak with their CEO, Jeremiah Kittredge, but they declined. Of the rest of the funding in support of Question 2, nearly $4 million came from private donors who gave more than $10,000, including Jim and Alice Walton of the Walmart chain, Ray Stata of Stata Venture Partners, Charles Ledley of Highfield Capital Management, and Seth Klarman of the hedge fund the Baupost Group. We reached out to several of these large donors. They either declined, or didn't return our messages. Except for one. Guest Chuck Longfield, chief scientist at Blackbaud, a company that develops software and services for the nonprofit sector. He donated $100,000 in support of Question 2.

But, she adds, “We love it!” However, they do return to Japan occasionally to visit family. While attending Women’s Art College in Tokyo, Kazuko studied oil painting. But it wasn’t until she came to Oregon that she learned how to make pots—at Rogue Community College. Now, pottery is her passion. Young works in her home studio near Williams, where she specializes in the most spectacular of ceramic techniques, known as raku. In Japanese, raku means “comfort” or “ease.” But the process of doing raku is anything but easy. Ms. Young first heats the bisque-fired pots to 1800 degrees. Then she reaches into the kiln with long tongs and pulls the orange-hot pots quickly out of the heat. Immediately, she plunges the glowing ware into a bed of combustible material, such as shredded newspaper, pine cones, sawdust, straw, or leaves, to create an oxygen-poor atmosphere that brings out textures and colors that can be achieved in no other way. Part of raku’s attraction for potters is the drama, and part is the unpredictability of the process. Abrupt temperature changes—from the fire to cool air to sawdust—can cause pieces to crack, or even explode. But when it works, the result can be bright, sometimes iridescent, colors. Some raku glazes will “crackle” on the surface of the pot, producing a jigsaw-puzzle look, against a rich black background of unglazed clay. She notes, “The designs come out of my imagination.” Her inspiration, she says, comes from the natural beauty of trees, flowers, animals, fish, rivers, mountains, the ocean, and the sky. Currently, she is also experimenting with sculpture, particularly small animal pieces. Young’s work is featured at Gallery One in Grants Pass and at Touchstone Gallery in Yachats. But, on the weekend before Thanksgiving, you can meet her in person at the Clayfolk Show and Sale, November 18-20th, 2016—perfect timing for holiday shopping. Before you go, you may want to peruse images of Ms. Young’s work, at the Clayfolk website: http://www.clayfolk.org/project/kazuko-young/. With more than sixty-five clay artists, the Clayfolk event is the largest all-clay art show in Southern Oregon. Most of the exhibitors live and work in Southwestern Oregon—but some hail from as far away as Bend, Portland, and Northern California. Holiday shoppers at the Clayfolk Show will find both decorative and functional pottery, including dinnerware, jewelry, tiles, sculpture, and garden art, crafted in porcelain, stoneware, earthenware, along with Ms. Young’s raku. This year the Clayfolk Show moves to a new, temporary location in Talent: the Brammo Building, (the old Talent Wal-Mart) located at 300 Valley View just off the freeway at exit 21. The doors will be open Friday from 4:00-9:00pm, on Saturday from 10:00am to 7:00pm and on Sunday from 10:00am to 4:00pm. Admission is free. The best selection, of course, will be available when the Show commences on Friday afternoon—coincidentally, when the live music begins. Then on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers will see pottery-making demonstrations by several ceramic artists. Also on Saturday (10:00am-5:00pm) and Sunday (11:00am-3:00pm) children can work with clay, under the supervision of Clayfolk members. See ad this page.

"What we pay attention to is our profits after 10 to 20 years." JD.com is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's biggest competitor in China's online shopping market, which is on track to show almost $700 billion in spending this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Unlike Alibaba, the Beijing-based company has invested heavily in its own fixed assets such as warehouses and delivery trucks to ensure good service, and facilitate the buying and selling of everything from electrical goods to boxes of kiwi fruit. JD.com's logistics network has also helped win more users through speedy shipping, and the company is competing with Alibaba to sell consumer goods, electronics and home appliances. Liu pointed to stepped-up investments in logistics automation as well as financial and technology services as areas that will ensure success for China's second-largest online retailer for the coming decades. E-commerce is already contributing substantial cash flow, Liu said. JD.com is on track to handle 14 percent of China's total 2016 e-commerce spending, compared with Alibaba's 78 percent, according to JP Morgan. The bank's analysts, led by Alex Yao, said in August that JD.com's gross-margin improvement was positive, but had a cautious view of its operating expenses. "The investment for growth could delay JD's path to profitability," Yao said, pointing to rising expenses and competitive pressure from Alibaba. On Oct 20, the company announced new initiatives in its partnership with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, including adding a Sam's Club to its website and two-hour delivery in select cities. JD.Com is also pouring large amounts of capital into new ventures, including an expansion into Southeast Asia via Indonesia, new financial services such as online loans and cloud-computing products. Liu's strategy is to emulate Amazon.com Inc by investing early profits back into new and existing businesses to grow scale and market share, according to Mitchell Kim, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities. "The asset-heavy model will probably not generate profit for the foreseeable future," Mitchell Kim said. "If you look at the margin difference of Alibaba versus JD, JD just does not have the profitability and cash-flow to invest in all these other new areas whereas Alibaba does."

Star file photo i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story In what’s shaping up as a preemptive move, the Olathe City Council on Tuesday will consider creating a large STAR bond district later this year to cover the former Great Mall of the Great Plains site. According to Olathe officials, there’s no plan yet to develop the former mall site, which has been substantially demolished to prepare it for an eventual redevelopment. Instead, the city wants to ensure that the sales tax revenue bonds, known as STAR bonds, can be used if and when a development plan surfaces. “We want to preserve our ability to use that should the appropriate project come up,” said Tim Danneberg, an Olathe spokesman. The law that allows STAR bonds expires on June 30, 2017, meaning the tool goes away unless the Kansas Legislature reauthorizes it. Even if STAR bonds don’t expire, they probably will be subject to closer scrutiny by lawmakers, some of whom believe the incentive has been used without enough oversight. That concern also, in part, prompted the timing of last week’s announcement that STAR bonds would pay for up to half of a $160 million proposal to build a new complex for the American Royal near the Legends shopping district in Wyandotte County. “I think there was, less on our part and more on the state, an urgency to get this district set up,” said Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kan., spokesman Mike Taylor. “Just in case.” STAR bonds allow a tourism development project, one that’s deemed significant enough to draw a sizable number of visitors from 100 miles away or farther, to use local and state sales taxes generated by the attraction to repay up to half the debt on a project. They’re considered one of the more potent development incentives in the region. STAR bonds were first used to support the development of Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County. Since then, STAR bond projects have spread out in Kansas. The Village West shopping district, Children’s Mercy Park (both in Wyandotte County) and the Museum at Prairiefire (in Overland Park) are examples of STAR bond projects. Last week, STAR bonds were envisioned as up to half of the funding source for a proposed $160 million American Royal complex near the Legends. An earlier proposal for the American Royal, which surfaced late last year, drew the ire of Kansas legislators. That proposal contemplated redirecting state sales tax revenues from the Village West and Legends STAR bonds in Wyandotte County, which are set to be paid off early, and using that $42 million for the American Royal. “The districts can’t share in that type of revenue,” said Kansas Sen. Jim Denning, an Overland Park Republican and a chief critic of that previous American Royal plan. Other uses of STAR bonds have given lawmakers pause, such as including auto dealerships as part of STAR bond district. Auto dealerships, they say, hardly constitute tourism attractions. Controversy about STAR bonds predates the American Royal project. Lawmakers were unhappy when an erstwhile proposal to build a large aquarium at the Mission Gateway project, along with a Walmart Supercenter, meant that a nearby Walmart in Roeland Park would close and cost that suburb significant sales tax collections. That aquarium proposal never broke ground at Mission Gateway. The agenda for Tuesday evening’s Olathe City Council agenda lists the STAR bond item on the consent agenda, which suggests that the item should pass without much, if any, discussion. The agenda item would call for a public hearing to create a STAR bond district for the Great Mall site, as well as undeveloped ground to the north of the now-demolished mall, on Dec. 6. A STAR bond district could be created shortly after that hearing. The Great Mall amounted to a great disappointment for Olathe when it failed meet original projections for visitors and sales when it opened in 1997. The mall closed in 2015, and demolition of the mall started last summer. The property is owned by VanTrust Real Estate, a prolific Kansas City development firm.

RestaurantNews.com The Essential Resource for Online Restaurant News! Home About Subscribe Send News Advertising Restaurant Franchise Classifieds Restaurant Jobs Contact Privacy Melinda’s Ketchups Sweep the Scovies; Hot Sauces Take Top 2 Awards Monday, October 31st, 2016   Mango, Garlic sauces claim top honors in ‘World’s Most Competitive Fiery Foods Contest’ Dallas, TX  (RestaurantNews.com)  The 2017 Scovie Awards judging panel of top culinary experts honored Melinda’s with five awards at its annual competition recognizing the best spicy and savory food products in the business. The Scovie Awards (the Academy Awards for all things spicy) ranked Melinda’s spicy ketchups first, second and third place. That’s right, it was a clean sweep! Melinda’s Ghost Ketchup claimed the top spot, followed by Habanero and Jalapeño. All of Melinda’s Ketchups now come in plastic, upside-down squeeze bottles, making it even easier to get those award-winning flavors on your favorite dishes. “It’s a shame they didn’t award fourth and fifth places too, because our Chipotle and Black Pepper Ketchups feel left out!” said David Figueroa, Melinda’s Co-founder and Head of Brand Marketing. The accolades didn’t stop there. Melinda’s Mango Habanero Hot Sauce took top honors in the all-natural hot sauce category, followed by Melinda’s Garlic Habanero in second place. “We knew we were taking a bit of a risk putting Melinda’s up against all the new and trendy craft brands that have been popping up everywhere, but we were confident that our perfect balance of heat and flavor would be rewarded,” said Figueroa. “Sweeping the ketchup awards, and nearly doing the same in the all-natural hot sauce categories, is such a tremendous honor. We cleaned up!” Dave DeWitt, founder of the Scovie Awards and the National Fiery Foods and Barbecue Show, noted that 131 total companies from 34 states and five countries (USA, Canada, Hungary, Croatia and Australia) entered the 2017 competition. Melinda’s spicy ketchup product line was first introduced to the market in 1998. Its recipes combine fresh chile peppers and real cane sugar instead of the High Fructose Corn Syrup favored by the mass-market brands. And as with all its quality products, Melinda’s ketchups are Kosher-certified and contain no artificial preservatives or colors, zero gluten and no GMOs. Melinda’s hot sauces are derived from vegetables and fruits – unlike most sauces that are primarily vinegar – and expertly crafted to perfectly balance heat and flavor. Melinda’s packs the heat at four different levels – X for Hot, double X for Extra Hot, triple X for XXXtra Hot and four X for the XXXX Reserve – giving fans the options that are best for them and what they’re cooking. The company’s extensive product line features Passionately Crafted Pepper Sauces™ with exotic ingredients from around the world. Flavors range from tangy and mild – like Garlic Habanero and Mango Habanero – to downright incendiary, including Red Savina, Ghost Pepper, Naga Jolokia Pepper and Scorpion Pepper. Melinda’s upside-down squeeze ketchups are available at Central Market and Walmart stores, and are expanding rapidly at retailers nationwide. Melinda’s pepper sauces are served at thousands of restaurants and retailers from coast to coast, including Whole Foods, Kroger, Albertsons, Central Market, H-E-B and Walmart.

Home View Current Issue PDF Business Directory Advertising Rack Locations Contact A & E Business Community Dining Features Health Kids & Families Schools Seniors News Updates   Home / Community / Metrocenter Mall not being razed Metrocenter Mall not being razed November 2016 A rumor circulating about the demolition of Metrocenter Mall has prompted mall officials to assert that Metrocenter isn’t going anywhere. “The public’s response confirms what we’ve known for a long time—that Phoenix residents hold a special place in their hearts for this retail landmark,” said Warren Fink, chief operating officer for Carlyle Development Group, the owner of Metrocenter Mall. “We feel the same way, which is why we’ve worked so hard to create concepts that will revitalize Metrocenter without losing its history.” According to Fink, this includes a number of different concepts in the planning stages, but none at this time that include a complete demolition. Despite rumors floating around Phoenix that Metrocenter Mall is slated for total demolition, the only building that has come down thus far is the old Broadway department store, which was razed in November 2015 to make way for a new Walmart Supercenter that is set to open next year (photo by Teri Carnicelli). “Our vision is to create a mixed-use palate that makes the very best use of this site—both its existing space and parts of the property that can support redevelopment or new development, such as senior housing, multifamily housing, corporate office, healthcare and additional retail, restaurant and entertainment amenities,” said Fink. “Shoppers flock to this type of dynamic combination. It’s what communities want and it’s what we want to provide. This will almost certainly include some level of redevelopment and new development, but not an entire demolition.” One of the first projects to move forward at Metrocenter has been the construction of a 148,000-square-foot Walmart Supercenter, which upon completion will sit directly adjacent to Metrocenter Mall, at the site of the former Broadway building. The development marks the single largest capital investment in Metrocenter Mall in decades. Other benchmarks on the horizon include the extension of Light Rail to the Metrocenter site, with an on-property Light Rail stop expected to be open and operational by 2023. “The bottom line is that there’s a tremendous opportunity to do great things here. We won’t be saying ‘goodbye’ to Metrocenter for a long time,” said Fink. “We will be saying ‘hello’ to a new hub that we hope will serve the community for years to come.” Like what you see? Share it!

Charged are Jessica A. Greiss, 23, and her mother-in-law Laurie A. Jacoby, 47, who both live at the same address in the 1300 block of Northampton Street in Easton, said Colonial Regional police. The pair about 7 p.m. Friday were nabbed at Kohl's department store at the Lower Nazareth Township mall after also allegedly stealing goods from Hobby Lobby, The Shoe Dept., Sally Beauty and Wal-Mart. DNA evidence links teen to stolen car, cops say Officers found $526 worth of stolen items from Kohl's hidden in a bag being carried by Greiss and another $1,075 worth of items from Kohl's in a bag being carried by Jacoby, according to police. Greiss also had in her possession items worth $448 from Hobby Lobby; $44 from The Shoe Dept.; $215 from Sally Beauty; and additional goods from Wal-Mart with a value still being determined, police said. Police said Jacoby had four prior theft convictions while Greiss was awaiting entry in the county's first offender's program for a prior retail theft. Greiss is charged with two counts of theft and receiving stolen property while Jacoby is charged with two counts of theft. Both were arraigned before District Judge Alicia Zito. The judge set 10 percent of $10,000 bail each for Greiss and Jacoby. In lieu of bail, both women were taken to Northampton County Prison. The judge ordered them to stay away from Northampton Crossings. Pamela Sroka-Holzmann may be reached at pholzmann@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow her on Twitter @pamholzmann.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 20 Photo: Issei Kato/Reuters/Newscom When the FBI Has a Phone It Can’t Crack, It Calls These Israeli Hackers Kim Zetter Kim Zetter 2016-10-31T15:12:14+00:00 Photo: Issei Kato/Reuters/Newscom Earlier this year, at the height of a very public battle between the FBI and Apple over whether the computer maker would help decrypt a mass murderer’s locked iPhone, it appeared that a little-known, 17-year-old Israeli firm named Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization might finally get its moment in the spotlight. After weeks of insisting that only Apple could help the feds unlock the phone of San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook, the Justice Department suddenly revealed that a third party had provided a way to get into the device. Speculation swirled around the identity of that party until an Israeli newspaper reported it was Cellebrite.  It turns out the company was not the third party that helped the FBI. A Cellebrite representative said as much during a panel discussion at a high-tech crimes conference in Minnesota this past April, according to a conference attendee who spoke with The Intercept. And sources who spoke with the Washington Post earlier this year also ruled out Cellebrite’s involvement, though Yossi Carmil, one of Cellebrite’s CEOs, declined to comment on the matter when asked by The Intercept. But the attention around the false report obscured a bigger, more interesting truth: Cellebrite’s researchers have become, over the last decade, the FBI’s go-to hackers for mobile forensics. Many other federal agencies also rely on the company’s expertise to get into mobile devices. Cellebrite has contracts with the FBI going back to 2009, according to federal procurement records, but also with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and DHS’s Customs and Border Protection. U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies use Cellebrite’s researchers and tools as well, as does the U.S. military, to extract data from phones seized from suspected terrorists and others in battle zones. The company is poised to seize a prominent and somewhat ominous place in the public imagination; just as Apple has come to be seen as a warrior for digital protection and privacy against overreaching government surveillance, Cellebrite is emerging as its law-and-order counterpart, endeavoring to build tools to break through the barriers Apple and other phone makers erect to protect data. “Vendors … are implementing more and more security features into their product, and that’s definitely challenging for us,” says  Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. “But we’ve solved these challenges before [and] we continue to solve these challenges today.” In July, months after the unknown third party provided the FBI with a method for getting into the San Bernardino phone — an iPhone 5C running iOS 9 — Cellebrite announced that it had developed its own technique for bypassing the phone’s password/encryption lock. And the company is confident that it will be able to deal successfully with future security changes Apple may make to its phones in the wake of the San Bernardino case. “If it’s going to be done, it’s going to be done in this building,” Carmil told The Intercept during a visit to the company’s Israeli headquarters earlier this year. Cellebrite’s ascent comes at a time when mobile forensics has never been more important to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Data extracted from phones has eclipsed data extracted from desktop and laptop computers in recent years, since the former can yield not only detailed logs about a user’s activities, interests, and communications, but also, in many cases, map the user’s whereabouts over weeks and months to produce a pattern of life.  The story of Cellebrite’s emergence as a forensic powerhouse is the story of how mobile forensics itself has evolved over the years — beginning first in the late ’90s with a simple tool for migrating user contacts from one cellphone to another, which morphed in 2007 to a solution for harvesting address book data from PDAs and feature phones, to the complex multistage operations needed today to bypass the sophisticated security mechanisms built in to smartphones. Ahead of Competitors Cellebrite isn’t the only forensic game in town. It has a number of rivals around the world, each with varying strengths and weaknesses. They include the Swedish firm MicroSystemation AB, also known as MSAB, whose XRY tool is used by the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military and others; the U.S. firms Susteen, Paraben, and BlackBag Technologies; Magnet Forensics, a Canadian firm; and Oxygen Forensics, a Russian firm whose customers include, according to its website, the IRS, U.S. Army, DOD, DHS, and the Justice Department. But Robert Osgood, an FBI supervisory agent for more than 25 years until he retired from the bureau in 2011, says that Cellebrite and MSAB are the leaders. “They’re the two 800-pound gorillas in the mobile forensic device world” when it comes to extracting data, says Osgood, who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University. “I would be lying to say it is still close — because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition.” —Heather Mahalik, advanced mobile forensics trainer, SANS Institute. Although he says the FBI buys other forensic tools, they are primarily used in specific niches — for example, parsing and analyzing subsets of data, such as data associated with social networking apps, after it has already been extracted using a Cellebrite or MSAB tool. Heather Mahalik, who trains about 400 federal and local law enforcement workers a year in advanced mobile forensics for the SANS Institute, says that even among these two giants, Cellebrite has been edging out its competitor over the last two years. “There are uniqueness and little tricks in both of them that really help … but I would be lying to say it is still close [between them], because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition,” she told The Intercept. Mahalik says she surveys her students each year to see which tools they’re using on the job. Two years ago, Cellebrite and MSAB were almost neck and neck, but these days, she says her students mention only Cellebrite. A 2012 annual report from MSAB acknowledges that Cellebrite penetrated the U.S. market before it did, which helped it gain an advantage as a result. Cellebrite’s forensic tools include the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), hardware bundled with proprietary software that acquires, decodes, and analyzes data from smartphones, tablets, and portable GPS devices; the UFED4PC, which is standalone software for use on a PC; and the UFED Pro, an add-on to the UFED that does something called physical extraction, which siphons data directly from a phone’s flash memory chip. This can include deleted SMS messages and call histories as well as data collected by the phone and apps that the user is unaware is being collected. The company doesn’t help governments remotely hack into phones for real-time surveillance, as the NSO Group, another Israeli firm, reportedly does; Cellebrite focuses only on forensics — collecting data and artifacts already created and stored on phones. Physical access to the phone is required for their work. Cellebrite’s edge lies in its ability to extract data from more mobile operating systems and chips than its competitors, often producing solutions faster than rivals. Each time a new version of a mobile phone or an update to an existing operating system is released, Cellebrite’s team of reverse engineers goes into assault mode to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other hidden pathways that will give the engineers access to data the phone makers have worked hard to block. In some cases, they’re already working on new phones before they’re released. That’s because some vendors — Cellebrite won’t say which ones, but Apple isn’t among them — ship a sample of their new phones to Cellebrite three months before they’re released, giving Cellebrite engineers a head start in cracking the devices. It’s a practice that dates back to the company’s original business, selling gear to cellular carriers that helped their customers migrate contacts from one phone to another.  The company doesn’t put all of its forensic techniques into its automated tools, however. To prevent competitors from reverse-engineering its software to uncover and steal its unique methods and to prevent phone vendors from discovering the vulnerabilities used in its techniques and patching them, some exploits are only performed manually by its staff. Its new solution for extracting data from iPhone 5C’s running iOS 9 — the San Bernardino phone — can only be performed by a Cellebrite worker as part of the company’s Advanced Investigative Services division, also known as CAIS. This is a premium unlocking subscription service that costs $250,000 a year in the U.S., according to a DEA procurement record, and will also get customers help in bypassing encryption on the iPhone 4S and 5, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5, and some Galaxy S7s, among other devices. Though Cellebrite will also unlock phones as a one-off service, for about $1,500 per phone. Bypassing encryption, the most vexing problem law enforcement faces today in mobile forensics, is one of Cellebrite’s biggest selling points. The company says it has been able to “crack the code to the screen locks” on a number of phone models, allowing it to access data on the phones without a password. “Encryption is a show stopper for most of the industry,” Tal told The Intercept. “Except for us.” Technology used to extract data from mobile phones, developed by Cellebrite, is pictured at an international forensic laboratory in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 22, 2013. Photo: Colm O'Molloy/Boston Globe/Getty Images How It Began Cellebrite employs about 520 people, most in Israel, including workers at a manufacturing facility in the southern part of the country that makes its UFED devices. The company is a subsidiary of the Japanese Sun Corporation, which took ownership of 80 percent of the firm in 2007. And although Sun doesn’t influence the company’s strategy or direction, Carmil says, its secretive corporate culture appears to have affected Cellebrite’s approach with the media. “We are not telling so much about ourselves. What we tell is what Sun has allowed us to publish,” Carmil told The Intercept. Cellebrite’s headquarters in Israel occupies several floors of a mid-sized office tower in Petach Tikva, a small city east of Tel Aviv that was once a malarial swamp until Jewish pioneers drained it in the 19th century to make way for citrus groves. The groves have largely been replaced today with hi-tech business parks like the one Cellebrite shares with IBM and Intel. Its modern office space was dim and quiet during an afternoon visit by The Intercept in June, except for the sound of Hebrew rock playing softly on a floor where researchers worked. Down a hallway leading to the research offices was a device lab resembling a large, highly organized shoe closet that contained more than 15,000 mobile handsets stored in carefully marked boxes. These are phones that Cellebrite has bought or received in advance from vendors over the years to analyze.  About 200 new phones arrive to the lab monthly, each containing different versions of operating systems and configurations, since carriers like Verizon and AT&T like to customize the branded phones they offer customers by tweaking the operating system to disable and enable different features. There are also burner phones – pre-paid throwaway phones that criminals and terrorists often favor because they offer anonymity – and phones from China that pose a special challenge to extracting data because they often lack uniformity and standardization in their design. Each phone that arrives to the lab gets a manual inspection to determine the software that’s running on it and any operating system changes the vendor has made since previous versions. A screen outside the device lab in Cellebrite’s office shows the system for tracking devices that have been assigned to researchers. Photo: Kim Zetter for The Intercept Cellebrite has five forensic research teams: the team that reverse-engineers phones to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other means of extracting data; a team that focuses on translating binary data into a readable format; a cloud data team; and two teams who work on analytics, which involves mining data to create leads from different sources of data — for example, to cross-reference data extracted from a phone to determine all the locations a suspect has been in the past month. The analytics team is also working on being able to automatically identify activity in video extracted from mobile devices — an act of violence, for example. The reverse-engineer team that Tal leads, which is responsible for finding ways into phones, has about two dozen people. “I don’t know what the NSA has for mobile research, but in the forensics industry I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have,” says Tal, who joined the company late last year after leading the vulnerability research team at the Israeli security firm Checkpoint.  All of this belongs to Cellebrite’s new life as a mobile forensics firm. But the company didn’t begin life in forensics. “In the forensics industry, I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have.” —Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. Cellebrite launched in December 1999 with a tool that was only designed to transfer the contents of an address book from one phone to another. Back then, transferring contacts was a time-consuming task that was generally done manually. But Cellebrite developed the Universal Memory Exchange, a handheld device that resembled the clunky credit card readers airline stewards use to charge for in-flight beers, which could transfer data between any two phones, regardless of make and model. They later added capabilities for backing up, restoring, and synchronizing data as well. They sold the device initially only to telecoms and phone stores — first in Israel and Europe, then in the U.S. By 2005 Cellebrite says the UME was in more than half of all Verizon and T-Mobile phone shops in the U.S, in addition to the phone departments of big-box chains like Best Buy and Wal-Mart, something The Intercept was unable to confirm. “Every place that offers cellular-handset selling, repair, and exchange activity, Cellebrite was there,” Carmil asserts.  The UME became so integral to the mobile phone business that any time a vendor launched a new phone, it shipped an advance sample to Cellebrite to ensure that the UME would work with it. “Because we got all of [the phones] from the mobile operators … no one could compete with our phone support offering for a long time,” says Carmil, who was vice president of Siemens’s commercial division in Israel before joining Cellebrite. “We came with 1,500 [phones] supported, where the competition … were struggling for 100 or 150.” Cellebrite touts this advance look at phones as one reason for its competitive advantage in forensics. Though MSAB and Paraben, which don’t receive advance phones, naturally downplay early research like this, saying it can be counterproductive. “Many of the times the device firmware will change so much before the release that a lot of the deep research required for forensics must be redone [if done in advance of a device’s release],” Amber Schroader, CEO of Paraben, told The Intercept. By 2006, Cellebrite was selling its UME devices to law enforcement and security forces in Israel and abroad. It was at this point that the company’s new customers developed a novel use for the UME that caught Cellebrite’s attention — they were using it to extract call logs and other data from phones seized in criminal investigations. The method worked well for generating investigative leads, but the extracted data wasn’t forensically sound to serve as evidence in court. So the customers, Cellebrite won’t say which ones, asked for a way to show courts that data hadn’t been altered after it was removed from a phone. Cellebrite only had 18 employees at the time, but Carmil and co-CEO Ron Serber immediately saw the potential in steering the company in a new direction. “We realized that there is a market [for mobile forensics] which is already existing and established,” Carmil says. The next year, they released their first forensic tool, which was basically an extension of the software they were already using to transfer, back up, and restore data, but with a hash function thrown in to certify the integrity of extracted data. “That was the beauty of the whole story,” Carmil says. “We brought the same capabilities to a completely different core business.”  A hash is a cryptographic representation of data. Run text or data through a mathematical algorithm and you get a value that represents the data. But alter the data or text, and you get a different hash when run through the same algorithm. By comparing the hash of data on a phone with the hash of data presented in court, prosecutors could show it hadn’t been altered. It can also verify that the output from two different forensic tools grabbed the same data — if hashes of the two sets of extracted data are the same. Over time, as the number of mobile phones and data formats grew, Cellebrite added features for decoding varying formats and analyzing extracted data.  The company wasn’t the first to enter the mobile forensics field. Micro Systemation beat them to it with a mobile forensics tool in 2003; Paraben came out with a forensic tool for PDAs in 2001, followed in 2004 by a tool for mobile phones. But Cellebrite’s solution could process data from CDMA and TDMA phones, unlike competitors.  It was easy to extract data from mobile phones a decade ago, says Leeor Ben-Peretz, executive vice president for products and business development at Cellebrite. The devices had none of the sophisticated security protections they have today and there was a lot of public documentation that detailed programming interfaces, so researchers for the most part didn’t have to reverse-engineer operating systems and applications to understand how they worked. All of that changed in January 2007 when Apple introduced the iPhone, a smartphone that blended music, email, text messaging, web browsing, camera, and desktop applications with an easy-to-use touchscreen interface. The following year, Apple added GPS to the phone. It was a forensic bonanza for law enforcement, but Apple wasn’t generous with its documentation the way other phone makers had been. And as subsequent versions of the iPhone came out, Apple added security protections, including encryption, that made it even more difficult to extract data. Cellebrite scrambled to expand its research team. Carmil won’t say why — he’s silent on a lot of things about the company — but it seems to have coincided with the forensic challenges the iPhone brought. Cellebrite went looking for skilled reverse engineers, particularly among former members of the Israeli military’s Unit 8200, the famed tech and signals intelligence unit where many of the country’s elite hackers and vulnerability researchers hone their skills. Tal, Cellebrite’s 33-year-old director of research, hails from the unit. The research efforts paid off and the company’s forensic business soared, as shown by federal procurement records, particularly among U.S. law enforcement. Cellebrite has held about 230 federal contracts over the years, with the first dating to late 2007 when it signed contracts with the DEA, Secret Service, and the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. The National Guard Bureau of Tennessee purchased six UFED devices in 2008, noting in its procurement document that the DEA already had “over 200” of them. On September 11, 2009, the FBI appears to have signed its first contract with Cellebrite. And by the end of that year, the company says more than 4,500 UFED devices were in use around the world.

Photo: Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Something else was happening to push sales in the U.S., according to Christa Miller, Cellebrite’s former director of mobile forensics marketing from 2012 to 2015. Wireless carriers were storing customer text messages for only short periods of time, and law enforcement was desperate to find a way to get evidence from customer devices even after it vanished from telecom servers and after users deleted it from their phone, Miller says. So in November 2009, Cellebrite launched a new product, the UFED Physical Pro, to extract data from the flash memory chip of phones, including deleted data.  There are two primary ways to retrieve data from mobile phones — logical extraction and physical extraction. Logical focuses on content and data the phone allows you to extract naturally through its application programming interface, or API, such as contacts and text messages. Sometimes the method for extracting the data is well-documented, sometimes it’s not and requires reverse-engineering; but in general, the presence of the data is readily apparent to a user or piece of software. Physical extraction, by contrast, gets data from a phone’s flash chips that’s not normally available, like deleted information. In August 2010, Cellebrite developed the means to do physical extractions from iPhones on the market at the time. By 2012, the company was also able to extract deleted messages from BlackBerry and Motorola devices, the latter using a technique that bypassed the user lock.  And in 2014, Samsung’s Galaxy S4 family of devices fell to the company’s physical extraction methods as well. MSAB began offering its own physical extractions from flash memory in 2010. Cellebrite is secretive about its methods, but a lawsuit the company filed against MSAB in 2013, accusing its competitor of stealing its Samsung and BlackBerry techniques, offered a few clues about the company’s process. It asserted, in regard to Samsung devices, that the technique didn’t require the phones to be powered-down first to do the extraction and that the solution involved a vulnerability in the phone’s memory, or RAM. Cellebrite’s researchers also had to locate several “landing addresses” in the RAM where they could inject a custom bootloader they created. A bootloader is code built in to a smartphone that launches the phone’s operating system when someone turns on the device. But Cellebrite’s custom bootloader halts the normal boot process in a way that allows their tool to then access and read the phone’s memory. Cellebrite’s other solution, for the BlackBerry smartphone, relied on a vulnerability the company found in the process that BlackBerry phones used for authenticating BlackBerry software delivered from a desktop computer to the phones, which allowed them to load their bootloader to the phones. The Cellebrite bootloader, the company wrote in its lawsuit, piggybacked on the official signed BlackBerry bootloader, “thus tricking the extremely sophisticated BlackBerry security protocols” into allowing the Cellebrite bootloader to run on BlackBerry devices in place of the legitimate bootloader.  Methods like this for doing physical extractions, however, were soon thwarted by Apple and other vendors, who began to increase the security of their phones by encrypting data stored on the devices and adding other security protections. A physical extraction yields a greater wealth of information over a logical extraction, unless the data extracted is encrypted and therefore unreadable. The problem was particularly acute with iPhones. “Modern iPhones, if the user configures them correctly, are virtually impossible to get into,” says Osgood.  In June 2009, for example, Apple introduced full-disk encryption with iOS 3 and the iPhone 3GS (the term “full-disk encryption” has come to refer to routine encryption of all data stored on a device, even those, like the iPhone, that do not actually use a physical disk). It was the first stage in the Going Dark problem for law enforcement, though it was only a partial eclipse, since the encryption key was not user-generated but was generated from a unique ID embedded in the phone, which meant Apple still had the ability to unlock phones. With iOS4, Apple introduced a file-encryption scheme that used a key derived from the user’s password and the embedded ID. Apple also added a time delay of 80 milliseconds to password guesses, which made it harder, though not impossible, to bruteforce the user’s password. Then with iOS 8, Apple expanded the data it encrypted on the phone — photos, messages, contacts, call history — and added even more delay to password guesses. By the ninth failed password, the wait became an hour before another password could be tried. If the user enabled an erase feature, the decryption key would disappear altogether after 10 failed password attempts. Despite measures like these, Cellebrite has developed methods to get around or disable encryption in a number of phone models, including iPhones, though certainly not all of them. “If you can do it, the competitive barrier is huge,” says Ben-Peretz. “And this is where we excel.”  In June 2015, for example, Cellebrite developed a way to unlock Apple devices running iOS 8, without the risk of erasing the encryption key. Earlier this year, a forensic specialist in Italy, stymied by an iPhone 5 running iOS 8, reportedly paid $1,500 for a Cellebrite team to help get him into the phone. This doesn’t mean full-disk encryption isn’t still a challenge. Encryption is “definitely more complex than it was five years ago or 10 years ago,” Tal says. “There are more and more mechanisms involving encryption. … And today our typical forensic capability would be constructed out of several chains of blocks, each of which [is] solving a different technology layer or mechanism in order to provide the eventual result.” To defeat password locks and encryption, the company has developed custom bootloaders that in some cases can interrupt the boot process of the legitimate bootloader on a phone before the operating system loads and before the password-locking mechanism kicks in. The details of how it does this vary depending on the phone, says Tal. And the process for cracking an iPhone is much more complicated than this, though he won’t elaborate. A lawsuit Cellebrite filed last year against Oxygen Forensics touched on its solution for disabling the screenlock on some Samsung Android devices. According to a court document in the case, Cellebrite developed special lock disabler code — commands that can run on the phones, despite their screens being locked, and disable the locks. Cellebrite did something similar with LG Android phones, by identifying which files on the phone control the screen-locking function and manipulating them to disable the lock.

Photo: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Limits of Encryption Cracking Bollö, the MSAB CEO, admitted that encryption is hard for his company to address, though he told The Intercept, “we have solutions for either working around or trying to bypass” encryption. Asked to elaborate on those methods, however, he couldn’t provide a clear example.  “It is not as simple as getting around encryption or not,” he wrote in an email. He noted that these days, the problem isn’t just the extra security and encryption built in to phones themselves, but also the encryption in mobile apps. “I think both Google and Apple have more than 2 million apps on their app stores, and each app has their own database or encryption — they are updated 10 times as often [as phone operating systems],” he said during an interview in the company’s Virginia office. “That’s a much bigger challenge than specific phones.” Indeed, each forensic tool can only extract data from a small percentage of apps, so they focus on the most popular ones that are likely to yield important forensic data. The data for each app requires decoding if it’s in a special format. And once data is extracted, it has to be analyzed and presented in a format customers can understand. This is largely what makes mobile forensic tools so expensive — the many variations of phones, operating systems and applications they have to address. Mobile forensic tools can cost $10,000 to $14,000 for the base tool or software, with an additional annual subscription for upgrades — the release notes for new versions of Cellebrite’s tools and software list dozens of mobile apps and mobile handsets and operating systems that are newly supported by each upgrade. Tal says the breakthroughs they achieve in cracking phones are rewarding, but his research team gets other satisfaction from the work. “You see murderers, you see child molesters get behind bars because of data that we extracted yesterday, and it’s a very immediate connection with the purpose of what we’re doing here,” he says. “We’re not just security researchers who work on this forensic capability to make money for the company; there’s a story behind this for the people.” Cellebrite, he insists, gives highly skilled researchers a more ethical and acceptable outlet for their talents than, say, selling vulnerabilities and exploits to questionable buyers as some researchers do. He doesn’t name names, but researchers at the Citizen Lab in Canada recently found that Cellebrite’s compatriots at the NSO Group had supplied iPhone zero-days to the United Arab Emirates government to install a spy tool on a phone used by a local human rights activist. “[T]here are a lot of very good people, very good talents in this space who don’t necessarily feel very comfortable working for someone who may sell their product to a foreign government that may or may not use it against journalists in their countries and oppressive regimes,” Tal says.  He says their customers are first-world Western law enforcement agencies and notes that he’s had interest from a lot researchers lately who have been expressing an interest in working for Cellebrite “because they know the research we do doesn’t go into the ‘shady’ areas. We have a strong ethics backbone, a clear-use case for our capabilities, and dramatically less potential for abuse should ‘evil customers’ attempt to deceive us.” This doesn’t mean that Cellebrite is without controversy. The company works at the epicenter of an increasingly important U.S. policy debate about government use of computing vulnerabilities and exploits for surveillance purposes and about how keeping those vulnerabilities secret leaves the devices of millions of people vulnerable to intruders of all sorts. Apple still doesn’t know what iOS vulnerability the mystery party used to help the FBI hack into the San Bernardino phone, leaving many iPhone users at risk of someone else using the same vulnerability on their phones. Tal says Cellebrite’s researchers have deliberated at times about disclosing vulnerabilities they found to vendors, but won’t say if they’ve actually disclosed any. “Sometimes we do want to disclose a vulnerability because we think that’s in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of maintaining some aspect of privacy and security,” he says. “But then of course [the] forensics business is entailed with getting access to information the vendor maybe did not want you to have access to. So there’s somewhat of a delicate dance around this.” Related Contact the author: Kim Zetter✉kkzetter@​gmail.comt@kimzetter Additional Credits: Additional Reporting: Jenna McLaughlin.˅ ⎕ 20 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Thoughts From The Publisher’s Desk – October 28, 2016 Oct 27,2016 by Steven Green Until this week, I confess to not being aware of the “topfreedom” movement, but I sure am now after this week’s story and online buzz in response to it. On the surface, it seems so obvious that women shouldn’t be allowed to go topless as men can do. It’s indecent and far too revealing for the general public in our country. After a closer look and reading about this “topfreedom” movement, these advocates have a valid point when it comes to “Equal Protection” laws. It seems societal condemnation of bare breasted women is rooted in private beliefs rather than law. That’s why Worcester County State’s Attorney Beau Oglesby filed a request with the Maryland Attorney General’s Office seeking clarity and direction on how to proceed with Chelsea Covington’s request from his office that, “if men can go shirtless, Equal Protection requires that women be allowed to go topless too.” After looking over her blog, “BreastsAreHealthy,” Covington is clearly an advocate for the “topfreedom” movement. She has done her homework on the matter and has gone topless on the beach in Ocean City several times and many other places. In fact, she reported on her blog, “I’ve gone bare-chested in Ocean City between 20 and 30 times in the last two years. By and large people ignored me, as they should.” Over those two years of going topless, Covington states only one time has she been given any trouble. In that case, she said a fellow beach-goer complained to the lifeguard on duty. She reported she wasn’t arrested “because Maryland law allows it.” She said the complaint allowed her to have the desired conversations she has wanted for some time with the beach patrol, police department and then Oglesby’s office. This really is a fascinating situation and one that clearly could be precedent setting dependent on how the attorney general opines. While that’s being drafted, Covington seems content on spreading her message. On her blog this week after our online story was published Monday, she wrote, “At its core, topfreedom is about creating equality, reducing victim blaming, bullying and body-shaming and to promote body positivity and autonomy in girls and women. No one is saying women should go bare-chested.  We are saying we should have the choice, as men freely do. Neither Maryland nor Ocean City will be remotely inventing the wheel on topfreedom or gender equality.  Female breasts are healthy, nurturing body parts.  It will feel new at first, but it will be normal and okay very quickly.” Although it may not seem that way to many, commercial development along Route 50 has been slow. This is especially the case along the stretch from Holly Grove Road to Seahawk Road, which was identified 20 years ago as areas prime for commercial growth. While there are several reasons, including the economic downturn in the last decade, the main issue currently is it’s too expensive to develop. The cost associated with permitting and building and the outrageous square-foot prices being charged have derailed numerous efforts in the past. One of the objectives of the Design Guidelines and Route 50 Corridor Plan Task Force is to make it easier to develop along the highway, specifically at the Ocean Landing Shopping Center area where Walmart and Home Deport are the anchors. Worcester County Economic Development Director Merry Mears put it this way. “Worcester County is now in the position to grow this area substantially, and it must be done responsibly, with significant input from the business community,” she said. “I’m encouraged by the cohesiveness of the members involved, and I look forward to the outcomes of our work.” Governor Larry Hogan is fed up and he’s no longer mincing words about the continual opposition to his post-Labor Day school start Executive Order, including this week’s resignation of a state school board member. During a conversation last week with Comptroller Peter Franchot and Lou Peck, political editor of Bethesda Magazine, at a breakfast hosted by the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce, Hogan got some things off his proverbial chest. “You may not know this, because it has been ignored by the media, and the tiny minority of vocal opponents, but the decision on starting school after Labor Day was thoroughly vetted and overwhelmingly approved by a legislatively-mandated, nonpartisan commission made up of school administrators, school board members, education professionals, teachers, PTA members, and parents. The commission studied this issue in depth and addressed every concern, disproved every false claim, answered every question, overcame every objection and then voted 12-3 to start school after Labor Day,” he said in a rant. “The previous governor, the President of the State Senate, the majority of legislators, and the Comptroller all strongly support starting school after Labor Day,” Hogan said. “Most importantly, it is supported by an overwhelming super-majority of parents, teachers and students. It is my job to serve the people of Maryland, and I will never stop doing what is best for our students and families.” I take exception to the covered up by the media part because we have reported the task force’s findings numerous times, but I agree with everyone else. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Steven Green The writer has been with The Dispatch in various capacities since 1995, including serving as editor and publisher since 2004.

 The CEO of £1.4 billion software giant Xero says AI will be 'transformational' for finance Oscar Williams-Grut and Sam Shead Oct. 31, 2016, 5:11 AM 2,496 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rod Drury, Xero CEO and founder/ Xero The CEO and founder of cloud-based accountancy software giant Xero says artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies will be "transformational" for finance over the next few years. Rod Drury told Business Insider during a recent interview in London: "We’ll see more innovation in the next 2 years than we have in the last 10 years, all driven by AI." The Xero founder says: "We’re getting a massive hit on the R&D we’ve done around machine learning and AI. We think it’s going to be transformational for the industry. "If you capture information from the bank statement and the invoice and the bills that are flying through, you can actually programme things to do a whole lot of work for you and you’re just checking and making fixes, which trains the machine." Xero's accountancy software helps small and medium-sized businesses manage their accountants in the cloud but Drury believes much of the management — things like categorizing expenditure and sending accounts to be checked — could be automated by "smart" AI and machine learning programmes, which learn the habits of your business. "You can build unique system for each business," says Drury. "The first innovation in cloud accounting was actually getting these transactions into the cloud. The second generation that’s happening now is getting all these big data, machine learning, AI, over these massive data sets which is super interesting." Gary Turner, Xero's UK MD, added: "Specialised AI is, I think, much more interesting. We’re taking a discreet function or process that either doesn’t exist today because someone hasn’t had access to such a large data set or automating what was previously important but not really value additive, tasks like accounting." Gary Turner, Xero's UK MD. Xero Drury, who founded Xero in New Zealand in 2006, says the benefits of AI and machine learning technologies will be felt in the wider finance world too. "We’re getting a fantastic hit because the fintech space is a relatively small domain with massive amounts of data and it’s inherently high value. I think it’s going to be one of the areas where you see AI and machine learning really take off. The ability to reduce risk for banks, fraud reduction." There has been a surge in interest in AI over the last few years with tech giants like Google and Facebook investing hundreds of millions into the field in a bid to make their platforms and personal assistants smarter. This new appetite for AI, which comes after a period known as the AI winter, has come about partly as result of advances in computer processing power and partly as a result of advances in subfields like deep learning and reinforcement learning. Algorithms underpinned by AI are now capable of learning and mastering the most complex board games, driving cars, and detecting cancers. However, advances in AI and machine learning, as well as robotics, have led to fears that many people could be put out of a job by machines and computers. The World Economic Forum claims the world is on the cusp of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," caused by the rise of robots and artificial intelligence. WEF estimates that these technologies could potentially put 5 million people out of work by 2020. A joint study by Citi and Oxford University earlier this year estimated that an incredible 77% of jobs in China could be at risk of automation, while the figure stands at 57% of jobs across the OECD. Foxconn, Walmart, and the US Department of Defence — 3 of the world's top 10 employers — have also already begun replacing manufacturing, warehouse, and combat roles with robots. Unfortunately, most of the conversation is restricted to the Hollywood AI, Skynet Terminator and that kind of thing. — Gary Turner, Xero UK MD Drury says that Xero's adoption of AI will not mean the end of accountants — but says they will need to change with the times. He told BI: "We don’t think this is the end of the accounting industry, we think a lot of the manual process goes away and then it becomes about growth strategies and actually thinking about the business. "We’re seeing accountants become more like business consultants. They need to know about crowdfunding because for early stage businesses that might be the right way to get funded. They need to integrate point of sale systems to accounting software. As the software gets smarter it just creates more and more opportunities to add value." BT CEO Gavin Patterson and HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver made a similar point at the HSBC Innovation Summit on Friday. Patterson told the audience: "It's quite possible that 80% of the jobs that people do today won't exist in the future," while Gulliver added: "There may be new jobs that emerge and our responsibility is to manage that transition." Xero's UK MD Turner says: "More specialised application of AI we think is maybe only a year or two away. That’s much more about extending the ability of an individual rather than replacing them. "But unfortunately most of the conversation is restricted to the Hollywood AI, Skynet Terminator and that kind of thing." Xero has over 700,000 subscribers around the world and employs 1,600 people globally, including 172 in London. The company has a market capitalisation of NZ$2.4 billion (£1.4 billion) in its native New Zealand. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 5 Top Fintech Predictions by the BI Intelligence Research Team.

They've got nicknames like Python, Cyclone, Diva and Biscuit. At first, you'd think twice about messing with any of them. And that's just what the Bikers Against Child Abuse are counting on. Sporting patches on their leather vests reading, "No child deserves to live in fear," the northwest Indiana club aims to harness the cultural perception of bikers as big, scary dudes to empower children who've suffered at the hands of abusers. "I saw for myself the need, the gap that needs filled," local member Darren "Python" Williams said. Statewide, dozens of children die each year from abuse or neglect, according to the Indiana Department of Child Services. Many more are injured, physically or emotionally - the state's child abuse and neglect hotline fielded more than 17,800 calls in September alone, DCS statistics indicate. As foster parents, Williams and his wife have met children trying to escape abusive situations, including one child the couple fostered a few years ago. "I was at a point with the foster care system, and what goes on with kids in general ... I was so frustrated," Williams said. Helping abused children heal takes time, he said, and if they cross paths with their abuser, they can experience a huge setback. So that's where the Bikers Against Child Abuse come in. A horse farmer just outside Logansport's north edge, Williams and his wife, Tonya "Cyclone" Williams, have been part of the international club's local chapter for about the last three years. Like all BACA members, they had to go through background checks and training and be in for at least a year before getting further involved. Now, he's the local chapter's child liaison, which means he puts more than 10,000 miles a year on his 1994 Harley Heritage traveling to initial meetings and other gatherings with all the families hoping their child can be "adopted" into the biker brotherhood. Williams estimates he's handled at least a hundred cases over the last few years. Once leaders have decided to take on the child's case, they gather as many members as possible for a meetup with the child and the rest of the family. That's the "adoption," as Williams called it. "That's when the big group shows up at their house and we make a lot of noise." Literally - "you can hear us coming from miles away," another chapter member, Natalie "Diva" Brouwer, said. The child and any siblings get a leather vest with special patches designed just for kids involved in the biker club. They also get a backpack and a teddy bear. Before presenting the teddy bear, bikers tell the child they've each hugged it to fill it with love. They encourage the child to hang on tight to their teddy bear if they feel afraid, at least until one of the bikers can stop by, explained Brouwer, of Rensselaer. After the big get-together, the child is assigned to two bikers who cooperate with the child's therapy team. Mainly they're there just to provide a sense of safety. The bikers tell the child to call anytime, day or night, if they feel they need to. "It can be 'I passed a test,' it can be 'I was bullied today,' or it can be, 'I thought I saw my perpetrator at Wal-Mart and now I'm having a nightmare,'" Brouwer said. " ... Some of our kids hardly call us and others call us every day. Whatever it takes for them to not be afraid." And as a woman, she's an important member, if you ask Williams. Some abused children are much more comfortable around women than men. But, Brouwer added, "the guys have their place, too." "We have some big and scary guys, and ugly too, they tell everybody," she said. "That's kind of one of the things they lean on with certain children. I'm bigger, I'm uglier, I'm scarier than anything that's going to come after you. Try have them come after me." However, Brouwer emphasized, the bikers "are not vigilantes." "We do empower the children ... to speak up and report, and we're happy with that," she said. They do so in part by attending court appearances if the child wants them to come along. They recently showed up in Cass County Circuit Court to sit with the first Cass County child they've assisted. A court date can be traumatizing for a child who's been abused, Cass County Deputy Prosecutor Noah Schafer said. "For a child to face down their attacker and abuser in the courtroom ... comes close to reliving the entire experience for them," he said. "So to have big strong, friendly faces around them is a great thing." That's why he supports letting members of the public attend hearings to comfort victims. But at first, that wasn't what he thought the bikers meant to do. "Not to stereotype a group of people, but when a group of bikers dressed up to ride... my first reaction was a little worried, 'uh oh, what's about to happen here?'" Schafer said. "But when I realized what they were here for - especially when I saw the victim's face, when she felt safe and secure ... I was happy to have them there." He said as prosecutor, he can't invite groups like BACA because he can't be seen as trying to strong-arm a defendant. But he praised the bikers for taking extra steps to show respect and deference to authorities. "When one of them stood up," he recalled, "and really it was just to leave the courtroom to go to the bathroom or something, they said 'No. Don't do anything disruptive.'" And while the bikers hope to empower the children, sometimes it works the other way around, Brouwer said. "We're not sure who's empowering who," she said. "This little bitty 8-year-old marching up to the stand ... and that 8-year-old will stand up and say, 'he did that to me and it's not right.' And I feel so much joy and empowerment in that, watching that small child get that much bravery and gumption." ___ Source: http://bit.ly/2dJ5pLF ___ Information from: Pharos-Tribune, http://www.pharostribune.com Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: News Indiana Associated Press Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.
