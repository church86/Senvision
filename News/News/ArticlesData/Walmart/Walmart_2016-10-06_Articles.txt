Can it avoid the fate of Wal-Mart Express? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 7, 2016 at 7:08PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  With a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com growing faster than ever, Target (NYSE:TGT) is getting squeezed in the middle. Comparable sales turned negative in its most recent quarter, falling 1.1%, reflecting a trend throughout retail as department store chains struggle across the board.  E-commerce sales growth is also losing steam. Though digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, that was down from 23% in the previous quarter, and, more importantly, the company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year. It now sees comps from flat to down 2% in the third and fourth quarters, which includes the key holiday season.   Thinking small The discount retailer is turning to a familiar strategy to stem sliding sales. It's looking to open smaller-footprint locations in densely packed cities and college towns. Other retailers, including Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Macy's, and Wal-Mart, have looked to smaller stores to expand their footprint and beef up sales. Target is opening up a slate of smaller stores in big cities and college towns in order to cater to the millennials that make up one of its core constituencies. This week it opened a 45,000 square-foot store in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, about a third of the size of the average Target. Near the University of Minnesota campus, a store 15% the size of a regular Target stocks items intended for college students like mini ironing boards and twin sheets. CEO Brian Cornell told The Wall Street Journal, "We could see hundreds of these. It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time."  In many ways, the small-footprint strategy fits well with Cornell's emphasis on signature categories, including health and wellness, baby and kids, stylish apparel and home goods. Those are all categories that millennials care about, and as young people have flocked to cities it makes sense for Target to follow them. Currently, those customers are driving Amazon's growth, as no major brick-and-mortar chain has made a play for them.  Avoiding Wal-Mart's fate At the beginning of the year, Wal-Mart announced it would shut down all 102 of its Walmart Express stores, a small-footprint concept scattered across the rural south, just a few years after launching the miniaturized chain. The Express stores faced several challenges. Wal-Mart struggled to get the product mix right, as operating small stores entails more than simply shrinking the Supercenters. It also opened many of them near existing Wal-Marts, obviating much of the need for a smaller version.   But Target's more upscale brand should give it an advantage, as should its focus on cities and college towns, places where shoppers may not have cars and therefore need convenient options close to home. Many of those cities are also devoid of Wal-Mart, as the retail giant has found it difficult to penetrate many of the nation's largest cities and is still without a store in New York. Instead of imitating Wal-Mart, Target may be better off following the lead of drugstores chain like Walgreen's and CVS, its new pharmacy partner, as that category has seen steady growth, with sales at health and personal care stores up 7.7% this year according to the Census Bureau. Sales at those stores have not only benefited from their selling more prescriptions, but they have also stocked more groceries, and consumers have turned to them for convenient "fill-in" trips. Target has to do more than just be a drugstore to make the small-store experiment work, but with its "cheap chic" brand it should be able to find the right mix between its signature categories and everyday staples like groceries and household items. While small stores could provide a valuable new revenue stream, it won't flip Target's sales slide overnight, as the company's most pressing problem is reinvigorating performance at 1,800 big-box stores. Grocery sales have been a problem, as the company has seen more spoilage than its competitors, and accelerating e-commerce growth would also be a promising sign. Still, with comparable sales headed negative for the rest of the year, the retailer could use some good news in the form of successful small stores to tout to investors.

According to the Weather Channel, "potentially serious" flooding may impact areas in Georgia, South Carolina, and southern parts of North Carolina through Saturday night. Flooding had already occurred along the Florida coast, including spots near Jacksonville Beach and Daytona Beach. Hurricane Matthew has caused major disruptions in retail stores across Florida, with Reuters reporting Friday that many Walmart locations had closed due to the storm: "A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes."

If you watched the first five games of this new-era-49er season you might be tempted to do the same. One notable quirk about the Queen of Hearts is that her commands were routinely ignored. No one was ever executed. So it will be for the folks on this blog who keep demanding the termination of this or that person in the 49ers hierarchy. The truth is that no one gets fired in York-land unless there is a sufficient breach in operational tranquility at 4949 Centennial (as there was with Jim Harbaugh) or in the abject event that the team wins less than a handful of games over a couple of years under a new, seemingly competent head coach. Barring such an eventuality, our only realistic hope for continuity in this franchise is from working within the status quo. It is therefore important to understand what the status quo actually is. Continuity and good coaching are essential ingredients to success in team sports. Letting players adjust to a good and flexible scheme, play faster and make fewer mistakes through repetition lifts the aggregate performance just as much as the infusion of talent. But the rate of influx and departure of talent is also an important variable largely independent of the first two, influenced as it is by the culture from the top of the organization. For example, the culture may determine what resources are allocated to scouting and re-signing homegrown talent, or for acquiring expensive free agents. Thus, it is important to understand the tension between a head coach’s vision and the owner’s fiscal policies, as these are at the core of the crucible within which continuity must be forged if the franchise is ever to experience success. I think we are now in the early stages of a phase in the franchise’s history that could just as easily turn out well as go down in flames. In the midst of such fragility it is sometimes easy to lose sight of context and keep shouting ‘off with their heads’. I will try and describe the context I see. Fans who impersonate the Queen of Hearts when faced with employees like Baalke, Marathe and even Jed often miss the fact that these men are simply extensions of a philosophy that originates at the very top: Daddy York. That philosophy is, fundamentally, a Walmart philosophy completely devoid of football vision but thoroughly imbued with a desire to maximize shareholder value. Indeed the only big ‘win’ the Yorks have experienced in the nearly two decades since they acquired operational control of the team is the building of a stadium that made the 49ers franchise one of the five most valuable in the sport. That’s something they care about. To understand the pedantic mind of a John York, go back to his public comments in 2000 when he dismantled the continuity of a proud franchise in order to ‘save money’. Nothing illustrates this better than the way he squandered cost-effective Pro-Bowl linemen like Derrick Deese (LT) and Kevin Gogan (RG) who, at the time, cost us 1.1 and 2.3 million annually, good deals even back then. If that period and the years of mediocrity that followed do not convince you, go back to the seventies. John, the young pathologist, spent an epic seven years as a postdoc trying to land a real job in academia, but without success. In science, seven-year post-doctoral stints are exceedingly rare and can mean only one thing — though, to his credit, John York eventually turned a smart trick and married into money. Which is why Daddy York and his pedantic mind can now direct our team’s fate from his dinner table as chief shareholder. Understand the man and you will instantly understand why Paraag Marathe is so loved by the Yorks for being ‘shrewd’ with player contracts, and why Baalke stocks up on late picks, scanning the boroughs for talent bargains each cycle — busted ACLs presenting no particular obstacle. It’s like shopping at Walmart. It would not be hard to imagine Daddy York vetoing the deal Baalke put together in Denver after Harbaugh’s dismissal — one that might have retained some continuity with Fangio while upgrading the offensive vision with Gase. Instead Daddy may have preferred the cheaper Tomsula option. Penny pinchers without vision make uninspired choices like this all the time. I know people who fit that mold. Their backyards are filled with rusted things that no longer work; though, at the time they were bought, those items were such a deal. Vision, on the other hand, is a rare thing to find in a head coach. After Walsh, we had to wait decades for Kelly. There is nothing more frustrating for a coach with vision and creativity than working for bosses without it. I know exactly how it feels. Kelly’s leverage is compromised by recent history, so he has to keep mum and suffer. For now. Having said all this, if there is a time to Walmart the team it is certainly this season, and I think Kelly must understand that too. In order to build continuity, there must first be something worth continuing. You can’t buy more than a handful of players in an offseason, anyway. The rest must come from those you draft over several years. Baalke did indeed draft a bunch of young guys, but their evaluation by Tomsula’s staff is not definitive — in part because Kelly’s system requires different skill sets (for example, zone blocking). Until the current staff knows who the ‘keepers’ are, it is hard to decide where to spend one’s offseason capital. The 49ers certainly have the cap so it is mostly a matter of knowing what to buy, even if one shops at Walmart. The key part of offensive continuity, which (in my view) is much harder to build than defensive continuity, is a franchise quarterback. The 49ers do not have such a player on their roster. Baalke has invested just one top-100 pick (Kaepernick) on a QB since the Ice Age. However, since it takes a couple of years for linemen and journeymen skill players to get their timing down in a new offense, it may make sense to draft a QB only after some semblance of stability has been built around that position (see: running game, pass pro). In the meantime, Alex Smith 2.0 would be fine as placeholder, and I think Kelly is trying to make Gabbert into that; though, so far, not successfully. So how should we see this dynamic tension between Kelly’s vision and Walmart in our quest to build continuity on the 49ers? What’s in the crystal ball? Here’s my guess, and it is only a guess: 1. More Gabbert (with a possible detour to Kaep). Gabbert helps prepare the team in practice with good and accurate execution, I understand, even if he does seem to beg a psychiatrist during games. (Blaine should talk to John Smoltz — what an inflexion point his sports psychiatrist was in 1991, both for Smoltz and the Braves!) With Garnett in there perhaps the run game will finally get traction, though Tiller is probably more solid in pass pro. Perhaps they can alternate and find out about both phases of the offensive game in alternating series. The play design that Kelly brings is clearly superior to what we’ve seen here in a while. Unfortunately, the execution is still very far behind, like teaching a teenager to gearshift on a Porsche. Until it catches up, Kelly cannot learn what plays of his current repertoire the NFL might have difficulty defending. BTW, If Kilgore goes down, one should note, the offensive experiment is probably lost entirely. Baalke failed to sign a free agent backup center, which I believe should have been a priority last offseason. 2. The defense will continue to bleed run yards, though I’m holding out some hope for Glen Dorsey (the only almost-healthy NFL-caliber NT on the roster). Not much hope, though. The ILB core was thin to begin with, they drafted no one, they signed no free agents, and they have now lost both starters to injury. There is zero NFL talent left at the ILB position and we will pay for it on run defense. But I was happy to see the emergence of Ray-Ray before his injury. He’s definitely a keeper. 3. The defense is finding some gems in pass defense, notably Rashard Robinson and Jimmie Ward, but I am also excited for Blair, Buckner, Redmond and Armstead to come into their own, especially now that Lynch is back. It takes a year for a DL to get NFL-wise, anyway. I watch the games now for flashes of promise for next year. All in all, counting IR, I see 14-15 ‘keepers’ on defense: Buckner, Armstead, Blair, Dial, Williams, Ward, Tartt, Reid, Brock, Reaser, Robinson, Bowman, Ray-Ray, Lynch, possibly Redmond. That is definitely the core of something worth continuing! 4. The receiving corps (TE and WR) is not a source of joy yet, but this may change as the OL improves, which it will. I had hoped that MacDonald would emerge, but he keeps getting hurt. Kerley is a ‘keeper’, I think. I reckon the bulk of the free agent dollars we Walmart this coming offseason could well be on WRs. 5. ‘Keepers’ on offense seem few: Hyde, Staley, Trent Brown, Tiller, Kilgore, Kerley, Torrey Smith, possibly Macdonald and Garnett (7-9). And let’s not forget Pinion/Nelson on ST. All told, I see a core of 23-27 core players so far. It’s a start. We need another 6-8 ‘keepers’ on offense, 3-4 on defense and a kicker. A good fraction of those missing parts could arrive in free agency and the draft this offseason. As for backups, I think we have plenty of those already. One last thought: So long as Chip Kelly gets the pieces he needs to implement his vision does he even care whether or not they were bought at Walmart?

The sale price is 11.9 times Atotech’s adjusted earnings for last year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Equity for the transaction is to come from buyout funds Carlyle Europe Partners IV and Carlyle Partners VI. Atotech, which had revenue of 1 billion euros (US$1.1 billion) last year, has more than 4,000 employees, mainly in China and Germany. RETAIL Wal-Mart sees flat earnings US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday predicted that earnings would be flat in fiscal year 2018 as it pumps up investment in e-commerce initiatives. Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins on Feb. 1 next year will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at US$4.15 to US$4.35 a share. The company forecasted an overall capital budget of US$11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from US$11.5 billion in fiscal 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the US in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135 to 155 stores. The company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018. INVESTMENT Norwegian fund posts profit Norway’s US$882 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, returned a profit in the third quarter thanks to strong stock markets, it said yesterday. The fund earned a return of 4 percent in the quarter, or 240 billion Norwegian kroner (US$29.7 billion), beating its benchmark by 0.2 percentage points. In the second quarter the fund booked a profit of 1.3 percent. “Equity investments performed strongest during the quarter with positive returns in all regions. This was the main contributor to the fund’s results,” fund deputy chief executive Trond Grande said in a statement. AVIATION CIT sells leasing unit The CIT Group, a commercial lender, on Thursday agreed to sell its aircraft leasing business to a Chinese-owned competitor for about US$10 billion, signifying a big step by CIT to slim itself down in the face of pressure from investors. CIT is selling its aircraft leasing unit — which owns and manages 334 planes and has an additional 133 on order — to Avolon Holdings Ltd, which is based in Ireland, but is owned by the HNA Group (海航集團) of China. CIT will use the proceeds to pay out more than US$3 billion to its shareholders and to further bolster its balance sheet. RETAIL Seven & i restructuring Seven & i Holdings Co unveiled a restructuring plan to divest struggling department stores and set up a real-estate division, in a bid to focus on boosting profit at its core 7-Eleven business. The new unit, to be created this fiscal year, will explore redeveloping property occupied by under-performing general merchandise stores into housing for seniors or other residential and commercial facilities, company president Ryuichi Isaka said on Thursday. Seven & i also announced a capital alliance with a local retailer and is to transfer three Sogo & Seibu department stores to the partner. Seven & i Holdings shares yesterday fell the most in three months in Tokyo trading in the wake of the plan’s announcement. This story has been viewed 1240 times. Comments will be moderated.

Stock Market Showdown: Target vs. Wal-Mart U.S. News & World Report - Money 10/5/2016 Lou Carlozo © (Getty Images) Which mega retailer will come out on top? Though the shelves at your local Target Corporation (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) may be stocked well, you still won't find any stock on those shelves – not the kind that makes investors wealthy, anyway. Popular Searches Hills Ltd HIL ▼ 0.4600 -0.1300 -22.03% Nordex SE NRDXF ▼ 19.77 -0.59 -2.90% Citigroup Inc C ▼ 52.83 -0.78 -1.46% Cash Converters International Ltd CCV ▼ 0.3600 -0.0050 -1.37% Certainly, both companies have far transcended their humble beginnings – Target in suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, and Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas. Yet today, they also stand at a challenging crossroads in a competitive digital age. This year, Target shares are off roughly 8 percent. But as recently as May, the stock was on a tear, up 12 percent from January through April. Then came May's second quarter earnings report, and investors punished Target after it aimed for the bull's-eye but instead hit the bear's behind. While earnings rose 16.5 percent, sales missed forecasts and guidance from the company was glum. Between May 10 and 18, Target stock plunged more than 16 percent; it currently trades close to $69 per share. [See: 7 of the Best Socially Responsible Funds.] Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has enjoyed a steady climb this year, so gradual and sublime you couldn't be blamed if you missed it. The stock, now trading at $72, is up more than 17 percent in 2016. Wal-Mart has few if any threats so far as copycats to its brick-and-mortar model, though its Sam's Club has a very close competitor in by Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST). Yet like Target, Wal-Mart faces stiff headwinds from other corners of the retail sphere. Thus, there's a strange apples-to-oranges parity between the two, and you don't have to hit the produce section to spot it. "While Target struggles to maintain a more than 6 percent lead over Wal-Mart in profit margin, Wal-Mart struggles to stay above the water from the inescapable e-commerce threat from Amazon.com (AMZN)," says K.C. Ma, director of the George Investments Institute at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida. Indeed, Amazon continues to dominate all things e-commerce, and passed Wal-Mart in July of last year as the world's largest retailer. But that's not to say Wal-Mart has given up on the digital front – in fact, far from it. Wal-Mart hopes to grow its online sales around 20 to 30 percent in the near term by leveraging its tremendous distribution platform to support digital sales growth. Still, the explosion of e-commerce sets up a curious scenario where Wal-Mart and Target could face unlikely competitors: themselves. If nothing else, sales growth numbers may shed some light on where the companies stand. Figures provided by the investment analytics and financial research firm FactSet show sales growth hasn't been the best of stories for either Wal-Mart or Target. Since January 2013, Target has seen its growth decline from 4.9 percent to 1.6 percent in January of this year. Over the same period, Wal-Mart fell from 5.7 percent to -0.7 percent. Looking ahead, it's not much better: FactSet numbers project that by January 2017, Wal-Mart will inch up to 1 percent sales growth – while Target will slide 5.6 percent. "By investing $2 billion in labor, health care and employee training for next two years, the benefit is immediate: Wal-Mart shareholders have been rewarded 5 percent for last six months," Ma says. Target, citing improvements "not recognized by the market," has seen its strategic shift met with returns of -4 percent. But at least on the social media front – a metric that holds one key to retail success – Target clearly holds the lead. NetBase's "Social Media Industry Report 2016: Retail Brands," examined the overall performance of 60 leading retail brands across social channels. On the one hand, the social analytics company found Target and Wal-Mart close in terms of social outreach. "Target was second in mentions and Wal-Mart fourth," says Paige Leidig, CMO at NetBase. "Target's reach, mentions and awareness ranks were all comparable. But Target's brand passion index ranking was 41st while Wal-Mart's was 51st, suggesting that Target conversation was both more positive and more passionate." No. 1 on the mentions rank? Amazon. Tiffany and Co. (TIF) scored tops in the brand passion category. But if there were such thing as the broker passion index, the luxury jeweler would hold all the appeal of cubic zirconia: TIF stock is off almost 4 percent for the year. Meanwhile, the rise of dollar stores proves that some outlets can out-bargain a Wal-Mart or Target bargain. Wall Street types are definitely noticing: Dollar General Corp. (DG) in particular was high octane, up 26 percent this year until August. A disappointing earnings report tripped up DG stock, but nine out of 20 analysts still rate it a "strong buy." What's more, TGT and WMT stand apart from their retail peers for dubious reasons. Both have been dogged in recent years by bad publicity and a costly aftermath. Target's big data breach of 2013 whacked 40 million customers, and almost singlehandedly accelerated the adoption of EMV chip-based credit cards in the U.S. (Yes, Target takes them.) All told, the breach cost Target $252 million. Yet that's chump change compared to the setbacks Wal-Mart weathered after getting drubbed for its draconian labor practices. In response, the company enacted reforms that began last year and will increase wages by a total of $2.7 billion. And while that has made the worker bees happier, market watchers consider it quite the buzzkill. After the breach, Target made a smart move to right the ship. New CEO Brian Cornell, who came on board in August 2014, closed Target's underperforming Canadian operation and focused on transparency with the U.S. customer base. Cornell has also heralded a shift to a more focused consumer strategy and it's working, Ma says: "While Wal-Mart has been struggled to find the sweet spot to match the right prices and quality of products to carry, Target has returned to smaller, healthier, high-end stores with higher profit margins. So which mega retailer holds the advantage in the end? In the spirit of the political season, Ma makes his forecast: "Forward-looking valuation models suggest that WMT has a fair value around $80, approximately 9 percent undervalued. TGT has a fair value of $74 with 7 percent undervaluation," he says. "So if the election happened today, Wal-Mart would win."

(KOIN) – The man accused of opening fire inside a Subway restaurant inside a Hazel Dell Walmart is facing charges. Shaun Sprague appeared in Clark County court on Thursday where he was charged with three counts of first-degree assault and one count of first-degree arson. On Wednesday, Clark County deputies say that Sprague walked into the Walmart along Highway 99 around 6:11 a.m., armed with a revolver. At 6:54 a.m., he was contacted by the Subway manager. The manager walked away and when behind the counter, according to court documents. “At that time, Sprague points the revolver [at the manager],” court documents state. Sprague lowered the gun, but then pointed it at the manager a second time. At that point, the manager fled. As the manager ran away, Sprague turned to a group of pumpkins that had been set up inside the store and fired “multiple rounds inside the store.” The shooting was all captured on video. Detectives learned that Sprague wanted to buy a sandwich but was told the restaurant didn’t open until 7 a.m. The manager told investigators that he recalled hearing 6 initial shot followed by 2 more shots. When law enforcement arrived, Sprague was taken into custody without incident. No one was hurt. He told detectives that he had owned the gun for about 5 years, according to court documents. “Sprague advised [detectives] he had been cold and wet when he went inside of the Walmart,” according to court documents. “He advised that he had planned on killing himself while there but changed his mind.” While Sprague was sitting inside a jail holding cell, he told an investigator that he had used “speed” a couple days ago. He said, “none of this would have happened before I used that [redacted.]” The arson charge that Sprague faces stems from a separate incident that occurred Tuesday night in the 3000 block of Northeast 75th. Investigators say that Sprague started a kitchen fire and then found the gas line to the home’s water heater disconnected. Records show that Sprague lived at the residence and his roommate was home and had to put the fire out with water. Sprague is due back in court later this month.

Matthew Heller October 7, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Wal-Mart has almost doubled its stake in JD.com, becoming the third-largest shareholder in China’s second-largest e-commerce company. In a regulatory filing, Wal-Mart disclosed it now owns 265 million shares in JD.com, or 10.8% of shares that don’t have extra voting power, up from the 5.9% stake it obtained by selling Yihaodian, its Chinese online marketplace, to JD in June. Recommended Stories: Adobe Buys Ad Tech Firm TubeMogul for $540M Windstream to Buy Dial-Up Pioneer Earthlink Wanda Group Buys Dick Clark Productions for $1B The increased stake is just short of the level that would allow Wal-Mart to gain observer status at JD.com’s board meetings. JD’s two largest shareholders are Tencent, China’s dominant social networking company, which has a stake of 21.25%, and founder Liu Qiangdong, who owns 16.2%. “The stepped-up investment in JD has been part of our plan, as we continue to be a passive investor,” a a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said. “We believe this strategic alliance will help us grow e-commerce even faster in China.” As The Wall Street Journal reports, the sale of Yihaodian reflected Wal-Mart’s shift in strategy to “seeking to navigate China’s competitive e-commerce market as an investor in a major local player, rather than trying to expand its own online shopping platform.” “China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest e-commerce market. But it is a challenging market for foreign players, as the country’s fast-growing online shopping sector is dominated by domestic competitors like JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China’s largest e-commerce company,” the WSJ explained. At JD’s closing price of $27.40 on Thursday, Wal-Mart’s stake was worth more than $7.2 billion. Last month, the retailer was reportedly in advanced talks with India e-commerce company Flipkart for an investment of about $1 billion.

And I must admit that I can’t blame them. Analysts expect the S&P 500 as a whole to see profits contract 2.1% compared with last year. So now more than ever, it’s crucial to keep track of earnings. But considering that upwards of 50 companies will report operating results each and every trading day over the next several weeks, I don’t expect you to spend hours of your day combing through the data. Instead, I’ll do that for you and hit the highlights in this daily blog. However, before I do, let me say that Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) made headlines Thursday with its lackluster earnings outlook for the next two fiscal years. WMT shares fell after the company announced that it would open fewer stores, and focus more on its online business. Walmart will release its Q3 results in mid-November, and it will be interesting to see how this report shakes out. In the meantime, I consider WMT a B-rated (cautious) buy. Today, I’ll preview the biggest names to keep on your radar over the next several trading days: There are only five names scheduled to report today, including Oil-Dri Corporation of America (ODC), Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP) and TSR Inc (TSRI). Respectively, these stocks are rated A, C and B in Portfolio Grader. Monday: This Monday will also be a relatively quiet day for earnings. You can click here to see the full lineup. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Tuesday: Before Tuesday’s open, Alcoa Inc (AA) kicks off the official start to earnings season by announcing its third-quarter operating results. Now, Alcoa’s earnings are expected to improve from 7 cents per share a year ago to 13 cents per share. However, if you currently hold shares of the world’s leading aluminum producer, you may want to brace yourself: AA fails in Portfolio Grader (it currently is a D-rated Sell). This is due to a combination of anemic buying pressure and mixed fundamentals. For the rest of next week, we’ll have several more high-profile earnings reports. On Wednesday, October 12, CSX Corporaton (CSX) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) will release their quarterly results. On Thursday, we’ll hear from Progressive Corp (PGR) and Wynn Resorts, Ltd (WYNN). Friday will be a big day for the banking industry, with Citigroup Inc (C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) all reporting before the market opens. As a whole, this earnings season is going to be very challenging, especially for energy and financial stocks. There are exceptions to the rule. In Wednesday’s blog, I featured Constellation Brands, Inc.’s (STZ) Q2 earnings report. The stock is still rising after its 7% earnings surprise and its 3% sales surprise. 5 Stocks to Sell Now or Short Into the Ground I currently recommend STZ in Blue Chip Growth and it is a B-rated Buy in Portfolio Grader. Make no mistake—the next several weeks will shake up the market as earnings take center stage. So be sure to check in on this blog from time to time to help you locate the best profit opportunities in this shifting market.

Экономика 2016-10-07T09:22+02:00 09:22 07.10.2016 S&P 500 вырос в четверг, Dow и Nasdaq закрылись в минусе Динамика фондовых индексов США в четверг была слабовыраженной и разнонаправленной, инвесторы ждут новых данных по рынку труда, которые могут повлиять на темпы повышения базовой процентной ставки Федеральной резервной системой (ФРС) США. Число заявок на пособие по безработице в США неожиданно снизилось на прошлой неделе на 5 тыс. и составило 249 тыс., говорится в отчете министерства труда США. Показатель близок к рекордно низкой отметке с 1973 года. Аналитики Уолл-стрит в среднем ожидали увеличения показателя на 2 тыс., с 254 тыс. до 256 тыс. Важнейшим статистическим отчетом текущей недели будет публикация министерством труда США сентябрьских данных о безработице. Опрошенные MarketWatch эксперты в среднем ожидают увеличения числа рабочих мест в США в прошлом месяце на 169 тыс. (151 тыс. в августе). В среду глава Федерального резервного банка Ричмонда Джеффри Лэкер заявил, что текущие экономические условия в США обеспечивают сильные аргументы в пользу более быстрого повышения процентных ставок. Между тем нефть WTI в четверг превысила отметку $50 за баррель впервые с 24 июня, завершив сессию на отметке $50,44 за баррель. Курс акций крупнейшего ритейлера США Wal-Mart Stores Inc. опустился на 3,2% на торгах в Нью-Йорке из-за слабых прогнозов прибыли. Wal-Mart ожидает нулевого изменения прибыли в 2018 фингоду по сравнению с 2017 (текущим) фингодом, который завершается в январе. На текущий фингод компания подтвердила прогноз чистой прибыли от $4,29 до $4,49 на акцию, скорректированной прибыли - от $4,15 до $4,35 на акцию. Аналитики в среднем прогнозировали более высокую скорректированную прибыль Wal-Mart: в этом году на уровне $4,34 на акцию, в следующем - $4,48 на акцию. Рыночная стоимость Twitter Inc. рухнула на 20% на сообщениях о том, что Apple, Google и Walt Disney не заинтересованы в покупке сервиса микроблогов. При этом акции Salesforce.com Inc., которая по-прежнему планирует приобрести Twitter, подорожали на 4,2%, возглавляя подъем в рамках S&P 500. Бумаги Yum Brands Inc. подешевели на 1,2%, поскольку квартальная отчетность компании, которой принадлежат сети ресторанов KFC, Taco Bell и Pizza Hut, была слабее прогнозов. Индекс биотехнологических компаний iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF упал на 2,3%. Котировки ценных бумаг производителя оружия Smith & Wesson опустились на 3,6%. Аналитики Wunderlich Securities ухудшили оценку стоимости акций с $36 до $29 в связи с опасениями сокращения спроса на продукцию компании. Цена бумаг производителя электромобилей Tesla Motor Co. уменьшилась на 3,6%. Эксперты Golgman Sachs пересмотрели оценку акций Tesla с $240 до $185. Индекс Dow Jones Industrial Average по итогам торгов в четверг опустился на 12,53 пункта (0,07%) и составил 18268,50 пункта.

Investors abstained from making big bets ahead of Friday's much-anticipated September jobs report. Stocks sold off in early trade, but the market recouped much of its losses after a high-ranking European Central Bank official repudiated reports that the central bank had discussed tapering its bond-buying program.Aside from central bank policies and economic data, earnings are looming as an important market driver. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 12.53 points to finish at 18,268.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 9.17 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,306.85, pressured by losses in biotechs. The S&P 500 index edged up 1.04 points to close at 2,160.77, with the materials sector topping the gains. Sharp losses in Wal-Mart Stores and American Express weighed on the blue-chip benchmark. Wal-Mart Stores shares fell 3.2% after the retailer provided a lackluster outlook for 2017 at an investor meeting. Wal-Mart is a component of both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials. Trading was generally tepid as investors awaited Friday's jobs data, which will help them gauge the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of 2016. Ahead of the jobs report, Thursday's weekly jobless claims report pointed to extremely low levels of layoffs, suggesting that employers are reluctant to part with workers in a tight market. Meanwhile, ECB Vice President Victor Constancio reportedly said there is no consensus to wind down bond purchases. There were earlier reports this week that bank officials had reached an informal consensus to taper the ECB's quantitative-easing efforts sooner than expected. The denial from the ECB is in keeping with market expectations that the ECB is reluctant to exit its quantitative-easing program and that it is more inclined to extend its loose monetary policy stance beyond March. Mr. Constancio briefly rallied global bond markets when he denied reports from earlier in the week that suggested the central bank has held discussions about tapering its asset purchase program. That headline boost proved to be short-lived, however, as Treasury prices soon started to fade again, pushing yields back up. Today's economic data was limited to Challenger Job Cuts for September and weekly initial claims. September Challenger Job Cuts reported in at 44,300, which compares to the prior month's reading of 32,200. For the week ending 1 October, initial claims decreased by 5,000 to 249,000 (consensus 258,000). Continuing claims for the week ending September 24 fell by 6,000 to 2.058 million. Economic data showed that the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 to 249,000 in the final week of September, which bodes well for a strong payrolls number. The yield on the benchmark 10-yr note, which slipped back to 1.71% after the Constancio headline first hit, finished higher by four basis points at 1.74%. Third-quarter earnings season will kick off unofficially on Tuesday with Alcoa's results. Oil futures continued to climb, trading above $50 a barrel for the first time in four months. Gold futures retreated as a key dollar index gained. European stocks fell while Asian markets closed higher. Today's participation was below the recent average as more than 796 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Employment Situation Report for September. The consensus expects the report to show an increase of 176,000 in nonfarm payrolls. Meanwhile, August Wholesale Inventories (consensus -0.1%) and August Consumer Credit (consensus$18.0 billion) will cross the wires at 10:00 a.m ET and 3:00 p.m. ET, respectively.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said on Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth of about five per cent. Wal-Mart completed its more than US$3-billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer, Jet.com, last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totalled US$13.7 billion last year - still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping programme is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off - and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh-food managers working to train store sales associates. Online grocery shopping Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's US namesake business, told analysts on Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 US stores. The company is in the second year of its US$2.7-billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart US business. Global online sales rose 11.8 per cent in the second quarter. That's up from the seven per cent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 per cent increases from less than two years ago. McMillon reiterated to analysts on Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors on Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. Increasing stake in JD.com The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the United Kingdom and Brazil. It announced on Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said on Thursday it would spend US$11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent US$11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 US stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 US stores. It said it plans to open another 55 US stores next year. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be US$4.15 per share to US$4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. - AP «[node:title] Haiti to get US$20m insurance payout» View the discussion thread.

New York: WalMart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year - still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. WalMart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn't as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Walmart shares plunged 10 percent. But WalMart's flurry of moves - online and in the stores - have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, WalMart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Walmart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Walmart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Walmart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year. In contrast, rival Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Walmart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter - up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. Walmart also reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. McMillon stressed to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help the company attract higher-income and younger customers. Walmart plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges. Analysts questioned whether the price cuts that Walmart is taking will be sustainable as rivals respond. And they asked executives how much profit they would be willing to risk. Walmart had said it is spending several billion dollars in its plans to lower prices, but haven't given any specific details. McMillon declined to talk about how much farther they would be willing to go. Walmart did say Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Walmart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com As it faces a possible sale or spinoff, the Save-A-Lot grocery store chain is boosting the number of national brands on its shelves, remodeling to highlight fresh foods and adding stores. The changes underway at some of the discount chain’s 1,368 stores nationwide come as the Earth City-based grocer is poised to change ownership and as its discount chain rivals Wal-Mart and Ruler Foods are adding stores and services in the St. Louis region, vying for market share. Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu, which owns Save-A-Lot, is exploring spinning off Save-A-Lot as a stand-alone company or a sale of the chain amid increased competition and declines in prices for eggs, pork, beef and other foods. Reuters reported last week that Toronto private equity firm Onex Corp. was the leading bidder if Supervalu pursues a sale of Save-A-Lot, with a sale value of up to $1.8 billion. Supervalu is expected to announce Save-A-Lot’s fate soon, according to Reuters. The company did not respond to requests seeking comment. In a regulatory filing this summer, Save-A-Lot said if it’s spun off, its headquarters would remain in Earth City. Private label foods, which are sold under store brands, account for 60 percent of sales at Save-A-Lot’s corporate-owned stores and 55 percent at its licensee stores. Founded as a single store in Cahokia in 1977, the chain’s business model has centered on offering low-priced alternatives to national brands but it’s expanding its lineup of national brands. The company said this year that all of its corporate stores and most of its licensed stores recently started carrying 130 “must have” national brand items in a bid to attract and maintain new customers. Save-A-Lot’s private label offerings include maple syrup and biscuits sold under its own “Morning Delight” brand. “Private label branding at Save-A-Lot has no brand equity with consumers,” said Ajay Jain, a senior analyst at Pivitol Research Group in New York. To attract more brand-conscious customers, Save-A-Lot is carrying more national brands and consolidating its myriad private label offerings to one primary brand, America’s Choice, which it acquired earlier this year. “Over time, we expect that America’s Choice will become the predominant food private label brand in our stores as we seek to consolidate our private label brand offerings by reducing the number of private label brands that we offer while increasing brand recognition and enhancing brand equity,” the company said in the regulatory filing. Save-A-Lot’s current ads show an expanded array of national brands available, including Maxwell House coffee, Totino’s pizza rolls and Lay’s potato chips. “The American consumer does appreciate and demand their brands,” Supervalu’s president and CEO Mark Gross told analysts at the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference in Boston in June, referring to Save-A-Lot’s changes. While it adds brands, Save-A-Lot also said it plans to open 75 new stores in fiscal 2017, and “we believe the United States can support more than 3,500 Save-A-Lot stores under our existing store concept and layout,” according to the filing. The grocer also is remodeling its stores to bring its produce departments closer to the front of each store, expanding its fresh cut meat offerings, adding more ethnic foods and expanding its frozen and smoked meat departments. “The merchandising could use a shot in the arm,” Jain said of the remodels the chain is pursuing. “The stores were pretty tired looking.” Changing landscape Save-A-Lot is under pressure from rivals that are also expanding their food options, including Wal-Mart, which has been growing its Walmart Neighborhood Markets chain nationally and locally.

SOURCE: Chain Store Guide’s 2016 Grocery Industry Market Share Report Post-Dispatch Walmart Neighborhood Markets have about 41,000 square feet of space, and the grocery stores have fresh produce, pharmacy, deli and bakery departments. That size makes them smaller than most Schnucks stores, but larger than Save-A-Lot’s average 17,000-square-foot store. At the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 45 Sutters Mill Road in St. Peters, customers can order groceries online and have them delivered curbside to their cars, beginning Nov. 9. Wal-Mart said it plans to have online order pickup available at 600 stores by the end of the year. +5  FILE PHOTO: Chris Krehmeyer, president and CEO of Beyond Housing, pushes a grocery cart holding Diamond Rhymes (center), 4, in 2010 to mark the grand opening of the Save-A-Lot grocery store in Pagedale.

Check our People in Business Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Combined, Walmart’s Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores have 28.7 percent market share of grocery sales in the St. Louis region, according to Chain Store Guide’s 2016 Grocery Industry Market Share Report, which reflects fiscal year 2015 sales. Included in Chain Store Guide’s definition of the St. Louis market are the Illinois counties of Bond, Calhoun, Clinton, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair; and the Missouri counties of Jefferson, Lincoln, St. Charles, St. Louis, St. Louis city and Warren. In 2014, Wal-Mart’s local share totaled 28.8 percent. Wal-Mart may put the brakes on adding stores, however. The retailer said Thursday that it plans to slow down its store openings to focus on online sales, store remodels and tech initiatives. Maryland Heights-based Schnuck Markets Inc., the largest locally based, independently owned grocer, has 23.7 percent market share, a drop from 23.9 percent in 2014, according to Chain Store Guide. Supervalu’s Save-A-Lot chain and another chain it owns, Kirkwood-based Shop ’n Save, combined have 13.2 market share — the report does not break down the figures for each chain. Chesterfield-based Dierbergs comes in fourth, with 10 percent market share. Other chains that are expanding include German-based Aldi, which opened its newest St. Louis area store in Shrewsbury this week and plans to open a location in Wentzville early next year. Aldi had 3.4 percent market share in St. Louis last year, down slightly from 3.6 percent. One of the biggest increases in local market share came from Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., which re-entered the St. Louis market under a subsidiary’s Ruler Foods brand in 2014. Ruler, which has added seven local stores in the past year, now has nine St. Louis area stores. Ruler Foods grew its market share in St. Louis to 3.3 percent in 2015, up from 1.9 percent a year earlier. “We’re constantly looking at sites,” Ruler Foods’ executive director of merchandising, Mark Belleville, said of St. Louis. “We’re very happy with what is happening in the market and how customers are accepting us. We want to continue to grow.” About 85 percent of Ruler Foods’ merchandise is private label, many under the Kroger brand. Belleville said Ruler Foods stocks Kroger-branded food items, which resonate with customers who remember when the chain had stores here in the mid-1980s. “There are people who tell us it’s like an old friend coming home,” Belleville said.

Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model Business Insider 10/7/2016 Hayley Peterson © Scott Olson/Getty Images   Walmart is shifting its business model. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Going forward, the nation's largest retailer doesn't want to be defined by its stores. "This company, over time, is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday at Walmart's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. He said stores will remain vital to Walmart's future. But the company will be cutting back on new store growth, focusing more on same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — and growing investments in ecommerce. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018. Walmart is trying to transform into an ecommerce company to better compete with Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart CEO Doug McMillon But the majority of Walmart's business still comes from its stores.  The company's total revenue last year was $482 billion, meaning more than 97% of its business came from stores.  Now watch: Walmart is working on a self-driving shopping cart Click to expand Replay Video This retailer is closing nearly all of its stores: report Kenneth Cole will reportedly close most of its stores in the next six months.

He just moved here from Louisiana. "She's getting a little older and my brothers are in the service, so I was like the only one left,” Brumfield said. Before Brumfield gets inside he’s stopped by people with clipboards. Staff and volunteers are here with the New Georgia Project, a non-profit. They’re focused on registering minority voters, but they don’t turn anybody away. This neighborhood is about 75 percent African-American. Brumfield just signed up. He said he’s voting for the good of his three boys. "I had it hard coming up, so I know what it's like. I'd rather them have a better chance than I did,” Brumfield said. Between work and family, Brumfield doesn’t have a lot of time, and said he might not have registered if it weren’t for what he calls the “curbside service” at the Wal-Mart. If this is a drive-thru for voter registration, the New Georgia Project is best known for its delivery service. Half of its registration work is door-to-door canvassing.   “That’s expensive work,”  said Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s democratic house minority leader, and the founder of the New Georgia Project. “For a lot of the states where this work could be done, they simply don't have the resources,” she said. In many places it's expensive to find and register voters, and that leaves a lot of people out of the democratic process: about one in four Americans. Some states make it easier than others. Oregon voters are now automatically registered when they renew or apply for a license at the DMV.  Minnesota allows voters to register as late as Election Day. But in other places, civic groups do much of the legwork to register voters ahead of earlier deadlines. That’s the case in Georgia. Abrams said the New Georgia Project is unique because it does the labor-intensive work of finding voters at their homes. “These are folks no one talks to,” said Abrams. “You've got pay literally hundreds of people to go and knock on doors and stand in the hot sun in July in Georgia and get people to engage.” Stacey Abrams, the founder of the New Georgia Project, says Democracy benefits from more people being involved in the electoral process.  - Johnny Kauffman/WABE The group’s registration effort has attracted harsh scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. In 2014, Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State opened an ongoing investigation into the New Georgia Project over allegations it submitted fraudulent voter applications. A counter-suit by the group, alleging voter suppression, was thrown out. Some Democrats said the New Georgia Project should be signing up more people, given the amount of money it has raised from private donors. Brennan Mancil, chairman of the Georgia Association of College Republicans, said registration is a focus for Republicans too. “You have to involve people who are going to be the voting base of the future, and by and large that’s going to be Hispanics, blacks, and to a lesser degree than now, whites,” he said.   Mancil said his group registers voters in student centers, and at debate watch parties. Those kinds of high-traffic areas are the most common and most efficient way to sign people up.  But it can be expensive to try and find people who don’t have stable housing, a listed address or a phone, according to Bradley Spahn, a Stanford graduate student who studies unregistered voters. “Even if we wanted to register them we wouldn’t be able to find contact information for them, we wouldn’t know how to register them, because we would never know they existed,” said Spahn. Democrats probably have the most to gain from registering those hard-to-find voters, who tend to more liberal, said Spahn, but in addition to being costly, it takes time. “Party politics is run by short-term considerations. Campaigns disappear in the middle of November,” Spahn said. Back at the Wal-Mart, the New Georgia Project’s long-term plan is paying off, at least with Wayne Brumfield.  He’ll be casting a vote for himself, but with his young sons in mind.   “I have an 11, an eight, and a six-year-old, so it will be a while before they get a chance to do that,” said Brumfield.    Many voter registration deadlines are in October, though they vary from state to state.

(from left) Marc Lore, Rosalind Brewer, Brett Biggs, Doug McMillon, David Cheesewright and Greg Foran fielded questions from the press at the close of its Annual Investor Conference. by Kim Souza. Published Oct 6th, 2016 5:31 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart investors are again backing off the retail giant after the retailer’s top executives tempered earning projections for next year at somewhere between $4.29 and $4.49 per share, flat against the adjusted earnings per share predicted for this year. Hosting analysts Thursday (Oct. 6) at the home office in Bentonville, Wal-Mart executives were short on details around specifics into the metamorphosis it plans to make in the short term. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said internally the company will in the near future look more like a Silicon Valley tech company than a traditional retailer. He said key differences will be in how capital is deployed, faster decision making, and using technology to increase efficiencies and enhance customer experiences. He said the changes have to happen if the company is going to survive another 50 years. Wal-Mart declined to give specifics of its ongoing price investment numbered into the billions, except to say it will be “controlled and thoughtful.” Wal-Mart said it would not break out its level of investment, nor disclose the markets or categories where it’s being deployed. Analysts who watch the retailer on behalf of banks, investment firms and other financial sector companies say “controlled and thoughtful” would be hard to model. Avoiding margin pressure and leveraging costs will be “no slam dunk” next year, said Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs. He said Wal-Mart gave a flat guidance in part because they want to remain fluid enough to ratchet up investment if they need to do so. The retailer said nothing about upcoming holiday sales projections but focused more on updating analysts on the three year plan it laid out a year ago. One year into the plan Wal-Mart has already lowered the expectations with respect to next year’s earnings and gave very little clarity for next two year period. Wall Street has largely been supportive of the investments Wal-Mart is making in its people, including $2.7 billion over two years, e-commerce investments now at more than $5 billion, the $3.3 billion Jet.com deal, and increased stake in JD.com. When asked if this hefty investment level at e-commerce will be a recurring element or an outlier, McMillon said it’s an outlier. Wall Street is mixed on the retailer’s two-year sacrifice of profits. Mark Martiak, strategist with Premier First Allied Securities, said Wal-Mart has to invest and the ramp up made in e-commerce is the right step if they are going to gain market share against Amazon. He said Wal-Mart may have to look more closely at real estate holdings and closing underperforming stores because it’s important for the company to keep the focus on e-commerce and developing segments like pickup that drive people to the stores. Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran spoke to analysts about the focus on store performance. He said at anytime he can see the “Fast, Clean, Friendly” scores of the store fleet on a phone app. He said he can check on other store metrics as well. He and Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright said they evaluate the low store performers routinely. Cheesewright said they try and rehabilitate the low performers but if there are better places to spend money they do not hesitate to close underperforming operations. More cautious analysts say Wal-Mart investors now selling their shares are likely not happy about having to do so, and are getting out because of flat earnings and a lack of detail as to how the company will grow revenue when it reduces the number of new stores and faces growing online competition. Wal-Mart executives squelched the recent rumors and headlines about widely reported play for Indian-e-tailer Flipkart. Cheesewright said the Indian market is very complex and different from anywhere else in the world. “We are in a stage of learning about that market. We talk to lots of people there trying to learn and do better. For now we like the cash and carry business. India is not a focus for us right now,” Cheesewright told analysts on Thursday. Analysts asked Wal-Mart execs if the grocery pickup play is offensive or defensive. McMillon quickly said Wal-Mart was playing more offense with its new strategies. There’s no silver bullet approach, however, McMillon said, adding that “running great stores is important,” but no more so than offering shoppers a convenient online option. McMillon said Wal-Mart will continue to look for ways to reduce costs because that’s the foundation for its Everyday Low Prices. When asked about margin erosion he said margins across the globe have been driven lower because of internet transparency of price. He said Walmart is and has to remain prepared for lower margins in the future across the world of retail. Part of the reasoning behind the retailer’s planned transformation to a tech-like company is that more nimble and leaner operations provide for faster cycles and are cheaper than the traditional, more isolated models that dominated retail for decades. Analysts also pressed Wal-Mart on getting higher store comps given the U.S. store fleet is running more efficiently with eight quarters of positive comps and seven quarters of positive traffic. Also, e-commerce is beginning to gain positive traction. Wall Street believes 2% comps should be reasonable expectations in the future. The retailer did not provide any indication comps will soon rise to 2% or higher. McMillon did say that Jet.com and that business is growing for certain. He said Walmart.com will benefit as Lore finds synergies in the two businesses. The ongoing Federal Corruption Practices Act probe into Wal-Mart’s international businesses in at least five markets still looms over the retail giant. Some experts say the case could reach a settlement within the next few months. A settlement could cost the retailer anywhere from $600 million to more than a $1 billion according to some estimates. That cost would be in addition to the $858 million Wal-Mart has already spent on legal and internal compliance actions taken during the investigation. Cheesewright did tell analysts that compliance safeguards the retailer has put in place over the past two years are without equal in the industry and will be difficult for others to quickly replicate. He said this could be an advantage for the retailer once the matter is settled.

In this article I take a retrospective look at South Africa’s economy since 1994. It’s an article of faith for me, backed by economic evidence, that the ANC government and left don’t understand the western economic system. Yes, the National Democratic Revolution and patronage and populism have distracted them. But I’m convinced SA’s poor economic performance since 1994, while peer nations reaped the commodities and agriculture booms, is because they lack economic nous. There has been a preponderance of communists and unionists in economic portfolios – Alec Erwin, Rob Davies, Pravin Gordhan, Ebrahim Patel. What do they understand about modern, industrialised economies? (Doctrinaire SACP members may dismiss China, which has a capitalist centre, as a sell-out.) Except for Chris Liebenberg, not one professional economist or finance specialist occupied the primary economics portfolio – Treasury (see Nhlanhla Nene and Des van Rooyen below). Trevor Manuel and Pravin Gordhan were technicians at best, lacking insight for professional analysis only a specialist can bring to the job. They’ve had medical doctors in the health minister job – even the late, oft-inebriated Manto Tshabalala-Msimang knew medicine – but no economists in inarguably the most important cabinet post bar the president. Doesn’t the ANC think it deserves it? Perhaps this is a good reason why the country has not performed well economically. Manuel and Gordhan are not oracles I don’t understand why business, media and others are so enamoured of SA’s post-1994 finance ministers. They hang onto their every word as if they were the Oracle of Delphi. They are “heroes”, and we should “go down on our knees and thank them” they say. In fact, Manuel was an engineering technician diplomate from his alma mater, Peninsula Technikon (where I too studied engineering). I’m all for on-the-job training, but the finance minister job requires specialised, technical knowledge. Remember his “amorphous markets” comment that started a run on the rand? After a couple of years in trade and industry he should have known better. But his comment revealed how naive and unprepared he was for the portfolio. After this I always thought he was a dilettante and poseur. His Xhosa bon mots during his budget speeches were twee and cringe-inducing. His fans in Parliament and media lapped it up, though. But today he’s considered the Obi-Wan/Yoda of finance. His rare missives from his redoubt in his corporate HQ office are pored over by media cognoscenti like nuggets of gold in the shit that passes for SA’s political economy. Gordhan is similar. Nhlanhla Nene was not in the job long enough for me to form an opinion, but he appeared to be headed in the right direction before he paid the price. The difference between Nene and the other two, though, is he served an apprenticeship as deputy finance minister, which they didn’t, and he has an economics degree. Now, before someone says a minister is the political head of a department and has a team of specialists, then why the fuss after “unknown backbencher” Des van Rooyen was appointed in December 2015? He holds two master’s degrees including a master’s in finance specialising in economic policy from the University of London. Academically, he is the most qualified of the Zuma administration’s finance ministers. Yes, yes, I know all about the Zupta contagion, but that’s not my point. Like Manuel and Gordhan, he too could have learned on the job. In fact, his academic background may have made him a quicker study than they, but we shall never know. I know there are many things at play in the fields of macroeconomics that determine growth. But growth is a good indicator of the performance/success of a country’s economic policy and its chief financial officer, i.e. finance minister. Post-1994 growth has averaged 3%, half that of SA’s peer nations’ 5-6%-plus (not including China) for the same period. If we assume 6% is the benchmark for growth, development and job creation – government’s “achievable” target SA should have obtained, at least before the 2008 crash – Manuel and Gordhan performed poorly, far less than 8 or 9 out of 10 the media and DA regularly gave them. Manuel (and Maria Ramos, an economist, his director-general) gets credit for steering SA out of apartheid’s bankruptcy and through a necessary structural adjustment programme, GEAR. (Typical of government’s confusion, it conflicted with the RDP.) But numerous points are deducted for approving and defending the arms deal that was the trigger for the subsequent toxic brew of greed and corruption that has doomed the ANC and almost the country with it. Today he is still unrepentant. And his lapdogs quote him as the voice of reason and probity? Gordhan has muddled along, overseeing public debt that during his tenure from 2009 to 2014 rose from about 30% GDP to 50%. Points are deducted for failing to do what he promised – reduce public spending. Under his watch Nkandla occurred and SAA, SABC and other state enterprises continued their implosion. He also allowed banks to get away with their cartel-like practice of near usurious charges, another promise he broke. His promised firm hand is all talk. And under his management South Africa is facing possible downgrades. I wrote before that Gordhan is not our last hero at the bridge, defending us from economic ruin. In my book his score is a lower than Manuel’s, pushing him to mediocre. Somehow his urbaneness and newly acquired status of victimhood (“Leave Gordhan alone!”; “Let me do my job”) has overshadowed and made some forget his failures. It’s only in SA, where mediocrity is a virtue, that he’s considered “excellent”. As a former accountant myself, albeit for a very small concern, and a lay economics analyst, I think Gordhan (and less so Manuel) has adequate skills for a bookkeeper, but not the tough and ruthless perseverance a chief financial officer must have. I’m not underestimating the impact of party ideology – the ANC’s obeisance to the Party of the Broad Church and their bible’s commandments, the National Democratic Revolution – on SA’s growth path. The disastrous evidence is before us. But if Treasury is hostage to ANC ideology, why has its fan club in media and business frequently and loudly proclaimed its “independence must be upheld”? Even I have done so. Independence from what, though? The economy’s key failures I don’t know about them, but my view is Treasury must guide the economy to growth, development and prosperity based on sound social democratic and economic principles and not in the manner they have done over the past 20 years. The path has not been pro-growth and development. In Africa’s Third Liberation Greg Mills and Jeffrey Herbst summarise the SA economy’s key failures: - Balance of payments problems due to shrinking exports and increasing imports, including industrial technology. - Low labour productivity despite spending 20% of budget, or 7% GDP, on education. Due to protected industries, from 1990 to 2009 productivity rose only 2% while labour costs almost 6%. Between 2006 and 2009 public sector wages rose 23% compared to 10% in the private sector. - Government spending is crowding out private investment at a higher rate than comparable developing nations. High public debt is associated with low growth, and acts as a disinvestment to work and savings. - Investment promotion is constrained by political and economic interests. Included are unions resisting deregulating the labour market and lowering wages (and wanting a minimum wage), leading to the lack of job creation. - During the commodities boom to 2008, when peer nations reaped the rewards and grew 5% pa and above, SA’s mining output fell 1% pa, and investment in mining shrank just under a third between 2003 and 2005. In 2009 mining output was at its lowest level since 2000. The result of policy and political failures is a stagnant economy – a “stalled state” – and lack of jobs. Essentially the failures are laid equally at the doors of the president and economic minister of the day. Economic policy blunders Here’s a review of some of government’s industrial policy blunders. I don’t know if it could have been prohibited, but government should have discouraged – we know SA’s corporations are very afraid of defying government – Old Mutual, mining and other companies moving headquarters to London, despite them having no significant operations abroad. This contributed to the loss of confidence in the country as an investment destination and devaluation of the rand. Why should foreign companies invest when South African are leaving? A rookie finance minister’s (Trevor Manuel) mistake many at the time (including me) thought a bad idea.  Manuel also approved Barclays’ majority stake in Absa, Africa’s largest retail bank. This concentrated the banking sector rather than opening it to competition. (His wife, Maria Ramos, later became group chief executive of Absa.) Similarly, Walmart should not have been permitted to buy a majority stake in Massmart. Now both have regretted their investment, but are having difficulty divesting their shareholding. On the basis of antitrust principles and encouraging competition, Barclays’ and Walmart’s investments should have been permitted on condition they added diversity, infrastructure and competition and new jobs to their sectors – the bricks and mortar of investment that’s harder to divest, not volatile, “hot” money. Instead, from Walmart government extracted conditions and R100m for a “supply chain programme to improve competitiveness in the industry”. The programme reveals both government’s fatuousness and ignorance of economics. Both Barclays’ and Walmart’s investments concentrated their industries and diminished competition. But government believes increasing the number of oligarchies improves competition? Has the programme had any impact, or was it simply extortion as I thought it was? Had Walmart wanted to enter SA it could have acquired – government could have insisted – Massmart’s successful Builder’s Warehouse chain or a similar, promising green field enterprise. Similarly for Barclays, play the long game of building the brand from scratch – like successful, fast growing Capitec – rather than opportunistic, hot money in Absa. Other blunders include semi-privatising Telkom without another fixed-line operator in place, or Telkom should have been unbundled, and selling Iscor outright to Mittal Steel, which turned both into private monopolies overnight. Once they were privatised both engaged in unrelenting price-gouging causing huge damage to consumers and industry. It set back access to reasonably priced telecommunications and steel for years and economic growth immeasurably. Fining Telkom and ArcelorMittal years later could not undo the damage. Ironically, ArcelorMittal has now sought government protection from cheap Chinese imports. Allegedly they and government have “learned their lesson”. Recently director-general of trade and industry Lionel October admitted they were “naive” about Mittal. I read an honours degree in economics. I could call myself an economist but I’m not. I know enough to read the signposts, though. For the advanced international economics course in 1993 I wrote an essay on competition in oligarchic and monopolistic economies. Even with some of the technical material above my head, I understood the limitations and dangers to competition and growth in an economy that’s not free. This is standard economic theory, so why did October, whose résumé lists a master’s in economics from University of London, and his political masters, not understand it? It’s not that they’re naive, which is used as a weak defence. Instead, they don’t appear to understand the functioning of the western economic system and importance of political risk, stable institutions and a free economy on investor confidence. An example is the ANC’s complaints the markets – Manuel’s amorphous markets – “overreacted” to Nene’s firing in 2015. This is unsurprising given they are socialist-trained and leaning apparatchiks who are determined to take SA along the low road of patronage and low growth. Big business is complicit I must make something very clear, though. While government deserves most of the responsibility for the state of the economy, it’s convenient in some quarters to blame them for everything that’s gone wrong. But big business and unions must share a portion of the blame. South Africa’s economy is small and concentrated, and big business extracts as much revenue as they can squeeze from it. While there is nothing wrong with an acceptable rate of return, in SA they are like the commission-seeker or briber who demands a higher and higher percentage – in our case, from already embattled consumers – from transactions (e.g. banks, cell phone networks, etc). In a speech at the University of Witwatersand on 19 July 2016, the IMF’s David Lipton noted some of the problems that are already known: high barriers to entry for new entrants, which favour existing companies; few retail banks and high bank charges; SA companies have high profit margins, often 50 percent higher than in other countries; barriers to entry, protected industries and labour and protective subsidies harm consumers and competition, and widespread anti-competitive behaviour in industries. Collective bargaining serves big business’ and unions’ interest and is a big obstacle to small and medium enterprises – traditional job creators – that in turn suppresses competition. And apologists for SA’s big business and their model of almost unfettered capitalism choose to ignore, or excuse, the fact the questionable and rent-seeking black economic empowerment model is their creation. For 20 years big business made huge profits from a protected, uncompetitive and inefficient economy that was their love-child from a political marriage of convenience with “naive” and complicit ANC. Now that the happy, boom years are over and economy is stagnating at near 0% growth, like a delinquent, estranged spouse, they sit on their cash or invest it abroad, trying to distance themselves from the gunshot wedding and its bastard. Rather than be active, responsible citizens, as we all should be, and take a united stand against the “toxic combination of disastrous policy, incompetence and corruption that resulted in declining economic outcomes” they helped create, big business cowardly and dishonestly hides behind statements like Christo Wiese’s pretend-ignorance, “As a businessmen rather than a politician, [I] would like to stay out of politics”. The failures of the past 22 years indicate the government’s, left’s and big business’ lack of understanding of a competitive, free economic system and the requirements essential for growth and development. It’s a result of the ANC’s socialist-cum-nationalist black empowerment model married to apartheid-era’s over-protected, uncompetitive corporate/industrial model in which the elite benefit – a strange, two-headed beast that, yet, feeds off each other. This symbiosis, and ANC-business-unions (pro-growth) policy stalemate, is why the IMF’s and others’ repeated warnings for complete structural economic reforms to improve growth and job creation have been ignored. And so, SA’s development decline will continue. Sign up to our free daily headline newsletter Related Articles Twenty lost years Do we have the intellectuals we deserve? Skills and growth.

The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. ___ Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) — World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump's U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials "see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few." ___ Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor's 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. ___ US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 percent from a year ago. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn't move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 percent. ___ US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) — A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters' growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa's nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn't show on an agricultural census. ___ Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug's maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government's complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. ___ UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) — The United Nations' aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines' carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. ___ Airlines cancel hundreds of flights as hurricane hits US Airlines canceled hundreds of flights for Thursday and planned more cancelations for Friday as Hurricane Matthew hit the Florida coast with high winds and heavy rain. The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and the Orlando airport expected to do the same by nighttime. Before 2 p.m. Eastern time, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that 1,500 Thursday flights within the U.S. had been scrapped. FlightAware said airlines had already canceled 1,300 more flights scheduled for Friday. ___ Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) — Norway says it plans to spend 225 billion kroner ($28 billion) of its oil fund — the largest in the world — to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the country's GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 percent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund. The ministry said Thursday the market value of the fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, is expected to peak at 7,671 billion kroner at the end of 2017 — up from an estimated 7,420 billion kroner at the end of this year ___ Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) — Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centers and lay off more than 40 percent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years. Theranos is appealing the ban, which stems from an investigation of the California facility. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.53 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,268.50. The S&P 500 inched up 1.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,160.77. The Nasdaq composite slipped 9.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,306.85. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 61 cents to close at $50.44 a barrel in the New York, its first close above $50 a barrel since June 23. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 65 cents to close at $52.51 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline edged up less than 1 cent to $1.50 a gallon, heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.60 a gallon and natural gas rose less than 1 cent to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Ahead of Matthew, many stores out of water, bread, batteries Thursday Oct 6, 2016 at 5:34 PM Oct 6, 2016 at 6:10 PM Shoppers find mix of empty shelves or good supply. Fred Hiers @Hiersnews “It’s about bread and water,” said a customer at Wal-Mart on Thursday as she stared at empty shelves that typically held hundreds of loaves of bread. The white metal shelves at the big box retailer on Southwest 19th Avenue Road, also known as Easy Street, had been picked clean of all but half a dozen loaves of bread by mid-morning, but it was a sure bet those soon would be scooped up by the last wave of shoppers getting ready for Hurricane Matthew. “And they’re out of water too,” said Cathy Mason, to no one in particular as she contemplated which loaf of bread to take. “They’re out at the other Wal-Mart and the Publix.” The Wal-Mart on Easy Street had run out of most of its bottled water supply on Wednesday but then got another shipment at 3 a.m. Thursday, enough to fill the shelves. But, according to an employee, by 8 a.m. Thursday the shelves were empty again, except for a few cases of high-end flavored carbonated water.  The worker was taking advantage of the situation and was painting the empty expanses.  The store also was out of D batteries, the most common size for flashlights. The sporting goods section was nearly out of flashlights. Some shoppers settled for a couple of flashlights powered by AA batteries. “I got everything I needed, but there was no water and I’ve been trying to find water since last night,” said Grace Blackwater, 52, as she loaded her car at the Wal-Mart parking lot. “I’ve been to every gas station, CVS and every Walgreens, and there’s no water. And then I came all the way here and I still didn’t find what I was looking for.” Blackwater said Ocala is usually far enough away from the coast to be buffered from hurricane force winds. That’s why people don’t make a run on the essentials, she said, but now it is different. Sandy McClain bought one of the last flashlights in the store. “I’ve got one at home but I wanted an extra one,” she said. “I wanted a different kind but this is all they have, but they don’t have batteries, at least not the kind I want.” “No one expects a hurricane and when it comes everybody rushes to get what they need. I got water the other day but nothing is left now,” she added. Kim Smith settled on buying an expensive energy drink as there was no bottled water. “That’s all I saw in there,” she said looking at the sports drink in her trunk. “And I went to the Wal-Mart on State Road 40 but they didn’t have any water either.” She said at least she was lucky by way of gasoline. “I got gas the other day,” she said, getting into her Honda CRV. Md Islam owns the Shell gasoline station on South Pine Avenue. “There was a line yesterday of people buying gasoline. And yesterday we ran out,” Islam said. “What could we do? Nothing.” By 9 a.m. Thursday, fuel trucks has loaded his underground tanks again. Another two loads of fuel were scheduled for later in the day. Gov. Rick Scott said in a press release that Florida has enough fuel, but getting delivery trucks to stations later this week might be difficult. Frank Carroll was filling his wife’s Chevy Equinox SUV at the service station. “She tried yesterday but there was no gas. She also tried this morning,” he said, pumping the tank full of gasoline. “So she sent me out because I’m a full-time student (with no more classes today). Now I have to pick up sandbags and her mother in a minute.” The city of Ocala gave away 3,800 sand bags on Wednesday. City officials did not have a count early Thursday, but the line was continuous.  Martin Garcia was filling his pickup truck at the BP station at State Road 200 and Interstate 75. “I couldn’t find any gas yesterday,” said the 32-year-old mechanic. “Every place I went had a plastic bag over the (pump) handles. Either that or the lines were way too long. So I came out this morning and they had gasoline again. I won’t wait until the last minute the next time.” At the Heathbrook Publix, Jackie Davis bought one case of water. She said she could have used more but only saw three cases left and wanted to leave some for someone else who might need it. She said she had gone to the Wal-Mart store on State Road 200 near County Road 484, but there was no water. Assistant manager Drew Olawos said the Publix store was working hard to keep supplies on the shelves, calling on vendors to deliver the items customers wanted most: water and bread. He said the store was dependent on what his suppliers could bring him. The lines at each register were two-to-four people deep. “We had Christmas Eve business yesterday and Christmas Eve business today,” he said of the crowds. Shoppers agreed that finding supplies was a crapshoot. Lowes on State Road 200 had pallets of water and batteries. So did Aldi on Easy Street. McClain said the shortages were leading to shoppers sharing information about stores that might be getting restocked, “But you never know what’s really there until you get there.” Reach Fred Hiers at fred.hiers@starbanner.com and 352-397-5914.

Home Industry Companies Wal-Mart rejects settlement with US over alleged bribery Wal-Mart rejects settlement with US over alleged bribery Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. By: Reuters | Published: October 7, 2016 3:10 AM Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company’s alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company’s practices in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company’s alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. Some of Wal-Mart’s actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totalled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. ___ World finance leaders seek to address anti-trade backlash WASHINGTON (AP) — World finance leaders say they must do more to deal with a growing anti-trade backlash, which they fear could worsen already sluggish global growth prospects. How to deal with the attacks on globalization, featured in the Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential campaign and in the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, is a top agenda item at the fall meetings of the 189-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters Thursday that IMF officials “see growth as too low for too long and benefiting too few.” ___ Stocks end mixed after clawing back from broad losses NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks recovered from a broad decline to end mixed on Thursday, a day ahead of a key jobs report. The market fell from the start, then drifted between gains and losses for much of the afternoon. Yields on Treasury bonds rose again, and the price of oil climbed past $50 a barrel for the first time since June. By the end of trading, seven of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500 index rose, led by suppliers of basic materials. Health care companies and phone companies led the decliners. ___ US claims for jobless aid drop to lowest since mid-April WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week felt to the lowest level since mid-April, another sign that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid slid by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000. The less volatile four-week average dropped 2,500 to 253,500, lowest since December 1973. Overall, 2.06 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks, down more than 7 per cent from a year ago. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate unchanged at 3.42 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 per cent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 per cent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 per cent. ___ US farmers make foray into quinoa as demand for grain grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) — A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totalled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. ___ Federal government: Mylan has been overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug’s maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government’s complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties. ___ UN agreement reached on aircraft climate-change emissions WASHINGTON (AP) — The United Nations’ aviation arm overwhelmingly ratified an agreement Thursday to control global warming emissions from international airline flights, the first climate-change pact to set worldwide limits on a single industry. The agreement, adopted overwhelmingly by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization at a meeting in Montreal, sets airlines’ carbon emissions in the year 2020 as the upper limit of what carriers are allowed to discharge. Airlines that exceed that limit in future years, as most are expected to do, will have to offset their emissions growth by buying credits from other industries and projects that limit greenhouse gas emissions. ___ Airlines cancel hundreds of flights as hurricane hits US Airlines cancelled hundreds of flights for Thursday and planned more cancellations for Friday as Hurricane Matthew hit the Florida coast with high winds and heavy rain. The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and the Orlando airport expected to do the same by nighttime. Before 2 p.m. Eastern time, flight-tracking service FlightAware.com reported that 1,500 Thursday flights within the U.S. had been scrapped. FlightAware said airlines had already cancelled 1,300 more flights scheduled for Friday. ___ Norway to spend record $28 billion oil money to boost growth HELSINKI (AP) — Norway says it plans to spend 225 billion kroner ($28 billion) of its oil fund — the largest in the world — to further stimulate the economy next year in the Scandinavian country that has shown signs of a gradual economic recovery. The Finance Ministry says in its budget proposals that the record amount is equivalent to 0.4 per cent of the country’s GDP. It will be 20 billion kroner more than this year, amounting to 3 per cent of the value of the sovereign wealth fund. The ministry said Thursday the market value of the fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global, is expected to peak at 7,671 billion kroner at the end of 2017 — up from an estimated 7,420 billion kroner at the end of this year ___ Theranos closing labs, laying off 340 following sanctions PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) — Embattled blood testing company Theranos says it will shut down its clinical labs and wellness centres and lay off more than 40 per cent of its full-time employees. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes says the shutdowns will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. The move comes nearly three months after federal regulators banned Holmes from owning or running a medical laboratory for two years. Theranos is appealing the ban, which stems from an investigation of the California facility. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.53 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 18,268.50. The S&P 500 inched up 1.04 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,160.77. The Nasdaq composite slipped 9.17 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,306.85. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 61 cents to close at $50.44 a barrel in the New York, its first close above $50 a barrel since June 23. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 65 cents to close at $52.51 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline edged up less than 1 cent to $1.50 a gallon, heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.60 a gallon and natural gas rose less than 1 cent to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

But as the world's largest retailer pumps the brakes on its physical expansion, opting to shift its capital expenditures toward digital and store remodels, it will need to rely more heavily on its existing assets to drive future growth. At its annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas, Wal-Mart on Thursday said it would open fewer stores in the U.S. this year than originally expected. By year's end, the company will have cut the ribbon on 130 new domestic stores, down from the 135 to 155 it originally projected. This growth will slow more abruptly next year, when Wal-Mart said it will open just 55 stores in the U.S. The pullback applies to both its supercenters and smaller Neighborhood Market shops, which will open 35 and 20 locations, respectively. Of the company's $11 billion in capital expenditures next year, 20 percent will be funneled toward new stores; that's a dramatic change from just four years earlier, when they accounted for almost half of Wal-Mart's $13.1 billion budget. "This is a different Wal-Mart," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. The timing is right for Wal-Mart to make this shift, Cowen and Company analyst Oliver Chen said. Wal-Mart's U.S. division has been building momentum over the past few quarters, including its biggest quarterly same-store sales gain in four years during the period ended July 31. This strength has been fueled by a $2.7 billion investment in wages, which has better equipped its workers to make stores clean and more pleasant to shop. The company has also begun a multiyear project that involves spending billions of its own dollars to lower prices for consumers. Growth in its online grocery business has likewise brought new customers into the fold, who tend to grab additional items when they pick up their orders. This capability has been rolled out to 80 markets and 500 stores, and will be in 100 markets and 600 stores by year's end, Chen said. Because of these initiatives, the potential lift from its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and plans to give 500 of its stores a face-lift, Wal-Mart should be able to make up the revenues it forfeits by opening fewer stores, Chen said. "There's so many physical customers that come to a Wal-Mart," he said, noting that 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within 15 minutes of a store. The company said last year that it's targeting sales growth of 3 percent to 4 percent annually, excluding the impact of currency, which it's on track to achieve this year. Wal-Mart's decision makes even more sense in the scope of its Jet deal, which closed last month, O'Shea said. Wal-Mart's digital sales growth accelerated in the fiscal second quarter, rising 11.8 percent, making this the first quarter that metric had picked up in more than a year. Analysts view Jet as a critical piece of Wal-Mart's digital future. Wal-Mart has set its sights on 20 percent to 30 percent online sales growth in the second half and beyond, which O'Shea and Chen called achievable. "You just spent $3.3 billion accruing this asset. You've got to maximize it ... and that's what they're doing," O'Shea said. Wal-Mart on Thursday maintained its forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.35 this year. But its shares fell 3 percent as it walked back its estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019. Wal-Mart predicts fiscal 2018 earnings will be relatively flat with this year's adjusted figure. And in fiscal 2019, it expects earnings per share growth of 5 percent. Wal-Mart previously said it expected earnings per share in fiscal 2018 to increase modestly and then grow 5 to 10 percent in fiscal 2019. "It's good that they've set a reasonable bar, and I think there's some upside potential," Chen said. Both Chen and O'Shea agreed that while Wal-Mart's investments are expensive, they're necessary for the future.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wal-Mart, Twitter slide Margreet Dietz Friday October 7, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street was mixed as investors awaited Friday's nonfarm payrolls report to gauge the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike. A Labor Department report showed US initial jobless claims fell to 249,000 last week, the second-lowest level since 1973, underpinning bets the Fed will raise rates soon. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls to increase by 175,000. "There's no question about it, these are good numbers," David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast in New York, told Bloomberg. "The implication here is that the payrolls trend will remain healthy. The big picture is consistent with the Fed raising rates at some point this year, most likely in December." At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12.53 points, or less than 0.1%, to 18,268.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.17% lower to 5306.85 while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index eked out a one-point (0.05%) gain to 2106.77. "At the moment, what is driving the US market is a repricing around expectations of near-term Fed action," Bill Merz, investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota, told Reuters. In the Dow slides in shares of American Express and those of Wal-Mart, down 3.8% and 2.6% respectively, outweighed advances in shares of Home Depot and those of Apple, up 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. Wal-Mart sees little growth Shares of Wal-Mart Stores dropped after the retailer said it expects "relatively flat" earnings in its next fiscal year as it slows new-store openings to bolster its online business. For the year ending January 31, 2018, Wal-Mart expects earnings per share to be "relatively flat" from the previous fiscal year's estimated adjusted EPS of between $US4.15 to $US4.35 a share, it said in a statement. "The company will rely more on comp sales and e-commerce growth to drive the top line and plans to slow new-store openings while increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives," Wal-Mart said in the statement. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank 20% as concern mounted no one wants to buy the social media company after it put itself up for sale last month. Alphabet's Google does not plan to bid for Twitter, according to technology website Recode. Walt Disney won't make a bid either, Recode reported, while Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. However, Salesforce.com might be interested. "I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it," Salesforce chief executive Mark Benioff told the New York Times. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a slide of 0.4%. Germany's DAX Index fell 0.2%, as did France's CAC 40 Index, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index declined 0.5%.

By David Iaconangelo, Staff October 6, 2016 Save for later Saved Wal-Mart chief executive officer Doug McMillon speaks at the company's shareholder meeting in Fayetteville, Ark., in June 2015. Danny Johnston/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Ahead of a meeting with investors on Thursday, Wal-Mart said it planned to scale back plans to open up new stores in favor of investing more in e-commerce, as the retail giant tries to fend off online competition from Amazon. Wal-Mart has installed mobile payment systems for checkouts and established new online pickup and grocery services, according to the Associated Press. And it has paired them with a round of investments in e-commerce companies and a planned expansion of warehouses for online sales, in what many market analysts describe as a model geared toward "the consumer of the future." Last month, the company closed the deal on its $3 billion acquisition of online retailer Jet.com, and on Wednesday, it announced that it had increased its stake in Chinese e-retailer JD.com, from 5.9 percent to 10.8 percent. In late September, Wal-Mart was reportedly in advanced talks with Indian e-retailer Flipkart over a potential $1 billion investment. Recommended: Can you match the CEO with the company?

Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly – so that's what we're doing," he said.  Over the past four years, Wal-Mart has gone from investing $300 million (in 2013) to $1.1 billion this year, according to public filings and earnings transcripts reviewed by Reuters. The push responds to Amazon’s encroachment on brick-and-mortar sales, and to broader industry trends. In a report this year, London analysis firm Ovum wrote that in 10 years, consumers would expect 24-hour “"instant access and fast turnaround" – especially Millennials and the tech-savvy "Generation Z," those born between 1996 and 2010. "These generations are constantly connected and inhabit an online environment where events happen in real time without them having to wait, and where social media enables them to dictate terms,"  the firm wrote. "However, by 2026, instant gratification … will have evolved into expectations of a seamless shopping experience across an increasing range of connected devices, in which immediacy and convenience are paramount." "Instant access and fast turnaround will still be a key part of the equation, but other expectations will have come to the fore: proactive customer service and support, and free or very low-cost delivery anytime, anywhere. Consumers will expect goods advertised online to live up to the promise in every way.... This places great pressure on retailers, and those that fail to meet expectations will fall by the wayside." In the meantime, Wal-Mart isn’t stopping its opening of new brick-and-mortar locations entirely. This year it will cut the ribbon on 130 new stores in the United States this year, and another 55 will open next year – 20 of which will be the particularly successful small-scale stores that the corporation calls "neighborhood markets." The company's website has become the nation’s second-largest online retailer by traffic, boasted Mr. McMillon in a September blog post, with the number of items sold online expanding from 7 million to 15 million. "Within a year," he wrote then, "we've created one of the largest online grocery businesses in the country." Next up Test your knowledge Can you match the CEO with the company? Take the quiz!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack October 6 Follow @sarahhalzack A Walmart store in North Kingstown, R.I. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) Walmart said Thursday that it plans to significantly slow its efforts to open new U.S. stores, a strategic shift by the world’s largest retailer as it works to claim more of the shopping dollars that are rapidly moving online. At a meeting with investors, Walmart executives said the chain will open about 35 supercenters next year, sharply lower than the 60 it expects to open by the end of the current fiscal year. It aims to open just 20 of its smaller, grocery-oriented Neighborhood Markets, a pullback from the 70 it is to open this year. Instead, Walmart said it would work to increase sales by ramping up growth in its online division and squeezing more business out of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores. The goals executives laid out for its digital business were ambitious: They say they expect to deliver 20 to 30 percent annualized growth in a segment that lately has not shown nearly that level of momentum. For example, last quarter, Walmart’s global e-commerce sales were up 11.8 percent over the previous year. In the last full fiscal year, the company’s online sales were up 8 percent. [Is the retail industry ‘overstored’?] “This company, over time, is going to look like more of an e-commerce company,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said at an event at corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.  The big-box chain recently moved to boost its e-commerce firepower by acquiring upstart shopping site Jet.com and by installing that company’s founder, Marc Lore, as the head of Walmart’s online shopping strategy. Lore and McMillon spoke repeatedly of a focus on “basket economics.” This means that they want to find ways to incentivize customers to bundle their online orders, scooping up several items at a time. This behavior would slash shipping and fulfillment costs for the retailer, thus allowing sales in this channel to be more profitable. This tack would be different from the one that e-commerce leader Amazon.com has taken: That company has instead focused on getting shoppers to pay $99 a year for Prime memberships. Because shipping is free for members, these shoppers sometimes place several orders a day, one item at a time. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Investors sent Walmart’s stock down about 2.5 percent in afternoon trading, apparently disappointed by the financial forecast the retailer offered for the year ahead. Walmart said it expects earnings per share in the next fiscal year of between $4.29 and $4.49, about flat compared to what it anticipates for the current year. In the year after that, it expects 5 percent growth in earnings per share. Walmart expects to put $11 billion toward capital investments in the coming year. The company plans to remodel about 500 stores, and will add its grocery pickup capabilities to 500 additional locations. As it aims to boost sales in its existing stable of stores, the retailer will continue efforts to spiff up its fresh food offering and to lower prices on certain merchandise. It is also trying to build a healthier business by moving its inventory more efficiently. “Our goal is pretty simple,” said Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart’s U.S. business. “We only want to touch an item once from when it hits the backroom to getting into a customers’ basket.” [How Walmart plans to transform the way you buy groceries] Walmart’s plan to ease up on new store openings comes in the same year that it moved to close 154 locations and to do away with its small-format Express stores. Taken together, these moves suggest the retailer is thinking hard about just what kind of bricks-and-mortar presence it needs in the digital era, especially given that about 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. Similar re-evaluations are happening across the wider retail industry, with Macy’s, for example, working to close 100 of its 675 stores after determining it had too many stores at a time when many of its customers are shopping on smartphones and laptops. business business true Please provide a valid email address.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | October 6, 2016 -- 16:30 GMT (09:30 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Image: Walmart Walmart said Thursday it plans to reduce the number of new store openings and shift more resources into building up its e-commerce business and digital technology stack. What's Hot on ZDNet Edward Snowden: Don't fear Trump, fear the surveillance state Why MacBook Pros don't need 32GB of RAM Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 How Linux can save small businesses (and old hardware) Part of the strategy shift stems from Walmart's $3 billion buyout of online retailer Jet.com this past August. During a meeting with Wall Street analysts, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Jet.com founder Marc Lore outlined how they plan to reshape Walmart's position as an e-commerce brand while maintaining the existing strengths of each company. For Walmart, the strong point is its size and scale. There are currently more than 4,500 Walmart stores in the US, and each of those stores can be used in some capacity to service online orders. For Jet, the big money maker is what it refers to as "basket economics," which is basically an e-commerce ops strategy that stresses logistics and supply chain to reduce costs. The idea is to figure out the optimal way to ship a basket of goods to a consumer and to make that process transparent to the consumer as they're shopping. "So in real time we show the savings of buying one product over another," Lore said. "The idea is to encourage consumers to buy things that will ship together and in close proximity to where they live. And as a result, consumers are building bigger baskets." And that's the ticket right there -- bigger baskets. Walmart will apply Jet's 'basket economics" strategy to convince shoppers that big baskets are more efficient and akin to the digital version of supercenter shopping. And it will use its massive brick-and-mortar infrastructure to make all the pieces fit together. "The plan is to implement Jet philosophies across Walmart to grow business faster," McMillon said. Beyond basket size, McMillon also hopes Jet will attract a younger generation of brands and shoppers both in-store and online. The Jet brand indexes more strongly with Millennials than the Walmart brand does, McMillon said. Therefore Jet will focus on attracting the urban, Millennial customer and the youth-oriented brands that don't want to sell on marketplaces. "But we are more alike than people would guess, even though Jet is younger and cooler," McMillon quipped. Looking ahead, Walmart expects e-commerce sales to grow significantly in the second half of the 2018 fiscal year, jumping somewhere between 20 percent to 30 percent above previous measures. Last quarter Walmart said its e-commerce sales increased 11.8 percent primarily due to the continued rollout of its online grocery option and growth of pick-up in stores and clubs. It marked the first time in nine quarters that the retailer's online sales growth increased quarter-over-quarter. In terms of infrastructure, Walmart said it plans to add just 35 new supercenters (about half as many as last fiscal year) and 20 new neighborhood markets to its fleet of stores. This is a noteworthy point, because for the past four years, the bulk of Walmart's growth has come from new stores, said CFO Brett Biggs. Instead of opening additional stores, Walmart will remodel around 500 current stores and bring just as many on board as new online grocery locations. Still, Walmart said its fiscal 2018 earnings will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, with earnings in the range of $4.29 to $4.49 per share. "As retail changes, and Walmart changes with it, we can drive strong, efficient growth by continuing to operate with discipline," McMillon said in a blog post. "So we will be thoughtful about expense control and be more productive across the business. We'll win the basket business in stores and in e-commerce. And one other benefit from taking this approach is that shipping larger baskets is more sustainable from an environmental point of view."

Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) JEFF CHIU , By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in afternoon trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins February 1 will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at $4.15 to $4.35 a share. That was below analysts' forecast of $4.47 earnings per share. Shares of Dow member Wal-Mart tumbled 2.4 percent to $69.95 in late-morning trade. The world's biggest retailer said it would slow investment in new stores and steer funds to e-commerce, technology and store remodels. The moves come as retailers scramble to do more to beef up e-commerce and integrate mobile technology into operations, such as letting customers order groceries online and pick them up in the store. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Faced with surging growth at Amazon and other online retailers, Wal-Mart's response in the online sector has included a $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and taking a 10.8 percent stake in Chinese firm JD.com. The US giant is reportedly in talks to invest $1 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart. Wal-Mart forecasted an overall capital budget of $11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from $11.5 billion in 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018.

Officials have proposed that the world’s biggest retailer pay at least $600 million to resolve probes by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether it bribed government officials in markets from Mexico to India and China, according to three people familiar with the matter. The retailer has rebuffed the government’s request, two of them said.  Such a settlement would rank among the largest in four decades under a U.S. law against bribing foreign officials to obtain business.  With the impasse, prosecutors have gone back to elicit more evidence from witnesses about alleged bribe-paying in Mexico, the people said. That will put additional pressure on the company to settle. Some of the people familiar with the matter said the U.S. could propose a penalty well above $600 million. The government has some challenges as well. Some of the behavior it’s been investigating in Mexico, where the bulk of Wal-Mart’s non-U.S. stores are located, may be too old to prosecute, people familiar with the matter have said. Officials are working to wrap up an agreement with Wal-Mart before a new administration takes over in January, the people said. That would add to the wave of enforcement actions already announced this year, including last week’s agreement by Och-Ziff Capital Management LP to pay $415 million in penalties and fines to settle an U.S. investigation into bribe-paying across Africa. "As we’ve said from the beginning, we are cooperating fully with the government in this matter and have no further comment on that process," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in an e-mail. He added that the company’s compliance with anti-corruption laws is a priority and that the retailer was recognized this year by a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary for best governance program among large-cap companies.  Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. Wal-Mart said Thursday that net income for the year through January 2018 will be "relatively flat" as the company invests in its website and mobile app. The outlook sent shares sliding and signals that the retailer sees more work ahead as it attempts to compete with Amazon.com Inc. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $69.66 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. Long-Running Investigation The Justice Department and the SEC have spent half a decade investigating allegations that Wal-Mart representatives paid government officials over the course of 10 years to fast-track store openings. The U.S.’s proposed penalty accounts for the profits Wal-Mart reaped from stores it was able to open quickly after allegedly paying officials to speed zoning and building permits, said the people, who asked to not be named because the matter is confidential. Calculating a fine based only on the amount of the alleged bribes, as the department has done in some cases, would yield a lower penalty, they said. Even as the sides are grappling over the size of a penalty, they are also discussing whether there will be any criminal charges against any part of the company, the people said. Management Turnover Wal-Mart has already spent $791 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world, it said. The retailer has had major turnover in management since the investigations began, including a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer and heads of U.S. and international operations. Wal-Mart has warned investors that it may face additional costs and a possible loss because of the investigation. It hasn’t said what those costs may be. "Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future," the company said in a regulatory filing in March. While settlement of $600 million or more would be substantial for a company that has gained attention and a competitive edge for its focus on counting pennies to hold down costs, it’s modest relative to the company’s recent global results. The company posted more than $14 billion in profits last year on $482 billion in sales. U.S. Focus Under Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who took over in 2014, most of the company’s focus has been on improving its U.S. stores and online operations, rather than faster international expansion. Those efforts are starting to pay off, and the company’s shares have gained 13.6 percent this year. The Justice Department is wrapping up several of the marquee investigations started under President Barack Obama, including into financial-crisis-era behavior and benchmark manipulation. Several European banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, are negotiating settlements over their mortgage practices that officials are trying to close in the administration’s final months, people familiar with the situation have said. High Settlements The Wal-Mart settlement, as described, would rank among the highest levied under 1977’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans companies from bribing officials to win business overseas. Earlier this year, VimpelCom Ltd. paid $795 million to settle U.S. and Dutch claims that it bribed officials in Uzbekistan to win business. Siemens AG paid a record $800 million in a combined SEC-Justice Department penalty in 2008. Wal-Mart disclosed possible violations in Mexico to the Justice Department and SEC in November 2011. The following year, the New York Times outlined details of allegations that the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Wal-Mart into the country’s largest private-sector employer. The Wal-Mart case has posed challenges for investigators, Bloomberg News reported in March. With much of the conduct in Mexico too old to be used as evidence, the government tried to build stronger cases around conduct found in Brazil and India, two people familiar with the matter have said. The probe into the company’s China operations, which represented the final phase of the investigation, didn’t uncover widespread bribes to government officials there, the people said. Prosecutors are also likely to charge the company for not having sufficient controls to detect and prevent corruption, two of the people said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins February 1 will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at $4.15 to $4.35 a share. That was below analysts' forecast of $4.47 earnings per share. Wal-Mart will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores ©Joe Raedle (Getty/AFP/File) Shares of Dow member Wal-Mart tumbled 2.4 percent to $69.95 in late-morning trade. The world's biggest retailer said it would slow investment in new stores and steer funds to e-commerce, technology and store remodels. The moves come as retailers scramble to do more to beef up e-commerce and integrate mobile technology into operations, such as letting customers order groceries online and pick them up in the store. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Faced with surging growth at Amazon and other online retailers, Wal-Mart's response in the online sector has included a $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and taking a 10.8 percent stake in Chinese firm JD.com. The US giant is reportedly in talks to invest $1 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart. Wal-Mart forecasted an overall capital budget of $11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from $11.5 billion in 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the United States in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135-155 stores. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Walmart Slowing Store Openings, Accelerating Distribution Centers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Slowing Store Openings, Accelerating Distribution Centers Image courtesy of Will October 6, 2016 10:33 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler changing pace walmart SHIPPING amazon e-commerce online sales fewer stores slowing growth It’s no secret that Walmart is gunning for some of Amazon’s customer base: gobbling up e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion, mulling the idea of investing in Amazon competitor Flipkart, launching the $50/year Prime-rival Shipping Pass, and increasing distribution channels. As an indicator of the retailer’s online-focused future, Walmart has announced it is slowing the growth of its bricks-and-mortar stores while building more warehouses to expedite deliveries. The company said Thursday that it would begin to scale back the number of stores it plans to open in the U.S. over the next two years, with 130 stores opening in the next fiscal year (ending in Feb. 2017) and 55 in the 2018 fiscal year, USA Today reports. While the decrease in new stores — which will represent just 1% growth in 2018 — may come as a surprise, it probably shouldn’t. For starters, the company announced earlier this year it would actually close about 150 stores (though most of them were smaller-footprint Walmart Express locations), and it recently put many of its eggs in one basket: online sales. To that end, vice president of e-commerce supply chain Justen Traweek tells Reuters that Walmart is on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016. Previously, industry consultants had estimated Walmart would have just eight distribution centers by the end of 2017. The company also relies on more than 100 smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders, and 160 stores that serve as distribution centers, Reuters reports. Still, the large warehouses are perhaps the biggest cog in Walmart’s e-commerce strategy: the large buildings, with their abundance of products, allow the retailer to ship items in one package, rather than multiple packages from different stores around the country. In turn, this cuts down on the time it takes to ship products, putting the company and its $50 Shipping Pass more in line with Amazon’s two-day Prime membership shipping. “We have doubled our capacity in the last 12 months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek tells Reuters, noting that the company could eventually offer one-day shipping. Online sales represent about $14 to $16 billion of Walmart’s approximate $355 billion in annual revenue, USA Today reports, citing Moody’s Investor Service. While online sales are just a small portion of Walmart’s bottomline, executives with the company expect that to change in the future as the retailer combines all of its services. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement to USA Today. “Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly — so that’s what we’re doing.” Wal-Mart’s next move against Amazon: More warehouses, faster shipping [Reuters] Walmart to slow U.S. store openings [USA Today] October 6, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler changing pace walmart SHIPPING amazon e-commerce online sales fewer stores slowing growth Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related Invading The Great White North Walmart Spending $270M On Canadian Expansion; Plans To Build 29 Supercenters In The Frozen North where's my stuff?

At Wal-Mart's annual meeting with investors in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Thursday, McMillon said he's fielded many questions over why a start-up entrepreneur such as Lore would want to partner with the corporate behemoth. "We're really more alike than people would guess, even though Jet's 'younger and cooler,' some might say," McMillon said. He likened Lore's focus on finding new ways to deliver savings to customers to the mindset of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, who built Wal-Mart's business by promising the lowest prices. Lore, who has been on the job 17 days, chimed in that he founded his e-commerce company on three core values: trust, transparency and fairness. Jet uses a pricing algorithm that allows customers to save money by adding more items to their basket, or paying with a credit card over a debit card. It also reduces the price shoppers pay if more of their items are shipped from the same distribution center. "We did live those values in a way that no company ever has," Lore said. "We are changing consumer behavior," he said, adding that he's "incredibly excited" about the assets he now has at his disposal through the Wal-Mart tie-up. Those include a network of fulfillment centers and sourcing capabilities that are "not even close" to what it had previously. Wal-Mart completed the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet last month. As of August, Jet.com had a run rate of $1.2 billion. It has acquired 5 million customers who average 6.9 units per order. In the first half of the year, Wal-Mart fell well behind its previous goal to grow online sales between 20 percent and 30 percent over three years. CFO Brett Biggs told investors that excluding the impact of its sale of Yihaodian, an online grocery business in China, earlier this year, Wal-Mart's digital sales should come in near that range in the back half. It could potentially top that level in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Biggs said. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, then great things are going to happen," McMillon said.

CDT October 06, 2016 Walmart is cutting some back-office jobs (Photo: Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Walmart expects to reduce its rate of new U.S. store openings to a trickle within the next two years as the big-box chain seeks to bolster its online business and improve its foreign operations. The retailer (WMT) said Thursday that it would open 130 stores in the 2017 fiscal year ending in February and 55 in the fiscal year ending in February 2018. For a giant company with nearly 4,600 stores nationwide, those projections reflect growth of only 1.1% in 2018 — a far cry from the retailer's 5.1% store growth rate in the 2016 fiscal year, when it added 161 small-format locations and 69 supercenters. In the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years, the company opened 52, 70, 141, 198 and 316 stores, respectively. The planned small-format openings in the U.S. include 70 in 2017 and 20 in 2018. Though Walmart's reputation for low prices and its massive size give the company a significant foothold in the market for everyday items, it is coming under assault from Amazon.com and other digital forces. Walmart projected that profit would be flat from 2017 to 2018 before growing 5% in 2019. Any signs of a slowdown may prove unnerving to investors who look to the company for steady earnings. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," Walmart CEODoug McMillon said in a statement. "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly — so that’s what we’re doing." Walmart also reiterated its 2017 earnings-per-share expectations of $4.29 to $4.49 and projected that capital expenditures would decline from $11.5 billion in 2016 to $11 billion in 2017 and 2018. The company recently sought to bolster its online presence with the $3 billion acquisition of Internet retailing start-up and would-be Amazon.com competitor Jet.com. That deal, along with other "incremental U.S. e-commerce operating investments" will "accelerate e-commerce growth," Walmart said in the filing. Online sales represent about $14 billion to $16 billion of Walmart's approximately $355 billion in annual U.S. revenue, according to Moody's Investor Service. Despite the small percentage, Moody's hailed the retailer's efforts. "While we think it’s still early yet, we believe that Walmart’s big upfront spend to grow online, among other steps in recent months, is showing early signs of promise," Moody's said in a research note. Walmart also said it is seeking "a sharpened focus in China," where competitors have taken a savvier approach, and "solid growth" in foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada.

The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The Associated Press Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of other changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. _____ ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.

By Anthony Caskey The Brownsville Herald Four days of freedom ended Wednesday for one escaped Cameron County inmate when sheriffs depu-ties and members of an FBI task force captured him in a San Benito trailer. Benjamin Leal III was arrested without incident from a trailer near Stokely Park at about 12:45 p.m., Ca-meron County Chief Deputy Juan Mendoza said. Leal escaped from the maximum-security detention center in Olmito late Saturday. The 18-year-old Harlingen resident was being held at the jail on aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault charges. Investigators believe he spent most of his time since the breakout in a wooded area. He reportedly was spotted Tuesday at the San Benito Boys & Girls Club and sheriffs deputies were tipped off, Mendoza said, adding, We figured he had to be close. A trailer near the club is believed to be inhabited by a relative of Leals, and depu-ties watched it after receiving the tip, Mendoza said. When Leal returned to the trailer, a group of deputies and members of an FBI task force apprehended him, Mendoza said. Cantu said Leal was with three men who were also arrested and will be charged with hindering an apprehension, a third-degree felony. They knew he was an escapee and they didnt tell anyone, the sheriff said. Now theyre facing charges too. Brownsville resident Jose Luis Mendoza, 29, charged with auto theft and misdemeanor drug charges, also fled the jail Saturday and is still on the loose, Cantu said. But, Were real close to capturing him, Cantu said. The sheriffs department is not going to stop until we arrest the other one too. The two men are believed to have used plastic spoons to pick a lock to a broom closet in their cell and make their way through a crawl space to the roof of the jail and jump to freedom. It is the first escape from the $20 million maximum-security jail, which began holding inmates about three months ago. The incident prompted county officials to call for an examination of soft spots at the jail and call for more secure locks on doors.

News Wal-Mart Earnings Forecast Trails Views On More Investment Spending; Stock Falls Wal-Mart forecast earnings for its next fiscal year that trailed some analysts' estimates. (Walmart) BLOOMBERG NEWS 10/06/2016 Reprints Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) forecast earnings for its next fiscal year that trailed some analysts' estimates as the world's largest retailer plans more investments to improve stores and build out its e-commerce capabilities. In the year through January 2018, earnings on a GAAP basis will be "relatively flat" compared with the current year's expected adjusted profit of $4.15 to $4.35 a share, the Bentonville, Ark.-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts projected profit of $4.47 a share for the retailer's next fiscal year, on average. The outlook signals that Wal-Mart sees more challenges ahead as it works to improve customer service and upgrade its online operations to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). While Wal-Mart has seen better-than-expected growth in the U.S. this year as it cut prices and spruced up its stores, the company is spending billions of dollars to upgrade its website and mobile app, including last month's $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce startup Jet.com. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview Thursday that Wal-Mart will continue to make investments in remodeling stores and ramping up its online grocery pickup efforts. "The management team deserves kudos for taking the company's challenges head-on," Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research, said in a note to clients earlier this week. "Stores are neater, better stocked, and prices are headed lower." Still, the company faces struggles online, where it has an "abyss of operating losses," said Mushkin, who rates the stock underperform, the equivalent off a sell. McMillon has attributed Wal-Mart's profit struggles to his decision to pay higher wages and invest heavily in its online operations, but he told investors last year that growth would return once those the company moved past those increased costs. Wal-Mart is spending $1.5 billion this year to raise its minimum wages to $10 an hour and improve employee training. In addition to the Jet.com purchase, Wal-Mart also plans to invest more than $1 billion on its digital operations this year. Store Openings Slow As Wal-Mart focuses on improving its more than 5,200 U.S. locations, it will significantly slow down the number of stores it is adding. The retailer will open just 35 of its supercenters next year, down from 60 additions in the current year. It will also add fewer of its smaller-format locations, such as its grocery-store-sized Neighborhood Markets, which have been a key driver of growth in recent years. Next year it plans to open 20 of the smaller stores, compared with 70 this year and 161 last year. Analysts have questioned how much further Wal-Mart can expand its big-box model, with more than 90% of Americans already living within 10 miles of a store. Outside the U.S., China will become a greater focus for the company. Wal-Mart has struggled over the years to adapt its stores to meet Chinese consumers' tastes and compete with local e-commerce and online grocery providers. Wal-Mart said Thursday that it's boosting its stake in China's second-largest e-commerce website, JD.com (JD) Inc., strengthening an alliance to win more market share. Wal-Mart is signaling that its work may not be complete even after next year. The company said earnings per share in fiscal 2019 will grow about 5%. The retailer had previously projected a gain of 5%-10%. "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business, and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," McMillon said. "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly -- so that's what we're doing." Wal-Mart shares fell 2.8% to 69.68 in morning trade on the stock market today, briefly falling below its 200-day line. The stock had gained 17% this year through Wednesday.

Walmart pulls back, slows U.S. store openings Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY Thursday, 06-Oct-16 12:42:16 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Walmart expects to reduce its rate of new U.S. store openings to a trickle within the next two years as the big-box chain seeks to bolster its online business and improve its foreign operations. The retailer (WMT) said Thursday that it would open 130 stores in the 2017 fiscal year ending in February and 55 in the 2018 fiscal year ending in February 2018. For a giant company with nearly 4,600 stores nationwide, those projections reflect relatively inconsequential growth. In the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, the company added 198 and 316 stores, respectively, according to a securities filing. The planned small-format openings in the U.S. include 70 in 2017 and 20 in 2018, reflecting a sharp decline after opening 161 in 2016. Though Walmart's reputation for low prices and its massive size give the company a significant foothold in the market for everyday items, it is coming under assault from Amazon.com and other digital forces. Walmart projected that profit would be flat from 2017 to 2018 before growing 5% in 2019. Any signs of a slowdown may prove unnerving to investors who look to the company for steady earnings. The company's stock fell 2.1% in pre-market trading to $70.20. The projections include an additional $45 billion to $60 billion in revenue over the next three years, which would put the company above the half-trillion mark in annual sales. Still, Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told investors that the company must crack down on costs by "being tougher on third-party expenses, travel and things like that" and must improve store productivity and reduce excess inventory. "We're not where we want to be from an overall expense standpoint," he said Thursday. Walmart also reiterated its 2017 earnings-per-share expectations of $4.29 to $4.49 and projected that capital expenditures would decline from $11.5 billion in 2016 to $11 billion in 2017 and 2018. The company recently sought to bolster its online presence with the $3 billion acquisition of Internet retailing start-up and would-be Amazon.com competitor Jet.com. That deal, along with an increased investment in Chinese online retailer JD.com, will bolster Walmart's online acumen. The company projected annual online sales growth of 20% to 30% from the 2017 through 2019 fiscal years. Online sales represent only about $14 billion to $16 billion of Walmart's approximately $355 billion in annual U.S. revenue, according to Moody's Investor Service. Despite the small percentage, Moody's hailed the retailer's efforts. "Walmart's forecasts announced this morning are in line with our expectations, especially when the costs involved in building out its online capability are considered," Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said in a note. "It will take a while for the company to become a true multi-channel retailer, which occurs when cost efficiencies begin to generate and duplication reduces dramatically as physical assets and personnel are optimized." Walmart also said it is seeking "a sharpened focus in China," where competitors have taken a savvier approach, and "solid growth" in foreign markets such as Mexico and Canada. "We're seeing traction and the company is moving faster," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors. Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

 Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model Hayley Peterson Oct. 6, 2016, 10:33 AM 20,407 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says Walmart is transforming into an ecommerce company. AP Walmart is shifting its business model. Going forward, the nation's largest retailer doesn't want to be defined by its stores. "This company, over time, is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday at Walmart's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. He said stores will remain vital to Walmart's future. But the company will be cutting back on new store growth, focusing more on same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — and growing investments in ecommerce. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018. Walmart is trying to transform into an ecommerce company to better compete with Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. But the majority of Walmart's business still comes from its stores.  The company's total revenue last year was $482 billion, meaning more than 97% of its business came from stores.  SEE ALSO: Walmart has a secret weapon that could one-up Amazon — but it hasn’t released it yet NOW WATCH: This is how much it’ll cost you to open a McDonald’s Loading video...

Home Industry Companies Wal-Mart’s next move against Amazon: More warehouses, faster shipping Wal-Mart’s next move against Amazon: More warehouses, faster shipping Wal-Mart Stores Inc is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. By: Reuters | Chicago | Updated: October 6, 2016 8:19 PM Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. (Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world’s largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon’s robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. “We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. “These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon,” said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. “Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them.” Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart’s overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart’s e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. “This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart’s speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience,” said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart’s new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart’s $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart’s 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio’s from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That’s why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. “Anything that crimps Wal-Mart’s profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach,” he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Walmart closed on its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. The world’s biggest retailer also said Thursday that it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat versus its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Walmart foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., outlined its plans for the next several years ahead of its meeting with investors Thursday. Executives are expected to offer more updates on how it will integrate its Jet.com business with its online operations and offer more insight into how it will compete against online leader Amazon.com. Related Articles September 19, 2016 Walmart completes $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com August 31, 2016 Colorado asks Walmart to sell “ugly” produce in local stores August 8, 2016 Walmart buys Jet.com for $3 billion “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail,” said CEO Doug McMillon in a statement. “Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly – so that’s what we’re doing.” Like its direct store rivals, Walmart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Walmart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. Walmart has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It’s melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. It’s in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Walmart raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its Walmart U.S. namesake business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Walmart shares fell $2.16, or 3 percent, to $69.51 in morning trading Thursday. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. Target’s shares are down 6 percent for the year and are hovering at about $67. Last month, Walmart closed the deal to buy Jet.com. It believes that it will help it grab higher-income and younger customers and will be incorporating some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. But Walmart still has plenty of challenges. The company faces challenges in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. The company has been making some changes to bolster its business overseas. The company announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Walmart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. In the release issued Thursday, Walmart said it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the last fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year that ended in January, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Walmart plans to open 60 supercenter stores and 70 small-format stores or what it calls its Neighborhood Market stores this year. And for next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller format stores. Walmart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Twitter dived 17.9 percent after technology news site Recode said Google had no plans to bid for the social media company. Apple and Disney also are not interested in making a takeover offer, the article said. Dow member Wal-Mart Stores lost 2.5 percent after it projected that fiscal 2018 earnings would be flat amid a period of heavy investments in e-commerce and increased staff pay in the US. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 18,188.79, down 0.5 percent. The broad-based S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent at 2,153.47, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.4 percent at 5,292.41. Analysts expect caution among investors ahead of Friday's US jobs report for September. Analysts have projected the economy added 176,000 jobs last month. Declines in Twitter and Wal-Mart were offset somewhat by gains in petroleum-linked equities after US oil prices shot above $50 a barrel in intraday trade for the first time since June. Dow member American Express lost 3.3 percent following a downgrade by Nomura. Lam Research advanced 2.4 percent while KLA-Tencor lost 0.1 percent as they announced they were shelving a plan to merge due to opposition from antitrust regulators. The two companies provide process control technology for the semiconductor industry. - AFP Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Tsunami hit New Zealand after quake...

Derek Russell in Entertainment, Lifestyle W. DEREK RUSSELL Do you ever try out one of those blood pressure cuff machines at Walmart or Fred’s? You know, the ones they put right out in front of the pharmacy so everyone can take a look at you and judge you for your numbers, like they’re copying off you for an upcoming test. I assure you, nobody would want to receive my grade. Up until about two years ago, I was pulling in numbers like 170 over 90 whenever I would stop off for a reading. To be fair, that was in a place like Walmart. Everyone’s blood pressure is higher in Walmart and if it’s not, then something is wrong with you. That’s why you shop local: Your blood pressure isn’t as high when you stay away from chain stores and shop local. But, for the sake of this piece, I actually was in Walmart one day on one of those machines that was trying to eat away my arm slowly, when I realized I had a problem. Now, to be fair, I’d been told I’d had a problem many times before. The first time I remember a doctor telling me I had ridiculously high blood pressure was when I was 19, so it took nearly a decade for me to do something about it. More often than not, that’s when I see people make a change in their lives – when they’re the ones behind the wheel of it. Convincing someone to change rarely makes them want to do so. In fact, it usually has the opposite impact in my experience. I finally got on medication in 2014 which helped considerably. During our recent health screenings at the Daily Journal, I had one of the lowest blood pressure readings I’ve ever had, probably since the days of me eating cereal in my pajamas and watching “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” on TV. Though, again, to be fair, that was just last Saturday. High blood pressure isn’t one of the things Saturday morning cartoons prepared me for as a child; they caution you on the dangers of quicksand and falling Acme anvils. I never saw He-Man stop off for a blood pressure test or Fred Flinstone drink a vial of Brontosaurus Barium to get ready for his colonoscopy. Yabba Dabba Do I have to drink the whole thing? I think cartoons should have been available for older age groups to deal with what you’re going through at that point in your life. Sure, when we were kids you could watch George Jetson trip and fall on the treadmill and call for Jane to get him off that crazy thing, but I would have appreciated an episode of “The Jetsons” later in life that helped you cope with death or Elroy overeating. Though, by the time we get to the future of “The Jetsons,” colonoscopies and death might be a thing of the past. Though, I am glad we never had to see Scooby-Doo or Garfield get put down by the vet or an aged-Speed Racer have his license taken away by his kids after one too many infractions. Later installments of “Inspector Gadget” might have revealed an episode where he shot an unarmed man, “Duck Tales” probably would have been impacted by the BP Oil spill, “Fat Albert” definitely had a foot amputated and Ms. Frizzle most likely got locked up for child endangerment against the “Magic School Bus” kids. It might be time for my medication. W. Derek Russell is the Daily Journal’s arts and entertainment reporter. Contact him @wderekrussell on Twitter or email him at derek.russell@journalinc.com.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 6, 2016 at 9:05AM A Wal-Mart store in India. Image Source: Wal-Mart. Months after making the biggest U.S. acquisition of an e-commerce company in history with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is back at it again. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest retailer "is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart Online Services," India's largest online retailer. When rumors arose that Wal-Mart was in talks to buy Jet.com, the company announced a deal just days later, so it wouldn't be surprising to see yet another announcement in the coming days. The news comes at a time when India is becoming an increasingly important focus of companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which see tremendous growth in the world's largest democracy. With more than a billion consumers and a fast-growing economy, India may one day become a growth engine in the way that China is today. What is Flipkart? Founded in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart has grown to a valuation of $16 billion, making it India's most valuable start-up. Its homegrown talent has helped the company master a difficult country to do business in, one where hundreds of languages are spoken, few people have credit cards, and the infrastructure is unreliable. The founders surprised many by proving that e-commerce could work in India, but after several years of strong growth, sales are slowing, not least because of Amazon's efforts on the subcontinent. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has pledged to invest $5 billion into the Indian market, and the voracious e-commerce giant has a no-holds barred way of competing, promising to open a network of warehouses and do more last-mile deliveries. Now enter Wal-Mart. My enemy's enemy is my friend Just as Jet.com and Wal-Mart are teaming up to take on Amazon at home, so it seems that Wal-Mart is making a similar play with Flipkart in India. The retail giant has had mixed results in its adventures abroad. It has become a dominant retailer in Mexico and in other parts of Latin America but has struggled at times in Europe, and its performance in China has also been underwhelming. The company recently sold its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian for a 5% stake in JD.com, the No. 2 e-commerce site in China.    Wal-Mart India owns and operates 21 Best Price stores and previously partnered on a joint retail venture with Bharti Group, the country's largest telecom operator. That business was unsuccessful, however, and Wal-Mart sold its stake in the venture. A deal with Flipkart could be significant for both companies. Flipkart could use a $1 billion cash infusion from Wal-Mart to further expand and fend off Amazon, and both companies could benefit from each other's expertise. Wal-Mart has years of experience with things like marketing and building complex logistical systems, and Flipkart has come up with creative solutions for tackling operations in developing countries. An investment in Flipkart would also give Wal-Mart a strong horse in what will be one of the biggest e-commerce markets, while it's still developing. Wal-Mart seems to have learned its lesson from the U.S., as it waited much too long to take on Amazon directly in the domestic market, where it now has a near-insurmountable lead. A playbook for taking on Amazon Following the Jet.com acquisition, it's becoming clear that Wal-Mart is hoping to become a force in e-commerce in part by swallowing other companies. There's nothing wrong with its strategy, and in fact, it shows some wisdom -- Wal-Mart's biggest advantage may be its deep pockets and the fact that it isn't Amazon, as nearly every other online retailer is feeling the heat from the undisputed leader in the space. Amazon itself has employed a similar strategy throughout its history. Acquisitions like Zappos.com, Diapers.com-parent Quidisi, which shares a founder with Jet.com, and Kiva Technologies have helped establish Amazon in various markets. Since taking the helm in 2014, CEO Doug McMillon has promised to devote more attention to e-commerce, and Wal-Mart finally seems to be following through on that promise. It has scaled back on new store openings to save on capital expenditures, and it has rapidly expanded its online grocery pickup program, which has been well received. Its acquisition of Jet.com and potential partnership with Flipkart will add momentum to those efforts. Challenging Amazon won't be easy, but Wal-Mart is taking the right steps to establish itself in markets with the biggest opportunities. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. "We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day," Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. "These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon," said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. "Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them." Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000.

 Walmart has a secret weapon that could one-up Amazon — but it hasn’t released it yet Hayley Peterson Oct. 6, 2016, 9:16 AM 12,303 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images Walmart has been aggressively investing in ecommerce to catch up to rival Amazon.  The retailer is cutting back on store growth over the next several years as it invests in digital, the company said Thursday. "This company over time is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018.  The company says it's now capable of shipping packages to 70% of America within one day, according to Reuters. But it can't do so profitably, so it hasn't rolled out the service or advertised it to customers just yet. Amazon currently offers two-day delivery to members of its Prime program, who pay $99 annually for the service.  Walmart has been ramping up investments in ecommerce as it tries to catch up to Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. As part of its bid to take on Amazon, Walmart recently purchased online retailer Jet.com. The company has said it expects Jet.com to accelerate its ecommerce growth. "We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement Thursday. "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly - so that’s what we’re doing."

Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 8:53 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>Election offers clear economic choice: David Malpass</p> <p>David Malpass, Trump economic advisor, talks about Donald Trump&#039;s plan for economic change and how it will work.</p> Election offers clear economic choice: David Malpass    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 7:32 AM ET | 02:41 From Wal-Mart to the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund, there are new signs the U.S. economy is on the wrong track, a senior economic advisor to the Donald Trump campaign told CNBC on Thursday. To make his point, David Malpass cited conservative news from Wal-Mart that broke just before his appearance on "Squawk Box." The giant retailer on Thursday morning reiterated its guidance for the current fiscal year, and said there would be fewer store openings than originally planned and a significantly slower store-opening pace in fiscal 2018. It also predicted flat earnings next year. "The election presents a choice. Do you want the current policies, which Wal-Mart has given us a very clear forecast [of] ... or do you want some different for the U.S.?" asked Malpass, president of economic and market research firm Encima Global. Malpass accuses Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of advocating the status quo from the failed years of President Barack Obama that's produced just 2 percent economic growth. "Trump is saying that's 'definitely not good enough for workers in America, for small business, for minorities. This system that they're doing is simply failing.' We have to have massive change," Malpass said. As more ammunition for his argument, Malpass pointed to the Fed's reduction in projected full-year gross domestic product to 1.8 percent, following its September policy meeting, at which central bankers held interest rates steady. Malpass said the IMF's new forecast for growth this week add to the urgent need for the GOP presidential nominee's ideas to boost the economy. "That's the whole point of the campaign — to change taxes [and] regulatory policy." On Tuesday, the IMF said advanced economies, including the U.S., will slow this year to 1.6 percent growth, compared with 2.1 percent last year and the group's July forecast of 1.8 percent. "Think of all the benefits that come from faster growth," Malpass said. "As you grow faster, Wal-Mart does better, everyone does better."

Justin Daniel Sturm, 28, of Ubly, was sentenced Monday to seven to 40 years for conducting a criminal enterprise; two to 20 years for breaking and entering a building with intent to commit larceny therein; and one year for heroin possession. Each sentence was enhanced by Sturm’s status as a third-offense habitual offender, which doubles the maximum sentence. Derrick Nicholas Grifka, 23, of Ubly, was sentenced in August to five to 25 years for a conviction of conducting a criminal enterprise and for being a fourth-offense habitual offender. Due to his prior criminal history, he had faced up to life in prison. Brad Allen Galloway, 33, of Caseville, pleaded guilty on Aug. 29 to a charge of conducting a criminal enterprise and to being a third-offense habitual offender. Combined, the convictions carry a possible maximum prison sentence of 40 years. He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 24. Sturm and his two associates took the televisions by loading them onto carts and walking out with them through the store’s front doors. They then transported the stolen items to Flint, where they traded the items for heroin. In total, the televisions were valued at $18,985. Grifka and Sturm were both ordered to pay their share of the cost in restitution to Walmart, and the same order is expected when Galloway is sentenced. Huron County Prosecutor Timothy J. Rutkowski said the men typically worked in two-man teams while stealing the televisions. Sturm and Grifka were present during seven of the 11 incidents, and Galloway took part in nine of the thefts. Sturm’s breaking and entering conviction was for a theft from Thumb Pawn, which was unrelated to the Walmart case. Co-defendant William John Messing said he was unaware Sturm was stealing items from the store until Sturm returned to the vehicle Messing was driving. Since Messing assisted Sturm by helping him leave the site with the stolen goods, he was also charged with breaking and entering with intent. On Monday, Sept. 26, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 60 days held in abeyance, and 18 months probation. Before his sentence was read, Sturm apologized to the court and stated his crimes were linked to his drug addiction. In a letter Sturm submitted to the court, he said he was doing well following his release from prison approximately five years ago. Then, he was injured in an automobile accident, which also nearly killed his best friend. “Even though I had a really good job, I couldn’t keep up, and that’s when everything spiraled out of control. I was scared to ask for help until it was pretty much too late,” Sturm wrote. On the date of his arrest, May 20, he was scheduled to begin treatment at a rehabilitation facility. Rutkowski said he requested a sentence of 12 to 14 years, which fell within the guideline range. Defense attorney Dallas Rooney asked for leniency, arguing that all Sturm’s crimes involved property, not violence against people. Rutkowski said just because Sturm did not directly attack a person doesn’t mean people were not injured by his crimes. “People are affected,” Rutkowski said. “Business owners are losing money, and they have to try to get that money back by charging honest customers more. It affects the rest of society.” He said a lengthy prison sentence will serve to protect the community. “Sturm’s not going to change. His history is littered with thefts,” Rutkowski said. Sturm received 136 days credit for time served. He was ordered to pay $594 fines and costs.

The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. FILE - This Sept. 19, 2013, file photo, shows the sign of a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. Wal-Mart said Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn't as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Wal-Mart shares plunged 10 percent. But Wal-Mart's flurry of moves — online and in the stores — have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Wal-Mart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year. In contrast, rival Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Wal-Mart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter — up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. Wal-Mart also reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. McMillon stressed to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help the company attract higher-income and younger customers. Wal-Mart plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges. Analysts questioned whether the price cuts that Wal-Mart is taking will be sustainable as rivals respond. And they asked executives how much profit they would be willing to risk. Wal-Mart had said it is spending several billion dollars in its plans to lower prices, but haven't given any specific details. McMillon declined to talk about how much farther they would be willing to go. Wal-Mart did say Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. ___ AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report. ___ Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

(NYSE: WMT) fell in pre-market trading after the company guided flat EPS for the fiscal year 2018. The company, however, reaffirmed its forecast for the fiscal year 2017. The retailer will also be outlining its strategic framework during the investment community meeting on Thursday. The company indicated the following four key focus areas for continuing its success: Make shopping easier for buy families Disciplined operation with a focus on cost management Most trust retailer Place the company to win to deliver results Wal-Mart reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance of $4.15-$4.35 and GAAP EPS of $4.29-$4.49 for the fiscal year 2017. While projecting GAAP EPS to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2018, the company expects to deliver about 5 percent growth in EPS in fiscal year 2019. The company expects to spend on e-commerce to accelerate growth in the sector. President and CEO, Doug McMillon, commented, "We are encouraged by the progress we're seeing across our business and we're moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail. Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly - so that's what we're doing." The stock fell $1.54, or 2.15 percent, to $70.00 in the pre-market trading.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Wal-Mart plans bigger e-commerce shift, tempers profit view By Reuters Published: 14:22 EST, 6 October 2016 | Updated: 14:22 EST, 6 October 2016 e-mail By Nandita Bose CHICAGO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations on Thursday and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years. The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centered on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target. Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading at $69.59. "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day. The company spent more than $3 billion in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales. Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years. Online sales currently account for about 3 percent of total sales. Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about $11 billion, similar to this year. Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent. While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note. The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercenters compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighborhood markets from 161 last year.

(Photo: Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images) New York — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is planning to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. Wal-Mart closed on its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. The world’s biggest retailer also said Thursday that it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat versus its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Wal-Mart foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, outlined its plans for the next several years ahead of its meeting with investors Thursday. Executives are expected to offer more updates on how it will integrate its Jet.com business with its online operations and offer more insight into how it will compete against online leader Amazon.com. “We are encouraged by the progress we’re seeing across our business and we’re moving with speed to position the company to win the future of retail,” said CEO Doug McMillon in a statement. “Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly - so that’s what we’re doing.” Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. Wal-Mart has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It’s melding online services with its massive fleet of stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. It’s in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its Wal-Mart U.S. namesake business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Wal-Mart shares are up 17 percent for the year, and are at near $72. Shares fell $1.33, or 1.9 percent, to $70.34 in premarket trading Thursday. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right and it also didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. Target’s shares are down 6 percent for the year and are hovering at about $67. Last month, Wal-Mart closed the deal to buy Jet.com. It believes that it will help it grab higher-income and younger customers and will be incorporating some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. But Wal-Mart still has plenty of challenges. The company faces challenges in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. The company has been making some changes to bolster its business overseas. The company announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. In the release issued Thursday, Wal-Mart said it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the last fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year that ended in January, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenter stores and 70 small-format stores or what it calls its Neighborhood Market stores this year. And for next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Twitter — Alphabet's Google unit will not move ahead with a bid to acquire Twitter, and that Walt Disney and Apple were also unlikely to be suitors, according to Recode. Wal-Mart — The retailer reiterated its prior financial guidance for this year, and said it expected earnings to be flat next year compared with this year and then up 5 percent the following year. The retailer plans to slow new store growth, and added that it is very strong financially and has flexibility and options that competitors do not have. Wal-Mart executives will discuss these matters in detail at today's Investor Day. Mylan — The drugmaker overcharged Medicaid for its EpiPen over two decades, according to Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey. They say a letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services backs their view that the product was incorrectly classified as a generic drug since the fourth quarter of 1997. Mylan said the product has been classified correctly. Yum Brands — Yum reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.09 per share, missing estimates by a penny a share. The restaurant operator's revenue also was below forecasts. The parent of KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza hut also reported a one percent drop in China same-store sales, compared to estimates of a 4.5 percent increase. L Brands — The Victoria's Secret parent reported a three percent increase in September same-store sales, well above the 0.1 percent increase estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals — The drug company will stop development of a drug designed to treat a genetic condition that can cause heart failure. The action follows negative results from a late-stage study. Tesla — Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla to "neutral" from "buy," and lowered its six-month price target to $185 from $240 per share. Goldman sees increased risk for the automaker owing to its deployment of capital for the takeover of SolarCity, and a potential further delay in the launch of the Model 3. Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health — UBS began coverage on both drugstore operators with "buy" ratings, praising the "integrated approach to care management" practiced by CVS, and the broadness of Walgreens product offerings. Abercrombie & Fitch — The apparel retailer was downgraded to "sector weight" from "overweight" at KeyBanc, citing a heavier promotional environment. AT&T — AT&T has struck a multi-year strategic deal with Amazon Web Services, with the two companies collaborating on cloud and networking capabilities. MetLife — MetLife plans to spin off its U.S. life insurance business to existing shareholders. It had announced earlier this year that it would separate that unit and rename it Brighthouse Financial, but had not yet chosen the method of separation at that time. The news came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and does not necessarily preclude a change to a different option such as an initial public offering. JD.com — The shares are getting a boost on news that Wal-Mart is nearly doubling its investment in the China-based online retailer to about 10.8 percent. The Wall Street Journal reports that the move also gives Wal-Mart observer status at JD.com's board meetings. KLA-Tencor, Lam Research — The companies have canceled their planned $10.6 billion merger. The two semiconductor companies pointed to Justice Department opposition to the deal on antitrust grounds. Deutsche Bank — The German lender has not been in violation of money laundering rules in Russia, according to a Reuters report, which said a German financial watchdog has found no evidence of wrongdoing. Costco — The warehouse retailer reported a September same-store sales increase of one percent, doubling the Thomson Reuters estimate of a 0.5 percent rise. BlackBerry — BlackBerry sales executive Alex Thurber told the BBC that a new keyboard-based BlackBerry device will be on the market within six months. —By CNBC's Peter Schacknow Questions? Comments?

While cross-dressing on Halloween can be harmless, it's the term 'tranny' being used to market a men's costume that goes too far for many transgender people.  Scroll down for video  An offensive 'Tranny Granny' costume has been pulled from the websites of Walmart, Amazon and Target The costume was being sold by a third-party vendor called Rasta Imposta. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with,' a Walmart spokesman said 'The word "tranny" and the stigma associated with it is often used to humiliate, dehumanize and degrade transgender women in a way that challenges and discredits our womanhood,' Ashlee Marie Preston, a transgender activist, told Mic. 'When society refuses to view us as women, we are instantly filed away under the "it" category and stripped of our humanity.' After complaints, both Amazon and Walmart pulled the product from their website on Tuesday, and Target - which had been selling the costume under the name 'Women's Granny Costume' - followed suit on Wednesday.  All three retailers had the costume listed by a third-party vendor called Rasta Imposta.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Insta-famous fashion designers you NEED to know: The top... First THAT dress divided the internet, now The Bag has... Share this article Share Walmart told LGBTQNation that the costume 'obviously' violated its terms of service for third-party retailers. It's unclear how the team dedicated to reviewing these products let it slip through the cracks.   'While it’s listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified. We’re appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with,' a spokesman said.   The 'Tranny Granny' costume was produced to be sold at $64, but was discounted to around $25 on most sites.   The costume is somewhat remniscent of the 'Call Me Caitlyn' costume which surfaced last year, parodying Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover. The costume was met with widespread criticism and was eventually pulled from several retailers.    Read more: The year's first transphobic Halloween costume, the "Tranny Granny," has arrived | Mic UPDATED: Walmart yanks ‘tranny granny’ Halloween costume from website / LGBTQ Nation Share or comment on this article e-mail 373 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A        Remember the old TV commercials promoting cotton? “The Fabric of Our Lives,” went the sentimental-sounding jingle. Many Americans still prefer cotton clothing and bedding. We’ll even pay extra for it. The world’s best cotton comes from Egypt. Sheets made from Egyptian cotton can cost three times as much as other varieties. Which raises a question: When the package says your sheets are Egyptian cotton, how do you know that’s true? We assume that big retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) buy from trustworthy sources and would not sell mislabeled products. That turns out to not always be true. Both Target and Wal-Mart recently cut ties with Welspun, an Indian textile company that sold them millions of fake cotton sheets. This apparently went on for years. It did not occur to them that Egypt doesn’t produce nearly enough cotton to account for all the products labeled as such. In any case, the companies have now stopped selling Welspun products, offered refunds to customers who bought them and are investigating their supply chains. All good moves, but it gives me another question. What other fake products are these big chain stores selling? I can give you one example. My wife owns a hair salon and sells Paul Mitchell hair products. Paul Mitchell sells only through professional hair stylists. All their distributors are under contract not to sell the products to anyone else. Yet you can still find Paul Mitchell bottles on grocery and drug store shelves. All of them are counterfeit, old or stolen. If you bought your Paul Mitchell shampoo at Target, you are applying unknown and possibly toxic substances to your head every day. Good luck with that. The retailers refund anyone who complains, but are otherwise unconcerned. Today’s far-flung global supply chains bring lower prices, but they have another cost. We can never be sure that we are really getting what we expect. As one cotton expert told Bloomberg News: “Customers want a better and better price, and the retailer applies that same pressure all the way through the supply chain. So what do the suppliers do? They cheat.” I feel sure this Egyptian cotton episode is the tip of the iceberg. Does Wal-Mart really know the origin of everything it sells? I’m sure they try, but it can’t be easy. Their stores must have all kinds of fake products. Ditto for Target and many others. Is this really a big deal? If you like your sheets and you thought the price was fair, maybe no harm done. The problem is that people and companies who get away with small deceptions often move on to larger ones. Then we end up buying products that aren’t just overpriced, but also dangerous and unsafe. Why did Target and Wal-Mart suddenly take interest in cotton sheets when they sell so many other thinly-sourced products? I don’t know, but it will be a giant problem if they start applying the new cotton-sourcing standard to everything in their stores. The Wells Fargo (WFC) bank account scandal suggests consumers are tired of having big companies take their business for granted. If enough customers start demanding change, the companies will have to deliver - and it won’t be good for their profit margins.

(NYSE:WMT) is taking aggressive measures to try to bolster its e-commerce business and better compete with its main foe, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In its biggest move, Wal-Mart is scaling up its number of warehouses to cut down on shipping times for online orders. From Bloomberg: The world’s largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. The company has also invested a great deal of time and money in upgrading its technological infrastructure, including state-of-the art robotic facilities: Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon’s robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. “We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the U.S. population in one day,” Traweek said. According to Bloomberg, Wal-Mart has spent about $3 billion over the past four years alone to boost its e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company has also been busy with M&A, recently acquiring Jet.com and installing its CEO, Marc Lore, as the new head of its online business. These initiatives should help the company reach more shoppers and deliver goods faster. And while it may never catch Amazon on the e-commerce side, it can certainly widen the gap between its online business and those of other competitors. WMT shares rose $0.61 (+0.85%) to $72.28 in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 16.92%, versus a 5.76% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Thursday, the world's largest retailer will hold its annual investor day -- and it should have a vastly different tone than the last two. The past two meetings were almost held with a dark cloud overhead in the form of Walmart's U.S sales growth continuing to be tepid, online sales growth being mixed at best, and a sense that Amazon AMZN would wipe the company out in the lifetimes of broke millennials. Moreover, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon was still getting his sea legs - which was to be expected any time someone of such youth (despite his immense experience) assumes a position atop an enormous global organization. In all honesty, the last two events mostly involved Walmart playing defense against long-time retail stock analysts with buy ratings who were growing concerned about the future outlook for Sam Walton's creation. Now the narrative around Walmart has noticeably shifted. It could win against Amazon even as the tech giant rolls out digital assistants that could order toothpaste from Target (TGT) if needed. It could continue to open up profitable stores across the country, especially smaller ones that target grocery stores such as Kroger (K) . Walmart does have the right mix of executives, which now includes Jet.com founder Marc Lore. It could regain the trust of consumers who were for years let down by poor customer service and too high a price for a tomato in some cases. And it could see a solid return on massive investments being made in people, processes and technology. Hence, Walmart's shares have turned in a good year while Target's have lagged (due to the company's operational hiccups). Here is what to be watching for during this year's event: Long-term guidance: Gut instinct and having followed Walmart for so long tell me the company may not bump up its long-term sales guidance or its 2016 earnings per share outlook. This management team seems to enjoy surprising skeptics to the upside and watching the stock act accordingly. At its last investor day, Walmart projected sales growth over the next three years of between 3% and 4%. If Walmart reiterates the long-term sales outlook, it may upset some new entrants into the stock but should leave longer-term holders feeling OK that Walmart is still positioned to beat and raise Wall Street estimates (which has been a key driver of the stock). The wildcard in terms of estimates is what Walmart outlines for earnings in 2017. Last year, Walmart noted it sees EPS really starting to re-accelerate in 2018 to the tune of 5% to 10%. Next year, theoretically, is an unknown as Walmart will likely guide to another year of heavy investment in people and e-commerce (Jet.com notably). I wouldn't expect a shocking EPS outlook (the initial 2016 outlook for as much as a 12% drop came as a surprise to Wall Street) as Walmart doesn't want to destroy the goodwill it has built up. But there is a real chance it forecasts a year of pressured earnings before a possible stronger-than-guided pick-up in 2018. New store growth: Walmart has drastically slowed down the number of store openings for this year as compared to 2015. That was divulged at least year's meeting, and reflected the company's need to ramp up investments in people and e-commerce. Believe it or not, if Walmart signaled another year of slower store growth -- which is highly likely -- the market may view it favorably. It would show that the company is taking expense management seriously, which is important considering how much it's investing to slash prices and bulk up in other areas. Fewer Walmart store openings are a good thing, letting the company get the processes down in order to drive better productivity from existing boxes. All in all, the day should be neutral if not modestly positive for Walmart. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the "+Follow" next to my byline to this article.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Wal-Mart Stores Inc is accelerating its investment in e-commerce in a bid to narrow the gap with Amazon.com Inc and to give it an even more dominant position against the rest of the field in retail. The world's largest retailer is now on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016, according to Justen Traweek, vice-president of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment. That pace is faster than the 8 large warehouses that industry consultants expected Wal-Mart to build by the end of 2017. At the same time, Wal-Mart in the last year has installed new technology such as automated product sorting and improved item tracking that for the first time puts them on par with Amazon's robot-staffed facilities, according to supply-chain consultants. "We have doubled our capacity in the last twelve months and that allows us to ship to a majority of the US population in one day," Traweek said. Wal-Mart is holding its annual investor day on Thursday when, among other topics, it is expected to update on the progress it has made in its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart, which has about 4,600 stores in the United States and over 6,000 worldwide, has been investing in e-commerce for 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. "These additions definitely give Wal-Mart the opportunity to compete better than other companies going head-to-head with Amazon," said Steve Osburn, director of supply chain with consultancy Kurt Salmon, referring to the likes of Target and others. "Having said that, choosing to race with Amazon is different than catching up with them." Wal-Mart in the last four fiscal years has accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital initiatives, excluding acquisitions, from about USD 300 million in 2013 to USD 1.1 billion this year for a total of about USD 3 billion, according to public filings and earnings transcripts. E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of Wal-Mart's overall sales. Since 2011, Wal-Mart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about USD 3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: Wal-Mart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with Wal-Mart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of USD 107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's USD 13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. TRYING TO NARROW THE GAP Inside Wal-Mart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70 percent of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give Wal-Mart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow Wal-Mart to now ship orders to 70 percent of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns Wal-Mart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from Wal-Mart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps Wal-Mart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. Wal-Mart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000. Tags  Wal-Mart Stores Inc investment e-commerce Amazon Amazon e-commerce Buy, Hold, Sell ?

"The market was quiet and calm today with price action seen on JD's notes," said a Hong Kong-based investment-grade trader. He noted that JD's 2016s were 7bp tighter this morning after a report on Walmart's investment, but profit taking came into play in the afternoon. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Walmart said it held a 10.8% passive stake in JD.com as of October 5. It had earlier reported a 5.9% stake in the company as of June 20. "With mainland investors still on holiday and Hong Kong off next Monday, we will not see much activity until new deals come out later next week," said the trader. The iTraxx Asia IG index was 0.6bp tighter at 99.75/101.75. Korea Housing Finance Corp's new 2021s were tightened about 7bp after being priced at 85bp over US Treasuries on Wednesday.

E-commerce accounts for about 3 percent of WalMart's overall sales. Since 2011, WalMart has acquired 15 e-commerce startups, one of which became its core Silicon Valley technology arm, @WalmartLabs. Last month, it completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion and named Jet's founder, Marc Lore, the head of WalMart's e-commerce business. The massive warehouses are key to WalMart's e-commerce strategy because they enable the company to deliver packages more economically when shipping online orders with multiple items. Fulfilling such orders now can often mean multiple shipments from different warehouses or stores. "This improves two fundamental things: WalMart's speed to market, which is how fast their products reach consumers, and it will help them reach an even larger audience," said Regenia Sanders, vice-president of supply chain at consultancy SSA & Co. Even with WalMart's new investments, though, Amazon has a commanding position in e-commerce with 40 warehouses of one million-plus square feet and plans to open five more by the first quarter of next year, according to data compiled for Reuters by retail technology firm ChannelAdvisor. Its online sales of $107 billion last year far outstrip Wal-Mart's $13.7 billion of online sales in the same period. The ten warehouses are designed to boost its overall distribution capabilities, which consists of smaller online warehouses, stores that stock online orders and 160 store serving distribution centers that stock online items. Amazon runs 104 warehouses and has announced 18 new ones, according to ChannelAdvisor data. An Amazon spokeswoman did not comment on specific questions for this story, but did say the company is laser focused on its customers and delivering unlimited, fast, free Prime Shipping. Trying to narrow the gap Inside WalMart's 1.2 million square-foot warehouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, two 40-foot robotic towers shuttle products like Cheerio's from storage to packaging. It handles more than 70% of the orders for best-selling products, Traweek said. Workers inside wear smart-phone like devices on their wrists that tell them where to find a product, what box it needs to got into and even how much tape is required to seal the package. The devices give WalMart the ability to store items anywhere in the warehouse and increase efficiency and lower costs, Traweek said, though he would not detail cost savings. The new warehouses allow WalMart to now ship orders to 70% of Americans in a day, Traweek said, but it cannot yet do so profitably. That's why it has not yet begun to promise one-day delivery to customers, he said. Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC which owns WalMart shares, said investors expect profitable growth from WalMart, while Amazon is still given leeway to lose money in the hunt for longer-term growth. "Anything that crimps WalMart's profits in the short term will not be met well by their shareholders, so trying to find a cost-effective shipping solution is a sensible approach," he said. WalMart plans to complete at least one more giant warehouse, in addition to the ten, by the first quarter of 2017, Traweek said. The retailer had worked with five giant warehouses since launching its online business in 2000. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

In a filing with the US regulator Securities and Exchange Commission, the American retailer—which does business as Walmart—has said it owns more than 9% of shares in JD. This is up from the 5% stake Walmart obtained after selling its Chinese online division to JD in June this year. Walmart’s ambitions in Asia, especially in the online retail segment, is becoming evident day by day. Media reports previously said Walmart is planning to invest $1 billion in India’s largest etailer Flipkart. The Economic Times had reported last month, citing sources it didn’t name, that “the companies are engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled soon”. These discussions, reportedly, include the world’s largest retailer picking up a minority stake in Flipkart. A Walmart India spokesperson had told Techcircle.in that “as a policy we don’t comment on speculative reports”. Flipkart too didn’t verify the news saying that “it is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” Techcircle.in had written in August about a possible deal between Walmart and Flipkart when the American retail giant bought US web retailer Jet.com. Walmart had bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a US e-commerce startup. Walmart acquired minority stake in JD for about $1.5 billion. According to the report in The Economic Times, the ongoing discussions may lead to a similar deal with India’s Flipkart. A Bloomberg report pegged the likely investment amount at $1 billion. Earlier this month, Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer had said at an event that the company was evaluating the policy guidelines of 100% foreign direct investment in food retail. Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had formed an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India. E-commerce sales in the US in 2015 totalled $340 billion, a 14.6% increase over $298.3 billion in 2014, according to non-adjusted estimates released by the US Department of Commerce. India, according to industry body Assocham, is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world and is likely to touch $38-billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, a 67% jump over the $23 billion it clocked last year. Still, it is tiny in comparison with the US. Clearly, the online markets of India and China cannot be ignored by Walmart if it has to have a stronghold in Asia. Like this report?

New York: Walmart Stores Inc. has increased its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, WalMart said that it has upped its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The move comes nearly four months after Walmart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is trying to improve its business in China, which is lucrative but increasingly challenging. In China, Walmart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. It operates more than 400 stores despite entering the country 20 years ago. It sees bolstering its online business as the future in China. Walmart said at the time that it announced its initial stake that it could see a tremendous amount of traffic from JD.com's huge customer base and its same-day delivery network. Getting China right is key to strengthening Wal-Mart's global online business. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing U.S. online retailer Jet.com for a purchase price of $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Wal-Mart's global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago.

But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Walmart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Walmart is America’s largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Walmart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school — and hardest to replicate — asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Walmart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. “We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, told investors last year. “The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner.” And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Walmart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. Walmart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. “I physically have no room in the cart,” said Brummel, 33. “It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over.” Walmart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Walmart. “They’ve historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Walmart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Walmart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > Walmart has allocated parking spaces for online grocery-pickup customers so that they may get in and out of the lot quickly. © Sarah Halzack/The Washington Post ‘The trust fall’ At the Walmart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Walmart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. “We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good,” Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable’s brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Walmart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they’re selecting for customers. There’s a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Walmart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is “the trust fall,” the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it’s because “I like to select fresh products for myself,” according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn’t quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. “If I’m not going to eat it,” Styers said, “then I’m not going to give it to anybody else.” The value of the store In Walmart’s version of pickup, which is not yet available in the greater Washington area, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store’s grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Walmart Grocery app. It’s a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Walmart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer’s front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Walmart doesn’t have to reinvent its supply chain — it is already getting these goods to its stores. “That is the opportunity. They’re redeploying an asset they already have,” said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it’s extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. “The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. The logistical differences might help explain why Walmart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, “being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible.” At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. “I have two little ones in the back,” said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. “To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour.” The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Walmart customer, and that they are often people who weren’t buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Walmart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Walmart store. “That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers,” said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. “Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I’m on my way,” Mishev said.

 This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like Hayley Peterson Oct. 7, 2016, 3:06 PM 22,152 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Walmart is the world's largest retailer. The company has more than 11,500 stores globally, including nearly 4,600 in the US, and raked in $486 billion in sales last year.  But who, exactly, shops there? And how do those shoppers differ from customers at stores like Target, Aldi, Kmart, and Kohl's?  To find out, we gathered data from Kantar Retail's ShopperScape, a proprietary monthly survey that polls thousands of consumers on their shopping habits. According to the data, the average Walmart shopper is a white, 51-year-old female with an annual household income of $56,482.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape By comparison, Target's shoppers are five years younger, on average, and they make approximately $13,000 more annually per household. Most of the shoppers at each of the five chains are white. Target and Kmart have the highest share of Hispanic shoppers (15%) and Kmart and Aldi have the highest percentage of African-American shoppers (14%). Kantar Retail/ShopperScape Kohl's attracts the highest-income shoppers out of all five retailers. The average household income of Kohl's shoppers is $69,442 annually, and nearly 30% of the chain's shoppers make more than $100,000, according to the data. By comparison, just 18% of Walmart's shoppers earn $100,000 annually per household.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape On the other end of the income spectrum is Kmart, which attracts shoppers with an average household income of $55,006 — the lowest of the group.   When the demographics are broken down by generation, Target has the biggest share of millennial shoppers, while Aldi has the biggest share of shoppers from the Baby Boomer generation. Aldi also claims the biggest share of seniors, who are qualified as people born before 1946.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape At all five chains, women far outweigh men as the primary shoppers. But men are more likely to shop at Walmart and Kmart over any of the other chains. Kantar Retail/ShopperScape SEE ALSO: Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model More: Retail Walmart Kohl's Kmart Target shoppers Shopping Demographics Aldi shopper demographics facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like Walmart is the world's largest retailer.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 11:38am   Comments Share: Related HON Facebook, Bank Of America, Honeywell: Fast Money Picks For November 11 Can Trump Make Your Portfolio Great Again? Shares from the industrial conglomerate are under pressure after Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) provided a downbeat forecast for the third and fourth quarters. The company now expects GAAP EPS of $1.60 and adjusted EPS of $1.67 for the third quarter. The company claimed that it was in line with its earlier forecast. However, this fell short of analysts' estimates of $1.70 a share. Honeywell blamed the weak shipments to business and general aviation OEMs apart from the continued delays and completions in the defense & space segment in the domestic and global businesses. Lower volumes in productivity solutions also played its part in the soft guidance. Related Link: Cramer On Honeywell's Guidance Update: "This Does Not Make Sense" For the fourth quarter, the company expects EPS to be $1.74–$1.78 while guiding adjusted EPS to be $6.60–$6.64 for the full year. The company expects core organic sales to fall 1–2 percent for the full year. Analysts are looking for an EPS of $1.80 and $6.68 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Following the downbeat forecast, shares of other industrial conglomerates also started trading in volatile on Friday. At Last Check ... Honeywell was down 7.72 percent at $106.68.

Fraudster scams local out of thousands 11:21 a.m. EDT October 7, 2016 File photo (Photo: Journal & Courier) 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CHILLICOTHE - A 65-year-old Clarksburg woman has reportedly been scammed out of at least $8,000. Chillicothe police responded Thursday morning to WalMart to talk with a woman who said she had been asked via Facebook to send $3,000 to a man in California. She told police she previously had sent $8,000 and was prepared to send the $3,000, but called police under the advisement of a WalMart employee who was concerned she was being scammed. Police talked with the woman’s son who said his mother had been scammed out of more than $15,000, but wouldn’t admit to it or listen to him due to her dementia. Reports of similar scams can be reported to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office by calling 800-282-0515.

Grocery giants bring click-and-buy service to Jackson area Posted by: Jack Weatherly in Economic Development, MBJ FEATURE, NEWS October 7, 2016 By JACK WEATHERLY Rival grocery giants Kroger and Walmart are rolling out online shopping programs in the Jackson area. The concept is designed to save time for shoppers just as the grocers battle to hold prices down for customers. For now, Kroger’s QuickList has next-day pickup, but soon it’ll be same-day, according to Marcus Hamilton, e-commerce field specialist. Hamilton declined to give specifics on how many orders have been filled since the service started in metro Jackson, but said “the numbers are good” and that both Jackson-area stores are meeting expectations. Bethany Haynes and her 3-month-old daughter, Liora, were leaving the Kroger in Jacksonian Square on Monday. She was asked if she knew about the new program. She said she did, but that hadn’t had time to sign up. “It sounds appealing, being a new mom,” said the Jackson resident. “I’ll have to be more strategic in my meal planning,” she said. Orders can be placed by going to kroger.com/onlineshopping and selecting a store and listing the items. The items are then brought by a store employee to be picked up at a designated spot on the parking lot. Kroger entered the Jackson market last week, beating Walmart by a few days. Krogers at 1070 Highway 51 in Madison, 6745 S. Siwell Road in Byram and in 3408 Pemberton Square Boulevard in Vicksburg offer the service, in addition to a store in Hernando and one in Southaven. The Cincinnati-based chain started offering the service in the Midwest last year. Reviews have been generally complimentary,, according to published accounts. Lisa Murtha, writing in Cincinnati Magazine, endorses the service, but offers a few helpful tips. She says if you wait till the day before “you risk all the time slots being full, or being left with a few random time choices that don’t work with your schedule.” Further, she writes, her experience has been that “as soon as your time is reserved, you have until midnight that same day to load items into your [virtual] cart. If you do not officially place your order by midnight, you lose both your cart contents and your time slot, and have to start over.” She said placing an order for her family of five takes her about 40 minutes, and, with a 10-15-minute wait at the pickup site, she cuts her shopping time in half. The first three QuickList orders are free. After that, it’s $4.95 per order. There is no minimum order, said Teresa Dickerson, public relations manager for Kroger’s Delta Division. Walmart, meantime, began its rollout in the state on Monday. And it is one-up on its rival in one regard. The service is free.But there is a $30 minimum purchase. Stores in Pearl at 5520 Highway 80 East, Clinton at 950 Highway 80 East and Flowood at 5341 Highway 25 now offer the service. Orders are placed at walmart.com/grocery or though a Walmart Grocery mobile app. Business Kroger Madison Mississippi NEWS 2016-10-07 Jack Weatherly tweet Tagged with: Business Kroger Madison Mississippi NEWS Previous: Aluminum startup finds going rough in Louisiana, as it did in Mississippi Next: BILL CRAWFORD: Congress should be ready to impeach whoever wins About Jack Weatherly More Stories Like This BILL CRAWFORD: Appointments will tell if Trump can deliver November 13, 2016 Health systems in New Orleans, McComb, announce partnership November 11, 2016 Stocks mixed as investors seek clarity on Trump policies November 11, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 9:38am   Comments Share: Related WMT 3 Scenarios For Wal-Mart's Q3 Earnings Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Dividend Aristocrats In Focus Part 39: Wal-Mart (Seeking Alpha) While Wal-Mart Stores, Inc’s (NYSE: WMT) store and ecommerce enhancements are gaining momentum, the company would likely continue to generate flattish EPS growth due to elevated investments, Morgan Stanley’s Simeon Gutman said in a report He maintained an Equal-weight rating on the company, while reducing the price target from $76 to $74. At its Investment Community Meeting, Wal-Mart “delivered the most cohesive strategic message in years,” Gutman commented. Management seems to be initiating the right moves for the business and the company is evolving rapidly, “with better service, cleaner stores, higher in-stocks, deeper value, more unique items and a differentiated e-commerce platform in Jet.” Related Link: Wal-Mart Reaffirms 2017 Outlook, Sees Little Growth To 2018 Transformation Costlier, Taking Longer Than Expected While Wal-Mart’s top line growth is now the healthiest it has been since 2010, Gutman pointed out that “repositioning the largest retailer in a hyper competitive market is a massive undertaking” and that companies tend to “underestimate the cost of adapting.” He added that omni-channel transformations are typically costlier and take longer than most retailers anticipate. Take On Prospects EBIT and gross margins are expected to contract into F2018. The market seems to be underappreciating the difficult gross margin comps “WMT faces next year as it laps vendor negotiation benefits and modest deflation tailwinds,” the analyst commented. Although downside to Wal-Mart’s shares is limited by the company’s revenue momentum and “safe haven status” against a volatile consumer and retailer backdrop, expectations of flattish EPS makes the stock less compelling, Gutman said.

Walmart and Amazon are vowing to remove this "tranny granny" outfit from their websites. It includes a dress, headscarf and padding for the breasts and rear-end. The costume sparked some outrage online, with many saying it's offensive to the transgender community. On Walmart and Amazon, the costume was reportedly listed by a third-party vendor named Rasta Imposta. According to the news site "LGBT Nation;" Walmart says the costume violates its terms of service for third-party retailers. It's still available from several other online retailers. At last check, Rasta Imposta was marketing the product as a "manny granny" on its website.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company’s shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn’t as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Wal-Mart shares plunged 10 percent. But Wal-Mart’s flurry of moves — online and in the stores — have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Wal-Mart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year.

It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn't as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Wal-Mart shares plunged 10 percent. But Wal-Mart's flurry of moves -- online and in the stores -- have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Wal-Mart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year. In contrast, rival Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Wal-Mart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter -- up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. 1 2 next  last »

Officials have proposed that the world's biggest retailer pay at least $600 million to resolve probes by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether it bribed government officials in markets from Mexico to India and China, according to three people familiar with the matter. The retailer has rebuffed the government's request, two of them said. Such a settlement would rank among the largest in four decades under a U.S. law against bribing foreign officials to obtain business. VIDEOS TOP JOBS With the impasse, prosecutors have gone back to elicit more evidence from witnesses about alleged bribe-paying in Mexico, the people said. That will put additional pressure on the company to settle. Some of the people familiar with the matter said the U.S. could propose a penalty well above $600 million. The government has some challenges as well. Some of the behavior it's been investigating in Mexico, where the bulk of Wal-Mart's non-U.S. stores are located, may be too old to prosecute, people familiar with the matter have said. Officials are working to wrap up an agreement with Wal-Mart before a new administration takes over in January, the people said. That would add to the wave of enforcement actions already announced this year, including last week's agreement by Och-Ziff Capital Management LP to pay $415 million in penalties and fines to settle an U.S. investigation into bribe-paying across Africa. "As we've said from the beginning, we are cooperating fully with the government in this matter and have no further comment on that process," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in an email. He added that the company's compliance with anti-corruption laws is a priority and that the retailer was recognized this year by a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary for best governance program among large-cap companies. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The Justice Department and the SEC have spent half a decade investigating allegations that Wal-Mart representatives paid government officials over the course of 10 years to fast-track store openings. The U.S.'s proposed penalty accounts for the profits Wal-Mart reaped from stores it was able to open quickly after allegedly paying officials to speed zoning and building permits, said the people, who asked to not be named because the matter is confidential. Calculating a fine based only on the amount of the alleged bribes, as the department has done in some cases, would yield a lower penalty, they said. Even as the sides are grappling over the size of a penalty, they are also discussing whether there will be any criminal charges against any part of the company, the people said. Wal-Mart has already spent $791 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world, it said. The retailer has had major turnover in management since the investigations began, including a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer and heads of U.S. and international operations. Wal-Mart has warned investors that it may face additional costs and a possible loss because of the investigation. It hasn't said what those costs may be. "Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future," the company said in a regulatory filing in March. While settlement of $600 million or more would be substantial for a company that has gained attention and a competitive edge for its focus on counting pennies to hold down costs, it's modest relative to the company's recent global results. The company posted more than $14 billion in profits last year on $482 billion in sales. Under Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who took over in 2014, most of the company's focus has been on improving its U.S. stores and online operations, rather than faster international expansion. Those efforts are starting to pay off, and the company's shares have gained 17 percent this year. The Justice Department is wrapping up several of the marquee investigations started under President Barack Obama, including into financial-crisis-era behavior and benchmark manipulation. Several European banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, are negotiating settlements over their mortgage practices that officials are trying to close in the administration's final months, people familiar with the situation have said. The Wal-Mart settlement, as described, would rank among the highest levied under 1977's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans companies from bribing officials to win business overseas. Earlier this year, VimpelCom Ltd. paid $795 million to settle U.S. and Dutch claims that it bribed officials in Uzbekistan to win business. Siemens AG paid a record $800 million in a combined SEC-Justice Department penalty in 2008. » Next page...

The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Walmart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Walmart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Walmart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Walmart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Walmart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. Walmart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, down from 230 in its last fiscal year. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The state gave its closing argument first. DeProw gave the jury five things to remember. He said the essence of the case was in the black bag, white rag, NEA Baptist video, Korre Phillips, and the confession video. DeProw told the jury this is all the critical evidence, and while he knows the defense is throwing out suggestions and ideas for what could have happened, there is no evidence of those theories. He used Tarver’s quotes from the confession video throughout his closing. The state also reverted back to the evidence of Tarver’s DNA found on the white rag and the rope with red fibers behind Tarver’s home matching the rope inside the black bag and found on Bridger road. DeProw encouraged the jury to watch the confession video again and make a determination if Tarver’s testimony in court makes sense. The defense then had an opportunity to speak to the jury. Miller started his closing with the statement, “Please don’t hurt my wife.” Miller said that’s what Tarver told police and where his state of mind was when he was arrested. Miller called this a bizarre case. He also showed several receipts showing the Tarver’s had bought things for a birthday party the weekend of the murder. The defense questioned how Tarver could have possibly killed Counce and acted calm throughout the weekend. Miller told the jury it’s their job to decide if witnesses are credible. He spent the majority of his close recounting past testimony from the trial. He focused on Korre Phillips and said he had a strange reaction to law enforcement. Miller said Phillips is not telling the truth. He also spoke about the lack of physical evidence and the possibility of the DNA evidence being contaminated. Miller finished by telling the jury this is a decision they can’t take back. Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington then gave the final close for the state. The state is allowed the last word because they have the burden of proof. Ellington said the confession the jury sees from Tarver is not fake. He said there is no way Roland could have given Tarver so many details in a short amount of time. The state also reverted back to previous trial hearings months ago. Ellington said Tarver never mentioned in those hearings that he was threatened or influenced to confess. Ellington said Tarver’s family said this action would be out of character and wearing jeans and a hoodie would be out of character. The state said yes that would be out of character, but Tarver said in his confession he was dressed in a costume and acting as a certain character. Ellington said the most frightening thing to him is while the defense is trying to point the finger at Phillips, it’s clear Tarver would have gotten away with this had he not asked Phillips for a ride that day. That ended closing statements. The jury was then taken out of the courtroom to deliberate.  The defense began its portion of the trial on Wednesday. The state rested its case after recalling Korre Phillips to the stand to show video of him leaving the Hays grocery store at 12:56 p.m. The video was used to demonstrate Phillips couldn’t have left Hays and made it to NEA Baptist by 1 p.m. on July 3, 2015. The defense crossed by making it clear you cannot see what car Phillips was driving in the video. Before calling any witnesses, Miller moved for a directed verdict on all charges and to suppress evidence from the search warrant. Miller argued there was lack of evidence to support the charges, and he said the search warrant was illegal. All motions were denied by Judge Cindy Thyer except for one. Judge Thyer did give a directed verdict for the aggravated robbery charge. She said, by definition and based on evidence presented, Tarver did not commit aggravated robbery. That still leaves six charges for the jury to decide on. The defense’s first witness was Dennis Tarver. He is the father of Richard Jordon Tarver. Dennis described his son’s upbringing and education background. Tarver received a GED and has worked a couple of full time jobs. Dennis did say his son lacks motivation and work ethic. Tarver’s father said he saw his son on Thursday, July 1. Dennis went out of town over the weekend and didn’t see him again until Monday, July 6, 2015. Dennis told the defense Tarver seemed normal when he saw him on Monday. They did discuss Counce’s disappearance and read about it daily. In the state’s cross examination, Dennis told DeProw Tarver has no mental, emotional, or physical disabilities. Dennis said Tarver was needed at home to help his wife with their two children. Dennis also said he and his wife give Tarver money on a regular basis. Jamie Platts, Tarver’s mother-in-law, was the next witness. She explained her daughter Samantha, Tarver’s wife, has medical issues. Samantha is unable to work so Tarver must be home to help her. Platts described Tarver as the best son-in-law she could ask for her daughter. Platts stated in her testimony that she saw Tarver on July 3, 2015, around 1 p.m. Platts said she was dropping the Tarver’s eldest daughter off at their home in Bay. The defense submitted a phone record as evidence that Platts called her daughter at 12:38 p.m. on July 3. She said she arrived at their home 10 to 15 minutes later. That is when she saw Tarver walking outside his home. Platts said she saw Tarver again on Sunday, July 5, at her granddaughter’s birthday party, and Tarver acted normal. DeProw then asked Platts several questions including what she thought about Tarver’s DNA being found on a wash cloth inside Counce’s home. Platts’ answer was Tarver sweats a lot and has a lot of wash clothes around. The state also asked how she felt about Tarver’s confession. Platts said Tarver confessed because he was scared for this wife. When asked if she saw or heard police threaten her daughter, she said no. However, when Miller asked Platts if she heard police threaten to arrest Samantha, Platts said yes.  After a lunch recess, Samantha Tarver, Richard Tarver's wife, took the stand to testify.  She explained she had many health issues and spent most of her time in bed.  She said because of these health issues, she was unable to hold a job.  On July 2, Samantha said her and Richard's about 7-month-old child kept them up throughout the night.  She said she and Richard slept in until about 1 p.m. July 3.  Her explanation for waking up at that time was her mother called to drop off their other daughter.  Samantha told the jury Richard then went outside to mow the lawn to prepare for their daughter's birthday party on Sunday.  She said her husband did sweat a lot and many times she would take a washrag outside to him. She did say Richard would often leave those washrags outside or under their carport.  The only people Samantha Tarver said who visited them that day was her mother.  She said Korre Phillips never came over like he said he did and like Tarver said in his confession video. On July 17, Samantha said she and Richard were in the back sleeping when they heard a banging at their front door.  She said she answered the door to guns pointed in her face.  She explained she had her baby in her hands and got down on the ground to protect her.  Samantha said she heard Richard ask police officers to not harm her or their baby.  She said then she was taken outside, placed in handcuffs, and threatened to be taken to jail. When she found out why police were there, she said she told them what they did on July 3.  She described the officers as rude and that they watched her change clothes when she went back inside.  Samantha Tarver also said that police told her they could come back for her at any time. During cross-examination, she told the jury that she knew her husband had a gun but thought he got rid of it.  She explained she was on 4 different types of medication at the time and spent a lot of time in bed.  When asked about the rain that day, she said their yard was dry enough to mow.  She said she thought Richard confessed to the crime to protect her.  After Samantha Tarver left the stand, her husband and the man accused of the murder, Richard Tarver testified.  While on the stand, Tarver repeated what his wife said about July 2 and 3.  He said their baby was teething and kept them up late, so they slept in until about 1 p.m. on Friday.  He said he attempted to mow the yard but the ground was still too wet.  Instead, he said he just picked up sticks around the yard.  Tarver said he and his family did go shopping that day but used money from his parents and daughter and some that he saved up.  He said he never saw Korre Phillps that day, did not take money from Lavinda Counce, nor did he go to the Hilltop area.  On the night he was arrested, Tarver repeated again what his wife said.  He said they heard banging on the door after waking up, his wife answered, and then went to the ground.  He explained that he said "I know, I know" because he knew to get on the ground.  Tarver said from where he was standing behind his wife, it looked like she had been pushed out of the way.  He said Captain Justin Rolland with the Craighead County Sheriff's Department took him outside and they eventually ended up in a white SUV together.  While in the vehicle, Tarver said Rolland read him his rights and also threatened him.  He said he was told his baby would be taken by DHS and his wife would go to jail.  Also while in the vehicle, Tarver said Rolland gave him information about the case so he could repeat it during a confession.  He said his biggest concern was his family.  During the interview at the Craighead County Sheriff's Department, Tarver said he lied about killing Counce.  He said Rolland wanted to hear a specific thing, so he said it.  He explained Rolland had the power to do what he wanted and did not want his wife separated from his baby. When asked about his gun, Tarver said he knew the serial number was defaced.  Tarver said he tried to sell it but nobody was interested because of the serial number.  He said Korre Phillips did look at the gun but did not buy it.  Tarver said he considered Rolland a "monster" for coming into his home and accusing him of the murder.  He said during the interview, he thought Rolland was trying to implicate his wife in the crime. During cross-examination, the prosecution discussed Tarver's testimony from a pre-trial. The prosecution showed Tarver that he said he got his information about the case from other news sources.  Tarver said he did not mention Korre Phillips at that time because his wife could still be arrested. He said again that many of the things he said during his confession were not true and that he made up most of it.  Tarver said he knew about Counce's cane from Phillips' girlfriend. Tarver added he came up with finding the $50 bill in Counce's purse.  He also said the comment about wanting to know what it was like to kill a person was something that just came out during the confession. Tarver said the comment about shooting Counce in the head was just something he had seen in movies.  He explained the reason for his comments were to protect his family and that he was not thinking about the Counce family at that time.  Some of the things he said Rolland told him about the case included what was in Counce's purse in her trunk, where Phillips was on July 3, and about the surveillance footage from NEA Baptist Hospital. The defense asked a few more questions after the prosecution.  During that questioning, Tarver said his wife went to NEA Baptist for treatment.  He said the route he told police in his confession was the same route they took to get to the hospital.  The defense rested and court is scheduled to meet again Thursday morning with motions at 9 and the jury at 9:30. The state called two more witnesses Tuesday morning. Lieutenant Aaron Davis, Craighead County Sheriff’s Department, participated in serving the search warrant at Tarver’s home. He recounted Tarver’s confession in court. Davis first described entering Tarver’s home. Tarver was on the ground, and Davis said Tarver’s wife had no reaction or expression on her face. After Tarver was taken into custody, Davis drove Tarver to the Craighead County Sheriff’s Department with Captain Justin Roland. Davis said Tarver was silent the entire ride. There was no discussion with him until they got to the interview room at the sheriff’s department. After Tarver was read his rights, Davis said he answered many of his and Roland’s questions. Tarver told Davis his selection of Counce was random, and he didn’t know much about her. Davis said Tarver’s plan was to leave Counce’s car at NEA Baptist and walk home to Bay. He said he chose NEA Baptist because he wanted to leave the car in an obvious place. Tarver had also considered leaving it at the mall or Walmart, according to Davis. In the interview, Tarver said he simply gave Counce commands and she did as he said. Tarver said at one point Counce did try to walk away and Tarver told her to stop. When asked why he didn’t kill her in her home, Davis said Tarver claimed he took Counce to the cornfield because he never shot the gun before and was worried about the noise it would make. Davis also asked him about the black bag. Tarver told Davis he didn’t remember having the bag but if he did it was a part of his costume as a survivor in the apocalypse. The lieutenant said Tarver even demonstrated how he killed Counce. According to the testimony, Tarver helped Counce out of the trunk of her car and told her to walk toward the field. She followed his order and he shot her in the head. Davis said Tarver demonstrated the angle of the shot on Roland by making a gun with his hand. Davis said Tarver told Roland he was much taller than Counce so Roland bent down so Tarver could properly demonstrate. During the interview, Davis said Tarver had a lack of emotion, was expressionless, and didn’t ask about where his wife and child were. As far as why he killed Counce, Davis said Tarver never gave an answer. Davis said Tarver never said he was sorry and when asked how he felt after killing Counce, Tarver said he felt better. The defense cross-examined Davis by asking him about his contact with Korre Phillips. Miller questioned testimony Phillips gave to Davis regarding the last time he had talked to Tarver and asked if the Phillips family had time to discuss the sheriff’s department’s interest in this case before giving a formal statement. Davis said he didn’t know. Miller then reviewed the previous statements Davis made in his testimony including Tarver saying he was going to walk back to Bay after leaving Counce’s car at NEA Baptist. Miller said Tarver is not in great shape and doesn’t walk often. Korre Phillips was the other witness called to the stand Tuesday morning. He recounted what he did on July 3. Phillips told the state he went and bought fireworks then went to Hays to buy groceries for a cookout. When at Hays, Phillips said he received a call that Tarver was at his home. Phillips said Tarver told him he had been at NEA Baptist visiting a friend and needed a ride home. Phillips said he had nothing to do with Counce’s murder and knew nothing about it when he gave Tarver a ride to Bay. In the cross-examination, Miller asked Phillips if someone else could have used his debit card at Hays to look like he was there. Phillips said no. Miller asked Phillips about knowing Tarver’s wife and possibly being jealous of their relationship along with questioning his truthfulness about statements made about Tarver. Phillips was asked to identify the difference in tools that belonged to Tarver with general tools, and Phillips said he couldn’t tell a difference. The state then made it clear Tarver told the investigators Phillips was not involved in the Counce murder nor did Phillips know about it when he drove Tarver home.  Captain Justin Rolland took the stand after a lunch recess.  He said he assisted in the case and first started working it on July 3.  Rolland said Sheriff Marty Boyd called him to inform him of a possible missing person in Bay.  He hoped the case would just be a missing person but that changed on July 12.  That was the day Counce's body was found.  With a confirmed homicide, Rolland explained that was also the day their investigation changed. Rolland was another investigator who talked to the Phillips family on Bridger Road.  On July 17, Rolland said Korre Phillips admitted to giving Tarver a ride and asked him to come to the sheriff's department.  Based on information given by Korre Phillips, Rolland said they received a search warrant.  He explained to the jury that they were in a hurry because they did not want Phillips to tell Tarver what he told investigators.  Rolland said they planned to knock on Tarver's door to get consent to search the home.  After they knocked and no one answered the door, Rolland said they attempted to force entry into the home.  He said Tarver then opened the door and asked them not to harm his wife or child.  Rolland said Tarver complied with orders and got on the ground while he held him at gunpoint.  After a few minutes of other officers clearing the home, Rolland said he cuffed Tarver and brought him outside to a vehicle.  Rolland said he read Tarver his rights inside the vehicle.  He said at first, Tarver denied any involvement with the incident but later changed his statement to his wife did not have any involvement.  Rolland said when he asked Tarver what happened,  he said he took her from the home and dropped her off in the cornfield.  He explained that he, Tarver and Davis then went to the sheriff's department for further questions.  When asked about Tarver's demeanor in the vehicle, Rolland said he was calm and looked like the world had been lifted from his shoulders.  The prosecution then showed a video involving Rolland, Tarver, and Davis where Tarver confessed to killing Counce.  In the video, Tarver explained that he went to Counce's home, knocked on the door, and just walked in.   He told investigators in the video that he gave Counce directions, which she followed.  Tarver also said in the video that he put Counce in the trunk of her car and drove to a cornfield.  He said in the video that he got her out, pointed at the corn, and shot Counce as she was walking. When investigators asked him in the video why he did it, Tarver replied by saying he wanted to know what it was like to kill a human.  In the video, Tarver said he watched The Walking Dead and thought an elderly person was as close as he was going to get to a zombie. When investigators asked him about the black bag in the video, Tarver said it was an accessory to his survivor outfit.  Tarver also told investigators in the video that robbery was not his motivation and the money he took was a bonus.  Tarver explained he was worried about the sound of the gun because he had never fired a gun before.  He also mentioned that he had gone to a doctor and received depression pill a few weeks before the interview. Tarver said he felt better after the shooting because he had gotten it out of his system.  After the first video, the prosecution showed a second video that was taken July 17.  In that video, Rolland showed Tarver photos of the black bag and it's contents.  Tarver claimed a few of the items but not all of them.  After the second video, Rolland said Tarver told him that he used some of the money he took from Counce at Walmart for items to use during his daughter's birthday party.  During cross-examination, the defense asked again what Tarver's first words were to Rolland.  The defense continued to talk about Korre Phillips and how he denied being the person in surveillance video from Hay's earlier in court.  Rolland said he thought Phillips was mistaken because they confirmed that Phillips was in Hay's during their investigation. The defense then brought up a comment that Phillips made while at the sheriff's department.  They said he denied making a comment about one of the investigator's shot glasses in his office that had a zombie on it.  Rolland did recall that comment being discussed on July 17.  The defense then had Rolland reiterate that they received a search warrant for Tarver's home based off of information given by Phillips. When asked about the conversation between Tarver and Rolland in the vehicle outside of Tarver's home, Rolland said there were no other witnesses to hear Tarver's verbal acknowledgments to his rights.  Rolland told the defense that he did not threaten Tarver's family at all.  He explained that he reassured Tarver that his family was at home in the second video because of the comment Tarver made when they first made entry into his home.  Rolland said he did not further investigate the Phillips family or their friend James Henry after Tarver's arrest.  Before Rolland left the stand, the prosecution asked a few more questions.  Rolland said he did state again in the first video to Tarver that he had read him his rights before they arrived at the sheriff's department.  He also confirmed that Tarver corroborated everything Korre Phillips told them when they interviewed him earlier that day.  The trial is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning at 9, Week two of the Lavinda Counce murder trial continued Monday. Two more witnesses took the stand Monday morning. Dr. Frank Perettie, medical examiner for the Arkansas State Crime Lab, performed the autopsy on Counce’s body. He described photos of Counce’s remains including the gunshot wound to her head and the decomposition of the body. Dr. Perettie had to explain where certain body parts were because it was difficult to distinguish some parts due to maggots eating away at her body along with the decomposition of skin. With the gunshot wound, Dr. Perettie said there was evidence of a blunt force head injury to the face. He said it appears she may have been struck in the face with an unknown object. Detective Ron Richardson, Craighead County Sheriff’s Department, was recalled to the stand. The state reviewed more evidence with Richardson including rope found off Bridger Road in Jonesboro similar to rope also found in a burn barrel at Tarver’s home. Richardson also described the night they searched Tarver’s home and arrested him. Richardson said no law enforcement member ever made threats to Tarver’s wife or child and when Tarver was asked if he knew why they were there he said “I know.” The night of the search, Tarver confessed to the crime as well as telling Richardson where to find a gun. The gun recovered in Tarver’s attic was presented in court to the jury. Its serial number was filed off. Miller, Tarver’s attorney, then cross examined Richardson. Miller had Richardson recount the investigation and explain the fact the court knows the last time Counce was heard from and when her car was found, but it doesn’t know when exactly Counce was killed. The defense asked Richardson if they’d heard Tarver’s name until members of the Phillips family mentioned it. Richardson said no. Miller said Tarver’s name was never mentioned in the investigation until people who live behind NEA Baptist, live off of Bridger Road, and know the Counce family mentioned it. Miller made a mention of Korre Phillips, the man who said he drove Tarver home to Bay the day Counce went missing, also being obsessed with The Walking Dead but no further investigation was made into that family. Beyond the interviews with Tarver and the Phillips family, Miller discussed the lack of physical evidence with Richardson. Miller confirmed with Richardson that Tarver’s fingerprints were not found anywhere, and the only DNA evidence that links Tarver to the crime is the wash cloth inside the black bag found at Counce’s home. There was also a footprint found at the scene that Richardson confirmed did not match Tarver’s shoe. Richardson said there was not enough bullet fragments recovered to know if the bullet used to kill Counce came from Tarver’s gun. The state then asked Richardson a few more questions. DeProw focused on the fact that Richardson never had any suspicion of the Phillips in relation to this crime. Richardson said no one in the Phillips family ever confessed to the crime, but Tarver did confess to the crime on two separate occasions. It was also noted by the state that pet hair was found on the black bag in Counce’s home. Counce had no pets, but Tarver did have pets in his home. Miller countered that statement by making Richardson aware that more than 50% of households in the United States have pets.  The defense ended by asking Richardson if Tarver had any way of knowing how his wife and children were when he confessed. Richardson said no he would not have known that they weren’t in custody.  After the lunch recess, more employees with the Arkansas State Crime Lab took the stand. Bobby Humphries examined shoes and an impression of a shoe print for the case.  He said during his examination, he was unable to match the 3 pairs with the impression.  Another employee analyzed fingerprints in the case.  She said she analyzed 14 items but only found partial prints on a few items.  She explained that a person can touch something and not leave a fingerprint. At the end of her examination, she could not include or exclude anyone.  She also said she never got to the point in her testing to compare Tarver's prints to the partials she found.  A third employee with the lab was a firearms and tool mark examiner who tested a gun from Tarver's home. She said the serial number on the gun was defaced but she was able to recover it.  She tested small damaged copper jacket fragments with a bullet fired from the gun.  The examiner told the jury that she was unable to rule in or out the gun because the jackets had similar class characteristics.  During cross-examination, she said the firearm that fired the fragments was a common gun but she could not give the caliber of the fragments. After the crime lab employees finished testifying, a man by the name of James Henry took the stand.  Henry lived with James Phillips on Bridger Road in July 2015. He said on July 3 a man came to the door asking for Phillips and Phillips' son. Henry said he made a phone call to the son to see if the man could stay in the house. After given approval, he said he let the man in but the man did not talk to him.  When the son got home, he said the son took the man home.  Henry said later, the investigators came by the home but did not inform them about the man.  He said he did not remember until around July 17.  The defense cross-examined Henry and asked about how much he knew about Counce.  He said he found out about her a day or two after July 4 from the news.  Henry also mentioned he, Phillips' son and Phillips were obsessed with the show The Walking Dead. A Hay's Grocery Store manager took the stand after Henry.  He explained that he supplied surveillance footage to the Craighead County Sheriff's Department from the store at their request. The manager said there was a 15 minute difference on the time stamp in the video.  He said this has been a problem for a while that they just recently fixed.  The prosecution then called James Phillips to the stand.  Phillips explained he lived in a trailer house on Bridger Road with his son, grandson, and friend James Henry.  He said he has known Tarver since 1997 or 1998.  Phillips said Tarver was one of his son's first friends when they moved to Bay.  Phillips stressed that Tarver was like an adopted son to him. He said on July 3, he was out with his son and grandson getting groceries and fireworks.  He said he knew his son received a phone call and later found out Tarver was looking for a ride home.  Phillips identified Tarver in the courtroom and from a photo.  He said Tarver looked different in the photo but it was the same person. Phillips continued to say investigators visited him on July 15 asking about any people that may have come by days before.  He said at the time he did not think to mention Tarver because he did not see it as suspicious.  Phillips said Tarver would come to his home all the time when he was younger and came over a lot when his wife got sick. When cross-examined, Phillips told the jury that he knew Counce.  He said he rented a home from Counce, who he thought highly of. He first found out about Counce's disappearance on July 4 by watching the news.  The defense told Phillips that in Richardson's visit to his home, he told the investigator that he lived alone.  Phillips said that piece of information was misconstrued and that he was not trying to hide the fact that he lived with other people. In all, Phillips said he talked with investigators on 3 different days.  He thought it was odd that Tarver may have walked from the hospital to his home.  He said that seemed out of character and even when he was younger, Tarver liked to drive.  Before he left the stand, Phillips said neither he nor his son had anything to do with Counce's disappearance and that he was not trying to cover for Tarver.  The last witness of the day was Keith Bowers, a deputy with the CCSD.  In July 2015, Bowers was a transport officer who transported evidence from the case.  He said he did not pack the items or touch them when they were in his vehicle.  Bowers said he transported them to the state crime lab and came back to Jonesboro.  Court is scheduled to resume Tuesday morning at 9.  Witness testimony continued Friday in the Counce murder trial.  Etter's testimony continued from Thursday afternoon. He briefly spoke about video surveillance he received from NEA Baptist and Hay's Supermarket.  The supermarket video was to show Korre Phillips', the man who said he gave Tarver a ride home to Bay on July 3, location at a certain time of a day.  Etter was also questioned about another possible suspect named Trevor Polston but explained he was released from consideration after questioning.  Miller crossed Etter by asking about phone records and Polston's whereabouts on July 3. Etter said he had no access to phone records and nothing to do with that paperwork.  Becky Wrinkles was called to the stand after Etter. Wrinkles said she lives off of Bridger Road and saw a man walking along Bridger Road on July 3 between 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. Wrinkles told DeProw she found it odd someone was walking along that road because in her 6 years of living in the area she rarely sees people walking.  She said she remembered a white man walking down the road in blue jeans.  Wrinkles told DeProw once she saw Tarver's mugshot on Region 8 News she knew that was the man she saw walking down the road.  Miller crossed by asking Wrinkles if she remembered what the man she saw was wearing. Wrinkles said he was wearing blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and a hat.  Detective Ron Richardson, a criminal investigator for the Craighead County Sheriff's Department, was the next witness called.  With 24 years of experience in law enforcement, he described to the prosecutor all the evidence he collected during the Counce murder investigation.  He also told the jury what he did to the evidence to process it for further information or leads including sending some of it to the Arkansas State Crime Lab.  Richardson showed the courtroom every piece of evidence including the black bag found at Counce's home and all that was inside it.  He also discussed his process of dusting for finger prints around Counce's home and in her vehicle.  Richardson told DeProw it is difficult to get fingerprints from a door knob because the dust they use doesn't stick to it at times.  Evidence including Counce's purse, wallet, cell phone, cell phone battery, and rope found on Bridger Road were presented.  Richardson described Counce's wallet and said there was a piece of black tape on the wallet.  When the tape was removed, Richardson said there was no evidence of the wallet being damaged or needing tape.  Richardson did see something red on the tape. He told DeProw he sent it to the state crime lab because he wasn't sure if it were blood or lipstick.  Also found in Counce's car was a pair of gloves. Photos of Counce's body were also shown during Richardson's testimony.  As part of the investigation, Richardson joined other detectives and deputies in knocking on doors around Bridger Road.  Richardson said he knocked on many doors in a trailer park off Bridger Road and talked to many residents.  The only residence that had a connection to Counce was a trailer owned by James Phillips. Richardson said Phillips asked him if they were investigating the Counce murder.  When Richardson said yes, Phillips told him he knew Counce and used to rent a home from her, but Phillips said he didn't remember anything about July 3 or seeing anyone walking down the road.  Because of the connection, Richardson said he revisited the trailer multiple times. After several conversations, Richardson finally learned Phillips' son Korre also lived there in the trailer.  Richardson said he later found out from those who lived at the trailer that Tarver had came by on July 3 and asked Korre to give him a ride back to Bay.  The detective said Tarver and Korre knew each other, and the surveillance video from Hay's showed Korre was where he said he was at a certain time of day on July 3.  Richardson did not say what time of day that was or go into detail about the video of Korre.  After receiving information from Korre, Richardson said a search warrant for Tarver's home was issued.  When the trial resumed after a lunch recess, employees of the Arkansas State Crime Lab took the stand.  The first witness was Chantelle Taylor who works with trace evidence at the lab which includes items like hair and fiber.  Taylor explained her qualifications and what she does during testing.  She said she tested hair, rope, and plastic wrap from the case.  During her testing, Taylor said the hair was from an animal.  The rope she received was from the bag found in Counce's home, a sample taken from Tarver's home and pieces found at Bridger Road.  She said her testing showed rope from the bag and from Tarver's home matched. Taylor said her results also showed that more rope from the bag and from Bridger Road had similar properties but could not say for sure if it came from the same piece of rope. She also had a piece of plastic wrap and a partial used box of plastic wrap to test.  Taylor told the jury that she could not match up the piece to the box but that it was similar. During cross-examination, Taylor said both the rope and plastic wrap were not uncommon.  She said the only uncommon thing about the rope was that it was deconstructed.  Taylor also said she could not say which animal the hair she tested came from.  The next witness to take the stand was Mandi Wertenberger who deals with physical evidence. She also explained her qualifications and process when she tested items.  Wertenberger said when testing, she looks for things like blood or semen that could give DNA evidence.  She said she tested the bag and its contents found at Counce's home but did not find blood on anything.  When cross-examined, she said she did find possible blood on shoes from Tarver's home. She explained that further testing showed that it was not blood but something else.  The last witness of the day was Mary Simonson, a DNA examiner. She said she tested swabs and tape lifts from Wertenberger for possible DNA. Out of the many items in the bag, she only found Tarver's DNA in a sample from the washcloth.  She said she did find an unknown female's DNA on items that included the billy club wrapped in plastic wrap and the black bag's zipper and pulls. Simonson explained that that DNA was not from Counce or Tarver's wife. When the defense cross-examined Simonson, they asked about each item again.  She told the jury that the only item in the bag with his DNA was the washcloth.  When asked about possible cross contamination during testing, Simonson explained that did not happen because their control samples passed each time. When the prosecution asked more questions, they asked her about the other items.  Simonson said other items in the bag like a screwdriver or butcher knife did not hold DNA well because it has a smooth surface. The trial took a recess after Simonson's testimony and will resume Monday at 9 a.m. The state and defense gave opening statements Thursday morning.  The jury took their seats as family and friends of Lavinda Counce filled up two rows in the courtroom behind the state.  Several were also in the courtroom behind Tarver's bench.  Grant DeProw, deputy prosecutor, gave the state's opening statements. He started by showing the jury a picture of the 90-year-old.  He explained Counce's daily routine and what she was doing on July 3, 2015.  DeProw said 11:11 a.m. was the last time anyone heard from Counce on July 3. She spent the day going to the salon and cleaning her home.  The Counce family planned to get together Saturday, July 4, 2015.  He also explained what Tarver was doing that day according to his interview with law enforcement.  DeProw said Tarver had binge watched "The Walking Dead" and had an obsession with zombies, the apocalypse, and how he wanted to know what it was like to kill someone.  Since there were no zombies, DeProw said Tarver picked a 90-year-old woman to kill.  DeProw explained to the jury they would hear from several witnesses that put Tarver near NEA Baptist Memorial Hospital on July 3, which is where Counce's car was found.  One witness the jury will hear from knows Tarver and lives on Bridger Road behind NEA Baptist. DeProw said that witness will explain how Tarver knocked on their door that day asking for a ride back to Bay.  DeProw also went into detail about July 12, 2015, when Counce was found. A man, on his first day of searching, found Counce's body in a cornfield. Counce's was found with a gunshot wound to the head.  Police were called and that's when the missing person's case turned into a murder investigation.  The state said the Craighead County Sheriff's Office investigation took them to Bridger Road where they talked to witnesses who said they saw Tarver and gave him a ride back to Bay.  DeProw also described the sheriff's department first interaction with Tarver. The state told the jury they will watch a video where Tarver confesses to police.  The prosecutor said the jury will see Tarver in the video describe exactly what he did, how he killed Counce, and told police he had a .38-caliber gun in his attic.  DeProw said Tarver showed no remorse or guilt. He then explained what physical evidence the state will present.  That evidence includes the duffel bag found inside Counce's home that contains a wash cloth with Tarver's DNA.  Randel Miller, Tarver's defense attorney, gave his opening statement. "Please don't hurt my wife," is how Miller began.  He said that is why Tarver confessed. Tarver had watched the news and kept up with Counce case through the media. Miller said because of threats law enforcement made to his wife and children he felt he had to say whatever they wanted him to say.  Tarver knew what to say to police because he watched Counce's case unfold in the media. According to Miller, Tarver is gullible and easily manipulated, which is why police got him to confess.  Miller told the jury they will hear testimony from Tarver's mother-in-law and wife that explains Tarver was home at the time Counce's car was left at NEA Baptist.  The lack of physical evidence is something Miller also focused on. He explained there is unidentified DNA of a female and possibly another male on the duffel bag.  There is no DNA evidence of Tarver inside Counce's car. Tarver's DNA can only be found on the wash cloth inside the duffel bag. Miller also said the gun police found in Tarver's home does not match the bullet used to kill Counce.  He asked the jury to remember they are here to judge facts and the credibility of witnesses.  One witness in particular Miller mentioned was the witness that claims he saw Tarver on July 3, on Bridger Road and gave him a ride back to Bay.  Miller said that witness knew Counce and told the jury they should look for inconsistencies during this entire trial.  The state called its first witness after Miller's opening statement. Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington called Patsy Scott to the stand.  Scott is Counce's eldest daughter. Scott described her mother's appearance, stature, past health conditions, and lifestyle.  Scott was in tears as she described the day her mother went missing. Scott had dinner with her mother Thursday night. That was the last time she saw or spoke to her.  In her testimony, Scott said she called her mother twice Friday and when she realized at 9:30 p.m. she hadn't heard from her, she knew something was wrong.  Scott and her husband drove from Jonesboro to Counce's home in Bay to find her car gone, an unmade bed, an unrecognizable duffel bag, and no sign of Counce.  She said she felt panic when she picked up the duffel bag and saw a crowbar and other tools inside. Scott called police shortly after that.  Ellington showed the jury 15 photos of the inside and outside of Counce's home.  Scott told Ellington there was money and jewelry missing from Counce's dresser drawer.  Miller did cross-examine Scott and asked her if the money usually in Counce's drawer could have been spent already. Scott said yes it was possible.  Scott was then released from the witness stand.  After a lunch recess, the prosecution called Earnestine Ladd to the stand.  Ladd said she was one of Counce's best friends and called her the day she disappeared.  She said everything seemed to be normal while they were talking.  About an hour after the first call, she said she called again but there was no answer.  After Ladd, Sergeant Keith Milan with the Bay Police Department took the stand.  Milan explained that in July 2015 he was living in a home across the street from where Counce lived.  He said he received a call July 3, 2015 at around 10:10 p.m. of a missing person.  Milan said he walked across the street to talk to the family and was told her car was not there.  He requested a BOLO for Counce's vehicle.  Milan told the court he contacted local hospitals to be on the lookout and called the chief to figure out how to send a Silver Alert.  Milan said the family took him to a bag in the house that they did not claim.  He noticed a knife, crowbar, and other items in the bag.  Milan said he asked the family to leave because the room was a crime scene.  While he was looking around the house, he said he did not see any signs of a struggle or any signs of forced entry.  Milan explained he also helped in the search for Counce's body, which took up most of his day.  When the county went to search Tarver's home, Milan said he was instructed by his chief to assist.  He said they had to force an entry into Tarver's home but did not hear any threats made to anyone.  During cross-examination by the defense, Milan said he did not ask the family if anyone touched the bag they took him to.  He said his biggest concern was finding Counce.  Milan finished his testimony by explaining that they did enter Tarver's home with guns drawn.  The prosecution called Bay Chief of Police Paul Keith to the stand after Milan. Keith explained he was called by Milan and told of the suspicious bag the family showed him.  When he declared the room a crime scene, Keith said he called the Craighead County Sheriff's Department to assist.  Keith said he helped coordinate the search efforts over the 8 day period when Counce was missing.  When her body was found, Keith said he was called to lock down the scene.  Craighead County Sheriff Marty Boyd was another witness Monday afternoon.  Boyd said Keith called him and informed him of the missing person.  He said he knew the Counce family but did not know who was missing when he arrived at the home.  Boyd said he called other deputies from his department after he arrived.  He explained that he helped direct investigators during the case and received briefings everyday on where they were at in the investigation. Boyd said he was in the area when Tarver was arrested.  The defense cross-examined Boyd and asked him about another suspect.  Boyd said a boyfriend of a relative of Counce's was a suspect but they ruled him out during their investigation. After Boyd left the stand, Joey Bogart replaced him.  Bogart said he saw there was a need for volunteers online and offered his services.  On July 12, 2015 he went to Bay to look for Counce. He said he decided to go to the Farville curve but changed his mind.  Bogart explained his decision took him around a wooded area and to some roads by a corn field.  He said during a pass, he smelled something odd.  Bogart said he located where the smell was coming from and expected to find a dead animal.  While looking through the corn, Bogart said he saw a pair of shoes.  He explained that he realized he found a body and called the police.  Craighead County Coroner Toby Emerson took the stand to explain what he did and saw at the location where Bogart found Counce's body. Emerson said he took photos of the scene, which was a part of his job.  He said she was not alive when he arrived and that there was an apparent hole in the back of the skull. Emerson described the body as being in an advanced stage of decomposition with a large amount of insect involvement.  He said it was very difficult to see the body from the road.  When asked if Counce had died from natural causes, Emerson said in his opinion she did not. Elbert Bradford was another witness who took the stand.  He said he knew the Counce family and wanted to help find her car.  Bradford said he thought Lavinda Counce had a relative who was in the hospital and decided to check.  He said he went to NEA Baptist Hospital with a friend and located her car in the parking lot.  Investigator Gary Etter was the last witness of the day.  He said he went to the hospital after Counce's car was found.  Etter said he received surveillance footage from the hospital, which was shown to the jury.  He described what took place in the video to the jury.  Etter said during the video, Counce's car could be seen driving through the parking lot.  He said when the driver parked, a suspect left the vehicle and began walking down Highway 49. During cross-examination, Etter said he talked to Scott about what they found during the investigation. When Etter left the stand, court was dismissed for the day. Jury selection continued Wednesday, after the court chose 5 jurors at the end of court on Tuesday.  Several potential jurors were excused during questioning.  One was excused because of memory problems and issues related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Two females were released because of conflicts with childcare and school, and a man was excused because of implied bias.  At the end of questioning two panels of potential jurors, 11 jurors were chosen. There is one more panel to be questioned. From that last panel, the court must choose one more juror to serve as well as alternate jurors.  A family member of Counce told Region 8 News opening statements begin at 10 a.m. and witnesses will take the stand at 1 p.m. Jury selection continued Tuesday in a Jonesboro courtroom in the case against Tarver.  Eighteen potential jurors were questioned in the morning by the judge, state, and defense. Questions for each juror ranged from personal background, knowledge of or relationship with any possible witnesses, feelings about gun ownership, along with feelings about the death penalty.  Three were released after they gave their opinion of the death penalty.  Jury selection continues until there are 12 jurors selected.  Jury selection began Monday morning for the Lavinda Counce murder trial.  Judge Cindy Thyer is presiding over the State of Arkansas versus Richard Jordon Tarver.  Tarver is charged with seven charges including capital murder, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, aggravated residential burglary, abuse of a corpse, theft of property, and possession of a defaced firearm.  Police arrested Tarver in July 2015 for the murder of Counce.  Potential jurors watched an orientation video and completed questionnaires.  Judge Thyer then dismissed several based on mental or physical impairments and extreme hardships.  Potential jurors will later be divided into groups, and more will be dismissed.  A gag order has been issued for those involved in the case. Region 8 News will continue to track the court preceding all week.  Click here to review the case and view a timeline of the Counce case.  Copyright 2016 KAIT. All rights reserved.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 October 2016 | MYT 12:47 PM Wal-Mart plans bigger e-commerce shift, tempers profit view Ramping up e-commerce investments: Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. — Reuters CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years.  The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centred on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target.  Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9% in afternoon trading at US$69.59 (RM289.28).  "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," chief executive officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day.  The company spent more than US$3bil (RM12.47bil) in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales.  Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20% to 30% in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years.  Online sales currently account for about 3% of total sales.  Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about US$11bil (RM45.72bil), similar to this year.  Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5% to 10%.  While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note.  The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about US$300mil (RM1.24bil) in 2013 to US$1.1bil (RM4.57bil) this year for a total of about US$3bil (RM12.47bil), excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports.  Chief financial officer Brett Biggs said only about 20% of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added.  In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercentres compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighbourhood markets from 161 last year. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Earnings , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Investing , Technology You May Be Interested Tech up your cooking TomTom targeting deals with US automakers Twitter impresses advertisers with BuzzFeed US election livestream Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMore (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

The index's biggest drag today was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which fell more than 2.6% after the retailer forecast weak earnings for the next two years. Let's look at the final numbers on Thursday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 18,268.50; -12.53; -0.07% S&P 500: 2,160.77; 1.04; 0.05% Nasdaq: 5,306.85; -9.17; -0.17% Now, here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a preview of Friday's economic calendar. DJIA Today: Investors Await Friday Jobs Report, Oil Prices Tick Higher The Dow Jones fell 12 points as investors weighed another round of economic data and monitored the approach of Hurricane Matthew. Last week, Americans seeking unemployment benefits nearly hit a 43-year low. The news comes a day before the Department of Labor announces the September unemployment rate. The report will provide a strong influence on the Federal Reserve's pending decision on interest rates in the months ahead. Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) is in trouble again. Shares had been rallying in recent trading sessions thanks to rumors that suitors were lining up to bid for the microblogging network. However, that speculation appears to have been premature. TWTR stock fell more than 18% after Re/code announced that both Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) and Alphabet Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Google were unlikely to make any bid for the firm. That leaves Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM), which saw shares crater on Wednesday after CEO Marc Benioff talked about a deal. Mizuho analysts warned that a Twitter deal could reduce Salesforce's stock value by as much as 25%. Here's the latest on the TWTR deal and why it looks unlikely. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more… The price of crude oil today was pushing back above $50 per barrel for the first time since June. Last week's announcement by OPEC that it will cap crude production in November has established a floor for prices. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors has called OPEC's deal a game-changer. However, there is much work to do for the global oil cartel. Moors explains what's next for oil prices and what investors must know about global production. The WTI crude oil price today gained 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Brent crude oil price added nearly 1.4%. But the big story today was at Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB). The company announced plans to slash more than 1,000 jobs in Germany as part of a larger restructuring plan. The firm will let go of 9,000 employees around the world as the fallout continues from its ongoing liquidity problems. The firm is expected to settle with the Department of Justice in the coming weeks for its peddling of mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis. Top Stock Market News Today, Oct. 6, 2016 Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) is back in the news, and – as always – it's not for good reason. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has demanded that Department of Justice shift its attention of the fake account scandal to the firm's executive committee. Thirteen other U.S. senators joined Sanders in a letter that warned DOJ head Loretta Lynch that the agency's investigation of Wells Fargo is a "critical test" of its ability to reign in bad behavior in the future on Wall Street. In deal news, shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) slipped more than 1% after the company announced plans to sell its infusion therapy business to ICU Medical Inc. (Nasdaq: ICUI). The all cash and stock deal is valued at roughly $1 billion. Meanwhile, in cybersecurity news, shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) fell 1% after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned Americans about the safety of the firm's insulin pumps. The government agency announced that the medical devices were susceptible to hackers. It was a good day for AquaVenture Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: WAAS), which debuted this morning on the public markets. Shares of the water management firm rallied more than 23.5% from its issue price of $18. In earnings news, shares of Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) fell more than 1.7% after the company fell short of earnings expectations after the bell Wednesday. According to Estimize, the company met Wall Street EPS expectations of $1.09, but fell well short of revenue expectations. The company announced that same-store sales in China were far less than analysts had anticipated. After the bell, look for additional reports from Ruby Tuesday Inc. (NYSE: RT), Helen of Troy Ltd. (Nasdaq: HELE), Mistras Group Inc. (NYSE: MG), and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (Nasdaq: CMTL).

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Average U.S. 30-Year Mortgage Rate Unchanged at 3.42 Percent WASHINGTON (AP) – Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 percent. U.S. Farmers Make Foray Into Quinoa As Demand for Grain Grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) – A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. Federal Government: Mylan Has Been Overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) – Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug’s maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government’s complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties.

NEW YORK — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in afternoon trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers such as Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart also is melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments, as well as the other moves, are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right, and it didn't push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the United Kingdom and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments â either by the same reader or different readers. We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper.

Wal-Mart shooting suspect appears in court By Jessica Prokop The Columbian (Vancouver, Wash.) Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Sheridan, Wyoming, appeared Thursday in Clark County Superior Court on suspicion of second-degree assault stemming from the Wal-Mart shooting and first-degree arson in an unrelated residential fire in Hazel Dell on Tuesday. Sprague wore a suicide-prevention smock – given to prisoners who may try to harm themselves with standard jail clothing – and appeared to be a bit dazed during the proceeding. Judge Gregory Gonzales asked Sprague several times if he understood his rights and repeated them one at a time. Sprague told jail officials that he suffers from mental health problems, according to court documents. His court-appointed attorney, Gerry Wear, said he may raise competency issues at a later date. Deputy Prosecutor Randy St. Clair asked Gonzales to find probable cause for second-degree assault in the shooting, rather than the three counts of first-degree assault referred by law enforcement. Gonzales found probable cause exists in both cases. Clark County sheriff’s deputies detained Sprague just before 7 a.m. inside the Wal-Mart at 9000 N.E. Highway 99 after a 911 caller reported an active shooter at the store, according to the sheriff’s office. No one was shot or injured during the incident. Sprague had a revolver on him and reportedly fired shots near the Subway restaurant inside the store near the front entrance, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Superior Court. The store had been open for about an hour when the shooting occurred. Employees and shoppers either evacuated or sheltered in place, sheriff’s office spokesman Sgt. Fred Neiman said. Officers searched the store for potential victims and accomplices, but none were located. Assault case Jake Bodle, a Subway manager, told the Columbian on Wednesday that he spoke with Sprague earlier in the morning. He said he was outside smoking when Sprague approached him and asked for a cigarette. Bodle declined. Sprague then came into the store and told Bodle he wanted a sandwich. Bodle said the Wal-Mart restaurant wasn’t open yet but that he’d make him a sandwich once he was done preparing for the day, the affidavit states. Bodle told detectives that he was in and out of the back room setting up the restaurant, and when he walked back to the front counter, he saw Sprague point a gun toward merchandise in the store. Sprague fired six shots and then placed the revolver on a nearby table, according to court documents. Bodle fled to the back area and saw Sprague fire two more shots in the same direction, before placing the gun on the table again, court records said. A manager at Wal-Mart called 911, and deputies arrived within five to 10 minutes and detained Sprague. During an interview with police, Sprague said he’s owned the revolver for about five years, according to the affidavit. He went into the Wal-Mart because he was cold and wet, he said, and planned to kill himself but changed his mind, court documents said. While at the Clark County Jail, he told officers that he had used “speed” – a term for amphetamines – a couple of days before the shooting and said, “none of this would have happened before I used that (expletive),” court records show. Arson case In the arson case, Sprague allegedly set a kitchen fire Tuesday at the home he was staying at in the 3000 block of Northeast 75th Street. He dipped a pair of fuzzy dice in gasoline, lit them on fire and placed them inside a kitchen cabinet, a separate probable cause affidavit states. A roommate, Artem Popov, told officers that he went to bed at about 11 p.m. the night before and awoke to the sound of the smoke detector and smell of smoke. He went downstairs and found a fire in a kitchen cabinet and extinguished it, court records said. He then smelled rotten eggs and found that the gas line had been disconnected to the water heater in the garage. Sprague was the only other person at the house when Popov went to bed, he said, and there were no signs of forced entry, according to court documents. During his court appearance, St. Clair said it appears that Sprague is a transient and has some criminal history in Wyoming, mostly convictions for driving while under the influence and criminal trespassing. Gonzales set his bail at $80,000 between the two cases. Sprague will be arraigned Oct. 20.

The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.31, or 3.2 percent, to $69.36 Thursday. — Associated Press Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Eastwood Rust Encapsulator 15-oz.

They carried signs that read, “Add Some Respect to My Check,” and “Sexual Harassment: I’m Not Loving It.” The protest came a day after McDonald’s workers nationwide filed 15 complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging sexual harassment. By law, the commission can’t confirm or deny whether complaints were filed. But the burger chain says it takes the claims seriously and is reviewing them. An online survey by Hart Research Associates of 1,217 non-managerial female fast-food workers released Wednesday found that 40 percent of them said they experienced harassment on the job. At the rally, workers and advocates described inappropriate touching, lewd comments, groping and retaliation against women who complained. The complaints also claim that no action was taken when workers brought up the issues to management. Many working women already know some of the solutions: the same economic reforms that low-wage workers are already demanding. A McDonald’s worker, who was wearing a Black Lives Matter/Fight for $15 T-shirt, pointed out that “a union would help protect the women’s jobs.” The worker, who did not want to give her name, also noted that the struggle by low-wage earners to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour was connected to the fight against sexual harassment. After all, she said women put up with sexual harassment on the job because “they are trying to support their families.” If they had more economic stability, women could complain more often and sometimes leave such workplaces. This presidential election year, we’ve heard a lot about economic fairness and about the empowerment of women, but not enough about how intertwined those two issues truly are. Yesterday’s rally was a good start. Liza Featherstone lives and writes in Clinton Hill.

The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It said that such investments are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year.

The business had its grand opening on September 16. This year Lansing has added some exciting new businesses, with more to come, ranging from restaurants and boutiques to fitness and industrial facilities. While most residents notice the retail spots, there has also been growth in other areas, including the addition of Dedicated Leasing Transportation Company, which opened on the west end of town, and a specialty contractor, International Quality Contracting, which works in medical buildouts. A soon-to-be-built Planet Fitness will occupy the former PetSmart building next to the new Wal-Mart location, which opened earlier this year. Cumbia Fitness also opened recently, offering Zumba classes in a location just off of Ridge Road in the downtown area. According to Travis Bandstra, director of economic development, a new barbecue restaurant called Champions II BBQ is nearly ready for business. “They’re opening soon at 17659 Torrence in front of Wal-Mart,” he says. Another local barbecue restaurant is planning both a move and expansion. Lynnie Que’s, which has operated a carry-out and catering business on Burnham Avenue for eight years, will relocate into a building at the Lansing Municipal Airport. The full service restaurant and bar, called Lynnie Que’s Airport Bar and Grill, is expected to be open by early November, according to owner Lynn Cartwright. Another restaurant that is new to Lansing this year is Bohemian Joe’s, which opened in January occupying the former Popolano’s building at 17940 Torrence Avenue. Offering an eclectic menu of American cuisine in a completely renovated and redesigned space, it features weekly specials, craft beers and occasional live entertainment. Some new storefronts can be found on Ridge Road, including the Simply Gorgeous Boutique, A. A. McCull Men’s Haberdashery and the Bunker (carrying military surplus items and antique gear). A new entertainment spot called UNLOCKaLOCK Escape Room just held its grand opening.

Thanks, TC Team Disrupt LondonWin A Free Trip To Disrupt London Enter Today In buyers’ market, acquirers look to lock in management teams longer Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Toppling democracy one byte at a time Acquisitions are often celebrated in the press. But academic research suggests that 70 percent to 90 percent of mergers don’t succeed, owing to a wide variety of factors. Buyers overvalue the synergies they’ll derive, or they underestimate the impact of the associated costs, or they rely too heavily on assumptions about where a market is heading. Of course, another reason acquisitions don’t always go as planned is that founders often leave a year or two after their company has been gobbled up. That’s changing in today’s challenging market for exits, where a growing number of well-funded companies and their investors are hoping that if an IPO isn’t in the cards, an acquisition might be. And in addition to other changing deal terms, acquiring companies are seemingly thinking long and hard about locking up talent longer than they have in the recent past. You saw it happen when the e-commerce company Jet sold to Walmart for a whopping $3.3 billion in August. According to Recode, cofounder and CEO Marc Lore agreed to stay on with Walmart for an atypically long five years as part of the acquisition agreement. In fact, according to that same August report, if Lore leaves before the summer of 2021, he’ll forfeit a sizable amount of both cash and stock that could otherwise earn him up to an estimated $1 billion. Lore may be exceptional in many ways, including his understanding of e-commerce and how to compete specifically with Amazon, which acquired his previous company. It’s easy to understand why Walmart wants him around. He probably won’t be alone, though. Steve Fletcher, a managing director at the global investment bank GCA, notes that it’s “hard to say” whether it’s universally the case that management teams are getting locked into longer contracts with acquirers in this market. “I don’t think anyone has a large enough sample size to say that,” he notes. But he adds that of the deals he is seeing, there is a move to sign on incoming talent for a longer period, sometimes “three or four years as opposed to [the previous standard of] 18 to 24 months.” Vas Natarajan — an investor at the venture firm Accel Partners who focuses on products and services that target developers, designers and media creators — makes a similar observation. “In the last four or five years, there’s been a rash of these acquir-hires, where the founders have left after 18 to 24 months,” Natarajan says. “But I know from talking with heads of product and corp dev teams [that they are now asking], ‘How can we do it in a way that’s much more retentive than in the past?’ M&A teams are starting to think more about structuring things in a way that you retain what you buy.” How big a trend this becomes is far from clear. As a baseline, SRS Acquiom, a San Francisco-based outfit that provides M&A post-closing services to companies, says that 21 percent of the 735 private M&A transactions it saw between 2012 and 2015 featured an earn-out period of four to five years. Meanwhile, 47 percent of those deals featured earn-out periods of 1 to 2 years. Founders who are more driven to start companies than reap their full reward from an acquirer will surely leave no matter the earn-out period anyway. Still, there’s reason for corporates to believe that longer agreements make sense. In 2013, PayPal, then a division of eBay, acquired the Chicago-based payments gateway Braintree in an all-cash deal worth $800 million. As part of that deal, the incentives of Braintree CEO Bill Ready were structured over a long period of time. In retrospect, that decision looks to be paying off for Ready and PayPal — which spun off into its own public company last year. As of September of last year, Ready was already running all product and engineering at PayPal. Just this week, he became the first person since it became an independent concern to be named to the role of chief operating officer. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Slice is an app that's all about pizza VIDEO | 1:08 Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election 11 hours ago | Lora Kolodny How Facebook can escape the echo chamber 15 hours ago | Anna Escher Secret is coming back yesterday | Sarah Buhr I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back yesterday | Matthew Panzarino Latest From TechCrunch WTF is computer vision? 3 hours ago | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Is Netflix Disney’s next big buy and is Reed Hastings its next CEO? 3 hours ago | Peter Csathy Naver to launch $43M fund to seek out investments for its Snow and Webtoon services 4 hours ago | Jon Russell How President Trump could abuse big data and the surveillance state 4 hours ago | Jon Stokes Comment moderation powered by Up Next Toppling democracy one byte at a time Posted Oct 6, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Developer Events Content Manager (Contract Role) at Google (Mountain View, CA, United States) Director of Marketing and Communications (Position #4782) at Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL, United States) Digital Marketing Analyst at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, United States) Advanced TV Product Manager - Media at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (New York, NY, United States) Technical Product Manager @ PANTHEON at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

Published Oct 6th, 2016 3:26 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon told Wall Street analysts gathered in Bentonville Thursday (Oct. 6) the company is going through a transformation period, the most he’s witnessed in his 32 years with the retailer. The world’s largest retailer, according to McMillon, is investing for the future as it slows new store growth which has been the basis for much of its revenue growth historically. Capital can then be redirected to e-commerce, with talent like Jet.com founder Marc Lore – who came with Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com – leading the ecommerce push. And while Wal-Mart management is excited about the change, the moves are somewhat scary to Wall Street as investors sold off shares Thursday (Oct. 6) in response to the retailers’ flat growth forecast for next year. Wal-Mart shares (NYSE: WMT) slid to $69.36, down $2.28 per share as the retailer tempered its profit forecast over the next two years. The retail giant expects flat earnings for fiscal 2018 that will begin Jan. 31, 2017, while capital expenditures will be trimmed to $11 billion. For the back half of this year Wal-Mart reiterated earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.35 per share, and said it’s gaining momentum in e-commerce as the giant U.S. store business is in a stronger position than a year ago. “We have to make sure this company is here 50 years from now,” McMillon said of the myriad changes the company is making to grow its business and respond to online retail growth. STORE REDUCTION PLAN Last year Wal-Mart opened 69 supercenters, with just 60 planned for this year and 35 the following fiscal year. Neighborhood Market expansion is being trimmed from 161 new stores in the previous fiscal year to just 20 new stores next year. Overall. the new store count is down from 230 last year to just 55 next year. This is a concern for suppliers and investors because roughly 70% of Wal-Mart’s revenue growth has come from new stores. McMillon said comp sales and e-commerce sales which now comprise the other 30% will grow. Wal-Mart is betting heavily on its investments in e-commerce including the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and the increased stake in JD.com in China to be catalyst for the this change. McMillon said China holds huge growth potential and the best way to tap that market was to partner with JD.com because it would have been too expensive to scale Yihaodian. In the U.S., McMillon said the play to acquire Jet.com made perfect sense. He said a mutual friend introduced Jet.com founder Marc Lore to him a few months ago and the two immediately began to talk about the possibilities of scaling e-commerce in the U.S. and what a marriage of the two companies might look like. Jet.com ships 100,000 packages a week with more than 5 million users, up from zero users just 14 months ago. REDUCING SHIPPING COSTS McMillon said Lore and his team cracked the code on how to win in e-commerce by giving the customer transparency into the costs of an online transaction and building baskets online, versus shipping individual items. The average basket on Jet.com includes 7.9 items, which they believe is a more effective way to ship product. Lore, who was in Bentonville for the analyst meetings, said a customer who wants to buy dog food online has the choice of paying for shipping, getting a better price if they use debit pay versus credit, and if they add a dog leash to the basket they find more value. The choices and push for a consumer to add more to an online order improves the margin. Lore said Wal-Mart has a good foundation with new distribution network and its vast store fleet which gives them an advantage in lowering shipping costs to roughly $1 per order if all the distribution nodes are efficiently used. McMillon said sharing knowledge and infrastructure with Jet should net exciting growth. Jet appeals to the urban shopper and Wal-Mart has the suburbs covered. Together the two retailers have 35 million items they will sell in their online platforms. Lore, CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce, has been on the job for 27 days and McMillon said he’s learned what a great item merchant Lore is at heart as the two recently walked Walmart stores and Lore kept being distracted by items he wanted to sell online. “If Marc can be Marc with this company then great things are going to happen,” McMillon said.

At an investor meeting Thursday, executives said the world's largest retailer will open about half as many supercenters next year as it did last fiscal year. Instead, Wal-Mart will direct more of its $11 billion in annual capital spending to boosting e-commerce sales, technology used in stores and service. Wal-Mart has already invested billions in online efforts, as well as higher wages for store workers -- efforts executives have previously said will depress profits for years. Last month, Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion to buy unprofitable online retailer Jet.com Inc., and on Wednesday it disclosed it had nearly doubled its investment in Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc. "I don't think it's an exaggeration to say we are going through a transformative period," CEO Doug McMillon told investors and analysts at the meeting. As previously expected, Wal-Mart said its fiscal 2018 earnings will be flat compared with fiscal 2017, which ends in January. Wal-Mart maintained its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 at $4.29 to $4.49 a share. But the company said per-share earnings in fiscal 2019 will fall at the low end of a previously forecast 5% to 10% growth target, in part because of its purchase of Jet.com. "We have more visibility on how that is going to shake out," a spokesman said. Shares of Wal-Mart slipped 3.1% to $69.46 in morning trading. The shares have risen about 13% on the year. New store growth will slow significantly. The retailer expects to build 35 new supercenters in fiscal 2018, down from 69 last year. Even growth of the company's smaller format Neighborhood Markets will slow, down to 20 new stores in fiscal 2018 from 161 built last year. Over the past four years, the majority of Wal-Mart's growth has come from new stores, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said Thursday. Same-store sales and e-commerce "are starting to play a much bigger role than they have in the past," he said. Wal-Mart's same-store sales have risen for eight straight quarters, in part because of investments to improve service and efficiency and to cut inventory. While its spending priorities are shifting, Wal-Mart maintained its outlook for capital expenditures at $11 billion this fiscal year and next. The company reported revenue of $482 billion last fiscal year, with about $14 billion coming from e-commerce. Wal-Mart is "investing in the right places, and slowing store growth is the right strategy," said Peter Benedict, retail analyst for Baird. However those investments will continue to weigh on company profits for years, he said. Executives speaking to investors from the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters also said e-commerce sales will grow significantly in the second half of the year, reversing years of underwhelming online sales. E-commerce sales will jump around 20% to 30% in the second half of the year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, Mr. Biggs said. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales growth slowed for nine straight quarters until last quarter, when they rose 11.8%. Mr. Biggs said e-commerce growth will come from efforts to rapidly add third-party sellers to Walmart.com, millions more products, and the acquisition of Jet.com. Wal-Mart also will market Walmart.com more aggressively, he said. Wal-Mart, which has $11.7 billion remaining on its $20 billion share buyback, said it anticipates completing the program around the end of fiscal 2018.

The group was almost entirely opposed to a new apartment complex off U.S. 98 in Fairhope, Ala. The council, with a 3-2 vote, endorsed the zoning needed for the complex to move forward. The vote led to a recent voter backlash against some of the incumbents, including Mayor Tim Kant. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com). Print Email John Sharp | jsharp@al.com By John Sharp | jsharp@al.com Press-Register Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 06, 2016 at 2:16 PM, updated October 06, 2016 at 2:45 PM comments "I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back." - Lynn Maser of the 98 Committee Diana Brewer, marketing and public relations director at the GulfQuest Maritime Museum in Mobile, Ala., lost her Fairhope City Council seat to James "Jimmy" Conyers during the Oct. 4, 2016, municipal runoff election. (file photo) The construction of a Walmart Supercenter angered plenty of Fairhope residents less than a decade ago. A Hampton Inn, built downtown with a parking deck, also stirred friction. And a worker-housing development next to the high school sparked fierce resistance. But none of those projects caused political upheaval like the 240-unit apartment complex proposal that surfaced a year ago and received the City Council's initial OK in April on a thin 3-2 vote. The apartment proposal arrived on the scene as booming Fairhope was struggling to chart its future under the pressure of relentless growth, overcrowded schools, limited downtown parking and congested roads.  Now, Fairhope's city government is experiencing something of an earthquake. Last month, voters ousted four-term Mayor Tim Kant, who had expressed support for the apartments, choosing political novice and bookstore owner Karin Wilson as the city's new chief executive. Also booted from office was Councilman Rich Mueller, a "Yes" vote for the apartments. Then on Tuesday, during a runoff election, Councilwoman Diana Brewer – another "Yes" vote -- was overwhelmingly defeated by James "Jimmy" Conyers Jr., an opponent of the apartment project. Only Councilman Kevin Boone, the third "Yes" vote who faced opposition from a newcomer to the city, was able to hold on to his seat. "I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Lynn Maser, chairwoman of the Fairhope 98 committee, which was formed one year ago to take a closer look at the city's growth after the apartment project was first introduced. "North Fairhope wasn't going to re-elect anyone who voted for the apartments." Said City Council President Jack Burrell, one of the "No" votes on the apartment complex: "It's probably been the hottest (issue) I've ever seen in the last 17 years living in Fairhope. I've seen some hotly debated developments and this one, I believe, may have cost the mayor his job." Meanwhile, the apartment complex's prospects may have dimmed. The city Planning Commission, which backed the project in February, voted on Monday – the day before the runoff – to not support the project's latest site plan based on drainage concerns. The project's developer now has to wait another six months before bringing it back up for consideration. Moratorium on growth The new city leadership, which takes office next month, could quickly take up a moratorium on new developments. The council, last month, opted to postpone a moratorium vote until Wilson and the new council members were sworn in. Burrell said the initial moratorium ordinance "was fairly generic" and needed to be more "well thought out" with specific recommendations on what the city wants to accomplish. Kant also is urging caution: "It's good as long as you're trying to accomplish something. If you put it in there and say you want 'no growth' then you are opening yourself to a lot of criticism." Burrell said the moratorium push last month came from Wilson. "The mayor-elect wants to see it enacted," said Burrell. "She would rather have it passed prior to her taking office so it's expedited. But it's a council decision and I think since we have such high turnover on the council, the new council should make decisions as to what the moratorium should look like and they should be the ones who adopt it." Karin Wilson, a Fairhope independent bookstore owner, speaks to reporters following her victory in the Aug. 23, 2016, mayoral election in Fairhope, Ala. (file photo) Wilson, who agrees with Burrell on holding off to await the new administration, said: "The pressure and sense of urgency is coming not from me but rather a community who voted in new leadership that campaigned on the shared belief that Fairhope's future growth is our No. 1 priority." She said, "I intend to deliver what our citizens expect and the only way to accomplish this is by taking the time to perform the comprehensive studies needed and to put a new plan in action for development. I feel confident our new administration will agree." Apartment opposition It's unclear what a moratorium might mean for the Retreat at Fairhope Village, the apartment complex pushed by Mississippi-based Leaf River Group. The company is also developing a 264-unit complex in downtown Mobile, a project which faced no controversy by Mobile city officials. But in Fairhope, a chorus of boos rang out within the council chambers on April 11, when the council voted 3-2 to support zoning changes to allow the complex to be built off of U.S. 98. Brewer repeatedly had to defend her vote, and wrote an extensive opinion piece at AL.com describing why high-end apartments were needed in Fairhope. The issue also followed Kant around. Maser and other critics of the project say the sprawling complex would rise near a sensitive watershed that feeds Mobile Bay, and they do not trust the drainage or stormwater management plans associated with the work. Others, such as attorney Adam Milam, maintain that the city is violating its own ordinances and past comprehensive plan in allowing the multi-family dwelling to proceed. A lawsuit, filed on behalf of project opponents, is awaiting a Baldwin County judge's opinion. "It's such an environmentally sensitive area," said Milam, noting that a Publix grocery store – developed nearby – was faced local opposition because of its potential impacts on important habitat. "The people who live around the area ... are proud of their homes and their community and want to protect it." Brewer believes there is more to the story, however. She said a "fear factor" was being spread that would harm the city. "It's an elitist concept and an elitist way of looking at things and one that I'm very much in disagreement with," she said. 'Huge factor' Kant downplays the effect of the apartment uproar on the city elections, saying it had "some impact," but no more than previous development controversies. "If you look at the issues important to Fairhope, it's the growth and the parking downtown and the school growth ... it funnels right back to growth and people are real concerned about that," Kant said. But Milam calls the apartment complex an example of "bad development decisions" that weighed heavy on voter's minds. "That was a huge driving force in the elections and one reason why I think Karin Wilson is so intent in making smart development ... a major part of her tenure," he said. "I think Kant was strong. I didn't think he would ever be beaten. But he made some major decisions that affected a lot of people and it motivated a big voter turnout." In an interview, Stewart Speed of Leaf River Group expressed confidence that things would work out for the apartment project. He said that the city's engineers had previously "signed off" on the engineering design. Referring to Monday's Planning Commission action, he said, "It's not like we had a faulty plan or anything. I just didn't technically meet the language of the letter in the ordinance." Speed declined to say whether the Planning Commission's vote was more political than substantive. Speed, himself, was not allowed to speak during the meeting in defense of the project or its drainage plan. He did acknowledge that, in his experience, the brush back in Fairhope is unusual.  "I've been doing this a long time in a lot of municipalities and that's the first time I've ever seen this occur," Speed said.

Wal-Mart said Thursday it plans to slow new store openings as it looks to pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. (AP file photo) Wal-Mart plans to slow new store openings By: The Associated Press October 6, 2016 2:26 pm 0 NEW YORK — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it’s struggling in the U.K and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores.
