Each year she and her family take a day to shop together and this year it was at Toronto Eaton Centre. Before school starts in September, Owen’s mom will take a family picture on the front steps of their home, which she has done every year since Owen started school. “It’s fun to have that tradition,” said Owen, a Ryerson student. The bulk of back-to-school shopping in the GTA takes place closer to Labour Day weekend, but for many retailers and shoppers, it has already begun. Back-to-school traffic at Cadillac Fairview malls, which includes the Eaton Centre, Fairview and Sherway Gardens, is second only to the holiday season, according to spokesperson Vanessa Jenkins. August is a peak month for shopping and the third-busiest shopping month of the year, after November and December, with 75 per cent of families making their back-to-school purchases in that time, said Jenkins. Mall traffic at Cadillac Fairview properties was up 4 per cent in 2015, over the previous year, and sales per pedestrian were up 8 per cent in the period. On average, Canadian parents are expecting to spend $461 on their children this back-to-school season, including school supplies and clothing — $132 more than last year’s average, which was $329, according to a survey conducted by retailmenot.ca. But while the average spend for an elementary school student is expected to be $318, it’s expected to be $412 for high school students and $1,630 for university students, reflecting the higher cost of setting up a dorm room and study space. “Right now, our top purchases online include mini fridges, mattresses and TVs (this is more of a back-to-campus shop) as well as stationery items such as notebooks,” said Felicia Fefer, manager of marketing and public relations for Walmart Canada. The bulk of back-to-school shopping will take place in-store, said Fefer, but Walmart is seeing a significant growth of orders on walmart.ca and through the mobile app. Walmart began marketing back-to-school in July. “We are ready when customers are ready to shop for BTS and there are always early shoppers,” said Fefer. Price is the most important consideration for shoppers, Fefer said. Walmart is projecting that Canadians will spend approximately $500 on average, on back-to-school shopping. Walmart is seeking to expand its back-to-school business with a collection of recipes and shopping lists to reach out to trying to save time on meal preparation during the school year. Some retailers at Yorkdale Mall have begun back-to-school sales but the busiest weekend is Labour Day weekend, said general manager Claire Santamaria. “Mid-August, that’s when we start to see our traffic patterns start to increase, especially around the weekends,” said Santamaria. Retailers are targeting parents on Facebook and using Twitter and Instagram to promote products to students. “We’ve had a really good year-to-date, so, if we continue the trends that we’ve been seeing this year, then yes, it will be better than next year,” said Santamaria. “If you want to get what you want, now is a good time to do it.” Back-to-school shopping queries on the comparison-price website Shopbot.ca began trending upwards before the middle of July, two weeks earlier than last year, according to spokesperson Lia Almeida. Sought-after products include: Birkenstock sandals, Nike Air Max shoes, Adidas Superstar shoes, the iPad mini, Asus Zenbook, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, iPod touch, GoPro Hero 4, and in toys, Pokemon Cards, Pokemon Nintendo games and accessories, Baby Alive Doll, Frozen Backpack and DJI phantom drones More queries are coming into Shopbot.ca from mobile phones. Mobile traffic to the website more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, and is on track to increase an additional 35 per cent this year, Almeida said. Some product searches are driven more heavily by mobile than others, she said — 78 per cent of searches for Air Jordan shoes or Birkenstock sandals are made via mobile phone. At eBay in Canada, the busiest week during last year’s BTS season was the week of Sept. 13. Mobile has also been increasing in use and makes up 57 per cent of transactions globally, according to a spokesperson. Some malls are adding an experiential component to their back-to-school offerings. Dixie Outlet Mall plans to host a virtual reality adventure lounge, which will include interactive gaming and complimentary WI-FI. Guests will be able to test drive the new Samsung Gear VR. “Our shoppers’ needs are evolving and they’re looking for a more dynamic and well-rounded shopping experience,” according to spokesperson Cristina Avila. The mall, off the QEW in Mississauga, is also offering travel discounts to Enterprise Autoshare and Uber riders who make the trip to shop back-to-school.

A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. Advertisement Continue reading “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals – including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. Advertisement Continue reading “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” It states: “A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A Meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” Advertisement Continue reading According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. “It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line.” Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added. newyork-meth _____ Keywords: New York, Amherst, Walmart, meth lab, methamphetamine Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Employees packed boxes for shipping in December at a Jet.com warehouse in Swedesboro, N.J. COLE WILSON NYT i The New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Traditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them. Now Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer and the dominant player of big-box stores, is turning to someone else’s technology and talent. On Monday, the company announced it was buying Jet, the year-old online bulk retailer, for $3.3 billion, the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Wal-Mart’s clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone. “The other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, ‘You know, absolutely, we’ve been failing at doing this,’ ” said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. “Bringing in an expert might be the key to it.” Overall, Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company’s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was “too slow.” Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business. Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Wal-Mart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth. Wal-Mart said Jet offered it access to “urban and millennial customers,” two groups that the retailer’s large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Wal-Mart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country. Still, the $3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago. Wal-Mart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the start-up does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something — or someone — else: Marc Lore. Lore, an e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon’s edge. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately. Wal-Mart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet’s ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition. Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79.3 billion, while Wal-Mart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O’Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody’s. “We view this as a race for second,” O’Shea said. “Amazon’s lead is so great that it’s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:47 Questions remain about death of 10-year-old boy on water slide Pause 3:10 Energy 101: How do wind turbines work? 2:13 Chiefs rookies help distribute Thanksgiving food 3:55 KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 2:59 Still no motive in March shooting deaths of four men in Kansas City, Kan. 2:11 Mizzou's Charles Harris on senior day, NFL Draft 3:14 Chiefs QB Alex Smith explains why he wore a safety pin 1:47 Teen writes about living at home with the crack addict her mother married 0:18 Raw video: Fatality fire, 34th Terrace and Erickson Road 1:55 Gun shop pays $2.2 million to settle death case Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 13 hours ago KC Chamber recognizes Donald J.

Joshua Lott, Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email It's a well-known fact that voters do not particularly like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton: the two pols consistently have the lowest favorability ratings of any major party nominees in recent political history. But "unfavorable" doesn't quite capture the particular level of disgust some voters have for both candidates in the race this year--a fact underscored by a pair of focus groups of undecided swing-state moms Tuesday night. Asked to describe their feelings about their two major-party options, the women's responses ranged from "frustrated" and "conflicted" to "fearful" and "screwed." As one woman in Phoenix put it, the choice between Trump and Clinton is "like choosing which arm to cut off." Play Video CBSN Did Trump insinuate violence with Second Amendment comment? Donald Trump sparked outrage after he said "Second Amendment people" could stop Hillary Clinton and her future Supreme Court picks. Bob Cusack, e... "I'd pick Minnie Mouse right now" if the election were today, said Ivania L, a radiation safety officer from Columbus. The focus groups in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, Ariz., were part of a series of "Walmart Moms" groups, jointly run by Democratic pollster Margie Omero of Penn Schoen Berland and GOP pollster Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies since 2008. They were conducted Tuesday night and screened live for reporters in Washington, D.C. "Walmart moms" are predominantly white, 18- to 44-year-old women children who have shopped at Walmart at least once in the last month--and they're representative of a swing demographic that makes up roughly 14 to 17 percent of the American electorate. These women largely voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but chose Republicans in the 2010 midterms; of the 20 women who attended both groups Tuesday, all have said they are undecided in the 2016 race. "What you get here is an incredible frustration with the campaign--they feel irritated, they're tired of the candidates," Newhouse said of the focus groups, adding that the women are "disgusted" by their choice in November. And unlike in past elections, both Trump and Clinton have almost universal name ID--meaning that not only did the women in Columbus and Phoenix know a lot about each candidate, but they had pretty strong opinions about both of them. On Trump, the one-word descriptions women offered up included "racist," "derogatory" and "petty." "He kind of acts like a 2-year-old," said Lukisha H., a teacher from Phoenix. "I have a 2-year-old--I see the similarities." "He's a jerk," said Ruth P., a client services specialist from Columbus. "To call a woman a 'fat pig' on national television--yeah, you're doing that intentionally." Though some of the women admitted that they liked his brashness, they also felt it would inevitably get him--and the country--in trouble. "I think his weakness is his mouth," said Donna G., a clinic manager from Columbus. "To me he has no filter ... when you're in a political office that high, I think it could be a huge issue with him on all levels." As for Clinton? The word that kept coming up is the same one that has consistently dogged her in national polling: "untrustworthy." The various Clinton scandals that have been swept under the rug are so numerous, said Linda C. from Phoenix, that it's hard to keep track of them all: "There's so much stuffed under there they can't even lay the carpet down flat now," she quipped. "I think she lies about things, and big things," said Maria S., a homemaker in Columbus. Julie, an office administrator, replied: "I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot." The women also seized on the scandal over Clinton's email practices as proof that she considers herself above the law. "If anybody else did that, they would have lost their job," said Anita A., a health analyst from Columbus. Mary H., a retired cable TV sales representative from Columbus, was more blunt: "She's a cold-hearted b**ch," she said. While many of the moms felt the country was headed in generally the right direction, many feared for the future when a new president takes office--whether it's Clinton or Trump. "Really either way the future's going to be harder," said Stephanie C., a customer service representative from Phoenix. "I see more damage to the economy if Hillary is elected, an increase in terrorism ... but I think Trump would get us right into World War 3." © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Kroger has nearly 3,000 stores, more than 120 of which are Marketplace stores.  We went to three Marketplace stores in the Richmond, Virginia area to check them out. Here's what we found. The store is massive. This image shows only one quarter of the front of the buildings. Kroger Marketplace stores are typically 100,000 to 145,000 square feet  which is about three quarters of the size of a Walmart Supercenter. Business Insider Stepping inside, shoppers are greeted by the fresh produce department. Business Insider It's one of the biggest departments in the entire store, and it's meticulously organized. Business Insider Starbucks is nearby so you can grab a drink before you shop. Business Insider Just beyond the produce department, there are several prepared food counters like this one, where three chefs are behind the counter rolling sushi. Business Insider The "fresh meals" kitchen features all kinds of customizable dishes, including pizza, sandwiches, and burrito bowls made to order. Business Insider Some pizzas are pre-made, but you can customize anything. Business Insider Here's a closer look at part of the menu. Business Insider You can order your food using touch-screen kiosks. Business Insider Or grab it to go from the salad bar. Business Insider There are self-checkout registers near the prepared food counters so people grabbing lunch or dinner don't have to wait in long lines. Business Insider The store also cuts down on lines by setting out freshly sliced deli meat to go. Business Insider There's a drink bar if you're dining in... Business Insider ... and the dine-in seating area features flat-screen televisions, a fireplace, and lounge chairs. Business Insider Back in the main part of the store, there's a giant wine selection that stretches across four aisles. This department features 500 types of beer and nearly 2,000 types of wine. Business Insider There's also a wine bar with craft beers on tap. Business Insider Here's a closer look at the wine bar. Business Insider The bakery has some cool gadgets like this self-service bread slicer. Business Insider Like everything else in this store, the meat department is huge. Business Insider Check out that meat selection. It goes on forever. Business Insider There are all kinds of kitchen appliances... Business Insider ...from standing mixers to microwaves, mini refrigerators, and blenders. Business Insider The store even offers a selection of home goods. Business Insider There are lots of decorative items like picture frames and vases... Business Insider ...as well as more useful things like silverware sets and cutting boards. Business Insider One aisle is devoted to towels and bathroom accessories, such as soap dispensers and trash cans. Business Insider Stylish pillows and baskets are for sale... Business Insider ...and there's a small selection of rugs. Business Insider A few aisles are stocked with college dorm decorations. Business Insider Futons and bean-bag chairs are featured. Business Insider The fashion department offers clothes and accessories. It's nearly the same size as the produce department. Business Insider It offers back-to-school items like backpacks. Business Insider ...and a large selection of sneakers, heeled shoes, and flip-flops. Business Insider Everything is affordable. Most pairs of shoes are under $20. Business Insider There are workout clothes including sports bras and running shorts. Business Insider And more fashionable tops and dresses. Business Insider There's also an aisle devoted to accessories like scarves and handbags. Business Insider A fitting room is on site for anyone who wants to try the clothes on. Business Insider If you get tired while walking around the store (and you probably will) there are several benches to take a rest. Business Insider You can even buy a bike. Business Insider There's an emergency clinic offering health care... Business Insider ...and a jewelry store. Business Insider There's also a toy department. Business Insider And on your way out, you can pick up some outdoor furniture.

VIDEOS TOP JOBS Three grant-funded tech firms to talk about their progress Three tech companies that received state grants designed to help them bring cutting-edge technologies to market will provide updates on their work Wednesday at Church & State, 370 S. 300 East, in Salt Lake City. About 150 members of the startup and investment communities are expected to attend the 3:30-6 p.m. event along with a dozen tech entrepreneurs and Val Hale, executive director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development, whose Technology Commercialization and Innovation program provided the grants to: • PK Clean, a Salt Lake City company trying to eliminate plastic waste from the landfill, creating clean energy diesel fuel along the way; • Homie, a company that has raised $4 million in establishing a "peer-to-peer real estate marketplace" designed to save clients money by eliminating middle men; and • MesaGen, a company fighting cancer at its roots through MesaNet, a $50 million database of "proprietary human protein fragments."

Sugarmont Dr. Through its Xfinity Internet Essentials program, "Comcast and Boys & Girls Clubs have teamed up to bridge the digital divide for at-risk youth," said Boys & Girls Clubs spokeswoman Amanda Hughes. The computer labs will help integrate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities into existing afterschool and summer programs. "We are obligated to make sure that kids and teens are prepared with the tools and resources needed to compete in this ever-changing, technologically driven world," said Merlin Jensen, Comcast's vice president of operations.

An amazing discussion that kicked off with big deal of the week, Walmart snapping up Jet.com for $3b, that crackled on to Google, the government, anti-trust, the entire U.S. debt problem, the Chinese Market, the very future of energy (featuring, naturally, Elon), and the latest in startup CEOs behaving badly. And more. [ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): http://ctt.ec/00i8b ] Subscribe in iTunes: http://bit.ly/TWiSTAV And watch here! Some key discussions M&A The big deal of week is Jet.com being bought for $3B by Walmart. What’s behind the deal? Walmart.com has been around since 2000 and has never bridged the gap with Amazon, remaining the #2 player in e-commerce. Could Jet.com & CEO Marc Lore be the answer? Politics & Google What’s the story of Google, the White House, and anti-trust? Google was investigated on anti-trust grounds by the FTC, but ultimately, the decision was made against pursuing any anti-trust case. The Obama administration has been pro-tech and pro-Google. And lobbying works — both parties have been fairly reluctant to launch any anti-trust campaign within technology in the US. Debt in economy Debt-to-GDP in the economy, even after some of the de-leveraging from 2009, is still at a level that is “mind-boggling.” The problem is in private debt (corporate, student loan, credit card, mortgage debt). Is this why millennials do not accumulate assets? Where do we go from here? Bad behavior Using the recent Hampton Creek controversy as a starting point, the panelists debate questionable CEO startup behavior of late. When Silicon Valley prioritizes growth over everything, yet any appearance of impropriety IS impropriety, where is that line … exactly? Elon Musk & the future How much do you want the future to arrive early? Elon would like the world to solve global warming and get off fossil fuels in his lifetime. But we have to decide as a society where to allocate funds. Is there a sustainable, bull market in electric- & self-driving cars? And when you factor in all of the capital and regulatory requirements required, do you bet on Tesla? (or Apple? Google?).

World NEWSPAPERS Boca Raton Folsom Orange County St Augustine Vero Beach Published:August 10th, 2016 13:26 EST Meth Lab Discovered in Sewer Under Walmart Parking Lot By Robert Paul Reyes "Police, fire and hazmat crews are investigating a suspected meth lab found in a sewer under the parking lot of the Walmart on Sheridan and Bailey Monday afternoon. WGRZ Is anyone surprised that there`s a sewer underneath a Walmart store? Walmart is a blight on America, it destroys local competition from mom and pop stores, and sells toxic wares from China. What a perfect location for a meth lab: In a sewer underneath the parking lot of a Walmart store. A smart businessman sets up shop where his customers are located, Walmart shoppers thrive on cheap merchandise and cheap meth. The chemicals used in making meth are more dangerous than the germs that live in sewers -- any idiot who buys meth deserves to lose all his teeth, brain cells and money.

Walmart To Stop Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 300 Additional Stores Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart To Stop Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 300 Additional Stores August 10, 2016 2:02 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No price-match here trying to save more walmart price match savings rollbacks Making Changes expanding the changes Back in May, Walmart announced that 500 of its stores in the U.S. would stop in-store price matching ads from local competitors. Despite assurances that it had no plans to expand its no-price-matching policy, the retailer has quietly ditched the service at 300 additional stores.  Consumerist reader Jeffrey tipped us off to the possibility that the big box retailer was discontinuing the policy at additional stores when he recently noticed signs at his local Walmart. Because Walmart refused to indicate what stores were affected by the policy change in May, it was unclear if his store was part of the initial change. A rep for Walmart confirmed that as of August 1, 300 more stores across the country had stopped allowing customers to price match local ads at the register. “Because we believe you don’t have to trade down or sacrifice quality to save money, customers are finding new savings in select markets as we lower prices on our assortment of national brands and quality private brand items they want,” the rep said in a roundabout way of confirming the additional stores changing their policies. Under the outgoing policy, Walmart allowed customers to bring in local competitors’ ads and if the prices were lower for a product, they would be able to purchase that item at the cheaper price. Since Walmart still isn’t saying which stores — or even which regions — are affected by this policy change, the only way for customers to know if they can’t price-match is when they get to the store. The changes are being announced in-store with blue signs at registers — like those seen by Jeffrey — and managers will be on hand to assist customers. Again, the rep tells Consumerist that in lieu of the Ad Match program, the 800 stores will offer new “significant, long-term” rollbacks on thousands of items that were commonly price-matched, including consumables, groceries, paper products, and other products. “We understand Ad Match provided an additional layer of reassurance for customers,” the rep said. “That’s why we’re working hard to deliver upfront low prices that customers can trust every day of the week.” August 10, 2016 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No price-match here trying to save more walmart price match savings rollbacks Making Changes expanding the changes Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related No price-match here Walmart Ending Price Matching Of Local Competitors’ Ads At 500 Stores; Won’t Say Which 500 getting money back Amazon Stops Price-Matching Everything But TVs, So Here’s Your Guide To Other Retailers’ Policies how low can you go?

Focus groups of "Walmart moms" -- women who have at least one child under 18 living at home and who have shopped at Walmart in the past month -- observed by reporters on Tuesday painted an overwhelmingly negative picture of the campaign, with participants calling it a choice between the "lesser of two evils." The 20 middle-class mothers gathered in Phoenix, Arizona, and Columbus, Ohio, used terms like "nauseating" and "painful" to describe the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One woman simply said the choice made her feel "screwed."

The women, mostly in their 30s and 40s, were a mix of undecided voters and those leaning slightly towards supporting one of the major party candidates. In Phoenix, five women said they favored Clinton, two for Trump and three undecided. In Columbus, three said they were for Trump, two for Clinton, and five said they were open to a third-party candidate, despite knowing little about the alternative choices. However, 19 of the 20 said they believe Clinton will win, with one undecided. The reason most gave was Trump's mouth. "I think he's going to do something between now and November to really shoot himself in the foot," said Connie, an unemployed mother of two who participated in the Phoenix group. The focus groups, organized by Democratic firm Penn Schoen Berland and Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies, were meant to gauge the thinking of what has become a coveted voting bloc. "Walmart moms" have supported the winning candidate or party in every election since 2008, except in 2014 when the broke for Democrats in the midterms. Though a number of the women said they would be open to supporting a third-party candidate, most said they knew little to nothing about Libertarian Gary Johnson. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and newly announced independent candidate Evan McMullin went unmentioned.

Bill Weld. The mistake went unnoticed. Women in both group's struggled to come up with positives for Clinton and Trump, often framing their attributes in a negative light. Mentions of Clinton's years of experience often led to questions about her honesty. "I think they're all liars, but she gets caught a lot," Julie, an undecided voter in Columbus, said. Another said the former secretary of state has swept so much under the rug " they can't even lay the carpet down flat now." Trump's experience in business led to discussions about his lack of experience in politics and, ultimately, his temperament. "He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old, I see the similarities," said Deanna, a mother of four in Phoenix. Just as telling were the Olympic sports the participants paired with the candidates as a moment of levity during what were mostly pessimistic discussions. Four of the women in Phoenix associated Clinton with fencing because, as one participant said: "She would stab you in the back." Another said Trump could be a swimmer because he's "trying to stay afloat." These voters said that, at least for now, the negativity has not impacted their views of the competitive Senate races in both Ohio and Arizona. None of the women said that how Republican Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio, or Sen. John McCain, Arizona, handle being on the ticket with Donald Trump would impact their views. However, GOP pollster Neil Newhouse cautioned that could change closer to Election Day as Democrats put more effort into tying Trump to down ballot Republicans. "Once Democrats start linking them to everything Donald Trump has ever said or done, that could change," he said.

The people responsible had to travel 244 metres from the culvert’s opening to reach the apparent lab, which was discovered beneath a Walmart store.  (MIKE BLAKE / REUTERS File Photo)   By Lindsey BeverThe Washington Post Wed., Aug. 10, 2016 A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 3.6 metres under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. Article Continued Below “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York state Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York state, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A Meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about 6.4 kilometres from Walmart. “It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line.” Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers travelled some 244 metres from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added.

He said he had a woman at his home and she asked him for a hot dog while they were watching TV. He said he went downstairs to make a hot dog and when he returned, the woman, his car and house keys and wallet were gone. He then discovered the vehicle missing. He said the wallet included $380 cash and credit cards. He only knew the woman by her first name and said she was between 25 and 30-years-old. Officers called a phone number he had for her, but the voice mail was full. The man was advised to change the locks on the house. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 46, was arrested at Walmart July 29 for the suspected theft of two TVs and a computer, valued at a total of $1,045. He said he did not have a receipt for the items but was there to return them. He also gave a false identity and was cited for falsification. He was found to have several active warrants in South Euclid. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: Two East Cleveland women, 20 and 21, were arrested at Walmart Aug. 3 for the theft of $204.35 worth of women's clothing, shoes and underwear. They bagged the items in the self-checkout area, but did not pay for them. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 44, was arrested at Walmart around 4:15 a.m. July 29 for trespassing and the suspected theft of a pair of shoes and five pairs of pants. He was wearing the stolen pair of shoes and a pair of worn shoes was found in the shoe aisle. He had been arrested at the store in July and served a trespass notice at that time. The total value of the theft was $101.68. Criminal damage, Eastway Road: Something was thrown through the front window of a home at 2:30 p.m. July 31, causing damage. The resident said he looked outside but did not see anyone in the area. Officers believed the damage could have been caused by a BB. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Newburg Heights woman, 28, was arrested at Walmart Aug. 1 for the suspected theft of $688.33 worth of grocery, laundry and clothing items. An employee said she under-rang massive amounts of merchandise at the self-checkout section of the store. Impaired driving, South Belvoir Boulevard: Officers responded to a report at 6 a.m. July 30 of a vehicle that had crashed in a resident's front yard. The driver was located walking away from the accident and identified as a 31-year-old South Euclid man. He said a deer may have caused him to lose control of the vehicle. He was subsequently arrested for hit-skip, driving under suspension and operating a vehicle while impaired. His driving history showed six previous OVI convictions, including four in the last six years. He told officers he likes to drink and said he did not feel drunk at the time of the crash. Impaired driving, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights man, 29, was arrested for operating a vehicle while impaired after he was stopped at 1:37 a.m. July 30 for driving without illuminated headlights. He was taken to Hillcrest Hospital for a blood draw, but refused to allow it. While there, he made several comments about displaying his genitals to the female staff and at one point urinated on the floor of his room. He was also cited for obstructing official business and failure to comply with the order of a police officer. Fraud, Haywood Drive: A woman reported July 29 she received a welcome packet in the mail from a credit union and learned there was a savings and checking account fraudulently opened in her name. After discovering this, she ran a credit report and found a credit card had also been fraudulently opened in her name. There was no monetary loss associated with the incident and there are no suspects. Driving under suspension, Warrensville Center Road: Officers located a disabled vehicle at 10:43 p.m. Aug. 3 and found the driver was changing two tires that had blown out. It was learned the Cleveland man, 43, had 13 open driving suspensions and warrants with Highland Hills and Cleveland Heights police. One large bag and two small bags of marijuana were found inside the vehicle, along with a scale. The man was cited for driving under suspension, drug abuse and possession of drug paraphernalia. Unwanted guest, Warrensville Center Road: At 1:51 a.m. Aug. 1, officers responded to an apartment for a report of a woman who was asked to leave by her boyfriend and his mother, but refused. She told officers she was a tenant, but she was reminded her name was not on the lease and she had been given a trespass warning in March. She eventually collected some of her belongings and then left the building. At 3:48 a.m., officers returned to the apartment after the residents said the woman returned and threw an object through a window and slashed three tires on one of their vehicles. They found her drinking a beer in the area and returned her to the station, where she became belligerent and verbally assaulted officers. At one point, she pulled her pants down and exposed herself to officers and kicked and punched officers, causing injuries to several of them. The South Euclid woman, 36, was charged with assault on a police officer, open container, criminal trespass and criminal damaging. She was subsequently taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Reports indicate she also removed all of her clothing while in the booking area and defecated on the bench and floor. Theft, Mayfield Road: A shoplifter ran from Giant Eagle July 30 and was subsequently located hiding behind a couch in a resident's garage on South Green Road. The stolen items, valued at a total of $90.37, were found in her purse and on the ground near the garage. It was later learned the Cleveland woman, 53, had bed bugs after seeing scars on her legs and arms. She was cited for theft and given a trespass warning. She had active warrants with several agencies, but none were able to take her into custody. Littering, South Belvoir Road: A woman reported July 28 seeing a man throw an empty beer can into a resident's yard as he walked along the sidewalk. She had previously seen him do the same thing so she followed him and took a photo. Officers located the South Euclid man, 67, who admitted throwing the can onto a front yard. He was cited for littering. See more South Euclid news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest. If you would like to discuss the police blotter, please visit our crime and courts comments page.

Each year she and her family take a day to shop together and this year it was at Toronto Eaton Centre. Before school starts in September, Owen’s mom will take a family picture on the front steps of their home, which she has done every year since Owen started school. “It’s fun to have that tradition,” said Owen, a Ryerson student. The bulk of back-to-school shopping in the GTA takes place closer to Labour Day weekend, but for many retailers and shoppers, it has already begun. Article Continued Below Back-to-school traffic at Cadillac Fairview malls, which includes the Eaton Centre, Fairview and Sherway Gardens, is second only to the holiday season, according to spokesperson Vanessa Jenkins. August is a peak month for shopping and the third-busiest shopping month of the year, after November and December, with 75 per cent of families making their back-to-school purchases in that time, said Jenkins. Mall traffic at Cadillac Fairview properties was up 4 per cent in 2015, over the previous year, and sales per pedestrian were up 8 per cent in the period. On average, Canadian parents are expecting to spend $461 on their children this back-to-school season, including school supplies and clothing — $132 more than last year’s average, which was $329, according to a survey conducted by retailmenot.ca. But while the average spend for an elementary school student is expected to be $318, it’s expected to be $412 for high school students and $1,630 for university students, reflecting the higher cost of setting up a dorm room and study space. “Right now, our top purchases online include mini fridges, mattresses and TVs (this is more of a back-to-campus shop) as well as stationery items such as notebooks,” said Felicia Fefer, manager of marketing and public relations for Walmart Canada. The bulk of back-to-school shopping will take place in-store, said Fefer, but Walmart is seeing a significant growth of orders on walmart.ca and through the mobile app. Walmart began marketing back-to-school in July. “We are ready when customers are ready to shop for BTS and there are always early shoppers,” said Fefer. Price is the most important consideration for shoppers, Fefer said. Walmart is projecting that Canadians will spend approximately $500 on average, on back-to-school shopping. Walmart is seeking to expand its back-to-school business with a collection of recipes and shopping lists to reach out to trying to save time on meal preparation during the school year. Some retailers at Yorkdale Mall have begun back-to-school sales but the busiest weekend is Labour Day weekend, said general manager Claire Santamaria. “Mid-August, that’s when we start to see our traffic patterns start to increase, especially around the weekends,” said Santamaria. Retailers are targeting parents on Facebook and using Twitter and Instagram to promote products to students. “We’ve had a really good year-to-date, so, if we continue the trends that we’ve been seeing this year, then yes, it will be better than next year,” said Santamaria. “If you want to get what you want, now is a good time to do it.” Back-to-school shopping queries on the comparison-price website Shopbot.ca began trending upwards before the middle of July, two weeks earlier than last year, according to spokesperson Lia Almeida. Sought-after products include: Birkenstock sandals, Nike Air Max shoes, Adidas Superstar shoes, the iPad mini, Asus Zenbook, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, iPod touch, GoPro Hero 4, and in toys, Pokemon Cards, Pokemon Nintendo games and accessories, Baby Alive Doll, Frozen Backpack and DJI phantom drones More queries are coming into Shopbot.ca from mobile phones. Mobile traffic to the website more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, and is on track to increase an additional 35 per cent this year, Almeida said. Some product searches are driven more heavily by mobile than others, she said — 78 per cent of searches for Air Jordan shoes or Birkenstock sandals are made via mobile phone. At eBay in Canada, the busiest week during last year’s BTS season was the week of Sept. 13. Mobile has also been increasing in use and makes up 57 per cent of transactions globally, according to a spokesperson. Some malls are adding an experiential component to their back-to-school offerings. Dixie Outlet Mall plans to host a virtual reality adventure lounge, which will include interactive gaming and complimentary WI-FI. Guests will be able to test drive the new Samsung Gear VR. “Our shoppers’ needs are evolving and they’re looking for a more dynamic and well-rounded shopping experience,” according to spokesperson Cristina Avila. The mall, off the QEW in Mississauga, is also offering travel discounts to Enterprise Autoshare and Uber riders who make the trip to shop back-to-school. What Canadians are planning to buy for back-to-school, according to Retailmenot.ca: 80 per cent said clothes 75 per cent said shoes 74 per cent said school supplies 61 per cent said back packs 44 per cent said textbooks 20 per cent said beauty and grooming products Read more about: Walmart, Eaton Centre The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. “I was completely astounded,” Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. “It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. “Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new.” Story continues below advertisement. Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a “preventative patrol,” according to CBS affiliate WIVB. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” Amherst police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station. “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good,” he added. Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including “a liquid we believe is methamphetamine.” But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” Chamberlin told the station. “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police.” Investigators plan to see whether Wal-Mart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such “clandestine laboratories.” It states: “A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present.” Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are “highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties” and that the chemicals used in them are “extremely toxic.” “A meth lab can be located anywhere,” it states. “The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests.” According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about 4 miles from Wal-Mart. “It’s a concern. I mean, it’s unbelievable in this area. This isn’t a bad area,” Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery. “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this — that’s the bottom line.” Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. “They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically,” Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. “They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark.” Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. “It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous,” Lucey told the Buffalo News. “Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation.” “Certainly, they weren’t thinking,” he added.   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Cargill stops using human antibiotic to prevent disease in turkeys Next story:Parents who insist on vegan diet for children may risk jail in Italy » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Bath-built destroyer breaks down, towed out of Panama Canal Bangor police explain why woman not charged in possible hate crime assault St. Clair: $40M in private funds ‘go away’ if monument abolished Texas man summoned in Smyrna hit and run crash State police search for suspect in Smyrna hit-and-run ‘Hamilton’ and the implosion of the American left Where are the voices of indigenous people in the Thanksgiving story?

DEPRIEST Associate Editor The Haz Mat Team from the Clarence Fire Company responded Monday to the scene of a reported meth lab in the sewers beneath the Walmart store at Sheridan Drive and Bailey Avenue in Amherst. Also involved were the Eggertsville Hose Company, Brighton Fire Company and Buffalo Fire Department. Photo by David F. Sherman. Purchase color photos atwww.BeeNews.com Amherst police are currently investigating an apparent illegal drug lab housed within a sewer line underneath a Walmart parking lot. According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. The detective said that at as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody as they were working to pursue leads in the case based on evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether or not there may be other hidden labs in the immediate area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m. Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311. email: kdepriest@beenews.com Return to top Clarence Special Events 2016 Click for schedule Browse Archives

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Kathy Gilsinan Aug 10, 2016 Global Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Just days after I interviewed the legal scholar Rosa Brooks about her book on her time as a civilian advisor in President Barack Obama’s Pentagon, the United States bombed Libya again. This was the third such strike in the U.S. campaign against ISIS there, but this time, Reuters reported, U.S. officials said it “marked the start of a sustained air campaign.” Still, it was hard to tell how much of a turning point it really was. Small numbers of American special-operations forces have been active in the country since late last year, ostensibly to support local partners against ISIS, though details are vague. By launching more airstrikes at the beginning of August, America was not so much opening up a new front in its war on the group as maintaining an existing one. And it wasn’t so much changing tactics as amplifying them. Did this mean that the United States somehow became more “at war” in Libya last week than it had been the week before? For that matter, as U.S. planes have accelerated their bombing campaign against militants in Afghanistan this summer, and President  Obama has vowed to leave some 8,000 troops there through the end of his term, is the United States any less “at war” there than when U.S. combat operations in the country officially ended in December 2014? What about  in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, where U.S. drones have killed thousands of people outside of what the government considers “areas of active hostilities”? Related Story The Drone War Crosses Another Line Brooks’s new book, How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything, is about the limits of categories like these, just as much as it’s about war and the American military. Brooks, a writer and law professor at Georgetown University, bases her account in part on her two-plus years at the Defense Department, where she observed the blurring of the line, in her words, “between war and not-war.” The Pentagon, she writes, is on the one hand a “vast, bureaucratic, death-dealing enterprise;” on the other, the U.S. military operates in “nearly every country on earth” and in many cases its activities have nothing to do with shooting at bad guys. Its personnel, she notes, have been involved in everything from Ebola response in Liberia to agricultural reform in Afghanistan to health care in Malaysia. The range of their work is as remarkable as it is unsettling. If the U.S. military’s job is to protect America’s own security, why is it doing all of these things? Brooks contends that the amorphous nature of modern security threats—conflict and terrorism, but also things like climate change and financial collapse—have made it “increasingly difficult to define a uniquely ‘military’ role and mission.” It’s not just that the Bush and Obama administrations’ pursuit of terrorists around the world have pushed the geographic boundaries of the so-called war on terror beyond the more formal battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. It’s also that, as the military has sucked up an increasing share of America’s foreign-policy resources in the post-9/11 era, the Pentagon has become “like a Super Walmart with everything under one roof,” as retired General David Barno tells Brooks. “Like Walmart,” she writes, “the military can marshal vast resources and exploit economies of scale in ways impossible for mom-and-pop operations. And like Walmart, the tempting one-stop-shopping convenience it offers has a devastating effect on smaller, more traditional enterprises—in this case, the State Department and other civilian foreign policy agencies.” I spoke to Brooks recently about war, peace, and the space in between. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation. Kathy Gilsinan: The lines between “war and non-war are growing indistinct,” as you say. As a very basic question, what is war? And do you know it when you see it? Rosa Brooks: I think we have absolutely no idea what war is. I think everything that frightens us, we now label war, more or less. And that’s a problem. As an analytic category, [war] has lost any clarity it might once have had. Gilsinan: Are there any common features to things that are war-like? Brooks: They run the gamut, and they have fewer and fewer common features. We look at Syria and we say, “Oh look, there’s war.” And that’s the sort of traditional understanding of war. Lots of people who are shooting each other, blowing each other up, generally killing each other. But we also are thinking of cyber [operations], more and more, primarily through the framework of war. We look at terrorism through the framework of war. Already some of our thinking about what we call “illicit transnational actors”—not terrorists, but groups like narco-smugglers and traffickers—[is] beginning to get framed as part of war and war-like stuff. When we think of sort of the classic understanding of war that we’ve had in Western society, it owes a huge amount to [Carl von] Clausewitz, the 19th-century Prussian military strategist whose very famous definition of war was: “War is the continuation of politics by other means.” But Clausewitz was really clear what those “other means” had to include, and Clausewitz’s understanding of war was that it had several defining facts that differentiated it from other kinds of competitions or conflicts that weren’t war. So, to Clausewitz, war is organized, it’s violent, it’s on a mass scale—not an individual scale—and it is for the pursuit of political ends. For Clausewitz, a game of chess is not war, because it’s individual, not violent, and it has no political ends. A rugby match where people end up with bloody noses and broken arms is not war, because although it’s organized, it also has no political ends. A barroom brawl is not war, because it’s not organized, and it has no political ends. Economic competition between states, however fierce, is not war, because it’s not bloody—it’s mass, it’s organized, and political—but it’s not violent. “We live in a world where technology has enabled individuals to cause a level of disruption that it might once have taken war to achieve.” In the terms of Clausewitz, where you have mass armies of thousands and thousands of people, and single battles that are killing tens of thousands of people, terrorism is small potatoes. But increasingly, we’ve got these things that, they’re not mass, they may not be organized, the political ends are sometimes unclear, and yet we’re calling them war. It’s not completely crazy that we want to, since we now live in a world where technology has enabled both states and even individuals to cause a level of disruption that it might once, 100 years ago, have taken war to achieve. So on some level, why not call it war if it sort of does what war does? On the other hand, Clausewitz would not have recognized [it], if you said “We’re at war with terrorism.” He would have just said, “Whatever you’re doing is not war.” Gilsinan: I see how terrorists aren’t, under the Clausewitzian definition, doing acts of war on the United States, but the United States’s “war on terror” is organized, violent, on a mass scale, and for the pursuit of— Brooks: We’re certainly responding with something that looks more like war. It’s just not all that clear that it’s entirely reciprocal. Could you have a war if only one party knows it’s a war? I don’t know how that fits into the Clausewitzian framework. Gilsinan: Do you have in mind a glory era in which the lines were totally clear—[an American] war started when Congress declared it and ended with a signed peace agreement between the combatants? Or are there ways in which we’ve seen this continuum, rather than binary, between war and not war? There was never a peace agreement when the fighting stopped after the Korean War in 1953. Brooks: The line between war and not war has never been as clear as international lawyers sometimes like to pretend it is—that we have this nice, neat framework that says wars have beginnings and ends; there are places that are at war; there are places that are neutral. There are combatants; there are civilians. You can kill the combatants, you can’t kill the civilians, end of story. And it’s never been that neat, obviously. On the margins at least, there have always been actors who didn’t quite fit—partisans, guerrillas, countries that were technically not at war but where there was a lot of proxy war activity going on. The categories were never perfect; they were always somewhat arbitrary. But now the exceptions have kind of overwhelmed the rule. Gilsinan: “Now” being in the post-September 11th era? Brooks: Very much so. September 11th itself didn’t create this world, but it’s both the symbolic beginning and a dramatic acceleration of a lot of trends that had been out there already. Gilsinan: Which is interesting, because that era, in terms of the U.S. response, was kicked off with the more classic, interstate wars. You invaded Afghanistan, you invaded Iraq. Brooks: Absolutely. And it was in some ways an illustration of our difficulty in thinking beyond the framework of traditional state-on-state conflict. Like there we were, confronted by something very different—an attack that didn’t involve traditional weapons, by a non-army, from multiple different nationalities. But the only thing we could figure out how to do to respond was go and invade a bunch of states. Gilsinan: Then it sounds like the categories weren’t necessarily a good thing. Brooks: They certainly limited our imagination, but I don’t know if I’d characterize it quite that way, because we had a choice. It was not inevitable that the 9/11 attacks would be categorized as starting a war in a legal sense. They could have been categorized as crime, they could have been categorized as in between—it’s not quite a war, not quite a crime, [so] we’re going to do some stuff that’s in between. It was not that there were no alternative categories available, it was that the Bush administration was not interested in using them. And I am not sure of the extent to which they themselves thought through the long-term implications of choosing to call it war—I think some did, some didn’t—but they sent us down one path, when other paths were available. “All these categories we’ve been talking about—war, peace, conflict, combatant, military—we made them up.” Gilsinan: When you went in [to the Pentagon] versus when you came out, what would you say was the biggest difference in your thinking about what war means? Brooks: I was both impressed and somewhat terrified by the dawning awareness that the Pentagon does everything. If you go in with a bit of a stereotype of, the military shoots guns and blows stuff up, and then you find yourself in meetings with military officials who are talking about running a program to prevent sexual violence in the Congo, and doing a big research project on how you most effectively dissuade foreign militaries from using sexual violence during conflict, and then you walk into another meeting and people are talking about how to promote micro-enterprise among Afghan women, it’s both kind of amazing and inspiring—that there’s this unbelievably diverse set of talents and people [and] projects. It’s amazing that the U.S. can still marshal so much talent and idealism. At the same time, it’s kind of scary, because you think, “Wait, whoa, is this the right place? Do we know what we’re doing? And what happens to the military as an institution when we’re asking it and expecting it to be all things to all people?” Gilsinan: What does happen? Brooks: Well, we’ll find out. It’s a big experiment, and I think there are several possibilities. There’s a bad for the military, bad for the world possibility, and here’s what that one looks like: The U.S. military does everything, but it’s doing a lot of stuff that people weren’t trained to do, does it badly, that has bad effects on the lives of human beings all over the world. It also decreases U.S. credibility, because what the world sees as the face of the U.S. is the military. It’s a uniformed figure, which has bad ramifications for civil-military relations worldwide and for democracy. Meanwhile, the military as an institution is demoralized and less effective because we’re trying to force one institution to do too many things. [There is a] more interesting possibility. All these categories we’ve been talking about—war, peace, conflict, combatant, military—we made them up. They didn’t come down from a divine power. This invites us to radically rethink what it is we want from our institutions, and how to organize them. And if the military is not doing these things well, but we think the United States needs to do them, and if we think it’s not realistic that the State Department or USAID starts doing them again or doing them well, it invites us to say, why shouldn’t we have a radically different military that combines within it a whole spectrum of activities, from traditional war-fighting to things that we think of as more peace-building and development? Why not really change how we think of the military, and change how we recruit, change our training, to make this an institution that does those things, does them well, and does them accountably? And that would be really hard. I think most people both in the military and outside of it sort of recoil at that and tend to want to go back to the much simpler “Well, shouldn’t the military just fight?” I don’t know if that’s even possible anymore. Gilsinan: [We’re discussing] the dangers of this blurring of the line between war and not war. And yet there are fewer people dying in wars now than in the World War II era, when the boundaries were pretty clear, even if not completely clear. So on the one hand, the U.S. military is in maybe more countries than ever before, almost every country on earth. On the other, the worldwide level of killing going on is substantially lower than [at] almost any time in history. If the long-term trend is in this positive direction, how much should we worry about the categories? Brooks: I think those are separate questions. I don’t think they necessarily have a whole lot to do with each other. But I also would question whether we have a long-term trend. In the sweep of human history, 50 or 60 years is not a long-term trend, and I do worry about that. Of course it’s good that we, over the last few decades, have seen a reduction in the number of people dying in violent conflict around the globe, but on the other hand, the world we live in remains extraordinarily dangerous in many, many ways, including some quite new ways, driven by technology—the speed at which epidemics can move around the world has increased due to changes in transportation technologies, the speed at which economic disruption can move around the globe because of changes in electronic technologies, et cetera. And, by the way, there are very many thousands of nuclear warheads and old-fashioned sources of destruction. So I’m not all that comfortable when people say, “Oh, happy, happy news, interstate conflict and death have dropped in the last few decades.” There have been plenty of other decades in world history where you’ve gotten a few decades, a hundred years, or a few hundred years of relative cessation in violence, only to have new catastrophes. I am very, very skeptical of claims that what we have is a long-term trend, as opposed to saying we have no idea whether this continues or not, and lots of things could destabilize it. “The Russians have been very creative about operating in that space between war and peace in ways that have been very hard for the West to respond to.” Gilsinan: One of the things that could destabilize it is the expansion of the U.S. military all over the world and the tendency to view everything that scares us, as you say, in terms of war. Brooks: When you build up a national and international legal system where our ability to constrain power and coercion are very much linked to the creation of this particular set of legal and political categories—armed conflict, foreign, domestic, military, civilian—then when those categories get blurry, you lose your ability to effectively constrain power. But that’s not the same thing as saying the answer is necessarily to shore up the categories again. The categories themselves are arbitrary—what’s important is their relationship to a much broader system of consensus, of institutions, of laws, and so forth. We didn’t create these categories because there’s something magical about [them], we created these categories because they were part of a system that helped us achieve certain normative goals that have to do with the rule of law, with promoting stability and peace and so forth, and if the categories aren’t doing it, then maybe the categories don’t make sense anymore. Maybe we now live in a world in which we need an in-between category, something that’s in between war and peace, with a set of in-between implications for law and for power and for rights. Gilsinan: Are those categories Western-invented? To what extent is, say, Russia observing those categories? To what extent is China? Brooks: Every culture in the world has had some concept of war and some notion of what should be permissible and what should be prohibited during wartime, and what the distinctions are between warriors and non-warriors. In that sense, there’s nothing Western about it. In a narrower sense, sure they’re Western—the Geneva Conventions [are] what we think of the modern law of armed conflict, [and they] very much arose out of conflicts between Western states in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. I think Russia and China—partly because they’re authoritarian, which gives them the ability to move a little more rapidly because they don’t have to worry about debate or argument, and they’re less scrupulous, frankly—have been much more quick than Western states to look at the issues we’ve been talking about and say, “These categories don’t make any sense anymore, and that is an opportunity for us. We can exploit the West’s continuing insistence that the categories do make sense while we do whatever we want.” Gilsinan: The “little green men” and turning off the electricity in Ukraine. Brooks: Absolutely, the Russians have been very creative about operating in that space between war and peace in ways that have been very hard for the West to respond to, in part because they sort of confound our categories. We want to look and say, is there a war? Or is there not a war? And the answer is, well, hard to say. Gilsinan: And that opens up space—potentially dangerous space—because I think some of what constrains American policymakers is saying “Look, do we really want to start a war with Russia over Crimea?” But if there’s some in-between option, of combating Russia in Crimea or contesting the annexation of Crimea, without resorting to war but resorting to some sort of in-between category—do you see that happening already? Brooks: Not very much. I think that particularly in the special-operations community within the military, [there are] conversations about [how] we’re probably permanently in some kind of gray area between war and peace. Our adversaries are operating with comfort and creativity in that world. How do we operate in that world? I think the question is, if we’re going to be operating in that world, how do we do so while preserving our commitment to rule of law and democracy? Gilsinan: The drone war is one of these issues where you could say it represents an in-between category—we’re not at war with Pakistan, we’re not at war with Somalia. There’s a long history of soldiers trying to kill at a distance, stretching back to the ages of throwing spears and longbows and up through the age of cruise missiles. And you mention that you’re troubled by the innovation of drones but that you had trouble articulating what it is about drones in particular that was disturbing. Can you try to articulate it? Brooks: The drone war both highlights what is promising and what is frightening about some U.S. efforts to kind of operate in that in-between space. Start with the promising part: Yes, of course, we’ve always tried to find ways to kill the bad guys from a distance without risking the lives of our people. It’s not a bad thing to want to do that. It’s a good thing. Nobody thinks our troops should be engaging in hand-to-hand combat with terrorists because it’s more chivalrous or something. And also the drone strikes represent part of a trend towards the individualization of warfare, where instead of firebombing Tokyo or Dresden, which kills thousands upon thousands of people from soldiers to infants indiscriminately, we now have a technology that enables us, combined with our intelligence and surveillance resources, to be really focused in who we target and say, we’re not going to drop a bomb on cities in Syria, we’re going to bomb this guy over here. And we are pretty amazingly good at hitting that guy and nobody else—not always, no question. And I sometimes say to my friends who say “I don’t like targeted killing,” “Would you prefer untargeted killing?” Because that’s what World War II was most of the time, with catastrophic results for civilian populations. But here’s the dark side: Because it’s individualized, because it operates below the radar and it’s a technology that enables covert use of force across borders, it becomes invisible and shielded from meaningful democratic accountability, and shielded to some extent from international laws because of the deniability. This is our way of exploiting categories. The Russians use the little green men, when we use covert targeted strikes by unmanned vehicles. We then get to say, “Hey, this is just lawful wartime targeting combatants, there’s nothing new here, so leave us alone.” And yet at the same time, normally in a traditional war you know who the enemy is, you know where the battle is, and we don’t know any of those things. The claims the U.S. makes about these targeted strikes are completely non-falsifiable because they’re really not saying anything, and what little they say says, “Well, we can’t tell you who we targeted, we can’t tell you why, it’s a secret, trust us.” And that’s very, very frightening.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy.

Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

The nostalgic TV revival is a genre still in search of a purpose: Too often, shows like Arrested Development, Full House, and The X-Files have returned for no reason other than to gin up easy viewership, to appeal to those seeking to remember better days. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is the first such TV sequel that really uses the long-delayed circumstances of its existence to its advantage. There’s a smart self-awareness to the show (available on Netflix starting Friday) that goes beyond sly winks to the camera about how long it’s been since its titular mother-daughter team have appeared onscreen. Considering it could merely exist as a cheap cash-in, that A Year in the Life feels so emotionally resonant is somewhat miraculous.

DEPRIEST Associate Editor The Haz-Mat team from the Brighton Fire Company respond to the scene of a reported meth lab in the sewers beneath the Walmart store at Sheridan Drive and Bailey Avenue in Amherst on Monday. Also involved were the Eggertsville Hose Company, Clarence Fire Company and Buffalo Fire Department. Photo by David F. ShermanPurchase color photos at www.BeeNews.com Amherst police are currently investigating an apparent illegal drug lab housed within a sewer line underneath a Walmart parking lot. According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. The detective said that as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody as they were working to pursue leads in the case based on evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether or not there may be other hidden labs in the immediate area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m. Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311. email: kdepriest@beenews.com Return to top Browse Archives

As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for US$500 million in 2010. Analysts say the acquisition still won't enable Wal-Mart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed, Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Wal-Mart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. “This acquisition in tandem with its joint venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. “As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online.” As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it will incorporate some of Jet.com's “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. It is built on a pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper's home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal should help accelerate its path to profitability. McMillon said Wal-Mart customers likely will see lower prices and new brands aimed at millennials that have been carried by Jet.com. Wal-Mart customers may also have more control over creating their own basket to save money. As for perhaps merging the two sites eventually, McMillon said Wal-Mart wants to be thoughtful about how it approaches that. “This is about winning over time,” he said.

(Photo: John Zeedick, AP) Amazon.com's (AMZN) stock might be one of the hottest things going on Wall Street. The company is also worth more than any other retailer, and is the fifth most valuable U.S. company. But Amazon's bottom line is far less impressive. Despite all the attention Amazon gets from investors, ten retailers including Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), even fellow online retailer Priceline Group (PCLN) and apparel discounter TJX (TJX) are more profitable than the feared retailer hailing from the Pacific Northwest, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Amazon.com's retail dominance will be on full display this week and next as a wide variety of retailers report their quarterly results. The rapid growth of Amazon has already caused tectonic shifts in the retail business, made clear this week by Walmart's gutsy $3 billion buyout of small e-commerce player Jet. Amazon's influence is so widely watched that retailers attempt to steer clear of it and Bespoke Investment Group maintains a "Death By Amazon" index that tracks how retail stocks perform relative to Amazon (hint: Amazon is crushing them). "Three major trends affect business: globalization, demographic and technology," says Erich Joachimsthaler, CEO of brand consulting firm Vivaldi Partners Group. "These tectonic trio of shifts favor Amazon and its business model." Amazon.com's stock is outpacing the rest of retail.  (Photo: S&P Global Markets Intelligence) Bullishness for Amazon certainly isn't overlooked by investors. Thanks in part to the stock's 48% rise over the past 12 months, shares of the online retailer are trading for 191 times adjusted earnings over the past 12 months. That's five times higher than the average 36 times trailing price-earnings ratios of the other retailers in the S&P 500. But what's less known is that despite Amazon's larger-than-life image to consumers, the company's profits don't even come close to many of its retail peers. While Amazon has put Walmart on the defensive and is worth 59% more on the stock market, the nation's No. 1 retailer is actually 647% more profitable than its online rival. Walmart reported net income of $14.4 billion over the past 12 months, dwarfing the $1.9 billion reported by Amazon. USA TODAY Amazon posts fifth straight profit on Prime, cloud strength While Amazon is proud of selling just about any product imaginable, even a specialty retailer like Home Depot earns more. Home Depot's net income of $7.2 billion over the past twelve months outstrips Amazon's, even though Amazon's revenue of $120.6 billion is 33% higher than Home Depot's. Similarly, TJX, the company that operates discount apparel stores, hauled in $2.3 billion in net income over the past 12 months -- nearly 20% greater than Amazon.com's bottom line. It might be tempting to think Amazon's lower net income is a result of its online model that requires heavy tech investments. But name-your-own price online retailer Priceline.com earned $2.7 billion, 38% more than Amazon. Amazon, which started up in 1994, is far younger than its brick-and-mortar peers and famously lost billions of dollars in its early years. Still, the company generally has been profitable since 2001 despite heavy investments to expand its distribution network, and so it may be surprising how badly its earnings lag its rivals'. Make no mistake: Amazon.com's growth and momentum make it a darling with investors. The company's revenue soared 26% in the past 12 months, blowing away the average 8.8% growth of other big retailers. Walmart's top line shrunk 0.5% over the past 12 months by comparison. Eventually, retailers might get their mojo online and give Amazon.com some competition. But until then, the company's valuation continues to be larger than life even ias its profits play catch-up. "We believe the size of the market represents an opportunity for Amazon," says Tuna Amobi, analyst at S&P Global, in a report to clients. 74 CONNECTTWEET 276 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2bfby0q

It's the most expensive purchase ever of an online retailer. It's also really smart. On the surface it might seem like an odd match. Jet is barely a year old — it was founded by CEO Marc Lore, in July of 2015, after Lore had already sold another online commerce startup to Amazon for over $500 million. But despite considerable fanfare around its opening, Jet has yet to prove itself: Eighty-one percent of U.S. consumers still don't know the company exists, and Jet has been burning through cash to build out its staff, marketing, and customer base. It had to drop its $49 membership fee last October, and it doesn't anticipate becoming profitable until 2020. "If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn’t be worth what they’re paying for it," Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of venture capital research firm CB Insights, told The New York Times. But dig a little below the surface, and Jet and Walmart seem to complement each another well. Let's start with Walmart. While it remains the world's largest company by revenue — last fiscal year, it pulled in a whopping $482 billion in sales — it's still primarily a brick-and-mortar company and struggles with online retail. That's not to say it doesn't have any online presence. In fact, it's the second biggest online retailer in the U.S. The problem is that the biggest, Amazon, is so far ahead of it. Raking in over $79 billion in revenue last year, that e-commerce colossus alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in online sales in 2015. By contrast, Walmart's online sales only reached just over $13 billion in 2015, or 2.5 percent of its business. And up until now, Walmart has done very little to change this dynamic. Yes, it's been keeping pace online with Amazon, growing at 12 percent to Amazon's 13 percent over the course of last year. But Walmart's online business starts from such a massively smaller baseline that it needs to do something extraordinary to catch up. More troublingly, Walmart has stumbled recently instead: Amazon grew 31 percent in the most recent quarter, while Walmart's online business grew just 7 percent — less than half the internet retail average. And Walmart is losing out to more traditional competitors, too: Staples almost equaled Walmart's online sales last year, and Target's online business — while much smaller — has recently grown a remarkable 30 percent. Bourree Lam noted at The Atlantic that the overall world of retail may finally be reaching the tipping point where no one can ignore the online side of the business anymore: "In the past decade, Walmart has largely focused on its sales in its physical locations. But earlier this year, the company announced the closure of over 150 U.S. stores." Observers also argue that Walmart's online site just isn't as user-friendly as Amazon's. So plenty of people now see the rise of online sales as a threat to Walmart's business. The purchase of Jet and the melding of its institutional expertise with Walmart is a way to deal with all this. In fact, Lore himself will take over running Walmart's online activity once the deal goes through. Then there's Jet's side of things. While it's currently in the red, Jet is hardly the first tech startup to spend its early years focusing on growth and sales over profits, trusting the latter will come in time. Its sales in February 2016 were 50 percent higher than in September 2015. Walmart said Jet has added 400,000 shoppers monthly, and is on track to reach $1 billion in sales annually — and all of that after just one year of operation. The merger should also speed along the process by which Jet gets its finances into the black. But Jet's real value lies in the algorithm it developed, which has allowed it to price competitively against even Amazon. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar retailers that rely on bulk in their business model let you buy a whole lot of each individual item — five pounds of mayonnaise or whatnot. The idea behind Jet, rather, is to allow shoppers to buy lots of smaller items — a normal amount of mayonnaise, of toilet paper, of cleaning supplies, etc. — all in one bulk purchase. And then, the algorithm accounts for what a customer wants to buy, where they live, and which retailers have shipping capacity nearby, and uses that information to game out the cheapest way to get all those items to them. As customers add items to an order, all the items get cheaper. And as a result, Jet's been able to offer prices that are 10 to 15 percent lower than its competitors. The one wrinkle is this business model relies heavily on the suppliers — their locations, their physical infrastructure, and the ability to coordinate all those pieces. That's where Walmart comes in: It boasts an enormous physical infrastructure of stores and distribution centers, all of which can now be placed at the beck and call of Jet's algorithm. Mergers between established powerhouses and young guns are always rife with uncertainty. But at least on paper, this one looks like a perfect match. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Posted: Aug. 10, 2016 0 Comments SHARE Photos by Candace Moore Walmart will occupy the former Albertsons grocery store on U.S. 1 north of 17th Street. The 40,000-square-foot building fits with Walmart's Neighborhood Market concept. Wawa, new to Indian River County, is currently building a gas station-convenience store on the southeast corner of U. S. 1 and 8th Street. Construction will soon begin on a new retail strip center on the adjacent property to the south. Illinois-based DTS Properties recently purchased Indian River Commons from Wells Fargo Bank for $16.5 million. Simon Property Group lost this shopping center and Indian River Mall in foreclosure last year. Developer Michael Rechter is adding an additional 10,000 square feet of retail space to Indian River Plaza (formerly Kmart Plaza) that will house new tenants, Moe's Southwest Grill, Vittorio's Pizza, Eden Salon & Spa and Mattress One. By Candace Moore, The Newsweekly Posted: Aug. 10, 2016 0 While commercial real estate has experienced a robust boom over the past three years, the old adages "what goes up must come down" and "once bitten twice shy" remain strong in the minds of investors. Meanwhile, others prefer to gamble and "make hay while the sun shines." Some economists forecast that global economic instability will cause a decline in real estate growth, which has realized a nearly 12 percent year-over-year price appreciation on a national average since 2013. But Ken Maggiacomo, president & CEO of Sperry Van Ness International Corp., sees it differently. "Even in the event of a domestic economic slowdown, the global uncertainty could lead to lower interest rates and even greater inflows of foreign capital supporting the domestic commercial real estate market," said Maggiacomo. "The current risk/reward proposition of U.S. investment is unbeatable." Florida has become one of the hottest markets in the country, drawing both national and international attention from developers and investors alike. With Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville setting a record-breaking pace in new commercial development and resales, smaller cities like Vero Beach are benefiting from the overflow, due to comparably lower real estate prices. Consequently, local business owners are moving locations to better position themselves for the future growth of Indian River County and the Treasure Coast as a whole. "There are four areas where we are currently seeing an interest in commercial growth," said John McCoy, chief of Current Development for Indian River County. "U.S. 1 between 8th and 16th Streets, U.S. 1 and Oslo Road, Route 60 west of 43rd, and at the Route 60 and I-95 interchange." New Walmart After sitting vacant for several years, the old Albertson's building on U.S. 1 north of 17th Street will have a new tenant: Walmart. "We are excited to bring our Neighborhood Market store to Vero Beach on U.S. 1 and provide our customers the benefits of a Walmart closer to the beach," said Walmart spokesperson Phillip Keene. "Our small format store will generate additional tax revenue, stimulate new investment and economic growth, and provide jobs for the area." Their neighborhood store concept has a smaller-footprint, averaging 38,000-square-feet, approximately a quarter the size of a Supercenter. Walmart plans to open the new location in early 2017 and employ approximately 95 associates. They currently operate more than 70 Neighborhood Markets in Florida. Walmart on Route 60 will remain open. Busy places New construction is underway in many locations along U.S. 1 between 8th and 20th Streets, beginning with the new Cumberland Farms at 17th Street. Local developer Michael Rechter is building a new retail center in the Indian River Plaza (formerly known as Kmart Plaza), which will soon house Moe's Southwest Grill, Vittorio's Pizza, Eden Salon & Spa, and Mattress One. Ay Jalisco Mexican restaurant will be closing their location on Miracle Mile next week to move into their newly constructed building located at 1902 U.S. 1. Owners plan to keep the location on Route 60 open. At the intersection of U.S. 1 and 12th Street, a new-to-the-area Wawa gas station and convenience store is under construction and a retail shopping center will be built adjacent to it. On the opposite corner, Dollar Tree has taken over half the retail space of Staples. According to McCoy, the former Lincoln Mercury dealership has been sold and will be the future site of O'Reilly Auto Parts and Goodwill. Out west "There are many retail users looking at Vero Beach right now, with the larger investors looking along the Route 60 corridor," said McCoy. "Aldi Supermarket and two hotel chains, including Fairfield Inn & Suites, are very interested in developing properties here." Illinois-based DTS Properties recently purchased Indian River Commons, adjacent to Indian River Mall, for $16.5 million dollars from Wells Fargo Bank. Simon Property Group lost the center in foreclosure last year. The center includes Best Buy, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Michael's, Office Depot, Ross, Carnival Shoes, Play It Again Sports, Firehouse Subs and 24/7 Fitness. Across the street, a Delaware developer is breaking ground for an Outback Steakhouse to be built next to the new free-standing Chick-fil-A that opened a few months ago. The existing Outback Steakhouse on U.S. 1 will be leased to national restaurant chain currently under lease negotiation with Rechter. Downtown Downtown Vero Beach is seeing a continued resurgence of growth as more restaurants and shops open surrounding 14th Avenue. A 7000-square-foot office building will be built at 1745 20th Street near the Indian River County Courthouse. Owner-developer Joseph Foglia and architect Hal Lambert collaborated with his brother Ron Lambert and Billy Moss of Lambert Commercial Real Estate on the conceptual plan. "The old diesel plant inspired us to keep with the same historic look that will compliment downtown. People have a real affection for that building," said Moss, "and this project perfectly blends the growing interest in both downtown and Route 60 development." The two-story brick structure is planned to have offices on the second floor with a lobby and 30 parking spaces underneath the building at street level. Its location is already drawing the attention of area attorneys and other law professionals, according to Moss, who will handle the sales and leasing with the rest of the Lambert Commercial team. Diesel plans Michael Rechter who is working feverishly to open American Icon Brewery on July 4, 2017, couldn't be more honored to have been awarded the purchase of the old diesel power plant from the city. "With this unbelievable project, I am excited to transform an iconic building into a fantastic brewery that will transform downtown," said Rechter. "With amazing projects going on all over town, I believe that Vero Beach is poised for the next phase of growth and redevelopment." With a presidential election around the corner and global economic pressures fueling caution, most major real estate economists are taking a positive but prudent stance on future commercial growth. SVN CEO Kevin Maggiacomo concludes, "Investors and property owners should be aware that today's commercial real estate economy has little in common with previous downturns. As such, we believe that the risk and return profile of commercial real estate is still attractive in 2016 and likely to remain so for at least the near-term horizon." 0 Share Tweet Email Print Specialty Publications Jupiter Courier Newsweekly Vero Beach Newsweekly Treasure Guide Progress & Innovation Luminaries Living Well Advertise with us The Vero Beach Newsweekly is inserted into the Indian River Press Journal every Wednesday and home delivered to select non-subscribers in Indian River County reaching more than 25,000 homes every week; nearly 9,000 to affluent homes in the 32963 area code.

Photo: Reuters Are the recent acquisitions of Monster Worldwide Inc. by Randstad Holding NV and of Jet.com by Wal-Mart the last roar of the old economy? The two deals coming within days of each other continue a trend of acquisitions by large old economy companies of start-ups from the digital world. Thus, last month Verizon Inc. bought Yahoo! Inc., a year after it acquired the former America Online for $4.4 billion. Last January, Capital One acquired San Francisco-based money management app, Level Money, and in January 2013, Avis Budget Group Inc. bought Zipcar which changed the car rental business with its hourly rentals plans. In December 2011, health insurance giant Aetna acquired mobile health startup, Healthagen, the developer of the popular health app iTriage. Much like Verizon and Aetna, the 56-year old Randstad Holding NV, a Dutch multinational, has been a global leader in its business. While Monster’s bread and butter and mainstay is its website, Randstad focuses on recruitment centres. It has some 4,500 branches. Wal-Mart is, of course, a global behemoth, the largest company in the world by sales. By contrast, the companies they have acquired are products of the digital age, whose promise often exceeded their performance. Both Monster and Jet.com had reached the end of the road. A day before the announcement of the acquisition, Monster reported a net loss in the second quarter of $124.2 million. One of the pioneers of the new economy, the company has seen its fortunes plummet over the years. Its stock peaked at more than $86 a share at the height of the Internet bubble in March 2000, valuing the company at almost $8.4 billion. From there to a valuation of $429 million, the price which Randstad paid, is the story of many digital start-ups that left it too late. These acquisitions mark the coming together of two intersecting currents. Start-ups who have lost their way and are either running out of cash or simply out of momentum and see no future are putting themselves up for adoption. And old economy giants petrified by the changes around them and fearful of being left behind in the new digital world are using their last weapons—their vast cash hoards—to buy them up, often to the bafflement of outsiders. Also Read: Randstad to buy job ads site Monster for $429 million Thus, even as Wal-Mart, whose online sales made up just 3% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, coughed up $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com, analysts seemed more concerned about the impact of anti-trust moves in Japan on Amazon’s operations, than the challenge to its business from the Wal Mart-Jet combine. Wal-Mart’s move also comes at a time when Amazon is pushing the boundaries of technology in retailing by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted shopping. Jet’s acquisition still doesn’t get Wal-Mart anything resembling Amazon’s Alexa AI which is its equivalent of a digital shopping assistant. In fact, all the major computing platforms from Microsoft, Google and Apple have some form of voice-activated AI assistant with search capability. There is thus a touch of desperation in the Bentonville-based giant’s purchase of Jet.com. Its revenues are stagnating—down at -0.7% for its year ending March 2016, while operating income declined by 11% in the same period. By contrast, Amazon’s Q2 revenue was up 31% y-o-y while operating income was up 180% to $1.3 billion. Bit players like Jet.com have increasingly got left behind in the winner-takes-all world of digital services. Wall Street Journal reported that Procter & Gamble Co., the world’s biggest advertising spender, in a rejig of its digital advertising strategy, is scaling back spends on smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. That has meant a rash of new-economy start-ups available for a song. And large, old economy companies are past masters at beating down such acquisition targets. But whether buying a start-up when its descent down the cliff has already started, is such a great idea, no matter the cost, is open to debate.

Local and New York State Police set-up a crime lab in the Walmart parking lot after officers on regular patrol found evidence of the meth lab in a large culvert that runs under the parking lot, WIVB reported. The unsecured culvert is large enough that people could stand and make meth inside. "We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore," Captain Scott Chamberlin told WIVB. While shoppers exited Walmart, they saw police bringing evidence up to the surface through a manhole.

Police plan to review security cameras to determine who used the space to make drugs.

Published Aug 9th, 2016 7:49 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. –––––––––––––––––– Price matters. Retailers like Wal-Mart pride themselves on everyday low prices and “the customer is always right” mantra. So when a price mistake occurs at the retail shelf and a $12 LED lightbulb is marked down to $1.20 who takes the loss? In most cases the store cashier will honor the lower price and the store gets dinged for the mistake. However, suppliers also face risks when prices are incorrect at the shelf, according to retail experts. Dr. Chris Medenwald, an analyst with Fayetteville-based Field Agent, recently highlighted common reasons why consumer products are misplaced at retail in a blog post. He said with one passing glance a price tag can often make or break a sale. “An unappealing price, as perceived by the shopper, is a double-edged sword. Not only will you lose an immediate sale, you may also say goodbye to a customer for life – since they’ve already made a determination about your brand such as it’s too expensive or perhaps for other items, it’s too cheap,” he noted. He said suppliers often emphasize sales price and for those doing business with Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores that is always the case. But with more than 4,500 different stores across the U.S. how do suppliers know the prices that shoppers see at the shelf are the right ones. “Retail partners might, after all, misprice your products, leaving you and others wondering why sales are so disappointing,” he added. HUMAN ERROR The most obvious reasons an item is wrongly priced is because of human error. He said pricing errors can occur in simple misprints, or products can be missed within a certain category or item that is supposed to have a price adjustment. There is also the chance of pricing information being accidentally overlooked by store workers. If the price is wrong on the shelf and that wrong price correlates with the scanned price at the register the item could completely sell through before the mistake is caught. CVS made the mistake in 2011 of incorrectly pricing a Zhu-Zhu toy pet item. The price should have been 20% off the $20 price. But a pricing error was made as the stores advertised the toy items for 5 for $10 or $2 each. The items were sold at 7,000 stores and the retailers took a huge loss as the product sold out in a few hours time. Such mistakes are not that common according to Jami Dennis, CEO of Vendor Masters in Bentonville. She said prices are usually wrong because of human error at the store or a structural issue where it’s wrong in the retailer’s inventory system which is typically set up by the supplier or a consultant representing them. She said it is also possible for store managers or buyers to reduce a certain price because of competitive issues in a particular market and they don’t always tell the supplier they are doing it. “Once a buyer reduced a Walmart price to be more competitive in the H-E-B market in order to try and gain some marketshare from that retailer, which they can do. When it works the product will usually sell through and the supplier can always see the prices of their products within Walmart’s inventory system by running a simple report on the Retail Link portal,” Dennis explained. She said the one thing suppliers will want to monitor in such cases is to be sure the buyer and supplier margins are protected with the lower price, because if the margin is not there for the buyer there is always a chance they could discontinue the product. She said a short term price decrease is not typically a problem, but a longer-term lower price could drive down an item’s average price and negatively impact a supplier’s scorecard rating. DESYNCHRONIZATION Products may also be mispriced because of desynchronization. Dennis said when a new item is created and set up in Walmart’s system there could be a mistake made with respect to cost, color or quantity, for example. She said in cases like this the problem is more global and 9 times out of 10 it’s caught within the first 24 or 48 hours a product is on the shelf. When this happens the item when scanned in a store may indicate “item not found” in which the cashier has to use the shelf price, which might or might not be the correct price. Dennis said when the mistake is made in the item set-up, at the very least there will be a conversation with the supplier to discuss who eats the charge because the supplier will likely have some liability. She reiterated that suppliers can easily track the sales of their products to the store level using Retail Link and it’s to their advantage to look at the pricing reports on a regular basis, if they aren’t using a consultant to monitor that for them. She said if there is a pricing problem it will show up in the sales numbers. The one exception would be for suppliers like bread companies and bottlers who deliver directly to the stores, bypassing the distribution centers. She said those reps can rectify a pricing problem on the spot in the store by filling out some paperwork.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Walmart brings online ordering and curbside pick-up service to area Tuesday Aug 9, 2016 at 5:16 PM Aug 9, 2016 at 5:16 PM Order ahead and have the groceries loaded into your car when you arrive By Maggie Menderski Walmart has taken the one-stop shop concept to a whole new level. Now it’s as easy as parking. Four Southwest Florida Walmart Supercenters on Tuesday launched a free online ordering system that cuts out pushing shopping carts, browsing aisles and waiting in line. Now shoppers can select from more than 30,000 items online at Walmart.com/grocery and pick up the load from the store without ever having to leave their car. Walmart staff members have been training at select Southwest Florida Supercenters for about three weeks, said Ryan Reed, Walmart’s e-commerce market coach, who is based in Tampa. They are ready to do all the footwork for customers, from pulling the items from the shelves to pushing it out to the car. “It’s all about convenience and really doing taking the next step and doing our best to provide the low cost of Walmart, and helping people save time and spend time with their families,” Reed said. Where it's available The service is now available at the supercenters at 5315 Cortez Rd. W. in Manatee County, 17000 Tamiami Trail in North Port, 13140 S. Tamiami Trail in Osprey and 4150 Tamiami Trail S. in Venice. The staff at the Osprey Walmart Supercenter already had carried out four online deliveries by noon on Tuesday, said Christina McFadden, the Osprey store manager. Not everyone has the time or ability to browse through a grocery store. McFadden expects the program to gain popularity in the next month or so as the word spreads, and then to boom when Southwest Florida’s seasonal population returns in the winter. “I think it’s going to be a great experience," Mcfadden said. “I think it’s going to help a lot of our elderly customers who may have a harder time maneuvering through the store and maneuvering through the parking lot.” Popular across a large swath The program has been popular in a variety of demographics. In other markets where it has been introduced, busy families have used the service to set up quick shopping trips on the way home from work or from school and after-school activities. Parents of college students have used it to buy groceries for their out-of-town college students. “We’re going to take that anxiety of shopping and be able to do the shopping for them,” McFadden said. About 90 percent of customers use online ordering for fresh meat, dairy or produce to their baskets, but items such as diapers, school supplies and large dog food bags, according to information from Walmart.  How it works There is no sign-up fee, but a customer must spend at least $30 to use the service. All products cost the same as they do inside the store. Pickup orders can be scheduled for any day of the week and up to three weeks in advance. Same-day pickup is available, and orders placed by 1 a.m. are available for pickup after 8 a.m. that day and orders placed by 10 a.m. can be ready by 4 p.m. Stores with the service have parking spots labeled for online shoppers. The spots are marked with a phone number, and customers are asked to call it to let the staff know they’ve arrived. Expanding; not unique Walmart began rapidly rolling out the online pickup program late last year, and it’s now available in two dozen other Florida stores including locations in Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Naples, Orlando, Pensacola, Tampa and West Palm Beach. Walmart is not alone in its effort to simplify errands. Publix Super Markets Inc. announced plans last month to pilot grocery-delivery services with Instacart in parts of Miami. Shipt launched in the Sarasota-Bradenton area in October, and the on-demand mobile app promises to deliver Publix groceries right to your doorstep for a membership fee and a slight upcharge on products.

During checkout, the customer can select a time to pick up their order. Personal shoppers then select the requested produce, meats and other grocery items on the customer’s shopping list. Customers arriving at a pickup locations go to parking spaces marked in orange, then call a designated number to alert an associate, who then retrieves the prepared order and loads it into the customer’s vehicle. Walmart launched its online grocery pickup service Tuesday at four Cincinnati area stores, including one in Butler County. Walmart’s Online Grocery allows customers to order groceries online and pick them up at select Walmart stores without having to leave their vehicles. The free service is now available at 8288 Cincinnati Dayton Road in West Chester Twp. It’s also available at: 5303 Bowen Drive in Deerfield Twp.; 4370 Eastgate Square Drive in Cincinnati; and 201 Chamber Drive in Milford. Walmart’s grocery pickup service features 30,000 items, including fresh meat, dairy and produce, according to the company. All items are priced at the same prices found in local Walmart stores, company officials said. The minimum order total required for the service is $30, according to Walmart’s customer service division. “At Walmart, we have always been known for saving our customers money and, with services like grocery pickup, we are also saving them valuable time,” Scott Valentine, store manager of the West Chester Walmart Supercenter, said in a statement. “Our customers have told us that grocery pick up is a game changer. They are now able to complete their grocery shopping in a matter of minutes — between errands or on their way home from an after school activity – without even unbuckling their seat belts.” Last summer, Kroger made its online shopping service, called ClickList, available to customers of its Kroger Marketplace store in Liberty Twp. The location, at 7300 Yankee Road, was the first of Kroger’s 2,640 supermarkets nationwide to test online ordering. Kroger charges $4.95 for an online order, but the fee is waived for the first three orders. Other local Kroger stores that now offer ClickList include West Chester Twp., Mason, Sharonville and Lebanon locations.

On the recording you can hear, “We have a shoplifter at Walmart 1098 Frederick Blvd.” It happened on April 22, 2015 at around 7 o’clock in the morning. A loss prevention officer inside the Walmart called 911 to report a shoplifter then gave a description. The person said, “He is located in the shoe department, Black male with a grey hoodie, black scarf, multi-colored sweatpants, black hat…. Male is consuming clothing, he is moving towards the front near the general merchandise exit.” He calls 911 back and says the person is leaving the store. Dispatcher: Do you see the officer? Walmart employee: “Nah, I’m looking for him. I don’t see the officer nowhere...Oh, I see him.” Dispatcher: “Just show him where the guy is.” We know from court testimony Officer Rankin talked with the loss prevention officer who pointed out Chapman in the parking lot. Rankin is heard saying, “I’ll be out with that suspect.” We know from court testimony that Rankin approached Chapman. There was a confrontation. Rankin pulls out his Taser and attempts to use it on Chapman, but he said Chapman knocked it out of his hand and it went flying 20 feet away. The Taser video turns off for 15 seconds – and there was a struggle. Rankin then open fires on Chapman. On the 911 recording you can hear, “Shots fired, one down near the IHOP, Frederick Blvd.” The Taser turns back on after the shooting. You can hear Rankin saying don’t die on me man as Chapman lies on the ground. You hear, “I’m by the main entrance to the IHOP right across from the Rally’s.  He is unresponsive….  Have medics stage by the Wells Fargo so they can be close…I’m not getting a pulse, start CPR.” Chapman was shot in the face and chest. “I’m doing CPR.  Start setting up a crime scene as soon as you can so you can get medics in here,” heard on the recording. The unarmed 18 year-old died at the scene. Rankin was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and the jury recommended 2.5 years. Tuesday we also got newly released video from court security video. You see a friend of the Chapman family speaking to a juror in the hallway of the courthouse. When this happened on day 6 of the trial, the defense made a motion for a mistrial, but the judge denied it. The next day the defense came back and said they had video of encounter and asked for it to be entered in as evidence. The judge also denied that request. The defense said they will use this courthouse security video in their efforts for an appeal. Rankin will be formally sentenced on October 12.

Press & Sun Bulletin 5:16 p.m. EDT August 9, 2016 Johnson City police responded to the Wal-Mart store on Gannett Drive Tuesday afternoon. (Photo: ANTHONY BORRELLI) BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — Police say a man who slashed his own throat inside a New York Walmart store first tried goading an officer into shooting him before he was subdued Tuesday afternoon. The incident occurred around 2:30 p.m. at the Walmart on Gannett Drive in Johnson City northwest of Binghamton and forced an evacuation of the store's employees and customers for about a half-hour. Officers responded to a call about a man in the produce section who was threatening to slit his own throat, Johnson City Police Chief Brent Dodge said. When confronted by a police officer, the 40-year-old man kept saying, "Shoot me," Dodge said, and then started to cut his arms and wrists with a razor knife he was brandishing. "He's moving around while he's doing all this," Dodge said of the man, "and the officer deployed pepper spray to subdue the guy, but that was ineffective." Once the man cut his own neck, Dodge said, a second officer deployed a Taser and was able to take the man into custody while preventing further blood loss. Shoppers who were inside the store at the time of the incident were evacuated after Walmart staff pulled a fire alarm to empty the building. Binghamton resident Diane Chapman, who waited in the parking lot with several other shoppers, said Walmart employees emptied the store in an orderly fashion. "We all appreciated that," she said. Crime scene tape blocked the entrance to the store while police investigated the incident. The 40-year-old man, whose identity was not released Tuesday, was taken to UHS Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City and police said he is expected to survive. The man is not expected to face criminal charges and Dodge said the case is being treated as a mental health arrest. Dodge also credited responding police officers for using their training in deploying less-lethal options in order to take the man into custody safely. No customers or store employees were injured during the incident.

Eternal, which sources naturally alkaline spring water from New York’s Allegheny Mountains, Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains and the Shasta-Trinity Alps of California, announced the news last week. Co-founder and CEO Karim Mashouf, who launched the brand in 2008, called the new distribution “a significant step forward for our brand to reach a larger number of customers.” In a call with BevNET Mashouf called Walmart the brand’s “first mass-market customer.” He also revealed the company will service the world’s largest retailer directly, rather than going through a distributor. Despite its alkaline properties Mashouf has been quick to distance Eternal Water from other prominent players in the emerging alkaline water space, instead likening his brand more towards premium imported natural spring and mineral water brands, almost like a domestic Fiji or Evian. It’s that pure and pristine source, Mashouf said, that’s been the brand’s primary value proposition, whereas “artificially enhanced” waters in the space, derived from municipal sources, have had to rely on their alkalinity. “Our sources happen to be naturally alkaline and we call that out, we don’t have to lean on that,” Mashouf added. “All the other ‘alkaline waters’ have to draw attention to their alkalinity because what they really are at the end of the day is just filtered tap water.” Even with the current hype around the alkaline water category, Mashouf said its source will continue to be its premium proposition, and will be what continues the brand’s growth and push into retailers. “In today’s world every category in consumer packaged goods is moving towards better-for-you, healthier, organic, natural products,” Mashouf added. “People are going to wake up and say they don’t want artificially enhanced water.” The company’s press release can be found below: (Walnut Creek, CA – August 1, 2016) – -Eternal Water, the third largest premium sourced bottled water company in the United States, has announced a distribution deal with Walmart across 23 states. Through this partnership, Eternal Water will now be available in almost 1600 stores, offering their 1L bottle. The premium, naturally alkaline water company kicked off this partnership early July. “Adding Walmart as a major distributor for our water is a significant step forward for our brand to reach a larger number of customers,” said Karim Mashouf, Founder and CEO of Eternal Water. “In less than 6 years we have grown to be the third largest premium sourced bottled water company in the country by being the first to offer alkaline water in the category. The difference is that our water is naturally alkaline, meaning that the pH is in a basic state ranging from 7.8 – 8.2. Walmart has an incredible reputation as the world’s largest retailer, and is increasingly investing in the all-natural food and beverage trend. We are excited to be a part of their journey towards offering more pure products to consumers.” In a world where most bottled water is municipally sourced and artificially enhanced, Eternal Water is 100% All-Natural with nothing added nor removed, allowing them to not require an ingredient label. “It’s absurd to me that most waters have an ingredient label on them. Water shouldn’t have any ingredients or be artificially enhanced,” said Mashouf. “We didn’t make our water, we discovered it!” Eternal Water comes from the most pure and pristine natural water sources in the USA. They are nationally distributed across major retailers in America. About Eternal Water Eternal Water is the #3 Premium Sourced Bottled Water in the USA and one of the fastest growing premium waters in the category. Eternal has swept this category in the last few years boasting 86% incremental sales and over 60% repeat purchase rates, generating one of the most loyal customer bases in bottled water. Eternal Water has national distribution and can be found in the country’s largest retailers across all channels. Learn more about their products and benefits at http://www.eternalwater.com.

On a dollar-for-dollar basis, it's easy to understand why: Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. But if Walmart buys Jet.com, which it's reportedly considering, it could become Amazon's worst nightmare. Here's why: 1. Walmart has a massive customer base The retailer is far behind Amazon in terms of online sales, but overall, the picture looks much different. Walmart's revenue in 2015 was $482 billion, which is more than four times Amazon's revenue last year. All that revenue for Walmart represents untapped potential for online sales from customers who are currently shopping at Walmart's physical stores. Richard Feloni 2. Walmart has a massive network of stores that can serve as distribution centers for products sold online Walmart has more than 4.500 stores in the US and 102 distribution facilities. By comparison, Amazon has roughly 180 fulfillment centers in the US. For Walmart, "This combination of a massive brick-and-mortar footprint with [an] emerging ecommerce player would put both companies in a better position for battle," said Stephan Schambach, who founded e-commerce companies NewStore and Demandware. He said he's skeptical however that Walmart will ever overtake Amazon in online sales. "I still don’t think they’ll be able to beat out Amazon, but it will be interesting to watch them try," he said. Neil Saunders, CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, is more bullish on Walmart's potential. "We have always said that this is a major advantage for Walmart over a player like Amazon in that Walmart can distribute products far more cheaply and quickly, if it finds a way to fully integrate stores into its systems," Saunders wrote in a note to clients. 3. What Walmart lacks in e-commerce logistics, Jet.com can offer Jet.com is growing rapidly and stealing some customers from Amazon by offering cheaper prices than the e-commerce giant. It's only a year old and it has already generated more than $1 billion in sales from more than 4 million shoppers, according to Euromonitor. According to Slice Intelligence, another industry-data firm, Jet's sales in July 2016 have grown 168% relative to August 2015. Wal-Mart’s online sales, meanwhile, have grown only 30% Jet.com is also quickly mastering fast and free shipping. Richard FeloniWhile Walmart only recently began offering two-day delivery to members of its ShippingPass program — which is meant to rival Amazon Prime — Jet.com has figured out how to achieve one-day delivery for half of US households free of cost, according to Euromonitor International. "Wal-Mart will gain significantly from Jet’s logistics and delivery expertise," Michelle Malison, retail analyst for Euromonitor. "By strategically locating its distribution centers and streamlining its logistics, Jet has doubled its one-day delivery (of its own first-party products) penetration rate from 25% to 50% of US households since launch, and is approaching 99% of US households for two-day delivery. In select high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often is able to offer same-day delivery at no additional cost to both Jet and its shoppers." Walmart's ShippingPass costs $49 a year, compared with the $99 for Amazon Prime. Meanwhile Jet.com's two-day shipping is free for all orders of at least $35. Without ShippingPass, Walmart customers have the option to choose between "rush" one-day shipping, which can cost at least $14 an item, or "expedited," "standard," and "value" options, which take two to seven days and cost about $5 to $8. Walmart offers free pickup at stores.

Then the startup sold to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart bought Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal, making the shares Eric Martin won last year worth somewhere between an estimated $10 million and $20 million.  (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP/Getty Images File Photo)   By Gerrit De VynckBloomberg Tues., Aug. 9, 2016 Working at a startup that gets acquired can feel like winning the lottery. Not working at a startup, but still cashing in on its acquisition, can feel pretty good too, as Eric Martin learned when Jet.com sold to Wal-Mart Stores in a $3.3 billion (U.S.) deal. Martin, who works for a custom bath installation company, received 100,000 Jet shares last year when he won a contest to see who could get the most people to sign up for memberships to the online shopping site. He spent $18,000 (U.S.) on online ads and came away with a stake now worth millions in one of 2015’s buzziest startups. “It feels good; it feels really good,” Martin, of York, Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview during his lunch break. “The way, I think, to describe it is ‘occasional hysterical laughing.’” Martin, 30, has no idea what his stake is worth, though Fusion reported last year that his shares may be valued from $10 million to $20 million. The cash-and-stock sale to Wal-Mart could have boosted that since Jet’s private valuation was pegged at around $1.5 billion last November, but the company has also raised money since Martin won his shares. That could have reduced the value of his stake because startups sometimes give preferential shares to later-term investors that can squeeze out smaller investors or employees. Martin, who works in digital marketing, said he’s still waiting for Jet to tell him how much his stake is worth, but he’s hoping it’s in the “multi-millions.” Article Continued Below Wal-Mart’s purchase gives the world’s largest retailer a way to boost its online offering and better compete with Amazon.com. Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, worked at Amazon for about two years after selling his previous company to the e-commerce behemoth. He founded Jet as a members-only online retailer, aiming to cut prices below even what Amazon could offer. He’s raised more than $500 million in venture capital. While he waits to find out exactly how rich he is, Martin is thinking about his own startup, Ideadash.com, an online portal that lets people post their ideas for inventions or businesses and get others to execute them while retaining a stake in the project. “I’m weighing my options,” he said. “I’ve got to take time to process all this.” Correction – August 10, 2016: This article was edited from a previous version to update an incorrect photo caption that misstated Eric Martin’s surname.

 The US military is basically Walmart now Rosa Brooks, Foreign Policy Aug. 10, 2016, 9:46 AM 7,044 facebook linkedin twitter email print An aerial view of the Pentagon in Washington Thomson Reuters When my mother came for lunch at the Pentagon, I shepherded her through the visitor’s entrance, maneuvered her onto the escalator, and had just ushered her past the chocolate shop when she stopped short. I stopped too, letting an army of crisply uniformed officers and shirt-sleeved civilians flow past us down the corridor. Taking in the Pentagon’s florist shop, the banks, the nail salon, ­and the food court, my mother finally looked back at me. “So the heart of American military power is a shopping mall?” She wasn’t far off. By the time I started working at the Defense Department in the early years of the Obama administration, the Pentagon’s 17.5 miles of corridors had sprouted dozens of shops and restaurants catering to the building’s 23,000 employees. And, over time, the U.S. military has itself come to offer a similar one-stop shopping experience to the nation’s top policymakers. At the Pentagon, you can buy a pair of new running shoes or order the Navy to search for Somali pirates. You can grab some Tylenol at CVS or send a team of Army medics to fight malaria in Chad. You can buy yourself a new cell phone or task the National Security Agency with monitoring a terrorist suspect’s text messages. You can purchase a small chocolate fighter jet or order up drone strikes in Yemen. You name it, the Pentagon supplies it. As retired Army Lt. Gen. Dave Barno once put it to me, the relentlessly expanding U.S. military has become “a Super Walmart with everything under one roof” — and two successive presidential administrations have been eager consumers. But the military’s transformation into the world’s biggest one-stop shopping outfit is no cause for celebration. On the contrary, it’s at once the product and the driver of seismic changes in how we think about war, with consequent challenges both to our laws and to the military itself. Here’s the vicious circle in which we’ve trapped ourselves: As we face novel security threats from novel quarters — emanating from nonstate terrorist networks, from cyberspace, and from the impact of poverty, genocide, or political repression, for instance — we’ve gotten into the habit of viewing every new threat through the lens of “war,” thus asking our military to take on an ever-expanding range of nontraditional tasks. But viewing more and more threats as “war” brings more and more spheres of human activity into the ambit of the law of war, with its greater tolerance of secrecy, violence, and coercion — and its reduced protections for basic rights. U.S. soldiers of 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team disembark from a U.S. military helicopter CH-47 as they take part in the annual "Balikatan" (shoulder-to-shoulder) war games with Filipino soldiers at a military camp, Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija in northern Philippines April 20, 2015. Erik De Castro/REUTERS Meanwhile, asking the military to take on more and more new tasks requires higher military budgets, forcing us to look for savings elsewhere, so we freeze or cut spending on civilian diplomacy and development programs. As budget cuts cripple civilian agencies, their capabilities dwindle, and we look to the military to pick up the slack, further expanding its role. “If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” The old adage applies here as well. If your only functioning government institution is the military, everything looks like a war, and “war rules” appear to apply everywhere, displacing peacetime laws and norms. When everything looks like war, everything looks like a military mission, displacing civilian institutions and undermining their credibility while overloading the military. More is at stake than most of us realize. Recall Shakespeare’s Henry V: In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favour’d rage …   In war, we expect warriors to act in ways that would be immoral and illegal in peacetime. But when the boundaries around war and the military expand and blur, we lose our ability to determine which actions should be praised and which should be condemned. Soldiers of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, work as a six member team to lift a heavy log over their heads 20 times while competing in the Ivy Heptathlon during Iron Horse Week, Jan. 28, 2015. Teams executed seven events in accordance with Army Regulation 7-22 in the fastest time possible. (U.S. Army photo) Flickr/ The US Army For precisely this reason, humans have sought throughout history to draw sharp lines between war and peace — and between the role of the warrior and the role of the civilian. Until less than a century ago, for instance, most Western societies maintained that wars should be formally declared, take place upon clearly delineated battlefields, and be fought by uniformed soldiers operating within specialized, hierarchical military organizations. In different societies and earlier times, humans developed other rituals to delineate war’s boundaries, from war drums and war sorcery to war paint and complex initiation rites for warriors. Like a thousand other human tribes before us, we modern Americans also engage in elaborate rituals to distinguish between warriors and civilians: Our soldiers shear off their hair, display special symbols on their chests, engage in carefully choreographed drill ceremonies, and name their weapons for fearsome spirits and totem animals (the Hornet, the Black Hawk, the Reaper). And despite the changes ushered in by the 9/11 attacks, most of us view war as a distinct and separate sphere, one that shouldn’t intrude into our everyday world of offices, shopping malls, schools, and soccer games. Likewise, we relegate war to the military, a distinct social institution that we simultaneously lionize and ignore. War, we like to think, is an easily recognizable exception to the normal state of affairs and the military an institution that can be easily, if tautologically, defined by its specialized, war-related functions. But in a world rife with transnational terrorist networks, cyberwarriors, and disruptive nonstate actors, this is no longer true. Our traditional categories — war and peace, military and civilian — are becoming almost useless. In a cyberwar or a war on terrorism, there can be no boundaries in time or space: We can’t point to the battlefield on a map or articulate circumstances in which such a war might end. We’re no longer sure what counts as a weapon, either: A hijacked passenger plane? A line of computer code? We can’t even define the enemy: Though the United States has been dropping bombs in Syria for almost two years, for instance, no one seems sure if our enemy is a terrorist organization, an insurgent group, a loose-knit collection of individuals, a Russian or Iranian proxy army, or perhaps just chaos itself. A pair of U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles fly over northern Iraq Thomson Reuters We’ve also lost any coherent basis for distinguishing between combatants and civilians: Is a Chinese hacker a combatant? What about a financier for Somalia’s al-Shabab, or a Pakistani teen who shares extremist propaganda on Facebook, or a Russian engineer paid by the Islamic State to maintain captured Syrian oil fields? When there’s a war, the law of war applies, and states and their agents have great latitude in using lethal force and other forms of coercion. Peacetime law is the opposite, emphasizing individual rights, due process, and accountability. When we lose the ability to draw clear, consistent distinctions between war and not-war, we lose any principled basis for making the most vital decisions a democracy can make: Which matters, if any, should be beyond the scope of judicial review? When can a government have “secret laws”? When can the state monitor its citizens’ phone calls and email? Who can be imprisoned and with what degree, if any, of due process? Where, when, and against whom can lethal force be used? Should we consider U.S. drone strikes in Yemen or Libya the lawful wartime targeting of enemy combatants or nothing more than simple murder? When we heedlessly expand what we label “war,” we also lose our ability to make sound decisions about which tasks we should assign to the military and which should be left to civilians. Today, American military personnel operate in nearly every country on Earth — and do nearly every job on the planet. They launch raids and agricultural reform projects, plan airstrikes and small-business development initiatives, train parliamentarians and produce TV soap operas. They patrol for pirates, vaccinate cows, monitor global email communications, and design programs to prevent human trafficking. Many years ago, when I was in law school, I applied for a management consulting job at McKinsey & Co. Employees at Walmart. David McNew/Getty Images During one of the interviews, I was given a hypothetical business scenario: “Imagine you run a small family-owned general store. Business is good, but one day you learn that Walmart is about to open a store a block away. What do you do?” “Roll over and die,” I said immediately. The interviewer’s pursed lips suggested that this was the wrong answer, and no doubt a plucky mom-and-pop operation wouldn’t go down without a fight: They’d look for a niche, appeal to neighborhood sentiment, or maybe get artisanal and start serving hand-roasted chicory soy lattes. But we all know the odds would be against them: When Walmart shows up, the writing is on the wall. Like Walmart, today’s military can marshal vast resources and exploit economies of scale in ways impossible for small mom-and-pop operations. And like Walmart, the tempting one-stop-shopping convenience it offers has a devastating effect on smaller, more traditional enterprises — in this case, the State Department and other U.S. civilian foreign-policy agencies, which are steadily shrinking into irrelevance in our ever-more militarized world. The Pentagon isn’t as good at promoting agricultural or economic reform as the State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development — but unlike our civilian government agencies, the Pentagon has millions of employees willing to work insane hours in terrible conditions, and it’s open 24/7. It’s fashionable to despise Walmart — for its cheap, tawdry goods, for its sheer vastness and mindless ubiquity, and for the human pain we suspect lies at the heart of the enterprise. Most of the time, we prefer not to see it and use zoning laws to exile its big-box stores to the commercial hinterlands away from the center of town. But as much as we resent Walmart, most of us would be hard-pressed to live without it. As the U.S. military struggles to define its role and mission, it evokes similarly contradictory emotions in the civilian population. Civilian government officials want a military that costs less but provides more, a military that stays deferentially out of strategy discussions but remains eternally available to ride to the rescue. We want a military that will prosecute our ever-expanding wars but never ask us to face the difficult moral and legal questions created by the eroding boundaries between war and peace. We want a military that can solve every global problem but is content to remain safely quarantined on isolated bases, separated from the rest of us by barbed wire fences, anachronistic rituals, and acres of cultural misunderstanding. Indeed, even as the boundaries around war have blurred and the military’s activities have expanded, the U.S. military itself — as a human institution — has grown more and more sharply delineated from the broader society it is charged with protecting, leaving fewer and fewer civilians with the knowledge or confidence to raise questions about how we define war or how the military operates. Soldiers with the Japan Ground Self Defense and US Marines and sailors carry combat rubber raiding crafts ashore during boat operations as part of the Japan Observer Exchange Program at Kin Blue beach here, July 16. The soldiers are with JGSDF’s Western Army and the Marines and sailors are with Company L, Battalion Landing Team 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. The JGSDF soldiers have been observing L Co. for approximately six weeks. JOEP enables the JGSDF observation and education of small unit concepts, tactics, and amphibious operations to further enhance the interoperability of the two forces and security of the region. Cpl. Henry Antenor/US Marine Corps It’s not too late to change all this. No divine power proclaimed that calling something “war” should free us from the constraints of morality or common sense or that only certain tasks should be the proper province of those wearing uniforms. We came up with the concepts, definitions, laws, and institutions that now trap and confound us — and they’re no more eternal than the rituals and categories used by any of the human tribes that have gone before us. We don’t have to accept a world full of boundary-less wars that can never end, in which the military has lost any coherent sense of purpose or limits. If the moral and legal ambiguity of U.S.-targeted killings bothers us, or we worry about government secrecy or indefinite detention, we can mandate new checks and balances that transcend the traditional distinctions between war and peace. If we don’t like the simultaneous isolation and Walmartization of our military, we can change the way we recruit, train, deploy, and treat those who serve, change the way we define the military’s role, and reinvigorate our civilian foreign-policy institutions. After all, few generals actually want to preside over the military’s remorseless Walmartization: They too fear that, in the end, the nation’s over-reliance on an expanding military risks destroying not only the civilian competition but the military itself. They worry that the armed services, under constant pressure to be all things to all people, could eventually find themselves able to offer little of enduring value to anyone. Ultimately, they fear that the U.S. military could come to resemble a Walmart on the day after a Black Friday sale: stripped almost bare by a society both greedy for what it can provide and resentful of its dominance, with nothing left behind but demoralized employees and some shoddy mass-produced items strewn haphazardly around the aisles.

August 09, 2016 16:00 ET ICTV Brands, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call Begins Today at 4:30pm EDT WAYNE, PA--(Marketwired - August 09, 2016) - ICTV Brands, Inc. (OTCQX: ICTV), (CNSX: ITV), a digitally focused direct response marketing and international branding company focused on the health, wellness and beauty sector, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Second Quarter 2016 Highlights: Positive cash flows from operations of $307K, increasing cash from year end to $1.5MM Increased Q2-16 revenue to $4.5MM from $3.7MM in Q1-16 Streamlined expense structure resulting in $332K in decreased G&A expenses from prior year quarter Brick and Mortar retail sales of $156,000 Revenue from relaunch of Jidue campaign of $151,000 Incremental E-commerce sales including Bed Bath and Beyond, Walmart, JCPenney and Overstock of $116K Management Commentary: Richard Ransom, President, stated, "Our management team remains focused on executing our long term growth strategy of building a robust digital marketing platform to support our expanding global distribution channels. During the second quarter we saw progress on several key areas of this strategy, specifically expanding our footprint in programmatic display advertising, introducing a video component into our social media ads, all while supporting a growing number of listings on major retail ecommerce sites for companies such as Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Walmart, and JCPenney. The results of this progress are shown in growing our revenue base from the first quarter, while managing the business to maintain a positive cash flow from operations and increasing our cash balance from year end. The next steps for ICTV are to build upon our success with the retailers on their ecommerce platform and move our products into their stores. I am confident that ICTV's growth trajectory is built on a solid foundation and will continue for the foreseeable future."

The year over year decline is attributable to lower media related expenditures and the Company's shift to a higher concentration of digital marketing. The Company increased its net sales from the first quarter of 2016 as it was able to broaden its media footprint with its push into additional e-commerce and retail outlets in the upcoming months. Total selling and marketing expenses decreased to $2.7 million from $3.2 million in the prior year quarter.

Net loss was ($601,000), compared to net income of $287,000 in the prior year quarter. Earnings per share (EPS) was ($0.02), as compared to $0.01 in the comparable prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) was a loss of ($440,000) compared to EBITDA of $455,000 in the prior year quarter. Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $8.3 million, decreasing from $16.1 million in the prior year period as a result of a decrease in media related expenditures. Total selling and marketing expenses decreased to $4.4 million from $8.0 million, decreasing as result of media expense decreases of $2.7 million, answering and customer service decreases of $764,000, and merchant fee decreases of $183,000. Total general and administrative expenses decreased to $2.0 million from $3.1 million in the prior year quarter, as a result of bad debt expense decreases of $529,000, travel expenditure decreases of $135,000, payroll and employee benefit expense decreases of $117,000, consulting expense reductions of $73,000, and share based compensation decreases of $125,000.

Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 At June 30, 2016, we had $1.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2015, and had positive cash flow from operating activities of $306,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to net cash used by operating activities of $892,000 in for the prior year period. Based on our current rate of cash outflows and cash on hand, management believes that its current cash will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital for the foreseeable future.

Walmart parking lot USA Today Network Ashley May , USA TODAY 3:32 p.m. EDT August 9, 2016 Police found a meth lab on the property of a Walmart in Amherst, N.Y. this week. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Police found more than low prices at an Amherst, N.Y., Walmart this week. They found a meth lab inside of a drainage pipe in the parking lot. The pipe, wide enough for a 6-foot-tall person to walk through, leading to the meth lab runs underground near the Walmart parking lot exit on Sheridan Drive. Amherst Police “stumbled upon it,” Detective Lieutenant JoAnn DiNoto said. Inside, they found a makeshift table of wood propped on top of a tire, along with soda bottles filled with solvents used to make meth. USA TODAY Mayor of rich D.C. suburb charged in 'meth-for-sex' scheme “There was no danger to the community or Walmart shoppers or contaminating water source,” DiNoto said.

The New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team arrived on the scene Monday afternoon dressed in hazmat suits. A spray can, chemicals and liquid thought to be methamphetamine were found, yet officials stated there was no threat of flammability or air contamination, according to NBC 4. Captain Scott Chamberlin relayed to NBC 4 that the police had not received a tip. Rather, they were conducting a routine patrol of the area. “That’s what we do every day,” Chamberlin told the news outlet. “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” According to the Buffalo News, it was difficult to tell how long the lab had been in use. Chamberlin also spoke to the news outlet: “It happens all over the country, all over the state,” Chamberlin said of meth labs. “Is it out of the ordinary for Amherst? Has it happened here before? Yes.” Related Stories Meth Lab Discovered In Walmart Breaking Not So Bad According to police, the culvert was said to be tall enough to stand inside of and was not secured. Officials are working to secure the area so that it can no longer be accessed by the public. The New York Daily News reported no arrests had been made and officers were reviewing the Walmart surveillance tapes. Methamphetamines can be easily manufactured from every day products like cold medicine and cleaning chemicals. Meth production can cause “fires, explosions, injuries and environmental contamination,” according to the CDC. In a report that examined data from 1,325 meth-related chemical incidents reported by five states (Louisiana, Utah, Oregon, Wisconsin and New York) between 2001 and 2012, the CDC reported that “Seven percent of meth-related chemical incidents resulted in injuries to 162 persons, mostly members of the general public (97 persons, including 26 children) and law enforcement officials (42).” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Go figure. One scenario starred an impatient dog left in a parked car while its master went shopping. Well, doggie apparently felt enough is enough, and proceeded to honk the horn. Incessantly. Far more shocking is what transpired in a West Virginia Wal-Mart parking lot. Two frisky car-prisoners managed to shift into neutral! The car slowly rolled until bumping into the Wal-Mart building. What could have been disastrous thankfully ended without harm to bodies or buildings. Even the car was fine. Hopefully, though, dog owners will now think twice about leaving their best friends in hot, parked cars. Although the Wal-Mart canines lacked driving skill, last year a pint-sized Chihuahua was filmed taking a toddler for a spin in a kiddie convertible. Incredibly, the dog successfully maneuvered the 5 mph mini-vehicle for a full minute until it gently bumped into a curb. In 2012, a New Zealand animal shelter executed a publicity stunt to encourage the adoption of three dogs. They taught the dogs Drivers’ Ed. Seriously. And each successfully drove a real car — including ignition, gears, pedals, and steering wheel — and one even managed a hairpin turn! Two of the three were adopted in short order. A far more eye-opening fact about dogs, though, recently surfaced in the Daf Yomi, Bava Kamma 60b: “When dogs cry, it means the malach hamaves has come to town. When dogs play, it means Eliyahu Hanavi has come to town.” Somehow, dogs sense things that are out of our realm. But why dogs? As lovable as they may be, they’re often regarded as lowly creatures (as in the insult, “you dog!”).[1] Deepening the mystery, both “Eliyahu” and “kelev” have a gematria of 52; and Kaleiv ben Yefuneh’s name is spelled with the same kaf, lamed and veis as kelev! “U’lchol Bnei Yisrael lo yecheratz kelev leshono.” At the moment of makkas bechoros — the final clincher of freedom[2] — there is an emphasis that no dog so much as barked at any Jew or Jewish-owned animal. Dogs symbolized Jewish redemption. Why? The only two individuals excluded from the non-entry decree were Yehoshua bin Nun and Kaleiv ben Yefuneh, “ki milu Acharai.” The test of the Meraglim was not easy. Kaleiv went to Me’aras Hamachpelah and davened to not be swayed. He faithfully persevered despite witnessing the terrifyingly titanic inhabitants. That quality of faithfulness is the positive aspect of dogs. Their appellation “man’s best friend” is deserved. Dogs are fiercely loyal to their masters, often despite severe maltreatment. A faithful messenger completes his mission, no matter what. Eliyahu Hanavi is tasked by Hashem to herald the Geulah[3] and despite the passage of many, many long years, he will faithfully fulfill his mission — just as he was the quintessence of loyalty in his unflagging battle against Achav and Izevel’s pernicious promotion of baal peor.[4] And like the first geulah from Mitzrayim, dogs — with their trait of tenacious loyalty — will manifest that expression of redemption when Eliyahu eventually comes. During ikvesa d’Meshicha, “the face of the generation will be as the face of the dog.” Brazenness — the lowly, negative side of dogs — will abound. At face value, it’s a harsh-toned statement decrying Klal Yisrael’s lowliness upon the advent of Moshiach. However, it also contains a strong chord of consolation. In Mitzrayim — at the 49th level of tumah — we were not in good shape. Nonetheless, Hashem looked past all the filth to the pure, inner core of His beloved children, and helped them bring out their great potential. Although entrenched in idolatrous Egyptian practices, Bnei Yisrael remained loyal to their core identity. Halevai, Moshiach should come immediately. If c”v he does not, though, and we’ll have to sit on the floor bemoaning our past tragedies and current squalid state — innumerable crises and heartrending tragedies — we cannot overlook our core loyalty to our Father in Heaven. Yes, like the dog, we have serious flaws and failings and are soiled with caked-on layers of tumah. But, when push comes to shove, the Jewish People remains forever loyal to their Master. Hashem will not be put off by our less-than-attractive exterior. Looking past our face, Hashem will focus on our inner, faithful core and help actualize our great potential. May we imminently merit to see Eliyahu Hanavi fulfill his age-old mission, heralding the arrival of Moshiach Tzidkeinu. [1]. See also Devarim 23:19, that a sheep swapped for a dog cannot be brought as a korban, because it is an abomination. [2]. See Brachos 9a that our emancipation took place at night even though our physical exit waited until the following day. [3]. Malachi 3:23, Rashi Bechukosai 26:42 [4].

Till now, both the companies were at the same level, having opened 21 stores each. By 2020, METRO plans to set up 50 stores, whereas Walmart plans to have 70. While both are bullish on India, French retailing group Carrefour, which had a cash-and-carry business, left India after it found difficult to do business here. METRO claims higher revenues and better operational metrics than Walmart’s cash-and-carry business in India though these claims could not be independently verified. METRO is also working on a pilot in Jaipur to offer delivery to its registered customers, and plans to roll out the same across its stores, but it will charge for delivery, depending on the weight and the value of the goods ordered, said Arvind Mediratta, managing director & chief executive officer, METRO Cash & Carry India. Last year, Walmart India had kicked off online sales from all its stores. METRO has no plans to offer online sales, said Mediratta. Cash-and-carry stores are allowed to sell to business customers like traders and resellers, hotels, restaurants, caterers, companies and self-employed people. Mediratta joined METRO in February this year, after working for nine years in Walmart — he headed Walmart’s cash-and-carry business in India before moving to the US to work for Walmart’s retail business. His brief is to accelerate METRO’s growth in India and make its operations profitable. Metro has been in India for a decade but continues to post losses. In FY15, it reported a net loss of Rs 110.7 crore, Rs 142 crore loss a year ago. Net sales were Rs 3,974 crore, against Rs 3,440 crore a year ago. But METRO hopes to be profitable soon. It recently identified India along with Russia, China and Turkey as its key focus markets. “You need certain scale (20-30 stores) to be profitable and we will soon get there,” said Mediratta. METRO has been focusing on improving its operations by cutting costs and driving efficiencies and discipline.

Amherst police Capt. Scott Chamberlain told the news station officers often "look into areas where people could be up to no good." The culvert ran from a nearby street down under the Walmart parking lot. Police told WIVB the culvert was tall enough to stand in and not secured, meaning anyone could walk into it. Members of the New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team donned full hazmat suits before they were lowered beneath the parking lot through a manhole. They found spray paint cans, various chemicals and "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine," Chamberlain told WIVB.   Parking lot of Sheridan Dr. Walmart in #Amherst.

"It's not so much the chemicals themselves, it's the way they're mixed and how they're handled," he told the news station. "Once (officers) went in there and saw what they needed to see, it's determined it wasn't a hazard." Authorities have not determined how long the culvert was used or who was using it. "This isn't the kind of thing you'd expect in a place like this, that's the bottom line," resident Steve Harding told WIVB.

Square Blossoms Water Authority West Rock Trails Westville Renaissance Westville Synagogue What Now New Haven Workforce Alliance Yale Events YMCA Youth Continuum Under Chief, Abusive Behavior Unpunished by Paul Bass | Aug 9, 2016 12:30 pm (12) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the Author Posted to: Legal Writes, True Vote In Chief Dean Esserman’s police department, unchecked bullying has run downhill. Consider the case of Patricia Helliger. Like Esserman, Helliger, currently a police captain, has an extensive history of alleged rudeness, disrespect and bullying toward members of the public and lower-ranking cops alike. Like Esserman, she has escaped from those incidents with wrist-slaps at the most at a time when activists nationwide are calling for more accountability for police misconduct. Amid these complaints, Helliger won promotion to a top departmental post. Now Esserman is struggling to keep his job as chief. He’s in the midst of a three-week forced paid leave in which he has been ordered to show he can gain control of his temper and vaguely described “personal problems” and regain the confidence of a deeply skeptical public and a force in open revolt. Meanwhile, he faces complaints like a new human rights complaint by an 18-year office staffer in the chief’s suite that Esserman repeatedly “bullied” and demeaned her and other women, reduced her to tears and “shaking” by yelling at her when she didn’t immediately hear an order to dial a phone number for him, and created a “reign of terror” in the office. (Sixteen witnesses signed on to that statement.) One key question has emerged: Given Esserman’s record of abusing his cops and the public, can he credibly discipline cops who do the same if he returns to 1 Union Ave.? He has repeatedly avoided disciplining Patricia Helliger, based on a review of her internal affairs and personnel files in response to a state Freedom of Information Act request. An internal investigation found she confronted a citizen who dared to take her picture in a Walmart parking lot, slapped the phone out of his hand in contravention of a department general order on First Amendment rights, then lied about it when questioned by officers. One investigator suggested having her arrested. Instead, Chief Esserman — who at the time escaped from serious punishment for berating an elderly Yale Bowl usher and threatening to shut down a football game because he wasn’t allowed in for free — decided not to punish her. The police union president told Esserman that Helliger had just had a “bad day,” echoing the phrase Esserman himself used to seek to explain the Yale Bowl encounter. An attorney for a Latino immigrant complained that Helliger refused to certify routine paperwork needed to apply for a visa for an abused child, while insulting the mother’s command of English and complaining about immigrants allegedly taking advantage of a visa program. It turns out other immigrant families — whom Helliger allegedly suggested were liars — were also stalled in obtaining the paperwork. Instead of disciplining Helliger, police brass transferred the duties to another official. When Helliger allegedly “abus[ed] her authority as a friend” of a woman involved in a custody dispute, she escaped punishment. The head of internal affairs lodged a complaint about Helliger’s alleged “pattern of both verbal and physical aggression with both her staff (sworn and civilian) and the public,” including yelling incidents that interfered with staff work. “[T]hese incidents have been documented and reported yet nothing has been done to address it,” wrote the complainant, Lt. Racheal Cain. She filed that complaint last November. Officials claim an open “investigation” into the matter continues. Meanwhile, Helliger was promoted to captain. She did receive a one-day suspension once, for failing to respond one evening in 2012 to a scene where a cop shot a dog that was attacking a police canine. Helliger was the B squad shift commander. An internal investigation found that Helliger violated a general order requiring the supervisor on duty to respond to scenes where cops discharged weapons. Helliger wrote in a memo to Chief Esserman that she “should have responded to the scene…. I see that this incident certainly appears that I or the other supervisors are uncaring toward the welfare of the troops but for this supervisor and shift commander that is far from the truth.” Helliger has defended her actions in past controversies and claimed that she was subjected to unfair treatment by the chief. In fact, she’s suing him and the city for allegedly limiting her opportunities at the police department. The suit (read it here) also accuses police brass of not taking action against racist acts by white cops directed at Helliger, an African-American woman. One department member, for instance, called her “Mrs. Butterworth” in a Facebook posting. (Read her complaint here.) The discrimination Helliger reported she has faced in-house, along with visible support she has received from African-American alders, raised the political stakes of any action Esserman might have taken against her. However, he has also failed to take action against other officers who have violated the spirit or text of rules protecting citizens’ First Amendment rights. Helliger did not respond to requests for comment for this story. She had a lot to say internally when her fellow cops concluded she abused a member of the public, violated a general order, then fabricated her story in a dispute over a parking space. Attention Walmart Parkers The dispute occurred around 7 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2014, outside the Walmart on Route 80. Off-duty at the time, Helliger, then a lieutenant, was driving her department cruiser. She pulled into the Walmart parking lot. Chad and Bianca Grant, a brother and sister, were loading purchases into their car at the time. They each had a daughter with them. Their shopping cart occupied part of the space next to their car’s space. Helliger started to pull into that space. According to the Grants, Helliger asked them to move the cart, and they agreed. Here’s Bianca Grant’s version of what happened, according to a summary in the ensuing internal investigation’s file: Lt. Helliger then began to inch her car into the space. Again, they told her that they were packing up the car and asked her why she was inching up the car? She was going to hit the cart with her car if she continued to pull into the space. Lt. Helliger then identified herself as a police officer and said that when she asked them to do something, she expected them to do it. They told her that does not give her the right to inch into the space when they are trying to pack up the car. Again, Lt. Helliger said that she was a police officer, and she expected them to do what she asked. An argument ensued where all the parties involved cursed at each other. Lt. Helliger finished parking and left to go into the store. Bianca’s brother then said that he was going to take a picture of Lt. Helliger’s license plate because, if she is an officer, he wanted to call the cops and tell them what kind of officer she is. As her brother took a picture of her license plate, Lt. Helliger left the store and walked towards them. She said, “You can take a picture of whatever the hell you want.” As she approached him closely, he turned around, with his feet planted firmly on the ground, and tried to take a picture of her face. She said the camera was less than a foot from Lt. Helliger’s face. Lt. Helliger then slapped his phone out of his hands and pushed him away. Her brother raised his hand to block her, and then Ms. Grant stepped between them and pushed Lt. Helliger twice. She repeatedly said, “Do not touch my fucking brother.” Lt. Helliger raised her hands in a defensive posture and shouted back that they were not allowed to touch her. Ms. Grant said she was protecting her brother and although Lt. Helliger claimed to be an officer, she was not acting like one. Bianca said Lt. Helliger acted ridiculous and not as someone in authority should. Lt. Helliger returned to her car and called for back-up. They did not try to block or prevent Lt. Helliger from entering her car. They then left the parking space and saw officers stop another vehicle. Her brother rolled down his window and told the officers that they were probably looking for him. He was then handcuffed and placed in the back of a cruiser. One of the daughters and Chad Grant offered similar accounts to a police investigator the same story. The file includes this passage from the summary of the interview with Chad Grant: “As he turned around to take a picture of her, she slapped the phone out of his hand. The phone was around 2-3 feet from her face. He doesn’t remember whether he pushed back. He did not take a fighting stance or raise his hands with clenched fists (which is consistent with the video surveillance footage). His sister then got in her face and pushed the Lieutenant away.” Helliger called for back-up. Several officers arrived. One directed traffic. Another interviewed witnesses. An officer handcuffed Chad Grant, who insisted that “he did nothing wrong and that the video would show this. He said the Lieutenant came at him aggressively and tried to swat at him.” Helliger told the officers that she had returned to her car because she had forgotten something. She said that “the male tried to take a picture of her. She asked him not to and reached towards him to stop him. She said that he pushed her, and a female also came at her,” according to a report by Officer David Parker. Helliger told her side to several officers, including Sgt. Rose Turney. According to the file, Helliger said she had “opened her window and asked the male subject if he could move the carts.” He then asked why. She identified herself as a police officer and said she needed to get into the store quickly. He took offense to the comment and said, “Fuck the police. You think you can do whatever you want.” She ignored the comments, because she wanted to avoid a confrontation. She was eventually able to park her car. She got out and entered the store. Once in the store, she remembered items she forgot in the car. She returned towards the car to retrieve those items. The male individual was at the back of her car taking pictures with his cell phone. As she approached the car, he turned towards her and started to take pictures right up in her face. She became uncomfortable and unsure whether he was going to assault her. She pushed him back with two hands. His cell phone fell to the ground, and he took up a fighting stance with clenched fists. She believed he wanted to fight her. The females exited the car and confronted her. They yelled at her, and she put up her hands in a surrender type fashion. They continued to make comments about why she wanted to fight their brother. She continued to say she didn’t want anymore problems and then was able to get back in her car. She radioed the dispatcher with a description of what had happened. The other subjects saw her on the radio, continued to put their groceries away and then left quickly. Lt. Helliger never mentioned that she was assaulted or injured and Sgt. Turney observed no visible injuries. Four officers ended up reviewing surveillance video footage inside Walmart. Sgt. Turney was among them. In a subsequent internal affairs interview, Turney called “Lt. Helliger’s statement inconsistent from what she viewed in the video. The male subject did not walk up on her and put himself in her face to take a picture. He only slightly turned his body as if he heard something being said behind him. She then hit his hand holding the cell phone. Sgt. [Jason] Minardi asked Sgt. Turney based on this video, [whether] she would consider Lt. Helliger the aggressor in this incident, and Sgt. Turney responded, ‘Yes.’” Officer David Totino also reviewed the footage. He later told an internal affairs investigator that the video bore out Chad Grant’s version, not Helliger’s: “Lt. Helliger left Walmart and directly approached the male who is at the back of her car and either pushed or swatted at him. He then dropped an item on the ground and leaned over to pick it up. Officer Totino said the Lieutenant made ‘a bee line’ towards the male subject and did not see the male subject approach her. ...  He said from what he observed in the video, the male subject was not aggressive at all.” “The video clearly showed her swatting at him. He then bends down and may be picking up his phone. The two females then get out of his vehicle, and they have breach,” another officer present, Jason Bandy, later told an investigator. In a subsequent interview with internal affairs, Helliger reported that three days after the incident, she discovered that her right arm had a bruise. She concluded that she had been injured during the Walmart confrontation. She repeated that the Grants were the aggressors, not she. No Charges, No Discipline Sgt. Rose Dell conducted the internal affairs investigation. After reviewing all the interviews and the video, Dell concluded that Helliger had misrepresented her actions and violated department rules: In her taped statement, Lieutenant Helliger said she did not approach the male subject but passed by him in order to return to her vehicle. When she passed him, he placed his cell phone in her face. This statement is inconsistent with what is viewed in the video surveillance footage. Lieutenant Helliger left the store and briskly walked directly up to the male subject. His back was turned to her as she approached. As he turned towards her, he lifted the phone, and she slapped the phone from his hands. Lieutenant Helliger violated General Order 311, Citizen’s Right to Video: It is the policy of the New Haven Department of Police Service to permit video recording of police activity as long as such recording does not interfere with ongoing police activity or jeopardize the safety of the general public or the police. Lieutenant Helliger also violated Rule 15, Subsection 42: No employee of the Department shall engage in any act which would constitute conduct unbecoming an officer. Lieutenant Helliger is required as a police officer to treat all members of the public with respect and courtesy and create a positive impression when interacting with members of the public. During her first encounter with the Grants, she identified herself as a police officer. General Order 311 presented a particular challenge for the chief. His officers have repeatedly violated citizens’ rights to record them in public, in some cases arresting them for doing so. Earlier in 2014, the city paid two citizens $31,500 for violating their rights in those cases. As part of that settlement, the cops promised to train officers better in the general order. But Chief Esserman decided not to discipline Helliger for violating the General Order (which has since been rewritten to make it more enforceable), or for any of her actions in the Walmart incident. When asked by the Independent, he declined to say why. Then-police union President Lou Cavaliere Jr., who attended the meeting with Esserman and Helliger about possible discipline, said the chief decided to call the incident a “misunderstanding,” given that Helliger’s account differed from those of other officers. Helliger argued that the police should have arrested the woman for allegedly assaulting her. Cavaliere said he advised Helliger to “apologize and say you ‘had a bad day,’” since Esserman had just done that for his behavior at the Yale Bowl football game. Two days after he cleared Helliger, Esserman escaped discipline with that explanation, beyond receiving a reprimand warning him not to repeat his actions. Here is the full text of Sgt. Dell’s 22-page internal affairs report, including the full text of Helliger’s statement and those of officers and witnesses who contradicted her. It ends with a memo recounting that she raised the question of referring the incident to the state’s attorney’s office for criminal prosecution. According to the memo, then-Assistant Chief Al Vazquez said not to. Meanwhile, under Esserman, violations of citizens’ free speech rights have continued to go unpunished in the department — such as in the arrests of an immigrant-rights activist outside Goodfellas restaurant on State Street and of a woman video-recording an arrest outside the Beverage Boss on Whalley Avenue. Esserman either stayed mum or supported the actions of officers in those cases. He never publicly questioned the arrests. A new report by a mayoral commission recommends that the police department “provide comprehensive training in First Amendment and protest rights” to officers and “consider writing a new [general order] regarding citizens’ right to free speech, assembly, and protest that outlines expectations of civilians and police in these situations.” Immigrants Dubbed “Liars” The Walmart incident was hardly the first or last time Esserman learned of, and let pass, alleged bullying and rudeness by Helliger. Consider what happened to an immigrant mom whose 10-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted. With the help of an attorney, beginning in February 2015, the mom tried to get a routine form signed by then-Lt. Helliger. At the time, as head of the records division, Helliger was the authorized official who needed to sign off on a form citizens need to file for U-Visas (I-918 supplement form B). The mom’s child was eligible for a visa as long as the form got signed showing the family had cooperated with police in the investigation. In the first two months, the mom spoke with Helliger around ten times, she claimed. At one point, Helliger allegedly told her, “Look, there are lot of cases that happen here and there are a lot that lie.” After that Helliger would not respond to repeated calls asking to pick up a signed form, according to a civilian complaint the mom later filed against Helliger, charging “rudeness and neglect of duty.” The attorney eventually got the form back. It was signed, but not fully filled out. By that time the Clifford Beers Clinic had assigned a family advocate to try to help the mom get help with the police department. The advocate, Genesis Polanco, went to 1 Union Ave. on July 22 to ask to speak with Helliger. According to a subsequent police internal affairs report, Helliger “refused to speak with them and she stated ‘I don’t understand why there is so many people involved with this case, I’ve already spoken to the lawyer and there is no need for me to speak with you.’ Polanco explained that they wanted Lt. Helliger to come downstairs to get a copy of the form that needs to be completed. Lt. Helliger refused to come downstairs and asked for the form to be left at the front desk.” On Aug. 5, according to the report, Polanco received a promise that the mom would receive the signed form once Helliger returned from vacation. Helliger was allegedly back at work on Aug. 7. The mom showed up at 1 Union Ave. “[S]he tried to speak with Helliger on August 2015. Lt. Helliger refused to come downstairs and told her that if she didn’t know how to speak English properly to get an interpreter and that there was no need for her to speak with” the mom, according to the internal affairs report. The mom’s attorney told her it would take only 15 minutes to fill out the report. But she had only six months since the incident to obtain one and still have her daughter qualify for the visa. That time was running out. According to the internal affairs report, Assistant Chief Campbell met with the mom’s attorney: “Chief Campbell told [the] Attorney that the New Haven Police Department has not received the proper training with handling juvenile U-Visa requests. He stated he is currently seeking training for the Department on this matter. Chief Campbell stated he advised Lt. Helliger to not sign the forms and that he would take care of it.” The matter was eventually “resolved,” according to the report, which was written by Sgt. Jason Weted. (In order to protect the identities of the mother and the child involved in the U-Visa case, we are not publishing the internal affairs report.) It turned out that other immigrants were complaining of similar problems getting U-Visa forms signed by Helliger. At a “white shirt” (command staff) meeting, Helliger reported that “she was ‘overwhelmed’ and that a lot of the U-Visa applicants are just trying to use it as a way to circumvent the process,” according to a written account by Lt. Racheal Cain of internal affairs. So Campbell and Esserman convened a meeting on Oct. 15 with top cops and community domestic violence and immigrant rights advocates.  As a result of the meeting, the department transferred responsibility for handling U-Visa forms to Helliger’s then-deputy in records, Lt. Darcia Siclari. New rules would guarantee applicants a response within 60 days and written explanations of any denials. In a Dec. 8 memo, Campbell reported that all the U-Visa complainants “were more than satisfied with these changes.” The memo made it clear that Helliger was not “disciplined” for her conduct in these cases. “Lieutenant Patricia Helliger was removed from the U-Visa program, not as a discipline, but as a means relieving her of the responsibility of the U-Visa program, which clearly requires an enormous amount of focus and time,” Campbell wrote. “The amount of time that the program required was clearly interfering with the other primary responsibilities that Lieutenant Helliger has as the O.I.C. [Officer In Charge of] Records.” Helliger no longer oversees the records division, where she instituted a program to cut the backlog of unserved warrants. Asked what her current assignment is, Acting Chief Anthony Campbell said Esserman made her “Deputy of Administration. Currently she oversees the animal shelter, the garage, property room ... Her primary assignment right now is getting our fleet management system up to date, tracking department vehicles, getting the animal shelter into the 21st century and ensuring that staffing levels are brought up to speed. Additionally she is working with the unions at the animal shelter to get staffing levels improved.” (In the past, Helliger, , an immigrant from St. Martin, has run a program introducing immigrant police officers to New Haven schoolchildren. Read about that here and here. She continues to help organize an annual food, clothing, and toy giveaway program for children.) Jennifer Rodriguez, the attorney for the mom in the child-assault case, said Tuesday that she eventually gave up on trying to get the police to sign off on the visa form. She went to the state’s attorney’s office and obtained the signature there, she said. Since Helliger was relieved of the visa-form duty, Rodriguez said, she has had success with other clients in getting the police to deal with the forms. Rodriguez took exception to the claim that immigrants lie about being crime victims to obtain visas. Particularly in domestic violence cases, she said, ” “that’s one of the things they hold over them: ‘I can get you deported.’” Grab & Run Another internal affairs investigation of Helliger centered on a child custody battle. The complained stemmed from a Jan. 17, 2014 incident. The complainant was the uncle of the 10-year-old girl at the center of the custody. Helliger was friends with the child’s “biological great aunt,” according to the complaint. (Again, to protect the child’s identity, the text of the complaint is not being published here.) The biological aunt had custody of the girl. The uncle had the girl with him the night of Jan. 17 when, he said, Helliger showed up at his house one night and took the child away. The uncle “believed the situation was escalating so he attempted to take the child out of Helliger’s car…. Helliger wrapped her arms around him. He was able to break free from her hold and he began running to the house with the child. Helliger then grabbed [his] arm to restrain him. The child ran into the house and ran out of the back door where Helliger was now waiting. Helliger put the child into her car and drove off,” according to the internal affairs report, written by Lt. Rebecca Goddard. The uncle’s wife gave a similar statement. Goddard contacted Helliger for her side. Helliger “confirmed there was a verbal altercation ... involving the custody of the ten year old child” but “did not wish to provide further details due to the fact it was off-duty conduct,” Goddard wrote. The outcome: “Lieutenant Helliger was advised not to contact either party. This case is closed due to mediation. Raising Cain One complaint against Helliger remains unresolved. The timing of its handling is a story in itself. The complaint was issued not by a member of the public, but by a lower-ranking officer, internal affairs chief Lt. Cain. Cain filed her complaint against Helliger on Nov. 18 with the city’s Department of Human Resources. Cain complained that Helliger had created a “hostile” workforce by berating her and yelling at her in front of other people in a number of instances, and was making it difficult for her to do her job right. In the first instance, Cain was serving as a administrative sergeant in the detective division. (She hadn’t yet become head of internal affairs.) She asked a detective why he hadn’t completed a photo board of suspects in a robbery; the detective said Helliger had ordered him not to include juveniles because the law forbids it. Cain said a department inspector told her the law in fact allows the inclusion of juveniles’ pictures in photo arrays. “When I brought this to Lt. Helliger’s attention, she became defensive and told me that she would not authorize the use of juvenile photos regardless of what the Inspector said,” Cain wrote in her complaint. The next instance occurred when Cain was in charge of the Bureau of Identification. Her account: I was tasked with retrieving photographic evidentiary that was taken by patrol officers. Although there was a written policy on how to maintain these photographs, often the policy was not followed resulting in photographs never being downloaded or the designated computer having access to the internet (unsecure). As a result, Captain [Jeff] Hoffman (OIC of Patrol) and I proposed having the officers either print the photographs or burn them to CD and place them into evidence. This would alleviate the above mentioned issues and allow us to destroy the evidence in accordance with State Statute. When we brought this recommendation to Lt. Helliger she became angry, yelling at us that she was not the OIC of the Property Room and it was not her job. Over the course of several meetings, in an attempt to resolve the issue, she continually berated me. Ultimately, Assistant Chief [Al] Vazquez (then Lt.) became involved and after witnessing one of her rants, spoke with her supervisor who agreed the photos should be treated as evidence and be placed into the property room but, due to her unwillingness to cooperate with Captain Hoffman and I, the transition never occurred. The next three alleged confrontations occurred while Cain has been serving as head of internal affairs. In one, Cain wrote, Helliger yelled at her for not including her in the loop about an internal affairs decision involving another cop she had wanted to have disciplined. The second involved the immigration U-Visa case described earlier in this article. Cain wrote that at the “white shirt” command staff meeting, she had suggested a bureaucratic solution to the U-Visa paperwork jam. “After the meeting was concluded, but while several people were still gathered, Lt. Helliger turned to me and started yelling, repeatedly, “This is not an IA issue.” I repeatedly told her that she was correct, it was not an IA issue, and that the only reason I was involved was because there was a complaint filed. She continued yelling and pointing her finger at me. Fearing the incident would escalate further, I told her that I did not want to argue with her and got up and left. And, although this was witnessed by her immediate supervisor, Assistant Chief Anthony Campbell, to my knowledge, her behavior was not addressed.” The third incident involved a Freedom of Information Act request filed with records by New Haven Register reporter Esteban Hernandez. Hernandez sought copies of all civilian complaints filed against Chief Esserman. Helliger forwarded that request to internal affairs, Cain wrote. One day she came down to the first-floor IA office to ask about the status of the Hernandez request, according to Cain. When Helliger asked, Cain wrote: I told her that I had already fulfilled the request. She became visibly angry and told me that she was the “Keeper of Records” and that I should have forwarded the information for her to disseminate. She continued to tell me that we only have 4 days to respond and she needed to maintain those records for 1 year. I told her that I had maintained them but that I would make copies [of] all of the responses I had written and give them to her for her files. She continued to raise her voice and told me that I am supposed to give all of the documents to her because she was the Chief’s designee. I explained to her that when I took over as OIC I was not sure how the FOIAs were handled therefore, I contacted Kathleen Foster from Corporation Council and asked who is responsible for the IA records. Attorney Foster told me that I am the keeper of IA records and that in the past her office would make any needed redactions. Lt. Helliger said, “no one else ever asked before.” I tried to tell her that I called Corporation Council to make sure I was doing my job correctly, but she continued to speak over me in a hostile tone, telling me that I was wrong and that she is tired of me “disrespecting” her. I tried to tell her that I did not disrespect her and that she can have copies of my responses to the FOIAs I complete in the Internal Affairs division. Lt. Helliger continued yelling at me and said several times that I had disrespected her, that she was tired of it and would not tolerate it. I noticed that several citizens who were standing in the lobby were now turned around, looking toward my office, watching us. At that time, I told Lt. Helliger I did not want to argue with her and asked her to leave. She continued to yell and said that she is not arguing with me. I again asked her to leave but she yelled, “you can’t kick me out.” I said, “Patty, it’s my office, please leave” at which time she left and slammed the door behind her, again causing everyone in the lobby to focus on her. When I began walking back to my desk, I noticed that all of my staff which included Deb Sullo, Sergeant Rose Dell and Intern Frank Olive, were all staring at me with a shocked look on their face. One of my employees asked, “what was that?” I believe Lt. Helliger’s aggression and hostility has escalated in each of our interactions and feared it would continue to do so therefore, I reported this last incident to my immediate supervisor, Assistant Chief L. Casanova. He ordered that I, and all of the staff who witnessed the incident, submit memos detailing what occurred. In my memo, I asked that her behavior be addressed because, again, I fear her hostility toward me will grow and a physical confrontation will occur. One week after submitting my memo, I attended the regularly scheduled Board of Police Commissioners meeting in which I give the Internal Affairs report. Although there was nothing on the Agenda pertaining to Lt. Helliger, eleven Aldermen attended the meeting to show “support” for her. I found this to be a form of bullying and intimidation for reporting what I believed to be a hostile work environment to my supervisor. I also found it to be very concerning that eleven appointed City officials would take a stand when none of them were privy to the facts of the case. I can only interpret this to mean that, if there is an investigation, regardless of what is found these appointed City officials will back Lt. Helliger and no action will be taken to correct her behavior. I also fear, that based on their position of power within the City, I will be retaliated against and relieved of my position or overlooked for other positions within the Department. Lt. Helliger has shown a pattern of both verbal and physical aggression with both her staff (sworn and civilian) and the public. Yet, although these incidents have been documented and reported yet nothing has been done to address it. This latest incident, and the Alderman’s response, has caused me a great deal of anxiety and am hesitant to perform my required duties when it involves Lt. Helliger. I am asking for relief from her continued intimidating and hostile behavior. At the time of the filing of Cain’s complaint, Helliger was under consideration for her promotion to captain. She had influential people — numerous city alders — showing up at the Board of Police Commissioners to complain that her promotion was being unfairly delayed. More then eight months later, according to the head of human resources, the matter remains under investigation. And Dean Esserman officially remains chief of the New Haven police department.

Share | Post a Comment Commenting has closed for this entry Comments posted by: FacChec on August 9, 2016  2:00pm According to this story concerning Hellinger, not only does Esserman not recognize and take punitive action against Hellinger for multiple allegations of personal abuse towards police officers and the public, he ignores her abuse and reluctantly promotes her to the rank of Captain. It becomes abundantly clear that the reason for Esserman’s failure to follow policy and instill discipline is because he is looking at himself in the mirror and excusing his/her own actions. Essserman has a documented record of discipline, albeit slight, Hellinger does not. Therefore, it appears the problem in the police department, all city departments and the BOE is Harp. posted by: THREEFIFTHS on August 9, 2016  2:18pm Wow. This sounds like the movie Prince of the City. https://youtu.be/AIaKFOtLWd8 posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  2:42pm Well this definitely does not surprise me that the machine is starting to work in an effort to make the transition of Chief Essermans return back to work justified. This is called, “Politics 101 deflectionat its worse”. This is not really a brilliant spin by any form of the imagination. It’s done every day in politics across the country even as I scribe this commentary pertaining to all of the “Tom Foolery” which has gone on with Donald Trump since campaigning. It’s done every day. Here’s the key to this, Chief Esserman, in case you or anyone else think this is brilliant it is really not. The public is smarter than this. In order for you, “Chief Esserman” to return back to the helm of the NHPD you need someone you can say, “Look I am not the only one”. Yes. It’s totally unfortunate for at the time then, Lieutenant Hellinger, now Captain allegedly was confronted with a bad situation. Here are the differences between Esserman and Hellinger.Hellinger runs nothing, Esserman does. Hellinger can’t suspend or recommend termination, Esserman can. Chief Esserman still will be able to discipline. No matter what Capt. Hellinger or any officer may have done in the past they were not the Chief of Police. One of the largest departments in the State of Connecticut. No matter however the machine chooses to deflect and redirect Chief Essermans behavior he has no business running anyone’s Police Department in these United States of America. This is not about Capt. Hellinger this is about YOU! Chief Esserman! You can not hide behind any medium or political official with what you’ve inflicted on civilians and the officers of the City of New Haven. I can tell you that I’ve had conversations with your contemporaries across the state since your last explosive behavior. I can tell you this much from what I’ve received is, “If I don’t have anything good to say about someone I’d just rather not say anything at all”. This comes from Federal, State and Municipal partners. posted by: Statestreeter on August 9, 2016  3:00pm Let’s be honest here. Maybe the Indy could do a story, unless I missed it, about how a dozen or so alders marched their way to a police commission meeting to demand she be promoted to captain. Then everyone including our city hall elites held the big celebration to talk about the good old glass ceiling BS. Essermans behavior and Hellingers behavior happens because not only is it condoned but it’s celebrated at the highest levels. Esserman is here to stay. Guaranteed!!!! posted by: Hill North on August 9, 2016  3:31pm Mayor Harp it doesn’t make sense to bring back Esserman. How could you justify his return. posted by: Brian Banks on August 9, 2016  4:28pm This is a great job of investigative journalism, nice work Paul.  The article is founded in fact and the details are undeniable.  In an effort to refrain from responding viscerally, I will keep from personally commenting on Esserman or Helliger.  Furthermore, they are not the only command level officers at the NHPD who conduct themselves in this manner, they just happen to be in the spotlight right now.  This is the rule rather than the exception right now at the NHPD since most of the real police leaders have retired.  But i digress….     Over the past couple weeks Esserman’s ability to discipline subordinate officers, should he return, has come into question repeatedly.  The very real truth is that he won’t be able to be effective in this regard and any punishment he did impose would be met with immediate litigation and a flurry of union grievances.  Mayor Harp is taking the city down a rabbit hole if she allows Esserman to return, even if he doesn’t have any future problems.  Let’s make it easy to understand by talking about managing employees.  Most of us know that discipline should be 1) Uniform and 2) Consistent, that can never be the case now.  In her interview, I heard Mayor Harp mention the old “progressive discipline” standard, which is truly outdated.  You guys know the old four-step system: verbal warning, written warning, suspension, termination.  The problem is that with progressive discipline, the manager and the employee become stuck in a series of escalating steps, ending in threats and documentation, but very little action or rehabilitation.  The discipline or punishment is not instructive. It cannot teach a new behavior or solve a problem (how does three weeks off with pay solve a problem).  You may be able to stop a person from doing something or even coerce him to act in a more desirable way, but the desired behavior will never be permanently learned unless the person recognizes the impact of the problem and takes ownership to solve it. posted by: Brian Banks on August 9, 2016  4:36pm Continued… Esserman and Helliger have never admitted they were wrong, ever, about anything.  They merely make excuses for their behavior and deflect responsibility for their actions.  Every manager in the world has made a mistake or two during their careers.  In fact, mistakes are essential in the learning process and they help us develop a sense of compassion when dealing with employee errors.  But, my fellow NHI readers, these are not mistakes.  These are character flaws in people who have been promoted beyond their abilities and are much too arrogant and indignant to admit their mistakes and strive to improve. posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  5:21pm I promised myself that I would not make any more comments but I just could not help myself because my conscience was bothering me about the return of Chief Esserman and the fact that he is in possession of a service weapon. I do understand that Chief Esserman was not suspended in the true sense of the word. What concerns me which should concern every person who has been confronted by or in the future may come in contact with Chief Dean Esserman. In light of the most recent allegation which is still being investigated of a “Hostile Work Environment” pertaining to a civilian employee. Why is Chief Esserman allowed to continue to holster and wear a weapon on his side with a serious allegation pending? The allegation of a “Hostile Work Environment” has been filed and documented with the City of New Haven departments of Human Resources and Personnel as well as made public by this newspaper alleging Chief Esserman is the perpetrator or suspect of that claim. The most deciding factor in judging whether Chief Esserman is guilty of this behavior will be based on whether the civilian victim has transferred out of the NHPD to another department. So now you have to go back to the initial inquiry when the victim is transferred out of the NHPD the writing is on the wall. There was an incident the city had to comply with upon the return of the perpetrator to make the victim feel safe. That being said, if the transfer occurs then Human Resources and Personnel for the city knows that an actual “Hostile Work Environment” did occur and their responsibility is to make the victim feel safe from the perpetrator (Chief Dean Esserman). Lastly, if all of above has been played out and in fact Chief Esserman has been identified as the cause and threat for the transfer. Why is he allowed to carry a weapon? Also, is anyone concerned with his erratic behavioral pattern that he may be a high risk individual? I know I’m not the only one who is concerned about this am I? posted by: Ex-NHPD on August 9, 2016  8:03pm It is often said that the greatest stress for cops is not on the street; it is inside headquarters.  Esserman is hardly the first NHPD Chief to fail miserably in dealing with a problem employee.  Over my career, I saw numerous examples of problem cops (of all races/ethnicities/gender) who were never sufficiently taken to task for their actions, inactions, or unacceptable behavior.  Many were subsequently promoted and continued to act as they always had.  And then there were the absurdly ironic promoted employees who would take to task their subordinates for the exact same offenses they were notorious for doing. NHPD Supervisors and IA Investigators have been stymied for years after they wrote up Disciplinary Reports to the Chief on a cop or civilian, and had little or no action taken against those employees.  It emboldens the “bad” employee to continue their behavior and erodes the Supervisor’s authority.  It also destroys morale among the majority of the sworn and civilian employees who come to work every day and do their job professionally. For “problem” Supervisors, the Chief’s answer is not to discipline them, but transfer them.  Some supervisor work histories look quite impressive, with numerous assignments.  In reality, they are just shuffled through the deck at 1 Union after being ineffective or unable to get along with others in their last position. Everyone loses when problem NHPD employees are not addressed with proper documentation and discipline. In this article, several Assistant Chiefs are cited as having roles in different incidents with Helliger.  It seems they may have dropped the ball as well.  There also seems to be more than aninsinuation of Political interference. We know the rank and file lost confidence in Esserman. He will return to the NHPD even weaker than when he left for 15 days.  The ship is sinking.  With Esserman back at the helm, it is heading straight for the rocks.  The public and rank and file know this.  Why doesn’t Harp? posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  8:55pm @ Ex-NHPD on the contrary Mayor Harp does know what’s going on. It’s easier to take the low road and pretend that everything is ok and to continue to put a political spin on serious matters concerning Chief Esserman. The second part of this is that she politically can not touch Chief Esserman because of what she is be holding to what was agreed upon. I can not say any more because of the fear of being deleted or censored but I think you can read between the lines. All of this will come out in the wash before or after November 8th. posted by: Brian L. Jenkins on August 10, 2016  5:53am Instead of this officer being promoted, she should have been demoted. I see absolutely nothing wrong with promoting officers that have earned their promotions.  However, this is one officer according to what I read if accurate, who does not deserve one. We as black people cannot look the other way when black officers behave in this manner, and then ask for the dismissal of white officers when they behave similarly.  This chief, upon his return, will be ushered into an untenable situation with regard to potential disciplinary actions towards other officers. Thus, the city should protect itself, from himself. To simply imply that officer Helinger was just having “bad day” is reprehensible.  What kind of day do you think the young man that was handcuffed in the presence of his family and placed in the back seat of a police car was having?  Did these same Alders march to his home and apologize for Helinger’s behavior?  If you can march in solidarity to support this officer in terms of a promotion, then you should’ve marched in solidarity to support this gentleman who experienced the wrath of officer Helinger also. I’m a huge proponent of fairness irrespective of race or sex.  In essence, I call it at I see it, and thus far what I see emanating from these two officers is flat wrong.  I pray that these officers turn from their disrespectful ways and wear the badge correctly. Both Chief Esserman and Lt. Helinger should be made to apologize to those in whom they have harmed.  This form of contrition should be mandatory throughout the department as a form of discipline.  No citizen should be disrespected by an officer, ever. posted by: thecove on August 13, 2016  4:03am There is absolutely no way Chief Esserman can return and effectively run the NHPD.  Leadership of this once fine department must change and change now.

Scott Levine (scott81236) Aug 9, 2016 at 12:15PM Image source: Getty Images. When a company reports its quarterly earnings, management often presents just a sketch of how the company performed. But equally important for investors is the conference call where management's commentary colors in the sketch, providing the full picture of the company's recent performance. Let's look at some of management's more notable comments from Plug Power's (NASDAQ:PLUG) most recent call to help discern the full picture for Q2 2016. The beginning of a beautiful friendship? Throughout its history, one of Plug Power's ongoing challenges has been diversifying its customer base. In 2015, for example, Wal-Mart accounted for 56.7% of Plug Power's total consolidated revenue -- even worse than the previous year when Wal-Mart and Volkswagen provided 37.2% of revenue.  On the call, management suggested that a partnership formed in the second quarter will help address this problem. Although the new customer's identity is unknown, Andy Marsh, Plug Power's CEO, reported that it is a "leading North American retailer with a global presence." Occurring in the third quarter, the first deployment with the retailer -- which has over 40 sites -- may be just the first of many similar deals: And we believe there's potential in our discussions that over the next 12 to 18 months, it could be five to six additional sites of the same size. So this first site will actually have -- the first deployment will be over 200 units and that site could grow to be as large as 400 units. So we're pretty excited about that one. Fall semester credit Like other renewable energy sources, fuel cells have relied heavily on federal tax credits to make their high price tags more palatable to potential customers. So it was quite a disappointment when the industry found that fuel cells -- unlike solar and wind -- weren't included in the latest extension of renewable energy tax credits.  Claiming that the lack of inclusion was due to an oversight, management has spent months, maintaining that the renewal of the investment tax credit (ITC) for fuel cells is just around the corner. Image Source: Getty Images. In fact, on the company's previous conference call, Marsh suggested the renewal could be attached to the FAA reauthorization bill scheduled for this summer. But the Senate sent the bill excluding mention of the ITC renewal to the president in July. Nonetheless, management remains confident: We're working closely and continually with Congress and our coalition partners to make the extension a priority in Congress when members return after the November election. Supporting his confidence, Marsh reported that management has "identified a number of potential legislative vehicles which can be used to enact an extension," and despite the delay, the renewal is forthcoming.  A cut here, a cut there, and there, and there Lastly, management recognizes that it has not only made great strides in expanding the margin on its GenDrive units, but it also sees ample opportunity to further cut costs of its various products and services as it drives the company closer to profitability. According to Paul Middleton, Plug Power's CFO, the company "continues to make great traction on margin improvement. And our success is indicative of our ongoing progress both in terms of volume leverage and cost-down initiatives, demonstrating the focus we have on driving all offerings to 30% margin profiles or greater over the longer term." Management's focus on the long term is admirable; however, investors would benefit from some context. For the second quarter, management reported that it achieved a 39% margin on its flagship GenDrive units -- a vast improvement over the 26% it reported for the same period last year. Evidently, this fits in well with Middleton's 30% margin profile target. In fact, Andy Marsh, later in the call, stated his opinion that in the long term " the GenDrive business itself long term can be a 45% gross margin plus business." But zooming out a little, we find that management has also targeted an overall gross margin for the company of about 12% for fiscal 2016, making 30% seem like a goal not quite attainable for some time. Nonetheless, management believes that in addition to cutting costs in the GenDrive units themselves, it can reduce its expenses in the development of its hydrogen infrastructure. According to Marsh, the company is continuously working on "how to simplify and reduce the cost of hydrogen: infrastructure, which we believe can become a significant business for Plug in the future." The takeaway According to management, new customers represented more than 60% of bookings in the quarter, and Wal-Mart only represented about 15% of the bookings. These figures suggest that the company is succeeding in diversifying its customer base, but it will be interesting to see if Plug Power's 10-K for fiscal 2016 actually confirms that there is greater diversity among the main customers contributing revenue. Regarding the ITC extension, it's not surprising that it didn't appear on the FAA bill, but investors should watch for the renewal by the end of the year. Though Marsh claims that senators have offered to call potential customers and assure them of the tax credit's extension, it seems like there are some more pressing concerns in Washington right now than the ITC renewal. Lastly, investors can keep an eye on the company's gross profit margin. Achieving management's 12% target would certainly be impressive, considering the company reported a negative gross profit margin of 9.6% in fiscal 2015.

Walmart CEO Explains Why Company Spent $3 Billion On Money-Losing Jet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart CEO Explains Why Company Spent $3 Billion On Money-Losing Jet Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 9, 2016 11:24 am EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup wal-jet walmart jet acquisitions e-commerce culture shock When the CEOs of Walmart and of Jet met for the first time, they fell in corporate love. The two men couldn’t stop envisioning the future of their companies together, sketching out their dreams of combining Walmart’s inventory and supplier relationships and Jet’s e-commerce algorithm. The companies announced their engagement this week, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained what it was he ever saw in the startup, which has barely been selling to the public for a year. Walmart, after all, is known for its innovations in logistics and ways to save its own an customers’ money. “If Walmart were starting today and we were building an e-commerce business some of the things that Jet designed into their approach would have been things we would have thought of,” McMillon told CNBC in an interview (warning: auto-play video at that link) after the merger announcement. Walmart is paying $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Walmart shares for the startup, which is the biggest acquisition of an e-commerce company ever: the second-biggest is QVC’s acquisition of flash-sale site Zulily a year ago. Jet fits in with what Walmart wants to do in the future, though: McMillon notes that the startup’s algorithm thinks about purchases in terms of the total “basket,” or everything purchased at once, not the individual items. Walmart plans to keep Jet as a separate brand, but integrate more of its technology in Walmart’s own website. According to CNBC, Walmart had set aside more than $1 billion to invest in e-commerce this year.

Walmart announced Monday that the company has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com. The deal underscores how serious Walmart is about igniting its online business, which has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. AP PHOTO/SETH WENIG, FILE Copyright - Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer NEW YORK — Walmart is buying fast-growing online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, scooping up a newcomer that launched a year ago with the intention of challenging online leader Amazon. The hefty price underscores how Walmart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Walmart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce background as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. Analysts say the acquisition still won’t enable Walmart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Walmart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Walmart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. As part of the deal, which Walmart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Walmart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company’s low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Walmart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Walmart says it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. It is built on a pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper’s home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. McMillon said Walmart customers likely will see lower prices and new brands aimed at millennials that have been carried by Jet.com. Walmart customers may also have more control over creating their own basket to save money. “We have some cool ideas on how the two brands can work together over time,” he said. As for perhaps merging the two sites eventually, McMillon said Walmart wants to be thoughtful about how it approaches that. Lore cited the benefits of Walmart’s purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with Jet.com’s team and technology. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. Lore told The Associated Press that he can see helping Walmart with speeding up shipping, among other things. In its fiscal year ended in January, Walmart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com’s annual net revenue of $107 billion. Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Walmart in online sales in the U.S. But Walmart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon’s Prime program. But while Amazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions.

"If Wal-Mart were starting today and we were building an e-commerce business some of the things that Jet designed into their approach would have been things we would have thought of and we would have wanted to do, and they've just done it from scratch," said McMillon. The move is Wal-Mart's biggest effort to date to stand up against Amazon.com in the online retailing space. Later in the conversation, Jet.com CEO Marc Lore joins in on how his company is expected to add immediate value to Wal-Mart's business model. Other topics discussed in the interview include: Why it made sense for Wal-Mart to acquire a start-up rather than add to its own website. McMillon's long-term strategy and what it means for earnings. The pulse on consumer spending and where growth is taking place. Trade deals and how the political landscape may shape the future.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 9, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: Jet.com. Though rumors surfaced last week, it's now official: Global retail juggernaut Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com. The move stands as the latest, and perhaps most significant example of Wal-Mart's continued shift into global e-commerce -- a move that further pits Wal-Mart in a head-to-head battle for global e-commerce supremacy with market leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With so many important storylines at work here, let's quickly review what this move means for investors. Inside Wal-Mart's Jet.com buyout In headline numbers, Wal-Mart will acquire Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. The deal already gained approval from both companies' boards of directors and will reportedly close before year's end. The deal marks Wal-Mart's largest-ever acquisition, in a sign the company sees e-commerce as a central strategic priority amid slowing growth in its core retail business. The purchase price essentially doubles the $1.4 billion valuation Jet.com received during its latest round of fundraising in November. As part of the agreement, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will assume responsibility for Wal-Mart's e-commerce division, while also running Jet.com as an independent operating subsidiary. Image Source: Getty Images Lore, who reportedly stands to make some $750 million as the largest shareholder in Jet.com, is something of a visionary in the e-commerce industry. Along with several co-founders, Lore established and scaled the holding company Quidsi, which served as the parent company for Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com. After a protracted and highly public price war with Amazon, the Seattle-based e-commerce giant purchased Quidsi in 2010 for $545 million, making Lore one of the few entrepreneurs to successfully challenge the famously competitive Amazon and not completely lose his shirt. Investors weren't exactly sure what to make of the Jet.com deal, though it seems like a clear-cut win for Wal-Mart, price tag notwithstanding. A win for Wal-Mart? For its part, Wal-Mart gains two important assets as part of the purchase. The first is Jet.com's sophisticated pricing software. The second is Jet.com's executive team, which has what one publication described as "some of the best e-commerce operations minds in the business." Especially when layered atop Wal-Wart's supply-chain excellence and purchase-power scale, it doesn't take an overly active imagination to see how both Jet and Wal-Mart stand to benefit from each other's strengths. Though Wal-Mart launched its eponymous Walmart.com over 15 years ago, e-commerce has always been something of a strategic backwater for the world's most dominant brick-and-mortar chain. For context, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales last year -- though topping $13 billion -- accounted for just 3% of the company's whopping $482 billion in revenue. What's more, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth remains lower than the industry average and has decelerated in recent quarters. Clearly, the company needs some help if it ever hopes to credibly challenge Amazon's increasingly dominant grip on the e-commerce space. Judging by the market's initial reaction, investors may not view Wal-Mart's Jet.com purchase favorably; the stock traded down by nearly 1% on an essentially flat day for the broader market.  That falls well short of a sharp rebuke, but still suggests investors dislike the deal to some extent. There's certainly a case to be made that Amazon's leadership position in e-commerce will prove difficult to disrupt. Amazon's e-commerce business counts $99 billion in sales to Wal-Mart's roughly $13 billion. Its Prime subscription shopping and entertainment service continues to incentivize users to shift spending to Amazon. Though Wal-Mart recently launched a competitor service to Prime, it isn't clear what kind of reaction it has drawn from consumers.  I've long viewed the global e-commerce space -- with so much room for growth -- as a generational growth story, the true extent of which investors often overlook. Because of Wal-Mart's multiple structural advantages, it certainly seems possible for the company to carve out its own meaningful market share in this space. However, with Amazon seemingly as strong as ever, success will be harder to come by for Wal-Mart than, say, five years ago. Regardless, waiting to prioritize e-commerce would only make things harder for Wal-Mart, and adding Jet to its operational fold should certainly help in that effort.

This time, the giant retailer was determined not to whiff. On Monday, Wal-Mart announced the $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce upstart Jet.com, and named Lore, the company's co-founder and CEO, as head of online retail. It's a hefty price to pay — the most ever in e-commerce — for a 2-year-old company that's been burning millions of dollars a month and is nowhere near turning a profit. But Wal-Mart wasn't going to miss this opportunity. Not after what happened six years ago, when Lore's start-up Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, was snapped up by Amazon.com for $545 million following a bidding war. JPMorgan Chase, Wal-Mart's financial advisor then and now, was equally committed to aggressively closing the deal after missing out on Quidsi, according to sources familiar with the matter. Unlike in 2010, when Wal-Mart was up against Amazon as well as Walgreens in the bidding, there was no competition for Jet, sources said. Lore had spoken with other potential strategic investors because he knew Jet would require deep-pocketed financiers for years to come, but Wal-Mart was alone in pursuing an acquisition, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the talks were confidential. Lore didn't respond to a request for comment, and a representative from JPMorgan declined to comment. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said he doesn't have perspective on the Quidsi deal and that "Marc's reputation speaks for itself." Hargrove reiterated comments that CEO Doug McMillon made on a conference call on Monday. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said from Walmart.com's headquarters in San Bruno, California. "What he has built at Jet and his mindset at Jet does have application at Walmart, and that's really what led us to make the decision to let Marc be responsible for both Walmart and Jet." show chapters Wal-Mart buying Jet.com to compete with Amazon?    Monday, 8 Aug 2016 | 4:18 PM ET | 03:47 The acquisition includes a payout of $300 million in Wal-Mart shares. Lore's stake stands at around $750 million, according to Recode, but requires him to stick around and build up both Jet.com and Walmart.com. Neil Ashe, Wal-Mart's global e-commerce chief, is transitioning to other roles and then leaving the company. Some are referring to the deal as a high-priced acquihire because Jet was just getting off the ground. Lore's plan had been to serve customers with tremendous choice and a pleasurable experience while building a stronger economic model than Amazon. Algorithms help determine prices, which vary depending on how many items are in a customer's basket, the use of a debit card or credit card and whether a buyer waives the merchandise return option. Wal-Mart said Jet is on pace for $1 billion in gross merchandise volume and has 12 million products. "Jet.com brings a strong online presence, fresh perspective, and expertise on competing in the e-comm space and an attractive brand with appeal among millennials," analyst Jessica Schoen Mace of Nomura Securities wrote in a report. She recommends buying the stock and has a price target of $81. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6 percent on Monday to $73.34. With a stock market capitalization of $228.6 billion, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is equal to 1.4 percent of its value. More importantly, Wal-Mart is desperate to crack Amazon's online dominance. The company launched Walmart.com in 2000, six years after Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, but has never been able to close the gap. Amazon vs. Wal-Mart Bezos' shrewd business tactics were on full display in 2010, when the company was pursuing Quidsi. Amazon, Wal-Mart and Walgreens all approached Quidsi at about the same time. When Walgreens heard where the bidding was starting, it quickly bailed, sources said, eventually purchasing Drugstore.com the following year for $429 million. (The company said last month that it's shutting down Drugstore.com.) Meanwhile, Amazon took control of the process, as documented in Brad Stone's book "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon." Amazon was slashing the price on diapers on its own site, putting pressure on Quidsi's margins and making outside investors hesitant to put in more money. Furthermore, Amazon promised to keep dropping prices if Quidsi sold to Wal-Mart. "The Quidsi executives stuck with Amazon, largely out of fear," Stone wrote. Wal-Mart, for its part, was too focused on the pricing battle in a niche category and not looking at the long-term technology advantage that Lore and his team could bring to the company, said sources with knowledge of the deal. That was under Mike Duke, who was CEO from 2009 through early 2014. McMillon, who's been at Wal-Mart since 1984, succeeded Duke at the helm. The Jet purchase will be reviewed by regulators and is expected to close this year. McMillon and Lore are now teaming up to make sure that Amazon isn't the only game in town. Of course, this wasn't the plan. After being forced into a sale to Amazon and then working at the e-commerce giant for two years, Lore's ambition was not to land a top executive job at Wal-Mart. Rather, he'd set out to raise billions of dollars on a path to picking up enough market share to give customers actual choice in how and where they shopped online. Earlier this year, Lore responded to a question on the website Quora asking what would keep Jet from becoming the next Quidsi. "Amazon could afford to dramatically cut the price of diapers because it was such a small percentage of their business," Lore wrote. "As a mass marketplace, Jet is much more diversified than Diapers was, so we're better insulated against that kind of aggressive pricing." That may still be true, but getting there will require the strength of Wal-Mart's balance sheet. —CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report.

If the owner can't be found, Copiague town officials say they'll dispose of the boat. That could cost taxpayers $3,000 to $5,000. Newsday says the cruiser was dumped at the Tanner Park Marina last week. It's scrubbed of all identifying marks. The town turned to Facebook for help in identifying the owner. Copiague public safety director Pat Farrell says the boat is worthless. Its engine is shot. Farrell says he encounters about 11 such cases a year and recalls only about five of the owners being located. Consequences can include fines, labor costs and sometimes criminal charges. Suspected meth lab found under parking lot of Wal-Mart AMHERST (AP) -- Authorities say they've discovered what they believe is a methamphetamine lab under the parking lot of a suburban Buffalo Wal-Mart store. Police in the town of Amherst say officers on routine patrol found chemicals and other items used to make meth in an underground culvert that runs below the parking lot. Officers say the culvert is tall enough for a person to stand up in. Police and fire crews on Monday removed several jars of suspected meth from a manhole that's accessible from the culvert. Authorities say they plan to look at the Wal-Mart store's surveillance video to see if it shows people using the culvert. No arrests have been made yet. Woman sentenced for stealing $492K from company BUFFALO (AP) -- A 61-year-old western New York woman has been sentenced to prison time for stealing nearly half a million dollars from her longtime employer. The Erie County District Attorney's Office says Bernadette Szymanski of Cheektowaga was sentenced Monday to 1 2/3 to 5 years in prison. She pleaded guilty in May to a grand larceny charge. Prosecutors say Szymanski worked as the controller for FPPF Chemical Co. of Buffalo from 1991 until late 2015, when she was fired. Official say during a 13-year period that started in early 2002, she stole nearly $492,000 by committing payroll fraud and making unauthorized personal purchases on the company's credit card. The thefts were discovered after Szymanski became embroiled in a dispute with the company's owner. Szymanski so far has repaid $80,000 to the company. State to reimburse city $11.5M for cost of buying water NEWBURGH (AP) -- A Hudson Valley city has approved a contract that calls for the state to set aside up to $11.5 million to cover the municipality's cost of buying drinking water after a chemical was found in the city's main water supply. The Times Herald-Record of Middletown reports the contract with New York City was approved Monday. The deal calls for the state Department of Environmental Protection to send Newburgh a $2.4 million down payment upon approval of the contract by the state's comptroller's office. Washington Lake has long been Newburgh's primary water supply. It was closed in May because of the presence of a chemical known as PFOS. The chemical, which is used in firefighting foam, has been identified by environmental regulators as an emerging contaminant of concern. NYC officials seek ways to expand Brooklyn Bridge's walkway NEW YORK (AP) -- Transportation officials in New York City say they're exploring options to expand the Brooklyn Bridge's walkway to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Officials announced Monday they've commissioned a seven-month engineering study to assess how much weight the bridge can carry and consider options for expanding the promenade. The path extends on an elevated track above the six-lane road below and most of the walkway ranges from 10 to 17 feet wide. The city says the average number of pedestrians on the bridge during peak weekend hours has increased from 511 in May 2008 to more than 1,900 in May 2015. City Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg says they've received complaints that the promenade is narrow. But she says the study is a first step and an expansion could be complicated. Authorities find body of missing woman, 23, in Erie Canal PERINTON (AP) -- Authorities say they've found the body of a missing western New York woman in the Erie Canal. Monroe County Sheriff's deputies say 23-year-old Sonya Seetharam was found in the canal in Perinton around 11:30 a.m. on Monday. Investigators say she was reported missing by her family Saturday evening. Her body was spotted in an area near where marine and scuba units were searching. It's unclear when or how the Perinton woman got into the water. The woman's death remains under investigation. State's environmental magazine goes digital ALBANY (AP) -- The state Department of Environmental Conservation's 70-year-old outdoor magazine is going digital. Commissioner Basil Seggos says the Conservationist will now be available in both print and digital editions. The online edition will offer additional content, including video and audio files and more pictures. For a limited time, the August 2016 issue online is being made available free. Readers can subscribe on the website. A subscription to the Conservationist costs $12 for one year, or $21 for two years. Subscribers will get both the print and online editions. State warns against driver selfies, cites Instagram review ALBANY (AP) -- Authorities are warning New York drivers against taking selfies, citing a national review suggesting they are among the most likely to do it. It's generally illegal except in an emergency to use a handheld mobile device while driving in the Empire State. Terri Egan, executive deputy commissioner of the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, says taking selfies behind the wheel is "just irresponsible." The Auto Insurance Center website says it recently reviewed 70,000 Instagram posts with driving-related hashtags, including (hash)DrivingSelfie, (hash)SelfieWhileDriving, and (hash)HopeIDontCrash. New Yorkers ranked eighth nationally with 1.29 posts per 100,000 residents. AAA reports that a driver's eyes may leave the road for at least two seconds to snap a selfie, during which time a car can travel 176 feet at 60 miles per hour. Man grabs officer's gun, kills someone; cops wound him NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City police say a suspect grabbed and repeatedly fired an officer's gun, killing another man. A second officer wounded the suspect. Assistant Chief Larry Nikunen says uniformed officers were flagged down around 1 a.m. Tuesday to handle a dispute in a Bronx deli. As they were escorting a man out of the store, he ripped the gun out of an officer's holster. He fired the officer's gun numerous times. One of the shots fatally struck a man who'd had a dispute with the suspect. Another officer fired three shots at the suspect, hitting him twice. He was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Police say video recovered from the deli corroborates all of their information.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart and found sometimes Sam's prices were actually more expensive Cameron Huddleston, GoBankingRates.com Updated 8:57 am, Tuesday, August 9, 2016 Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart and found sometimes Sam's prices were actually more expensive. Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart... My husband and I had a membership at Sam's Club for years. But we dropped it two years ago because we didn't think we were shopping at the warehouse club enough to justify the $45 annual fee. A funny thing happened, though. I wrote an article for GOBankingRates earlier this year about secret ways to save money at Sam's Club. In doing research for the piece, I learned that Sam's had improved its merchandise and food items to compete better with Costco — which, unfortunately, doesn't have a store where I live. I discovered that it was offering deeply discounted products through limited-time deals and auctions on its website. So I started wondering, "Did we make a mistake by dropping our membership? Should we give Sam's another try?" You can probably guess what happened. We were lured back in. We decided to fork over $45 for a membership, thinking we'd get more out of it now that our kids are a little older and eating more, especially our 4-year-old son who is an eating machine. To see if our membership is actually saving us money, I did some comparison shopping — something I should've done before joining, but hindsight is 20/20. Be aware that I was not looking for the best and worst deals at Sam's Club. Here's what I found.

I did a per-unit price comparison to figure out how much I would have to pay to get the same amount or size of an item at Wal-Mart as is available at Sam's, which sells things in larger quantities. I was skeptical that I was saving enough at Sam's to justify the annual cost. So I was surprised by what I found after adding up prices on the same item at both stores, adjusting for size and amount. The winner: Sam's Club by $87. The total for item's purchased at Sam's would be $410.93, and the total at Wal-Mart would be $498.09. I know what you're thinking: What in the world is she buying that costs so much? Included in my sample basket of goods were several high-priced items, namely over-the-counter medication, personal grooming products, batteries, party supplies such as paper plates and cleaning products like detergent. These items likely would only have to be purchased once a year, but I wanted to find out whether they were actually a better deal when purchased in bulk. Removing those items, Sam's still came out ahead by about $30 — $189.92 versus $219.49 at Wal-Mart. WHERE I'M SAVING Medication: The biggest savings at Sam's, by far, were on over-the-counter medications. A bottle of generic Ibuprofen with 1,200 tablets cost $10.88 at the Sam's I checked. I would have to pay $15.56 for the same number of generic Ibuprofen tablets at Wal-Mart. A three-pack of Flonaise nasal spray with 360 metered sprays is $49.98, but would cost $67.41 for the same amount at Wal-Mart. And I'd save $8 by buying Allegra in bulk at Sam's — yes, I have allergies. Total savings on medicine by shopping at Sam's: $30.14. Also, I'd only need to buy these items once a year at Sam's because the large quantities would last a while. Batteries: We go through batteries quickly with our kids' toys — and they are significantly cheaper at Sam's. A pack of 34 AAA Duracell batteries costs $16.98 at Sam's but would cost $23.21 for the same number of batteries at Wal-Mart. And party supplies, such as heavy duty paper plates, are a much better deal at Sam's, costing $15.63 for a pack of 100 Chinet brand oval platters at Sam's versus $22 for the same number at Wal-Mart. Food: Even several everyday items were cheaper. For example, I would pay about $5 less in total to buy snack items such as granola bars, tortilla chips and Goldfish crackers in bulk at Sam's than for the same amount of those items at Wal-Mart. And fruits and vegetables that my family eats lots of and wouldn't go bad if bought in bulk — including grapes, spinach, apples, strawberries, bananas, blueberries, tomatoes and potatoes — would cost me about $8 less at Sam's Club than buying the same amount at Wal-Mart. WHERE I'M NOT SAVING Although I would see big savings on some items, the price on other things are about the same or even less at Wal-Mart. Soda — I occasionally drink Coke Zero — costs nearly twice as much per can at Sam's than at Wal-Mart. I also wouldn't save any by buying toilet paper at Sam's. In fact, I would pay about $1 more for the same number of rolls and same brand at Sam's than at Wal-Mart. A 3-liter bottle of extra virgin olive oil costs the same at both stores. And there's only a 10 cent difference in price per pound for chicken breasts at the two stores. I'LL KEEP MY MEMBERSHIP ... FOR NOW If I actually make use of my membership by buying the products I found to be cheaper at Sam's, then it's worth it for me to pay the $45 annual fee. However, I can't do all of my shopping there because we couldn't eat some bulk items fast enough to avoid waste. And it doesn't carry all of the items my family enjoys. That means I still have to make trips to the grocery store. As a working mom of three kids, I don't have a lot of time to shop at several stores throughout the month to get the best deals. So I'll just have to use my Sam's membership to buy items that will last longer and only make occasional trips to the warehouse club. Or my family might have to make some changes to what it eats so we can do all of our shopping at Sam's to maximize savings.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT 1. Walmart acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion Walmart is buying startup internet retailer Jet.com for $3 billion, Walmart executives disclosed on Monday. The deal marks the most ever paid for a new e-commerce company. Walmart has bought 15 startups over the last five years as it tries to make its online division more competitive with online retail giant Amazon. The acquisition of Jet.com, launched in July 2015 by entrepreneur Marc Lore, gives Walmart the startup's innovative pricing software, which Walmart plans to integrate into its own store while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. 2. Delta cancels 250 more flights as it recovers from computer outage Delta Airlines canceled 250 flights on Tuesday as it struggled to get back to normal after a power outage at its Atlanta base disrupted its operations worldwide. About 200 other flights could be delayed. On Monday, the computer glitch forced the carrier to cancel about 1,000 flights. Limited flights resumed after a six-hour halt to Delta traffic. Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized to travelers, and said restoring the computer systems and getting back on schedule was "an all hands on deck effort." Delta is offering stranded passengers refunds and $200 travel vouchers. 3. Barclays agrees to pay states $100 million in rate-rigging settlement British bank Barclays has agreed to pay $100 million to 44 U.S. states to end state investigations of alleged manipulation of interest rates from 2005 to 2009. The scheme allegedly hid evidence of Barclays' poor health during the global financial crisis, inflating borrowing costs linked to the U.S. and London interbank offer, or Libor, rates. "There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes big banks and other financial institutions" that manipulate financial markets, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. 4. Lending Club CFO resigns Loan marketplace Lending Club announced Monday that its chief financial officer, Carrie Dolan, is stepping down to "pursue a new opportunity." The news came three months after the company ousted its founder and CEO, Renaud Laplanche, over his failure to report details on problematic loan sales to an investment bank. The company's shares, which have lost two-thirds of their value in the past year, fell by nine cents to $4.70 in after-hours trading. 5. Fox News' Tantaros says she was pulled off air after complaining about Ailes harassment Fox News host Andrea Tantaros says through a lawyer that she complained several times to senior executives that the cable news company's now-ousted chief, Roger Ailes, has sexually harassed her before she was yanked off the air in April. Her lawyer said he believed her sidelining was "retaliatory." The claim counters earlier statements by Fox News senior executives that they were unaware of any accusations against Ailes until former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against him in July. The company says Tantaros was taken off the air for violating company policy — and her contract — by failing to submit her latest book for review.

Walmart Pay vs. Apple Pay: Hardware age dictates all Walmart went nuclear and banned Visa from Canada Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing If you have $3.3 billion lying around, why not buy a startup? That is exactly what Walmart is doing. The retail giant is buying two-year-old e-commerce startup Jet.com in an attempt to invigorate its online sales division. Walmart is dropping a lot of money on this deal, but it hopes to get a lot in return.  In IT Blogwatch, we hit 'buy' now. What are the deal's details? Erika Morphy gives us the background: Walmart...is...buying Jet.com, an e-commerce site...for the tidy sum of $3.3 billion, $3 billion of which will be in cash, to augment its own online sales operations. ... Jet.com's customer base does not align with Walmart's customers, which could be a point in the deal's favor...only a fifth of Jet.com buyers have purchased from Walmart.com in the most recent 6-month period. Millions of people have bought items from Jet.com, but it may not be an household name for everyone. So what do we know about the e-commerce site? Jason Del Rey fills in the blanks: Jet sells more than 12 million products...A little less than a third of its sales volume comes from items that Jet stores in its...warehouses and sells directly to customers. ... Jet has...a discounting model, dubbed the Smart Cart, that rewards customers with greater discounts as they add more items to their order...[It] also gives customers additional discounts if they forfeit the right to return an item, or [if they] pay with a debit card...Four million people have made a purchase on Jet since it launched. But what is Walmart's impetus for buying Jet? Turns out, this is part of a larger trend. Nandita Bose has some insight into Walmart's purchase: The deal...follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Walmart...has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. ... Walmart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year...as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. So if the Jet purchase helps Walmart catch up with Amazon, this deal could turn out well for both companies. But they aren't the only ones happy with this deal. It promises to pay out nicely for at least one Pennsylvania family. Anita Balakrishnan has the details: Walmart's...acquisition of...Jet.com was potentially a flush exit for early employees and its familiar big-name investors...But it was also a probably huge windfall for 10 people who -- like Pennsylvania's Eric Martin -- won significant equity in the company. ... Martin won 100,000 shares in Jet.com...as part of a contest aimed to get users to refer the most family and friends to the...site. That means he'll likely get some...slice of Jet's $3.3 billion price tag, along with a handful of other contest winners, who each got 10,000 shares. So what does this mean for tech buyouts in the future? Matthew Bradley thinks he knows: The Jet.com acquisition...soon to become known as the Silicon Valley hustle. It'll happen to Coca-Cola next.

Matt Krantz , USA TODAY 6:30 a.m. EDT August 9, 2016 In this May 16, 2011 photo, the Wal-Mart logo is displayed in Springfield, Ill. What Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says about how it's reversing a slump in its namesake U.S. business will be at the front of analysts' minds at the company's annual meeting with Wall Street Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2011. (Photo: Seth Perlman, AP) Q: Is Walmart more attractive with Jet? A: Walmart (WMT) is betting $3.3 billion it can take on Amazon.com (AMZN) on its home turf: Online. It has much to prove before investors will buy it. Walmart, the nation’s top retailer, is buying online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet has ramped up its name recognition with consumers and is developing ways to secure discounts on merchandise in a bid to rival Amazon’s retail business. Walmart, which still gets a majority of its business from physical stores, needs to reinvigorate growth especially with online shoppers. Make no mistake, Amazon’s growth is stellar. The company’s adjusted profit this fiscal year is expected to jump 356% to $5.70 a share, says S&P Global Markets Intelligence. Walmart, in comparison, is expected to see a 7.4% decline in adjusted profit this fiscal year. But in some ways, Amazon is opening the door for companies that are more focused on retail. Amazon is increasingly looking to get more business outside of retail, including cloud technology services. If Walmart can focus on retail, there could be an in. Investors aren’t convinced, though. Analysts rate Walmart a “hold” and have an 18-month price target that’s 6% lower than Monday’s price. USA TODAY markets reporter Matt Krantz answers a different reader question every weekday.

Jet gamifies shopping for CPG products, an experience not usually identified with fun.” eMarketer estimates that this year, ecommerce sales account for just 2.8% of revenues at Wal-Mart, which makes the bulk of its revenues at brick-and-mortar stores. But retail store sales growth has slowed dramatically in the past few years, down to just 1.6% in 2015 and into negative territory this year, according to company reports. Ecommerce sales, meanwhile, are growing at Wal-Mart—but there too the company’s 2016 performance is worse than the US average, according to eMarketer estimates. eMarketer expects US retail ecommerce sales to rise by nearly 16% this year, substantially faster than Wal-Mart’s estimated ecommerce sales growth of 9.4% for 2016 and the 6.8% growth estimated for the past 12 months. “Wal-Mart clearly needs to do something to jumpstart its ecommerce strategy, and adding Jet.com’s management team—and brand—seems like a very smart move,” said eMarketer analyst Yory Wurmser. “Jet.com’s expertise is in fulfillment optimization and pricing. Given Wal-Mart’s scale and physical store footprint, these improvements could turn Wal-Mart into a formidable price competitor to Amazon. “Second, Jet’s brand could attract some customers who are turned off by Wal-Mart’s brand, either by poor ecommerce experiences in the past or by unhappiness with the core Wal-Mart brand itself,” noted Wurmser. Overall, eMarketer estimates that 8.2% of total retail sales in the US will be transacted via digital channels this year—again, much higher than the share of Wal-Mart’s revenues from ecommerce sales. And the categories Jet focuses on tend to be even more reliant than average on brick-and-mortar stores. Euromonitor reported in June that just 3.0% of 2015 dog and cat food sales in the US occurred via digital, for example—and that was the CPG category with the most ecommerce sales. For paper towels, by contrast, ecommerce sales made up just 0.3% of the total. And these figures are not changing much. In 2014, 2.8% of dog and cat food sales were ecommerce sales, along with 0.3% of paper towel sales. eMarketer does not break out CPG sales specifically in its ecommerce sales estimates. The health and personal care subcategory will see 7.2% of US sales occurring online this year, while food and beverage (which includes groceries as well as packaged food and beverages) will have just 2.5% of sales transacted online.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 9 August 2016 | MYT 3:14 PM Wal-Mart buying Jet.com to lift online sales, battle Amazon Set to fly: Wal-Mart Stores Inc will pay about US$3bil (RM12.1bil) for Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. — Reuters Wal-Mart Stores Inc, vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc, will pay about US$3bil (RM12.1bil) for Internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. The deal disclosed on Aug 8 follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by Internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around US$3bil in cash and US$300mil (RM1.21bil) in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about US$500mil (RM2.02bil), the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. Billions spent on online efforts  Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7%, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3% to US$13.7bil (RM55.24bil), compared with a 16% jump to US$92.4bil (RM372.56bil) for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of US$3.1bil (RM12.5bil) for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online. — Reuters You May Be Interested Samsung Galaxy S7 could be coming in Glossy Black Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Meet Wan Hazmer, the man who put Malaysia on the Final Fantasy XV map M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

After years of forcing department and big-box stores out of business, is Amazon "taking market share" from QVC? asked Barton Crockett, retail analyst for FBR Capital Markets, in an investor conference call Friday with QVC boss Michael George. "The biggest drop was clearly in fashion, which had been the thing that was propelling our business," George admitted. Still, citing internal customer interviews, George said QVC's heavy users - mostly working-age women - use Amazon for mundane purchases like "pet food and cleaning supplies," not clothes or other QVC mainstays. He said QVC expects sales to recover later this year. Shares rose nearly 4 percent Monday. Meanwhile, in Hoboken, Marc Lore, the Bucknell grad who sold Diapers.com (Qdisi) to Amazon.com for $500 million six years ago, had another fat payday Monday. He, his partners, and their investors sold Jet.com, their high-tech warehouse development in Swedesboro near the Commodore Barry Bridge, and other assets, to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. With client sales of $1 billion a year from retailers including Barnes & Noble, GNC, Toys "R" Us, and Sports Authority (now in bankruptcy), Jet will now help Walmart, the nation's largest retail chain, try to catch up to Amazon's long lead in direct-from-the-warehouse retail. Walmart wants Jet for the company's "dynamic pricing and sourcing," said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer at Radial (formerly eBay Enterprise), a King of Prussia company that manages mobile and online sales for retailers. "One of Jet.com's value propositions is that they are able to reprice items in your basket, based on the other items you buy," Weitz told me. "Jet is able to do this because they are constantly repricing their goods based on the [profit] margins they've decided they need to hit," and the savings from sending many items to a single buyer. The software needed to match profit targets to inventory and location, adjust prices, and deliver on time "is a phenomenally complex computer science task" - and has special resonance for Walmart, Weitz added. Jet's "dynamic pricing" recalls Walmart's former "Rollback" in-store price-cut program, which relied on old-fashioned inventory and sales tracking to target products for discounts. By bringing back Rollback-like savings online, Jet.com makes Walmart more appealing to longtime customers as they move online, so they'll buy more and keep coming back, Weitz said. The deal enriches Jet founders and investors: Jet raised around $470 million from venture capitalists at Boston's Fidelity and Bain investment firms, Philadelphia-based MentorTech, Accel Partners and Google Ventures of Silicon Valley, New Enterprise Associates of suburban Washington, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and others, mostly in 2014, according to SEC reports.

By: Reuters | Published:August 9, 2016 12:48 pm Wal-Mart Stores vying to better challenge Amazon.com will pay about billion for internet retailer Jet.com. (Source: Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc, vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc , will pay about $3 billion for internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart’s online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. “One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. “Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent.” McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. “Marc’s e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive,” McMillon said. Wal-Mart’s current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet’s revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet’s revenue, according to analysts.

Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. “The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China’s 2 e-commerce firm. BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart’s online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.

The deal announced Monday shows Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. In June, it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. Analysts say Wal-Mart buying Hoboken-based Jet.com still won't enable it to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help widen the gap between itself and other retailers online. The deal also reflects the difficulties for start-ups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online start-ups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Union Township-based Bed, Bath & Beyond bought One Kings Lane. "This acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. "As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online." As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Jet.com will maintain separate brands. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it also will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart" technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal provides big financial backing. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart." Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement the combination of Wal-Mart's retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business of Jet.com will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore also has experience competing with Amazon as CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million back in 2010. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lore will take a senior leadership position on the e-commerce side of Wal-Mart and that Wal-Mart's top online executive, Neil Ashe, is expected to depart. Wal-Mart and Jet.com each declined to comment on that. In its fiscal year ended in January, Wal-Mart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com's annual net revenue of $107 billion. O'Shea noted that Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Wal-Mart in online sales in the U.S. But Wal-Mart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon's Prime program. But while Amazon's Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. Jet.com has also faced plenty of challenges. Three months after it launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 percent to 5 percent instead of larger discounts. O'Shea noted that Wal-Mart is "paying a lot" for Jet.com, but it was too soon to say if it overpaid.

Here, a Walmart store is seen in Chinatown, Los Angeles, Jan. 16, 2016. Photo: MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images UPDATE: 6 p.m. EDT — Walmart formally announced Monday its takeover of online retailer Jet.com “for approximately $3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be paid over time. Additionally, $300 million of Walmart shares will be paid over time as part of the transaction.” In a statement, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said of the acquisition: “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want. We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities.” Original story: After being subject to rumors for over a week, Walmart and Jet.com are expected to announce a $3 billion deal on Monday under which the brick-and-mortar retailing giant will buy the online retailer, according to various reports. Confirmation of the deal was first reported Saturday by Bloomberg, which, citing unnamed sources, said the terms of the acquisition will require that the startup founder Marc Lore continues “to head the retailer’s online division for several years.” Previously, Lore has worked for Amazon.com, the market leader in online retail sector and a rival that Walmart has been trying to close the gap with. Before spending over two years with Amazon, Lore was also competing with the e-commerce company when he founded Quidsi, known best for its Diapers.com business. He was forced to sell the company to Amazon in 2010 but after quitting Amazon, Lore started Jet.com, his new e-commerce venture, in 2015.

Compared to Amazon’s $99 billion annual revenue from e-commerce operations, Walmart has a fraction at $14 billion, Recode reported. “Wal-Mart still struggles with things like third party marketplaces which Marc and his team have successfully built,” Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., told Bloomberg. Recode, which also spoke to unnamed sources familiar with the deal, said Neil Ashe, Walmart’s current global e-commerce chief, will depart after a transition period. For his part, Lore is expected to make about $750 million from the deal, since he owns 25 percent of Jet.com. The deal was signed Friday and is expected to be announced Monday, TechCrunch reported.

The hefty price underscores how Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. Analysts say the acquisition still won’t enable Wal-Mart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online retailers. Investor suits against VW move ahead FRANKFURT, GERMANY Investor lawsuits claiming up to $4.5 billion in damages against Volkswagen over its diesel emissions scandal are moving ahead in German courts. Investors claim that Volkswagen did not inform them in a timely way of the impending scandal over cars with software that enabled them to cheat on emissions tests in the United States, depriving them of a chance to decide whether to sell the stock. The company has reached a $15 billion settlement with U.S. authorities.

All Rights Reserved Newspaper web site content management software and services 2016-08-03 / Front Page Tweet Print Apparent drug lab in sewer discovered by police Amherst police are currently investigating an apparent illegal drug lab housed within a sewer line underneath a Walmart parking lot. According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. The detective said that at as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether there are other similar types of labs in the area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m.  Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311.

Today the company is making another big bet towards that path by confirming it will be buying Jet.com, online-only shopping site that has been live for a little over a year, for $3 billion in cash plus up to $300 million in shares for Jet founders. The deal is expected to close towards the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval, making this one of the largest-ever acquisitions of an e-commerce company. Jet’s founder Marc Lore will reportedly lead Walmart’s e-commerce operations after the deal closes, replacing Neil Ashe after a transitional period. Lore previously co-founded Diapers.com’s parent company and sold it to Amazon for $550 million in 2011. Walmart currently has 11,527 stores in 28 countries with a total annual revenue of $482 billion and $15 billion in profits last year. E-commerce represents just a drop in the bucket with $14 billion in annual e-commerce sales, a far cry from Amazon’s roughly $100 billion, and its growth rate has reportedly decelerated for five consecutive quarters. With the acquisition of Jet.com the retail giant hopes to reinvigorate online sales. Wal-Mart and Jet plan to maintain distinct brands, with Wal-Mart's website continuing to focus on emphasizing the company's "everyday low price" strategy. While still not profitable and burning through advertising money at a rate of $20 million to $25 million per month to fund its growth, Jet has been adding more than 400,000 new shoppers each month and processes an average of 25,000 orders daily. The site sells more than 12 million products through its own warehouses and a network of third-party sellers. Aside from acquiring a growing e-commerce operation, Walmart is also interested in Jet’s back end technology, which can identify in real time which orders should be routed to which vendors to get the lowest fulfillment and shipping costs and pass some of that savings to customers.

Brown/Getty Images Tech Shira Ovide Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering technology. She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 8, 2016 3:42 PM EDT FACEBOOK INC-A -1.31 As of 1:59 PM EST 120.16 USD WAL-MART STORES INC +0.64 As of 1:59 PM EST 70.76 USD Walmart is trying to solve its online problems with a $3.3 billion acquisition that can't be justified with any conventional financial analysis.  But for validation of its deal splurge, the folks in Bentonville, Arkansas, can look west to Menlo Park, California. There, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made three overpriced acquisitions that turned out to be the smartest moves the company ever made. Facebook has struck a collective $22 billion worth of acquisitions for Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Facebook issued 279 million shares -- or 10 percent of the company's total outstanding shares as of July 25 -- for three companies that barely had revenue, let alone profits, at the time of the acquisitions. Oculus didn't even really have a product for sale when Facebook agreed to buy the virtual reality startup in 2014. When Facebook agreed to pay up to $19 billion for WhatsApp, the deal was so surprising and costly that some people thought the initial acquisition announcement might be a hoax. Good Buy Of Facebook's four main products with at least 500 million monthly users, two of them are companies Facebook acquired Source: Facebook Note: Monthly user count for Facebook also includes Messenger. Facebook's trio of deals makes Walmart's spending 1.4 percent of its stock market value for Jet seem sane -- as though Walmart bought a sensible Hyundai after a careful reading of Consumer Reports, while Zuckerberg went out for a gallon of milk and happened to come home with a fleet of Ferraris. Yet Facebook's acquisitions have since become foundations for the company's user growth and strategy long into the future. Facebook now has four products with at least 500 million monthly users. Two of those are the acquired Instagram (500 million monthly users) and WhatsApp (more than 1 billion at last disclosure in February).  Of the three, Instagram is the only one that so far has started to carry its weight financially. Research firm MoffettNathanson has estimated Instagram's yearly revenue could reach $3.7 billion in the next few years. Instagram also is Facebook's best chance to blunt the threat from teen favorite Snapchat. The sales and the competitive parry have already more than justified the Instagram purchase.  Oculus is on its way to sanity status, too. The company started selling its first virtual reality headset this year, and Cantor Fitzgerald estimates VR could account for roughly 10 percent of Facebook revenue by 2020.  Freewheeling Deals Facebook has been willing to spend big chunks of its market value on its acqusitions of Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp Source: Company filings For the moment, Facebook has been appropriately cautious about squeezing money from WhatsApp. The smartphone calling app has dropped its tiny subscription fee, which was WhatsApp's only source of revenue. Executives have talked in broad strokes about how WhatsApp could make money by connecting businesses with their customers -- Delta, for example, might pay WhatsApp to contact frequent fliers left stranded by Monday's flight-system glitch. For a glimpse at the financial potential of WhatsApp's audience, if the app started making one-tenth of Facebook's current average of $3.82 for each user, WhatsApp could churn $382 million in yearly sales.  Of course, the ink is barely dry on Walmart's acquisition contract with Jet, and it remains to be seen whether Walmart has the same acquisition wisdom as Facebook. Plus picking the right deals is only half the battle. The other trick is what happens after the purchase, when the buyer has to integrate a new company's operations with its own or let it carry on with relative independence.  Best Reaction to Facebook's WhatsApp Acquisition “They should call it WTFapp.” Facebook has opted for the light integration approach. It basically set up Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp as independent fiefs inside of Facebook. Even now, Instagram is the only one of the three that is even marginally part of Facebook's broader advertising sales machine. Based on Walmart's early comments about its Jet deal, the big box retailer plans to leave Jet as an autonomous island and seek to harness Jet executives' experience in e-commerce to help cure Walmart's decades of incompetence in online shopping.  There's an axiom of dealmaking that most corporate acquisitions aren't worth it. But it's interesting that both Google and Facebook -- arguably the two most ascendant of the tech superpowers -- turned acquisitions that looked like expensive head-scratchers into foundations of their tech empires. Just as it would be hard to imagine Facebook without its trio of deals, Google wouldn't be Google without its purchases of DoubleClick and YouTube.   Walmart is all about encouraging shoppers to hunt for good prices. But sometimes expensive deals wind up looking incredibly smart.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The count of issued shares includes restricted stock doled out to employees of the acquired companies.  I'm less sanguine about Google's priciest purchase, its $10 billion deal for Motorola struck in 2011, and its more recent purchase of thermostat maker Nest Labs.  To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Percentage Of Least-Popular Items Amazon Discounts 1% Secret Weapon How Retailers Can Fight Amazon on Black Friday Consumer Shira Ovide Leaping Deere Leaping Deere Deere shares spiked to a record after the company reported earnings that weren't as awful as expected Source: Bloomberg Overkill Enough Fawning Over Deere Industrials Brooke Sutherland Leaky Roofs Leaky Roofs Foxtons shares have been hit hard by the Brexit vote but have also underperformed web-based peers Source: Bloomberg Fee Fail Tech's Big Chance to Help Generation Rent Real Estate Lionel Laurent That Sounds Gross $1.32 Fine-Tuning AT&T Plays It Forward Tech Rani Molla Annual Revenue From PC Hardware $174 billion Hold the Eulogy Don't Write Off the PC Just Yet Tech Shira Ovide Peaked Interest Peaked Interest The market expectations for a Fed interest rate increase in December have hit 100% Source: Bloomberg Switchback Bond Market's November Surprise Markets Lisa Abramowicz Wrong Way Wrong Way Rocket Internet's shares are far below their initial public offering price Source: Bloomberg Startup Factory Rocket Internet's Trajectory Shift Tech Leila Abboud Back in Black Back in Black The big five panel manufacturers have posted enough profit in 2016 to wipe out two-and-a-half years of aggregate losses Source: Bloomberg Note: Shows aggregate net income for JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, and Yingli Green Energy.

Not working at a startup, but still cashing in on its acquisition, can feel pretty good too, as Eric Martin learned when Jet.com Inc sold to Wal-Mart Stores Inc in a US$3.3 billion (RM13.3 billion) deal. Martin, who works for a custom bath installation company, received 100,000 Jet shares last year when he won a contest to see who could get the most people to sign up for memberships to the online shopping site. He spent US$18,000 on online ads and came away with a stake now worth millions in one of 2015’s buzziest startups. “It feels good; it feels really good,” Martin, a York, Pennsylvania, resident, said in a phone interview during his lunch break. “The way I think to describe it is ‘occasional hysterical laughing.'” Martin, 30, has no idea what his stake is worth, though Fusion reported last year that his shares may be valued from US$10 million to US$20 million. The cash-and-stock sale to Wal-Mart could have boosted that since Jet’s private valuation was pegged at around US$1.5 billion last November, but the company has also raised money since Martin won his shares. That could have reduced the value of his stake because startups sometimes give preferential shares to later-term investors that can squeeze out smaller investors or employees. Martin, who works in digital marketing, said he’s still waiting for Jet to tell him how much his stake is worth, but he’s hoping it’s in the “multi-millions.” Wal-Mart’s purchase gives the world’s largest retailer a way to boost its online offering and better compete with Amazon.com Inc. Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, worked at Amazon for about two years after selling his previous company to the e-commerce behemoth. He founded Jet as a members-only online retailer, aiming to cut prices below even what Amazon could offer. He’s raised more than US$500 million in venture capital. While he waits to find out exactly how rich he is, Martin is thinking about his own startup, Ideadash.com, an online portal that lets people post their ideas for inventions or businesses and get others to execute on them while retaining a stake in the project. “I’m weighing my options,” he said. “I’ve got to take time to process all this.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Wal-Mart reviews Welspun records after Target pulls sheets Wal-Mart in talks to buy online retailer Jet.com, says report Wal-Mart to sell China online unit to JD.com for a 5pc stake Bank blunder millionaire spent bulk of A$4.6 million on designer handbags, ‘deluxe vacuum cleaner’ Wal-Mart sues Visa over chip cards in US Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT The largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company likely won't be enough for Wal-Mart (WMT) to dethrone Amazon (AMZN). But there's no shame in playing for second. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.77 +0.65 +0.92% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 777.63 -7.70 -0.98% In a bid to juice its online business, the world's largest retailer agreed Monday to purchase Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal. The acquisition will beef up Wal-Mart's e-commerce prowess, from deepening its bench of talent to finding the cheapest way to ship online orders. These capabilities should help Wal-Mart grab a larger piece of the growing e-commerce pie. They're also the best chance it has of closing the wide — and growing — gap between it and Amazon, analysts said. "Amazon's got this huge lead. That lead is going to be tough to relinquish but there's a lot of [share] out there," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told CNBC. Amazon's North America sales topped $62 billion last year. Forrester estimates the company grew its U.S. retail business by $23 billion, accounting for roughly 60 percent of total digital sales growth here. Those numbers are enviable, especially among its bricks-and-mortar competitors. Still, with Forrester calling for $373 billion in online revenue in the U.S. this year, "there's room for everybody to grow," O'Shea said. "These guys aren't just kind of sitting there and letting the world do what it wants to do," O'Shea said. Though Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth its slowing, its $13.6 billion in digital revenue already make it the second-largest online retailer. Yet even if it remains in second place, Jet is still worth the hefty price tag, analysts said. "I think they're playing for first and they may have a chance at it, but even if they take second place, there's a broad [range]," said Drew Carter, a managing director at AlixPartners. For instance, if an acquisition pumps Wal-Mart's digital growth from, say, 10 percent to 15 percent, "it's probably worthwhile," he said. © Provided by CNBC Buying Jet was necessary for Wal-Mart to have a shot at catching Amazon, Carter said. Not only does the online brand give Wal-Mart a fresh roster of digital talent, it can also help the company fine-tune its shipping and online logistics — a crucial part of preserving margins. Jet's co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will lead both Jet and Wal-Mart.com, bringing his vast e-commerce experience as a co-founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was sold to Amazon. These factors outweigh the fact that Jet is not yet profitable, Carter said. "The potentially dilutive nature of the Jet acquisition, that's very short term," he said. "The long-term value is buying their way into this expertise." On a call with reporters Monday afternoon, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said his company would help Jet become profitable more quickly than it could on its own. O'Shea added that the lofty $3.3 billion price tag makes sense for Wal-Mart to pay, as it shifts its capital expenditures from its bricks-and-mortar stores to the web. Even as the company invests in its online operations and higher wages, it's spending less capital overall. The retailer's capital expenditures budget for the five years ended January 2012 was roughly $15.5 billion, during which time it opened more than 3,000 stores, O'Shea said. That compares with $14.6 billion over the last four years, when it only opened 1,000 stores. Many of those were smaller format, making them less capital intensive. Wal-Mart had $7.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter. The company's shares were slightly lower, near $73, in afternoon trading. The world's largest retailer said a portion of the $3 billion it's paying for Jet, along with $300 million in Wal-Mart shares, will be spent over time. Terms of those payments were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approval. After the deal closes, Wal-Mart and Jet plan to maintain distinct brands, with Wal-Mart's website continuing to focus on emphasizing the company's "everyday low price" strategy, while Jet.com provides a curated experience that targets millennials. Although Jet has been operating its site for only a little more than a year, it has already reached $1 billion in run-rate gross merchandise value, and boasts a growing customer base of urban and millennial customers. The site says it has been adding more than 400,000 new shoppers each month and processes an average of 25,000 orders daily. In an attempt to dethrone Amazon, Jet uses an algorithm that it promises will deliver lower prices. Customers can save by buying in bulk from the site, or by forgoing the chance to make a return. The company originally planned to charge a $50 annual fee, but that was quickly nixed. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across [our] priorities," McMillon said. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart." —CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Aug 8, 2016 at 5:25PM While hundreds of companies will report quarterly results in August, there are two that stand out. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in the graphics card market, will need to keep up its recent pace of growth in order to justify its increasingly lofty valuation. And brick-and-mortar retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), faced with a tectonic shift toward e-commerce, has its hands full returning to earnings growth while taking on the Amazon.com juggernaut. Here's what investors need to know about these two companies. The graphics card king Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA has consolidated its lead in the discrete graphics card market over the past two years, claiming a nearly 80% unit market share during the first quarter and leaving Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with the scraps. At the same time, NVIDIA's push into the data center, pitching its GPUs as ideal accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, has created a fast-growing business for the company. NVIDIA will report its second-quarter results after the market close on Aug. 11. The stock has been on fire over the past year, up about 175%, as investors have increasingly bet that the company's profits will soar in the future. NVIDIA is at the center of a buzzword trifecta -- artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars -- and investors can't get enough of the company's stock. With NVIDIA stock now trading for more than 50 times last year's earnings, the company will need to impress when it reports its second-quarter results. Sales of its high-end gaming GPUs have been consistently strong, and that's unlikely to change with AMD offering no real alternative at the moment. But further market share gains will be tough, especially with AMD going after the mainstream portion of the market aggressively. And NVIDIA's growth businesses, including data center and automotive, are still small relative to the core PC GPU business. With the stock priced at an optimistic level, NVIDIA will need to show that it can produce the earnings growth that investors are expecting. Everyday low prices Image source: Wal-Mart. Retail behemoth Wal-Mart expects its earnings to decline during the second quarter, results for which it will announce on Aug. 18. The company has been making major investments in higher wages for its employees, new training programs, and e-commerce, sacrificing profits in the short-term in an effort to drive growth and customer satisfaction in the long-term. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $0.95 and $1.08 in per-share earnings, compared to $1.08 during the second quarter of last year. Already, some of these initiatives are bearing fruit. The U.S. business has reported positive comparable sales for seven quarters in a row, and customer service scores are improving. The e-commerce business is growing, albeit slowly, as Wal-Mart expands initiatives like its ShippingPass program and its online grocery pickup service. Wal-Mart's $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet demonstrates how much of a priority online sales have become for the company. Jet launched last year to substantial buzz, promising to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on how many items shoppers buy. With the Jet acquisition, Wal-Mart is following the same strategy that it always has -- offering the lowest prices possible. Investors shouldn't expect much improvement when it comes to profitability anytime soon, as Wal-Mart doesn't expect meaningful earnings growth to return until fiscal 2019. But the company needs to keep showing progress, particularly positive comparable sales growth in its U.S. business. A surprise drop in sales would likely undo some of the stock's gains this year.

Donald Trump, with his unfiltered rhetoric and lack of political experience, may be ushering Hillary Clinton into the White House, according to self-described swing-voter moms, who are more resigned than enthusiastic about that prospect. Participants in two small discussion groups of up-for-grabs female voters in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, described their presidential choice as the “lesser of two evils” Tuesday evening as Democratic and Republican pollsters and journalists listened in. In both cities, moderators asked the women a series of questions, including “How can Trump win?”  “If something happens and Hillary Clinton is indicted,” replied Joanna, a 30-year-old mother of four from Phoenix, who said she’s a homemaker and undecided about the presidential contest.  Like nine others in her focus group of 10, Joanna predicted Trump would lose to Clinton this fall. Their predictions aligned precisely with 10 mothers gathered separately in Columbus. “I think Donald Trump is going to say something that’s going to scare everyone,” predicted Gidget, a married mother of two and customer service manager from Columbus, who nonetheless said she’s leaning toward voting for the New York businessman. “They’ll think, ‘Whoa, he’s off the chain.’” “He’s a jerk,” said Ruth, a client service specialist from Columbus, describing Trump. “That’s just who he is,” she added, pointing to his TV persona when he starred in the reality series “The Apprentice.” The women, all mothers who shop regularly at Wal-Mart, were paid to participate and screened as likely voters. They described an election climate many said they found unsettling, in which “racism” and differences of opinion splintered the discourse among relatives in otherwise close families, between spouses, and created frictions between offspring and parents. Facebook and social media during this election cycle amplified political divisions, the women observed, along with coverage of the race by major media outlets they faulted as biased and addicted to conflict. “I’ve already gotten tired of hearing about it, and we’ve got months to go,” said Anita, a divorced health analyst and mother of one child in Columbus.  “I had to stay off social media for a week,” said Stephanie, a Trump-leaning undecided customer service representative and saleswoman from Phoenix. “It’s just too much.” Ohio and Arizona are among nine states on the RealClearPolitics Electoral College map considered toss-ups. Based on the latest polling, the RCP map shows Clinton leading Trump, 256-154, in the candidates’ pursuit of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.  “Wal-Mart Moms” is a label applied by some political analysts since 2008 to a key subgroup of not-especially-partisan female voters. They’re described as young-to-middle-aged mothers (18 to 44 years old), mostly white, and registered with both major political parties. They make up an estimated 14 percent to 17 percent of the electorate.  The demographic is considered important because of the sway that “persuadable” moms wielded in 2008 and 2012, when they backed Barack Obama for president, but supported congressional Republicans in 2010, when the GOP took control of the House of Representatives. In this presidential cycle, Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and nonpartisan polling firm Purple Strategies teamed up to continue the focus group conversations for sponsor Wal-Mart. The enthusiasm for Clinton among the women gathered together Tuesday was muted, evidenced by repeated descriptions of the former secretary of state as “cold,” a “liar,” and “untrustworthy.” “I don’t know what she can do,” said Dana, a single, 29-year-old African-American mother of two from Columbus. “I know she can lie.” Linda, 56, a widowed African-American business owner from Phoenix, gave this advice to Clinton on her email troubles: “Don’t just sweep it under the carpet, because there’s so much stuff under there, you can’t even lay the carpet down flat now.” The Arizona group burst into laughter. Focus group participants said Clinton’s vulnerabilities included events dating to the 1990s, when she was first lady, as well as the current revelations about her personal email server while serving as secretary of state. A number of the women described Clinton as a typical politician who has trouble “owning her mistakes,” who “says what people want to hear.” Clinton, the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major political party, was also described as experienced, diplomatic, educated, an accomplished speaker, powerful, and “more presidential” than Trump. The women who indicated they are leaning toward supporting Trump said they appreciated his ability to say what many Americans are thinking when it comes to the country’s problems, even when they conceded his rhetoric has repeatedly proven distracting, offensive, or both. “I think Trump understands where the American people are coming from better [than Clinton],” said Amy, a Phoenix massage therapist who described herself as “a Christian woman.” But in the dog days of August, the focus groups largely agreed they felt dispirited about the presidential race. They described themselves as economically better off than they were four years ago, but clearly were not steeped in distinctions between Trump and Clinton when it comes to most major economic policies. A number of the women in the two cities said they might watch some or all of the presidential debates (the first of three is scheduled Sept. 26). The 2016 election may be a vote in opposition to one or the other presidential nominee, many of the women suggested, rather than a vote for an inspiring choice. One woman predicted a single term would be all either candidate would get from voters. At least half the Columbus group weighed the option of voting for a third party candidate, particularly the Libertarian ticket represented by former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, as a fallback. “There’s a sense that people are looking for something else,” said Public Opinion Strategies pollster Neil Newhouse as the Ohio women wrapped up their conversation.  Alexis Simendinger covers the White House for RealClearPolitics.

The transaction, which involved 119 stores, is subject to regulatory approval, Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB and Liverpool said in statements Wednesday after markets closed. Liverpool will pay 15.7 billion pesos, assume 1.4 billion pesos of debt and distribute an additional 3.3 billion pesos to shareholders after the deal is completed. As part of the deal, Liverpool will also pay rent to Walmex for all 34 store locations where Suburbia stores stand alongside Wal-Mart stores. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

Walmex, a publicly traded unit of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant, announced last week that July sales rose 12.1 percent from a year ago at stores open at least a year, almost double the 6.8 percent rise in the previous month. “We are totally focused on our main business and our target is to double our total sales by 2024,” Walmex Chief Executive Officer Guilherme Loureiro said in the statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange. This is the second purchase this year by Mexico City-based Liverpool, a high-end department store chain that’s seeking to diversify. The company agreed last month to buy a stake in Chile’s Ripley Corp SA, sending its stock plunging, as disappointed investors were hoping the company would expand domestically. The deal was announced after trading closed Wednesday. Walmex shares are little changed this year, while Liverpool has dropped 9.7 percent. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Wal-Mart's Mexico unit selling apparel chain for about $852 million Reuters | CHICAGO Aug 11, 2016 04:17 AM IST By Nandita Bose CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Mexican unit said on Wednesday it has agreed to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool for about $852 million as the world's largest retailer streamlines operations in its largest non-U.S. market. Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica , also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to boost its core business of running discount retail and membership stores in Mexico by focussing on expanding its fresh food business. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about $247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about $6.93 billion.

That would mark a major turning point for an ecommerce firm that’s only been around for two years. Interestingly, it only opened its doors to customers in the US last July, and did so with a $49 membership fee. If the deal goes through, it’ll be the largest ecommerce acquisition in the country, ousting QVC’s $2.4 billion purchase of Zulily last year from the top spot. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Jet.com launched in the US a little over a year ago with scores of products on offer, ranging from TVs to apparel to household essentials. Last October – just three months after it opened for business – it dropped its $49 membership fee in a bid to woo more customers. And in May, it began trialing grocery delivery services across the country. According to Recode’s sources, Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore will continue to oversee the site’s operations and also take over the reins of Walmart’s online store. It’ll be interesting to see if this helps Walmart take the fight to Amazon in the ecommerce space; it currently makes only $14 billion a year through online sales, which is a pittance compared to Amazon’s annual revenue of $99 billion.

Somewhere Donald Trump is jotting down "Note to Self, WALL CANNOT BE MADE OF GLASS!!!" Get The Lid straight to your inbox each afternoon -- click here to sign up. '16 from 30,000 Nauseating. Painful. Screwed. Those were the words "Walmart moms" used to describe the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in two focus groups observed by NBC News. The overall feeling of 20 middle-class mothers who participated in the Phoenix, Arizona, and Columbus, Ohio, panels could be described as...well...depression over the state of the presidential race. Multiple women called it a choice between the "lesser of two evils." One equated the choice to "choosing which arm to cut off." The descriptions of both candidates, which ranged from harsh to downright brutal, mirror polling that shows the two hold historically low favorability ratings. "Walmart moms" have supported the winning candidate or party in every election since 2008, except in 2014 when the broke for Democrats in the midterms. And though only seven of the 20 said they were leaning towards supporting Clinton (with eight either undecided or looking at third party candidates), nearly all of them said they think Clinton will win. But the overall disdain shown by these women towards this year's election has us wondering if they are going to show up to the polls at all come November. As a participant in Phoenix said, "I morally, in good conscience, could not vote for either one of them." POPPING ON NBC POLITICS Alex Seitz-Wald reports on the conspiracy theories fueled by WikiLeaks regarding a DNC staffer's death.

If you live in - say - Florida, it ain't going to be fun to watch TV for the next few months unless you really like political ads. Here's why. There are still a lot of registered Republicans who still doubt Barack Obama's citizenship. "An aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a colleague that their boss lied at a 2013 press conference during which he told reporters that top staffers knew nothing of a scheme to punish a political opponent with lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, court documents released Wednesday alleged," Jon Schuppe writes. How likeable is Melania Trump? FOR THE RECORD… "He acts like a 2-year-old.

Kroger has a new plan that should terrify Walmart and Target Hayley Peterson Aug. 10, 2016, 7:00 PM 4,115,822 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Kroger is going after Target and Walmart by expanding a new type of store featuring home goods, clothing, and kitchen appliances. The store, called Kroger Marketplace, features nearly everything you would find in a Target or Walmart store, but with a greater focus on groceries, alcohol, and prepared foods. The company says Marketplace is one of its "primary growth formats of the future" — in other words, it's expanding rapidly. Kroger has nearly 3,000 stores, more than 120 of which are Marketplace stores. We went to three Marketplace stores in the Richmond, Virginia, area to check them out. Here's what we found. View As: One Page Slides The store is massive. This image shows only one-quarter of the front of the buildings. Kroger Marketplace stores are typically 100,000 to 145,000 square feet — which is about three-quarters of the size of a Walmart Supercenter.

Business Insider ... and the dine-in seating area features flat-screen televisions, a fireplace, and lounge chairs. Business Insider Back in the main part of the store, there's a giant wine selection that stretches across four aisles. This department features 500 types of beer and nearly 2,000 types of wine. Business Insider There's also a wine bar with craft beers on tap. Business Insider Here's a closer look at the wine bar. Business Insider The bakery has some cool gadgets like this self-service bread slicer. Business Insider Like everything else in this store, the meat department is huge. Business Insider Check out that meat selection. It goes on forever. Business Insider There are all kinds of kitchen appliances ... Business Insider ... from standing mixers and microwaves to mini refrigerators and blenders. Business Insider The store even offers a selection of home goods.

FOXSPORTS You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing Join us on our voyage navigating the choppy seas of sailing at the Summer Games By Chris Chase Aug 10, 2016 at 3:45p ET 0 Shares Because the Olympics is the world's greatest viewing buffet, I went back for seconds this morning and sampled some sailing, a sport that doesn't get much coverage on television for reasons that become immediately obvious. To say sailing is confusing is like saying Michael Phelps is comfortable in the water. And it doesn't help that the international feed features no commentators, presumably because everybody who knows how to describe the Mixed Narca 17 (multihull) race I watched today was presumably sailing in it. Thus, I was left to my own devices to try and figure out the most baffling sport in the Summer Games. Join me on my odyssey. 1. This is the start and it seems to have all the order of Black Friday at Walmart or swimming-pool management in Rio. I count at least five different direction those boats are traveling toward. This has all the order of Walmart on Black Friday or check-in at the Rio airport. 2. It looks like the radar for a hurricane. 3. What does the graphic mean? What are the black lines? Why does it look like one of those optical illusions that asks you how many triangles are in the picture? Why is Denmark going all rogue, which seems very anti-Denmark if you'll allow me to stereotype? 4. Okay, I'll buy that Brazil is in first. In this camera shot they're clearing leading what we're to assume is the trio of boats in front of the regatta. (I don't know if this is a proper usage of regatta but as we're flying by the cuts of our jib here I'm going with it.) But wait a second. Brazil first. Got it. Switzerland fourth? In what possible way does this camera shot indicate that Switzerland is fourth? WHERE ARE THE OTHER TWO BOATS? 5. Okay, now this I get. Brazil, Switzerland and Argentina racing on the open water. However, given the confusion, it's entirely possible Brazil was in first, Switzerland was in ninth and the Argentine boat was simply ferrying Juan Martin Del Potro to the tennis venue. 6. What is Italy doing? Here we have Denmark and Brazil again with Italy going away from the buoy and charging at the other two boats like this was rugby sevens, fiberglass division. 7. Speaking of event names, these are the actual names of the sailing competitions in Rio: Laser (dinghy), 470 (dinghy), Laser radial (dinghy), Mixed nacra 17 (multihull), Finn (dinghy), RS:X (windsurfer), 49er (skiff), 49er XF (skiff). Also, we have no idea what 2nd Mark is. It sounds like a Bible chapter. 8. Ahh, digging through the cooler from some cervezas. This is the kind of sport I can ... get on board with. 9. Guys - GUYS - I think that helicopter is about to make a move. 10. Toldja. 11. I imagine this is what Larry Ellison does when he's bored: Sailboat demolition derby. 12. Finally. This one's pretty self-explanatory. The boats, coming in at different angles (because the sea was angry today, like an old man trying to return soup in a deil), are headed toward the finish. But wait. Where are you going?  13. Then, before my stream froze, the United States comes in, finishing 2:07 behind the winner? The U.S. was in 13th place? Shouldn't we be good at sailing? It's called the America's Cup for dinghy's sake! The Kennedy family alone produce enough sailors to win a bronze!   0 Shares View Comments Hide Comments You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing UP NEXT : You might need to be a genius to understand Olympic sailing UP NEXT : FOXSports.com > Contact Us | Press | Jobs | RSS | Site Map | Shop Follow FOX Sports > Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube | Tumblr Other FOX Sites > FS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century Fox | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes Statistical Information provided by: STATS ©2016 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

Firefighters were called upon to douse the flames in a field behind the store. The power line problem caused an electrical outage inside, which prompted store officials to evacuate employees and customers at around 3:10 p.m. 7 News saw between 30 and 40 people in the parking lot after the evacuation. Fire officials say grass fires are generally easy to handle, but departments across the north country have been working together in the dry weather. "They're relatively easy to control and contain," Town of Watertown Assistant Fire Chief John Falge said. "You need resources and manpower and everybody's been rallying across the county and actually into other counties to help one another out during this drought period." Officials say if the weather was not so dry, the utility line would not have caused the fire.

Politics As voters talk, the collapse of Trump's support becomes clearly audible Trump supporters Evan Vucci / Associated Press Donald Trump supporters wait for his arrival at a rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, N.C. Donald Trump supporters wait for his arrival at a rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington, N.C. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) David Lauter Many gauges measure the rapid drop in Donald Trump’s support this summer: Polls show the Republican nominee losing nationally and in most battleground states, prominent Republicans have publicly defected, and GOP elected officials rarely rush to his defense. Twenty women, mostly swing voters, sitting at conference tables in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix on Tuesday night, provide another. “He’s crazy,” says one. "He kind of acts like a 2-year-old," says another. "I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities." Asked to imagine a President Trump, the women in Phoenix call out in a cascade: "doomed," "scary," "hang on" and "are you joking?" Disgraced ex-lawmaker shows up at Trump rally, messes up attack on Clinton Michael Finnegan Clinton slams Trump as unfit for presidency following 2nd Amendment comment Aug. 10, 2016, 8:31 p.m. Clinton told supporters in Iowa that "words matter" regarding Trump's 2nd Amendment remarksRecent polls in four key industrial states show Hillary Clinton widening her lead.

Hillary Clinton: Donald... (Michael Finnegan) The women, participants in focus groups convened by pollsters Neil Newhouse, a Republican, and Margie Omero, a Democrat, talked about the major party candidates as reporters watched from an office in Washington. Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Sign up for the newsletter  The sessions were part of a project sponsored by Wal-Mart that for eight years has examined the attitudes of what the company calls Wal-Mart moms, women who shop at one of the giant retailer’s stores. It’s a group that includes about one in seven American voters and is replete with the swing voters and soft partisans who candidates normally seek to persuade or mobilize precisely because they can decide elections. These were not voters who had much praise for Hillary Clinton, noted Newhouse. Even Democrats in the two groups used words like “deceptive” “lies” and “dishonest” when they were asked to describe the Democratic nominee, although others referred positively to her toughness and experience. To many of these women, Clinton appeared distant, emotionless and closed off. Few had a clear view of what she stands for, Omero noted. He kind of acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities. — Focus group participant Trump’s image appeared far more clearly etched in their minds, Newhouse said. Unfortunately for the GOP and its nominee, that image has become fixed in two tracks: foolish or frightening. To some, Trump appeared as a buffoonish character. To others, he seemed dangerous — a hothead, authoritarian and inexperienced. Those perceptions of the candidates’ character weigh heavily for these voters. Few on either side indicated that specific policies or issues were driving their choices.  Several, however, mentioned race and concerns about racism as a lens through which they were watching the campaign. Asked to name an Olympic sport at which each candidate might excel, Anita M., a 43-year-old married Republican in Phoenix, responded with fencing for Clinton. “She’d stab you in the back,” she explained, eliciting nods from around the table. Don’t count her as a Trump voter, however. “He’s a racist, really,” Anita said, noting later that she probably won’t vote at all. Asked to name an Olympic sport for Trump, several of the women in Phoenix cited diving, ski jumping or similar activities that involve, as one said, a “leap of faith” and an uncertain landing. The focus group reactions add texture to one of the key findings of recent opinion polls, which have shown Trump losing ground among Republican women.

Caption Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Paul Ryan comments on Donald Trump's win Several women in the Phoenix group said men in their lives were backing Trump: One cited her husband, another mentioned her father.  Africa C., a 40-year-old Latina business operations manager, said her son leaned toward Trump because he envisions himself a budding entrepreneur.  The women expressed far less enthusiasm, however. Several Republicans mentioned potential third-party candidates — an option none of the Democrats expressed interest in.  Stephanie C., a 38-year old, white, married Republican, was the most hostile to Clinton of the 10 women in Phoenix. She repeated conspiratorial allegations about mysterious deaths of people close to the former first lady that are staples of right-wing talk radio. Yet even she hesitated about voting for her party’s nominee. “Trump would get us right into World War III,” she said.  In Ohio, Ivania L., a radiation-safety officer who listed her age as between 35 and 44, said choosing Trump would be “like sending a painter to do a doctor’s job.” She listed herself as undecided, but seemed more accurately described as resigned to what she considered a poor choice. “I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now,” she said, but, in the end, Clinton’s  “experience wins me more.” I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now. — Ivania L., focus group member That quality and strength ranked high on the minds of most of the Clinton backers. Clinton won’t take ownership of her mistakes, complained Linda C., a 56-year-old African American business owner in Phoenix. The Democratic nominee tries to sweep scandals under the rug, she said. “There's so much stuffed under there they can’t even lay the carpet down flat now," she said. And yet Clinton had the knowledge to do the job, she added, while Trump was both inexperienced and “disrespectful.” Lukisha H., a married African American teacher sitting across from Linda, expressed similar concern about what she called Clinton’s unwillingness to clearly acknowledge her errors. But she praised the former secretary of State on other grounds. “I think it’s a tough job, and you have to be tough at it,” she said. In Ohio, Mary H., a retired cable television service rep, referred to Clinton as “cold-hearted” and added an expletive. And yet, she said, she too would probably vote for her because of her experience.

Hillary Clinton: Donald... (David Lauter) On all sides, the women were virtually unanimous in calling the campaign stressful to watch, disconcerting and offering a set of bad choices. The decision “is like choosing which arm to cut off," said a participant in the Phoenix group. In the end, though, they had little doubt about how the contest would turn out or why. “I think Donald is going to say something that is going to scare everybody. And they’re just going to go with, ‘Whoa, we better go with Clinton ‘cause he’s off the chain,’” said Gidget B., a white, married customer service representative in Columbus. Asked to predict who will win the election, 18 of the 20 participants made the same call: Hillary Clinton.  David.Lauter@latimes.com For more on Politics and Policy, follow me @DavidLauter ALSO Trump's call for ‘2nd Amendment people’ to stop Clinton isn't helping his dropping poll numbers What do you think of Hillary Clinton?

The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) handled the following incidents in Arlington during June, plus three incidents in the first few days of July. Editor’s note: All suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and values are estimated for stolen/damaged items. These are brief summaries of detailed SCSO reports. June 1 Zellner Street (theft from motor vehicle) An overnight burglary netted someone about $330 of property from a vehicle parked on the 5900 block of Zellner Street. The owner said he parked his Ford Fusion on the street in front of his home around 5 p.m. May 31 and returned around 3:45 a.m. June 1. He drove to a medical office on Spicer Cove and noticed some items were missing from his center console when he got back to his car around 5 a.m. He believes the theft happened overnight. Stolen items included audio/visual recordings and CDs ($300) and prescription drugs ($30). Officers saw no signs of forced entry on the car, and he said he might have forgotten to lock the doors. Longleaf Oak Trail (theft from motor vehicle) A woman on the 12300 block of Longleaf Oak Trail reported June 1 that someone stole valuable from her unlocked SUV almost a week earlier. She got in her 2008 Chevy Tahoe around 10 a.m. May 27 and realized these items were missing: Black Oakley sunglasses in a white case, black Coach purse and white gold diamond ring. She said a nearby neighbor has a security system and can provide photos of suspects in the area around 2:10 a.m. May 26. June 2 Village Center Street (theft of vehicle parts/accessories) The owner of a Dodge Ram 1500 pickup said June 2 that someone stole his trailer hitch while the truck was parked in his driveway. He noticed the theft around 7:15 p.m. that night and said it must have happened between noon June 1 and nearly 9 p.m. June 2. He lives on the 11700 block of Village Center Street. He didn’t have any suspect information or a serial number for the trailer hitch. June 3 Brooks River Drive (simple assault/domestic violence) Click to enlarge. A punishment turned into a fight that landed a daughter in juvie court, a family reported on June 3. A mom restricted her adopted daughter to the house after the child returned from a recent runaway episode. She said the daughter became irate and combative. They were upstairs in the daughter’s bedroom when she began striking the mother’s arms and kicking her legs. They went downstairs to the mother’s bedroom, where she kept up the assault. The responding officers couldn’t see any marks on the victim, who refused medical treatment. The child’s adoptive father said their daughter is upset about living under rules. Officers transported her to juvenile court. The incident happened between 11:45 p.m. June 2 and about 12:15 a.m. June 3. Quintard Street (other larceny/access device) When a store declined his debit card on June 2 was when one Arlington man learned he was the victim of fraud. First Tennessee told him that someone had spent $254.94 on his account at Walmart in Knoxville. He also learned that someone tried to use the number a second time for the same amount at that Walmart and for $7.23 at the Four Queens Hotel in Goodley, Texas. The bank refused those charge attempts. The victim, a resident on the 6000 block of Quintard Street, said he wants to prosecute. June 4 Goat Valley Cove (misdemeanor vandalism) A young witness solved the mystery about what shattered a woman’s bathroom window ($300) in early June. The woman spotted a small hole in the broken window the morning of June 4 and asked a neighborhood boy if he’d seen anything suspicious. He told her he saw a group of eight boys shooting cans on the left side of her home a couple of days earlier, and a light-skinned boy with a big BB gun shot the window. He didn’t know the suspect’s name. The victim, a resident on the 11000 block of Goat Valley Cove, said she has video surveillance around the home. She estimated the damages at $300. June 6 Gulf Stream Road (simple assault) An employee at Maines Paper & Food Service (11420 Gulf Stream Road) said a co-worker assaulted him on June 6. The victim said he was working alone in the freezer section when the suspect walked up and punched him several times on the face. Then the victim grabbed his attacker and they fell to the ground. He said the suspect kept hitting him and might also have used an object to hit the top of his head. The victim said he also landed on his right elbow, abrading it and making it swell. The victim got on top of the suspect, held him and kept asking, “You finished?” Eventually the suspect quit struggling and said, “I’m good, I’m good.” The pummeled man said he wasn’t sure why the co-worker attacked him but it might be related to an incident right before the attack: The suspect was arguing with a different man when the victim walked nearby to pick up some work supplies. That drew the suspect’s suspicion, who reportedly asked the other man in the argument if he “sent this little b____ over here to back you up.” The victim objected, saying he was trying to work and wasn’t in the argument, and he told the suspect to keep his name out of his mouth. The victim said he walked back to the freezer area and continued working through his scheduled break until the assault. Afterward, the victim walked out of the freezer and was seeing black-and-white spots, but he doesn’t think he lost consciousness. The suspect left the scene. The victim notified his supervisor and then drove himself to Saint Francis Hospital in Bartlett for treatment of the swollen elbow, abrasions to his face and small cut to the top of his head. There were no witnesses but the company might have video footage of the fight. Logan Circle (intimidation) One woman said another swore at her, threatened bodily harm and brandished an electroshock weapon on June 6. The victim was visiting a friend on the 5700 block of Logan Circle when the suspect pulled up in a gold Mercedes, cursed and threatened her, turned around in the cove, and pulled over again. Next, the suspect got out of the car, entered the friend’s front yard and continued the verbal assault, the victim reported. The suspect also pulled out an electroshock weapon (such as the Taser brand) and continued to threaten bodily harm before eventually getting back in her car and driving off, the victim said. A male witness was sitting in his truck nearby during the altercation but said he didn’t see a weapon. Deputies followed up with the suspect, who said the victim started it by yelling insults at her. She admitted to having words with the victim but denied making threats. The deputies told both the suspect and victim to stay away from each other and for the suspect to stay away from the homeowner’s property. Click to enlarge. June 7 Leewood Drive (other theft/non-specific) An unattended lawn mower was too tempting for a thief on the 11600 block of Leewood Drive. The owner said he cut the front yard on June 7 and left the mower in the driveway to go to the back yard briefly. He returned about five minutes later, and the mower was gone. He had no suspect information or witnesses, and there are no known security cameras in the area. He also didn’t have a serial number for the mower, so it wasn’t added to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. He estimated the value of the red Craftsman push mower at $300. June 13 Milton Wilson Drive (misdemeanor vandalism) A man on the 5500 block of Milton Wilson Drive reported June 13 that someone damaged his mailbox. He bent it back into shape and reattached it to its post before the officer arrived. June 15 Doctor Logan Road (simple assault/domestic violence) One woman elevated sisterly tensions into a chemical fight on June 15. The victim was at a home on the 11800 block of Doctor Logan Road when her sister brought their elderly mother home. After getting the mother into the house, the suspect grabbed a can of Raid insecticide, sprayed the victim’s eyes and fled the scene, the injured sister reported. The victim said her sister currently has an order of protection against her. Personnel at the SCSO fire department treated the victim at the substation. The responding deputy documented injuries where the woman was sprayed in the face. June 17 U.S. 70 (counterfeiting/forgery) An employee at an unspecified Arlington store (10996 U.S. 70) said on June 17 that one customer tried to pass two fake $100 bills. The second bill initially passed the test of a counterfeit money detection pen, but then the employee realized the bill was fake and returned it. When the employee checked the man’s other $100 bill he had spent previously, the employee realized it was counterfeit too. June 20 Greenlee Street/U.S. 70 (theft from motor vehicle) A woman learned how opportunistic thieves are on June 19 when she left her purse unattended. She got gasoline around 7:30 that night from a store at U.S. 70 and Greenlee Street. She left her purse on the passenger seat of her unlocked car when she went inside to pay. When she returned, she saw a black man getting into an older model car with large rims and speeding off. She didn’t realize her purse was missing until she entered her car. She didn’t know what to do at the time, so she went home and reported the crime the next morning after talking to her mother. Click to enlarge. June 22 Jackson Street (intimidation/domestic violence) A woman reported June 22 that her former boyfriend has been threatening her for several days. He showed up at her home on the 6000 block of Jackson Street around 2 a.m. June 21. He called and said if she didn’t come outside that he would hit her sister in the head with a bat, she reported. (The sister was not outside at the time.) The victim was afraid and met him outside, staying with him until 9 a.m. She said he popped up again later: Around 5 p.m., she was leaving a meeting with her probation officer when her ex met her and said, “I will beat you with a bat if you do not come to my house.” She followed him home because she was afraid, she said. She stayed for about three hours. Although he didn’t assault her, she said these incidents placed her in fear for her personal safety. Evening Ridge Drive (misdemeanor vandalism) A landlord suspects an evicted tenant of breaking the window of his property on the 11600 block of Evening Ridge Drive. He evicted her on June 21 and found the home’s rear window broken around 3 p.m. the next day. He didn’t observe that anything was missing from the house. Brooks River Drive (simple assault/domestic violence) An irate wife punched her husband on suspicions of cheating, he reported on June 22. They were at their home on the 12100 block of Brooks River Drive when a co-worker texted him around 7 a.m. He said his wife started an argument, got very upset and punched him on the ear while he was holding their four-year-old daughter. He believes the child may have been struck too. He said there were no injuries and refused medical attention. June 24 Dusty Field Road (felony vandalism) Someone damaged a man’s truck while trying unsuccessfully to break into it, he reported on June 24. He said he bought the green Ford F150 for his son on June 17 and had been parking it on the street in front of his home. On June 24, he noticed damage to the driver’s and passenger’s doors ($500). He suspects that someone tried to pry open the window on the driver’s door and then tried prying the passenger door. He lives on the 12300 block of Dusty Field Road. June 26 Logan Circle (theft from building) A woman suspects a guest of stealing her cell phone during a gathering at her home on the 5700 block of Logan Circle. She hosted about 20 friends and family members the night of June 25 and last saw her Samsung Note 5 cell phone ($500) at 11 p.m. Around 4 a.m. the next morning she realized her phone was missing. She suspects a cousin with a history of thefts. She couldn’t immediately provide a serial number at the time of the report. She advised that she has an app on her phone that can reveal the general area where the stolen phone is. June 30 U.S. 70 (felony vandalism) A man reported June 30 that he found his vehicle damaged when he returned from a grocery store trip earlier in the month. The victim said he went to Kroger (11635 U.S. 70) June 10. Back at home, he noticed gray paint on the driver’s side fender of his Chevrolet Silverado. He was able to remove it but found more damage. There was a gray mark on the driver’s door near the handle and another gray indentation at a lower angle on the left passenger door. He walked around the truck and also found a dent on the passenger side bumper. He said there was no one nearby or parked near his truck at the time. July 1 U.S. 70 (other theft/non-specific) A woman made the mistake of leaving her wallet on top of her vehicle when leaving the Kroger parking lot (11635 U.S. 70) on July 1. She returned but couldn’t find it. The wallet contained her credit cards, $600 in cash and a Galaxy S3 cell phone. The incident happened between 12:15 p.m. and about 2 p.m. Walker Street (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game) A father reported July 1 that a caller swindled his daughter out of money around noon that day. He said the caller identified himself as David Smith and told her she was eligible for a $9,000 Pell Grant. All she had to do was get an iTunes gift card from Kroger at 11635 U.S. 70 and send him the card’s information, and then she could get the grant check from Kroger. She followed his instructions and sent him the information online. But Kroger does not give out Pell Grant checks. July 3 Knob Creek Trail (misdemeanor vandalism) A woman found her car damaged in her driveway around 2 p.m. July 3. The victim, who lives on the 4900 block of Knob Creek Trail, said the front driver’s side door of her Chevrolet Cruze was damaged. She had no suspect information.

Jet.com to take on the e-commerce giant, showing enthusiasm for the darling stock is as strong as ever. Social Market Analytics, which scans posts on social networks to form predictive trading signals, reveals Amazon had the biggest jump in bullish mentions among major U.S. stocks in the last week. When news of a potential Wal-Mart/Jet.com deal was first reported last Wednesday, Amazon stock did dip slightly. However, the company's shares soon rebounded to near all-time highs as investors quickly shrugged at the potential competitive threat. Amazon shares are up 14 percent year to date as of Tuesday's close. Below are the other stocks along with Amazon seeing the biggest one-week jump in bullish sentiment on Twitter, according to SMA.

Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town's shops, according to local news reports. "I was completely astounded," Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. "It's like, are you kidding me? It's just not something you run across. I'm sure it can happen. "Anywhere at any time somewhere where there's the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new." Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a "preventive patrol," according to CBS affiliate WIVB. "Routine patrol, that's what we do every day," Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: "We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good." Crews in HAZMAT suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine." But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. "We'll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that's not accessible anymore," Chamberlin told the station. "We were shocked when we found out about this," Erica Jones, a Walmart spokesperson, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. "It's upsetting and unacceptable. We're glad the police have responded and we'll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police." Investigators plan to see whether Walmart's surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York state Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York state, has released warnings about such "clandestine laboratories." It states: "A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present." Erie County District Attorney's Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are "highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties" and that the chemicals used in them are "extremely toxic." "A Meth lab can be located anywhere," it states. "The house next door, hotels, motels, RV's, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests." According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. "It's a concern; I mean it's unbelievable in this area, this isn't a bad area," Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: "This isn't the kind of thing you'd expect in a place like this, that's the bottom line." Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers travelled some 800 feet from the culvert's opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. "They did have a working surface. They just weren't playing in the water, basically," Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: "They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it's dark." Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. "It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous," Lucey told the Buffalo News. "Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation." "Certainly, they weren't thinking," he added.

(Tribune file photo) Wine for sale at a state liquor store. State’s first new store since 2010 will be in Wal-Mart lot. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Utah may not allow wine and spirits to be sold inside grocery stores, but West Valley City's new wine and liquor store will be conveniently located in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 5675 W. 6200 South. The Division of Facilities Construction and Management (DCFM) recently bought property on the commercial site and is accepting bids to build the 13,500-square-foot building, which will include retail space, storage, a shipping area and offices. Officials hope to break ground in September and have construction completed within eight months, said division spokeswoman Marilee Richins. The project is expected to cost $2.3 million. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Once completed, the store will be the state's 45th liquor store and the first one built since 2010. Before any new stores are built, the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control must win approval from the state building board and secure funding from the Legislature. The DABC also must get approval from the cities affected. West Valley City is Utah's second most-populous municipality, with more than 136,000 residents, but has only one liquor store, in the northeast part of the city at 3381 S. Redwood Road. The new wine and liquor store will be in the southwest part of the city, where population growth has exploded in recent years, said Mark Nord, director of West Valley City's Redevelopment Agency. "With all the growth and development going on in west Salt Lake County, we were due for another store." The new store will be in a commercial area and shouldn't create any proximity issues for schools, churches or neighborhoods, he added. Resident James Bunnell said he didn't think the location was the most convenient for residents. "I don't understand why they're putting the new store so far south, and a mere three miles from the Kearns-Taylorsville store," he said. "It would have been much more convenient to have a store on 3500 or 4100 South." It's taken nearly two years to get the West Valley City project rolling. In 2014, lawmakers earmarked $4.4 million to buy the land and build the store. Earlier this year, another $557,000 was set aside to hire staff for it. Even when the project is completed, it won't make a dent in Utah's liquor store needs. According to a study conducted by the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah, the state needs 12 more liquor stores along the Wasatch Front — including six on the west side of Salt Lake County — to keep up with liquor sales and a growing population. While the DABC and lawmakers have said they would like to add one new liquor store a year, state officials have had trouble finding cities willing to host new outlets. Officials in Syracuse have said they are willing to have a liquor store, and the DABC and DCFM are looking for land in that north Davis County community. kathys@sltrib.com   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 2 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | Utah lawmaker accuses charter school of skirting procurement law President Obama honors Robert Redford with America's top civilian award After unusual election, lawmakers draft pile of bills seeking to make changes Kirby: Plenty to be thankful for when pie goes awry Historic Bear Lake ranch to be spared from development ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

While every company's goals are unique, the one goal they have in common is the desire to improve on the prior year's performance. The challenge lies in identifying and prioritizing the changes needed to deliver improved results. Future business goals act as the foundation of the rubric used to select and prioritize project investments. The greatest improvement in business capabilities come when executive management not only support the initiative, but also provide necessary staffing and funding.  And survey after survey of CEO priorities shows goals like “be customer-centric” or “improve customer experience” consistently rank the highest.   Align Customer Experience with Business Strategy Identifying improved customer outcomes as a key goal for an organization establishes a clear link between business strategy and customer experience (CX). So how can CX impact business strategy? Differentiation, focus and cost leadership are the three core business strategies. Every organization develops their own unique blend to appeal to selected segments of the overall market. For example, Walmart and Nordstrom are both in the retail industry yet have very different business strategies: Walmart is of course known for low-cost while Nordstrom focuses on differentiation. Prioritizing and ensuring CX projects are included in future business plans requires alignment.  Regardless of your company’s strategy, CX projects will be part of your organization's future, provided the projects align with stated business goals. Projects that align with business goals will always be prioritized over initiatives that don’t align with executive management’s future vision.  With each industry and company being unique, there are no magic answers, silver bullets or cookbook recommendations to produce results. You'll need brainstorming, creativity and design-thinking to architect a well-aligned solution.   Business Strategy, Through a CX Lens The most effective CX solutions align with the desired image of the company, are consistently delivered, and frictionless for the customer. Depending on what business strategy your organization competes on, looking at that strategy through a CX lens can help shape your future plans. Here are a few ideas to get you in the CX mindset:  Differentiation Conduct a Competitor Analysis (a la Porter's 5 Forces) to understand the buying journey customers face with competitors and define opportunities to deliver a better experience Evaluate the post-sale customer experience — the customer experience does not end with the sale and may be an area unaddressed by others Cost Leadership Develop a costed journey-map for the entire customer lifecycle.  Rank the activity costs for customer acquisition and customer retention, and identify cost reduction opportunities Adopt a Lean CX approach to improve customer experience by utilizing tools like business model canvas and lean canvas to improve customer experience. Develop experiments and conduct A/B testing to understand customer behaviors and optimize outputs (tools like Inspectlet can help visualize interactions)  Focus Optimize Personas: Know your most profitable customers and those that drive the most revenue, identify and develop experiences that align to unique elements of these personas Because every business has a customer to serve, no strategy can exist without considering the impact to the customer. The challenge lies in creating a positive customer impact that your company can consistently deliver and that your customers perceive as valuable. The time is now. Are you up to the challenge of defining a CX initiative that will both improve your customer’s experience and set you apart from your competitors? If you succeed, you'll have a winning strategy for years in the future.

Jae C. Hong/AP hide caption toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Pollsters identify "Wal-Mart moms" as a swing voting bloc. Jae C. Hong/AP NPR was invited to observe two focus groups of swing voters from Ohio and Arizona on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. "Wal-Mart Moms" are identified by pollsters as women predominantly between the ages of 18 and 44, who have kids under 18 living at home and who shop at Wal-Mart stores at least once a month. In these groups, the women were identified only by their first names. The research was funded by Wal-Mart Corp. (The Walton Family Foundation, which Wal-Mart's creators established, meanwhile, supports NPR's education coverage.) The sessions are anecdotal and unscientific. Here are some key takeaways: 1. Social media is a powerful — and divisive — force Frustration and exhaustion from social media, particularly Facebook, was a common theme. Social media has given them a constant stream of information about the election, but almost everyone says their interactions online are negative and exhausting. "I don't talk about [politics] as much as I have in the past because it's stressful," says Stephanie, a married mom of two kids from Phoenix. Stephanie quit Facebook for a week just to get a break from the news. Article continues after sponsorship Amy, a married mom of two kids who is also from Phoenix, said her family is sharply divided on political lines. She and her husband are leaning Trump, and she admits sometimes they post stories supporting Trump online "just to get people riled up." Nearly everyone said the election has strained ties with family and friends. In the Columbus group, Mary says she recently attended her 40th high school reunion and was dismayed by how much politics dominated the conversation. "That's not what I went there to do. I went there to have a good time," she says. That said, nearly all of the women identified Facebook and Twitter as a leading source of election information, even if it's a downer. 2. There's a lot of interest in "other" options on the ballot Another striking theme was how eager and interested the moms were in finding out more about third-party candidates, particularly the Libertarian Gary Johnson/Bill Weld ticket. In the Columbus group, five of the 10 moms said they were open to learning more about third-party candidates. "I need to know who the other parties are. I don't know who Gary Johnson is, but I'm willing to get to know who he is," said Dana, an African-American mother of two from Columbus. In Phoenix, two of the 10 said they were leaning toward voting for a third-party candidate. Some expressed a concern that a third-party vote was a "wasted vote," but on the whole, there was a welcome attitude about third-party candidates this cycle. There was also no voiced opposition to having Johnson participate in the presidential debates. 3. The conventions didn't matter; the debates will Very little information about either the Republican convention in Cleveland or the Democratic convention in Philadelphia broke through to the moms. Most said they watched some speeches and saw "snippets" on social media, but there were almost no lasting impressions voiced from either group. However, nearly all of the moms said the upcoming presidential debates will play a major role in helping them finalize their vote. "She has more facts and experience and knowledge about the inner workings of government, and that is where it's going to show exactly how little he knows," said Julie, a white, married mother of two from Columbus. There was a consensus that Clinton will "win" the debates but that Trump "will be talked about the most." 4. The first female presidential candidate is NBD Clinton made history this year to become the first woman nominated by a major party to run for president. But the moms overwhelmingly said that wouldn't affect how they vote. Nearly all agreed that the historic candidacy of Barack Obama, the first black man nominated, felt much bigger and more urgent. "It was more exciting, it was more history-making. He had so much he envisioned. He had real issues he was fighting for," said Dana from Columbus. Ivania, a Hispanic mother of two from Columbus, said she is disappointed voters don't seem to care much about Clinton's milestone. "It was almost kind of skipped over, and it was sad," she said. 5. Trump is not a Republican — and that's OK Trump won the Republican primary "fair and square," in one mom's words, but that does not mean any of them view him as a Republican. "The Republican Party is not behind him," said Amy from Phoenix, who is leaning Trump. "It doesn't matter to me," she adds. "I don't like the two-party system." In fact, the Trump brand and the GOP brand are very distinct in their minds. "He's himself. He's just Donald Trump," says one. Maria, a Hispanic mother of two from Columbus, said she was more frustrated that the party wasn't doing more to support Trump. "I think they are trying to sabotage him. I wish there was more unity." Trump's disassociation with the GOP brand could also be a benefit for down-ballot Republicans. Incumbent Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and John McCain of Arizona both got higher marks than Trump, and many moms said they'd be willing to split their tickets to support them. 6. Clinton is fundamentally untrustworthy Without a doubt the biggest criticism of Clinton is that these women — even those inclined to support her — think she can't be trusted. It was a theme revisited over and over again throughout the evening. "You don't know what's the truth and what's the lie," says Donna, a married mother of one child from Columbus. Asked what their biggest hesitation was about Clinton, "trustworthiness" came up repeatedly. "The whole email thing. I mean, c'mon," says Amy of Phoenix. The women were all aware of Clinton's controversy over hosting her emails on a private server while she served as secretary of state. None of them believed she told the truth, or handled the fallout well. 7. That said, no one thinks Trump can win Of the 20 women, five were leaning Trump, seven were leaning Clinton, and eight were undecided or leaning third party. But asked who they thought would win, regardless of their leaning, the answer was unanimous: Clinton. But none of the women were that excited about it. Most of them described it as a "lesser of two evils" vote or an "anti-Trump" vote more than a "pro-Hillary" vote. 8. It doesn't matter anyway Maybe the most depressing takeaway is how poorly the women view the country's ability to govern itself. Many believe it doesn't really matter who wins because the gridlock in Washington is unlikely to change. There was almost a resignation to the fact that government just doesn't work well anymore, and that politicians are all deeply disconnected from the challenges of their everyday lives. The women largely rejected Trump's assertion that the system is "rigged," but they largely agreed that their interests were poorly represented in government. "I think the system is corrupt. I wouldn't say rigged," says Stephanie of Phoenix. "I think it's broken," added Joanna, a young mother of four children from the Phoenix group. "I don't think the power is with the voters anymore." GOP pollster Neil Newhouse and Democratic pollster Margie Omero sat in on the sessions with the 20 voters who took part in the panels via video conference from Phoenix and Columbus. They have been conducting research on Wal-Mart moms since 2008. They estimate these moms make up about 14 percent and 17 percent of the electorate, and they are fairly evenly split between Republican and Democratic affiliations.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes MEMBER REWARDS Classifieds Life log in 'Wal-Mart moms' say they feel 'nauseated' by the choice of Clinton or Trump Wednesday Aug 10, 2016 at 10:24 AM To these 20 middle-class mothers in the electoral battlegrounds of Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, the looming choice for president between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inspires a mixture of fear, pain and disappointment. By Philip RuckerThe Washington Post To these 20 middle-class mothers in the electoral battlegrounds of Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, the looming choice for president between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inspires a mixture of fear, pain and disappointment. "Nauseated," said one woman. "It's like choosing which arm to cut off," said another. "I kind of wish we could start all over," said a third. Such is the mood of America's undecided voters, just 89 days until Election Day. Two focus groups of "Wal-Mart moms" -- most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate -- were convened Tuesday night in Ohio and Arizona by two polling firms and observed by reporters. They showed extraordinary resistance to the two major-party presidential nominees. The women, whose surnames were withheld for privacy reasons, described Clinton as deceptive, inconsistent and out of touch with the lives of regular people like themselves. When the 10 moms in Ohio were asked their biggest hesitation with voting for Clinton, eight said she is "untrustworthy." Many of the 10 moms in Phoenix gave similar responses. "I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot," said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. Linda, a business owner in Phoenix, said she is tired of watching Clinton sweep scandals under the rug: "There's so much stuffed under there they can't even lay the carpet down flat now." Only a few of them said the historic nature of Clinton's candidacy inspired them. "I have daughters," said Dana, a food service worker in Columbus. "It would be a big step for women. But that's the only - only - positive I see coming from Hillary." The women's views of Trump were just as harsh, if not worse. They see the business mogul as an inexperienced, impulsive hothead who is unwilling to listen and learn and lacking in humility. Ivania, a radiation safety officer in Columbus, said electing Trump president would be "kind of like sending a painter to do a doctor's job." Africa, a single mom and businesswoman in Phoenix, said Trump is too authoritarian. "Kind of like a dictator," she said. "If we were looking for a Noriega, he'd be great." "He's a racist, really," said Anita, who works in sales in Phoenix. Added Deanna, a Phoenix homemaker with four small children, "He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities." In Columbus, three women said they were leaning towards voting for Trump, two for Clinton and five were undecided and open to a third-party candidate, such as Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. In Phoenix, five leaned towards Clinton, two towards Trump and three undecided. Nearly all of the 20 women said they expected Clinton to win, however. "He's going to do something between now and November to really shoot himself in the foot," predicted Connie, who is unemployed in Phoenix. "He's just going to self implode." Tuesday's sessions - convened jointly by Penn Schoen Berland, a Democratic polling firm, and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm - were the latest in a series of "Wal-Mart moms" focus groups studying the political beliefs of a key swing voter group that tipped the scale for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 but backed Republicans in the 2010 congressional midterms. In both Ohio and Arizona, incumbent Republican senators fared better than Trump with these women. In Columbus, six of the 10 said they planned to vote to reelect Sen. Rob Portman, R, and four for his Democratic challenger, Ted Strickland, while in Phoenix, four women said they were backing Sen. John McCain, R, and three his Democratic opponent, Ann Kirkpatrick. The women in both groups universally felt the candidates were in a downward spiral of attacking and belittling one another and not focused enough on important issues, like health care and the economy. They said they feel the country is on a better track economically than a few years ago, but that the political system is broken, and they fear the rise of terrorism. Stephanie, who works in sales and customer service in Phoenix, said, "I don't trust that [Clinton] would protect our country, but I also think that Trump would get us right into World War 3." If they were ready to cede the presidency to Clinton, these women still saw a lot to like in Trump. Asked who they would rather invite over to their home for a backyard cook-out with family and friends, they overwhelmingly chose Trump. "I feel like personally he would be more fun and outgoing than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me," said Donna, a pain clinic manager in Columbus. Clinton is "emotionless" and "has an extremely hard shell around her," said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. "Cold" is how Mary, a retired cable television salesperson in Columbus, described Clinton. "She's a cold-hearted [expletive]." In a revealing moment of levity, the women were asked which Olympic sport they could picture each candidate competing in. They imagined Trump swimming ("his mouth needs a rest"), playing tennis ("back and forth with everybody"), archery ("I just can picture him completely nailing it") and rowing as the boat's coxswain ("yell at them to keep going"). For Clinton, the women suggested golf ("boring"), archery ("shoot to kill"), fencing ("she'll stab you in the back") and gymnastics ("she has to stay balanced - tries to please as many people as possible"). As they contemplated the November election, the women sighed. They said they were disgusted by the tone of it all - the name-calling, the attacks, the partisanship. They wish there were other options than Clinton and Trump. "I'd [rather] pick Minnie Mouse right now," Ivania said. "In politics, nobody's ever great, but these two are just blah," Deanna said. "They make me sick. With their integrity and moral values, it's kind of gross." Gidget, a customer service manager in Columbus, summed up the choice: "I feel like no matter which way we chose we're going to lose." The women paused to think of the first word that first comes to mind when they hear "President Hillary Clinton." "I cringe," said Maria, a homemaker and lunch aide in Columbus. "Deal with it and pray," said Nicole, a mail carrier in Phoenix. What about when they hear "President Donald Trump"? "A joke," said Anita. "A buffoon," said Deanna. Added Amy, a massage therapist in Phoenix, "Hang on."

Accidents are on the rise in Charlotte, but ambiguous data makes it hard to place the blame  Crunching the numbers By Madeline Lemieux Tools del.icio.us Facebook Twitter Email Print Add to favorites Saving… Add to Custom List Loading… Comments I don't have a will. How will anybody know what Tears for Fears songs to play at my funeral? These are the thoughts going through my head as I idle behind a Chevy Malibu at the intersection of the East 3rd-4th Street Connector and North Kings Drive. It's rush hour and I'm stuck in the far left lane, which could easily tie with Black Friday at Walmart in a 'Worst Fucking Place on Earth' contest. I rev the engine and lock eyes on my destination: the Interstate 277 on-ramp ahead on the right side of the road. To reach I-277, I'll have to speed out of the intersection (a pathetic median of white plastic barrier poles prevents me from merging before crossing North Kings), then cross four lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic and swing a sharp right turn onto the on-ramp. According to Google Maps, I'll have exactly 528 feet to accomplish this. If the engineer that designed this stretch of road intended for drivers like me to have a 'life flashing before my eyes' moment, mission accomplished. Recently released crash statistics rank that intersection the 10th most dangerous intersection in Charlotte. It joins a list of 98 intersections across the city designated by the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) as 'high-accident locations.' Though these 98 intersections represent a mere 0.51 percent of Charlotte's 19,242 intersections, they account for 8.5 percent of all non-highway collisions recorded in 2015. click to enlarge An overlook of the locations of 98 intersections deemed as “high-accident locations" by the CDOT. CDOT released its annual Traffic Collision Data (TCD) report last month, and the numbers paint a startling picture for our ever-growing city: 27,648 non-highway collisions were documented in 2015, a more than 20-percent hike from the year prior. During that time period, the population grew by just over 2 percent. Charlotte residents now have a 1 in 30 chance of being involved in a collision on surface streets over the course of a year. The data follows an assessment that came earlier this year from Allstate Insurance Company's annual Best Drivers Report, which ranked Charlotte 150th out of 200 major US cities for driver safety. With a crash rate 23.8 percent above the national average, we're worse than New York City. Let that sink in. While comment section pundits were quick to blame the unfavorable stats on lead-footed northerners or distracted driving, CDOT's numbers tell a different story. Of the 27,648 non-highway collisions recorded in 2015, speed was determined to be a contributing factor in 13 percent, down from 18 percent in 2014. Inattention and distractions like cell phone use accounted for 18 percent of accidents; an improvement from 2014's 22 percent. Those aren't the only categories where Charlotte drivers improved. The 2015 reports attributes alcohol use in 1 percent (or 278) of collisions — that's down from 317 collisions (1.38 percent) in 2014. We even got better at respecting fellow drivers — failure to yield to right of way contributed to 10 percent of accidents in 2015, down from nearly 12.5 percent in 2014. So what's the problem? What factors are actually responsible for the increase in collisions? That answer might lie in a pile of discarded data. It's up to CMPD officers to determine what caused a crash, using an official DMV 349 form to categorize contributing circumstances in every collision. The list is basically a smorgasbord of everything that can go wrong, like drug use, ignoring a stop sign, driving a lemon, passing a stopped school bus, etc. The list offers nearly 40 different crash factors to choose from, and most categories account for less than 1 percent of total collisions. If we bundle together all the data from this very specific list of categories, we have an explanation for about 60 percent of total collisions. With those factors like alcohol use and texting out of the way, a whopping 10,999 crashes remain, dumped into ambiguous categories like "undetermined," "no contributing circumstances indicated," "unable to determine," and, my personal favorite, "unknown." The above graph shows a comparison of official crash causes reported by CMPD between 2014 and 2015. As a recent college graduate and author of countless term papers, I can appreciate CDOT's knack for saying the same thing four different ways. What's troubling, though, is that this leaves the contributing circumstances of 40 percent of the collisions on Charlotte streets in 2015 as completely unaccounted for, their official causes basically labeled as "Who the hell knows?" CDOT Traffic Safety Manager Angela Berry attributes this year's spike in 'cause unknown' crashes to a software glitch that prevented coding for 6,000 crashes, but comparing reports from previous years shows that ambiguous data is nothing new in the TCD report. In recent years, the amount of crashes with no real cause has grown, making it harder to find solutions or prioritize how to educate drivers. "We understand that it can be difficult to get all the answers," Berry concedes when pressed about the gaping hole in the data. While 2015 saw an improvement in accidents caused by distraction or inattention, Berry says those issues remain a priority for her department. "Distracted driving continues to be a primary focus for CDOT," she says. "We believe those statistics are underreported in the crash data." Though the TCD report finds nearly 40 different ways to place the blame on Charlotte drivers, some alarming stats seem to suggest that it's time we look for answers outside of the driver's seat. According to the 2015 stats, 68 percent of collisions occurred in broad daylight and 78 percent occurred on dry roads. Half of the fatal wrecks to occur in Charlotte last year occurred at speeds at or below the posted speed limit. We know that Charlotte drivers have improved in multiple categories on the 'contributing circumstances' list, so when the total number of accidents still increases by nearly 21 percent, maybe the problem isn't the drivers or the weather or the time of day ... it may be the roads. click to enlarge We already know that 8.5 percent of accidents occur at high-accident locations. Why aren't we looking more critically at these intersections? Same shit traffic, different day: I find myself parked on the Interstate 277 off-ramp, waiting to merge into the far left lane of East 12th Street. The problem here is that drivers have about 125 feet to cross over three lanes of traffic before making a right turn onto North Davidson Street. This is exacerbated by the fact that drivers in the right lanes are often desperately trying to merge into the left lanes to access the I-277 on-ramp after the light. It's not uncommon to see cars completely sideways on 12th Street, waiting for a spot to open up in the right lane. Often, a line of cars is backed up onto I-277, blocked by the one car at the end of the ramp waiting to merge right. This junction (technical term: clusterfuck) is the eighth most dangerous intersection in Charlotte. Or consider sitting in traffic on N. College Street at the 7th Street light, with the Levine Museum of the New South on your right. That intersection is the sixth most dangerous in Charlotte, and if you plan on exiting the city by that street, you'll pass three more of the city's 10 most dangerous intersections in the next four blocks. Ryan Pitkin Beginning at this intersection with 7th Street, northbound drivers will pass four of the eight worst intersections in Charlotte in a five-block stretch of N. College Street. This begs the question: What is the problem with College Street? The road seems benign enough. It's probable that the overhwelming numbers of those working Uptown looking for a way out every day at 5 p.m. have become too much for the skinny, one-way street. While documenting traffic trends in high accident locations is a good start, we can't get the full story without finding a way to consider what role road design plays in a collision. Berry says finding this connection is easier said than done. "CMPD officers are not engineers and should not be making qualitative assessments that are outside their specific area of expertise," Berry explains. "Roadway design is broad and complex and takes into account many factors." Fair enough; road engineering is a tough gig, but it doesn't take an expert to recognize that Charlotte is outgrowing its roads. "The state and the city have a long history of funding transportation improvements, but the past level of investment has not kept pace with the relentless growth our region has experienced over the last several decades," Berry says. According to Berry, Charlotte is projected to welcome about 400,000 new residents between now and 2040. These new residents will likely bring around 250,000 more vehicles with them. "But, they will not be bringing additional streets, travel lanes, traffic signals, bike facilities, sidewalks or any of the other infrastructure required to keep people and goods moving throughout Charlotte," Berry says. "Keeping pace with growth will require consistent and continued investment by the state, region and Charlotte." As the future of the already outgrown roads remains unclear, I'd like to make a suggestion to those 400,000 incoming residents: Bring your bikes.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Philip Rucker August 10 Follow @PhilipRucker To these 20 middle-class mothers in the electoral battlegrounds of Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, the looming choice for president between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inspires a mixture of fear, pain and disappointment. “Nauseated,” said one woman. “It’s like choosing which arm to cut off,” said another. “I kind of wish we could start all over,” said a third. Such is the mood of America’s undecided voters, just 89 days until Election Day. The number of influential Republican officials saying that they can't vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is growing as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) pledges she won't vote for Trump. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Two focus groups of “Walmart moms” — most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate — were convened Tuesday night in Ohio and Arizona by two polling firms and observed by reporters. They showed extraordinary resistance to the two major-party presidential nominees. The women, whose surnames were withheld for privacy reasons, described Clinton as deceptive, inconsistent and out of touch with the lives of regular people like themselves. When the 10 moms in Ohio were asked their biggest hesi­ta­tion with voting for Clinton, eight said she is “untrustworthy.” Many of the 10 moms in Phoenix gave similar responses. “I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot,” said Julie, an office administrator in Columbus. Linda, a business owner in Phoenix, said she is tired of watching Clinton sweep scandals under the rug: “There’s so much stuffed under there they can’t even lay the carpet down flat now.” Only a few of them said the historic nature of Clinton’s candidacy inspired them. “I have daughters,” said Dana, a food service worker in Columbus. “It would be a big step for women. But that’s the only — only — positive I see coming from Hillary.” [New poll after conventions finds Clinton leads Trump by 8 points] The women’s views of Trump were just as harsh, if not worse. They see the business mogul as an inexperienced, impulsive hothead who is unwilling to listen and learn and lacking in humility. Ivania, a radiation safety officer in Columbus, said electing Trump president would be “kind of like sending a painter to do a doctor’s job.” Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton on the issues Africa, a single mom and businesswoman in Phoenix, said Trump is too authoritarian. “Kind of like a dictator,” she said. “If we were looking for a Noriega, he’d be great.” “He’s a racist, really,” said Anita, who works in sales in Phoenix. Added Deanna, a Phoenix homemaker with four small children, “He acts like a 2-year-old. I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities.” In Columbus, three women said they were leaning toward voting for Trump, two for Clinton, and five were undecided and open to a third-party candidate, such as Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. In Phoenix, five leaned toward Clinton, two toward Trump and three were undecided. Nearly all of the 20 women said they expected Clinton to win, however. “He’s going to do something between now and November to really shoot himself in the foot,” predicted Connie, who is unemployed in Phoenix. “He’s just going to self-implode.” Tuesday’s sessions — convened jointly by Penn Schoen Berland, a Democratic polling firm, and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm — were the latest in a series of “Walmart moms” focus groups studying the political beliefs of a key swing voter group that tipped the scale for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 but backed Republicans in the 2010 congressional midterms. In both Ohio and Arizona, incumbent Republican senators fared better than Trump with these women. In Columbus, six of the 10 said they planned to vote to reelect Sen. Rob Portman (R) and four for his Democratic challenger, Ted Strickland. In Phoenix, four women said they were backing Sen. John McCain (R) and three his Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. The women in both groups felt the candidates were in a downward spiral of attacking and belittling each other and not focused enough on important issues such as health care and the economy. They said they feel the country is on a better track economically than a few years ago but that the political system is broken, and they fear the rise of terrorism. Stephanie, who works in sales and customer service in Phoenix, said, “I don’t trust that [Clinton] would protect our country, but I also think that Trump would get us right into World War III.” [From Trump’s controversial words, a pattern: Outrage, headlines and then denial] If they were ready to cede the presidency to Clinton, these women still saw a lot to like in Trump. Asked who they would rather invite over to their home for a backyard cookout with family and friends, they overwhelmingly chose Trump. “I feel like personally he would be more fun and outgoing than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me,” said Donna, a pain clinic manager in Columbus. Clinton is “emotionless” and “has an extremely hard shell around her,” said Julie, the Columbus office administrator. “Cold” is how Mary, a retired cable television saleswoman in Columbus, described Clinton. “She’s a cold-hearted [expletive].” In a revealing moment of levity, the women were asked which Olympic sport they could picture each candidate competing in. They imagined Trump swimming (“his mouth needs a rest”), playing tennis (“back and forth with everybody”), archery (“I just can picture him completely nailing it”) and rowing as the boat’s coxswain (“yell at them to keep going”). For Clinton, the women suggested golf (“boring”), archery (“shoot to kill”), fencing (“she’ll stab you in the back”) and gymnastics (“she has to stay balanced — tries to please as many people as possible”). As they contemplated the November election, the women sighed. They said they were disgusted by the tone of it all — the name-calling, the attacks, the partisanship. They wish there were other options than Clinton and Trump. “I’d [rather] pick Minnie Mouse right now,” Ivania said. “In politics, nobody’s ever great, but these two are just blah,” Deanna said. “They make me sick. With their integrity and moral values, it’s kind of gross.” Gidget, a customer service manager in Columbus, summed up the choice: “I feel like no matter which way we chose, we’re going to lose.” The women paused to think of the first word that first comes to mind when they hear “President Hillary Clinton.” “I cringe,” said Maria, a homemaker and lunch aide in Columbus. “Deal with it, and pray,” said Nicole, a mail carrier in Phoenix. What about when they hear “President Donald Trump”? “A joke,” said Anita. “A buffoon,” said Deanna.

What is this ? X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen TORONTO – For 55 years, Giant Tiger’s smiling feline mascot has beckoned shoppers in small towns and those driving up to the cottage. But after years of operating under the radar amid intense competition against rivals like Walmart and the now defunct Target Canada, the company is setting its sights on becoming a household name. The Ottawa-based retailer, with its trademark yellow branding, currently operates 220 stores and has a goal of opening 10 to 15 new stores every year for the next three to five years. Story continues below The company also has plans to revamp the design of its locations and increase its product offerings in order to build a better shopping experience. Growing its e-commerce business has also been a top priority. Selling everything from groceries to big-screen TVs, the national discount chain credits the key to its survival and more importantly, its success over the last half-century, to delivering value to shoppers in the know. READ MORE: 5 things to know about Canada’s ‘stagnant’ economy right now “Giant Tiger is Canada’s best-kept secret,” touts Thomas Haig, president and chief operating officer at the privately-owned company. But in growing its footprint, Haig says it will not lose sight of what has kept it sitting pretty: its local franchise owners who know their customers and knows what works for their specific community. “These store managers live in the area, (have) lived there for several years and understand the clientele and understand the needs and wants of the community,” he said. For instance, some locations carry hunting and cottage supplies if they’re serving rural areas, while others may sell medical uniforms if they’re close to a hospital. As part of its expansion, the company says it’s looking for sites between 18,000 to 25,000 square feet in communities where there’s demand for Giant Tiger – including areas where there’s already a location. Recent openings have included stores in Bathurst, N.B., Sudbury, Ont., and Wetaskiwin, Alta. The company also recently announced a new store in Peterborough, Ont., scheduled to open next April. READ MORE: Retailers just endured their ‘worst year’ – but will this one be any better? For the past few years, Giant Tiger has been working on transforming its sleepy image in order to stay relevant to customers who want one-stop shopping for household items and groceries. One of the biggest priorities the company has is the task of reorganizing store layouts so customers can navigate faster and easier as opposed to rivals who operate warehouse-sized locations that force customers to walk around aimlessly. “(Our customers) are looking for a simplified shopping experience,” says Karen Sterling, vice-president of marketing at Giant Tiger. Their target customer continues to be women between 30 to 55 years old, with two kids, who are the “CFO (chief financial officer)” of their families and looking for value from their purchases. READ MORE: Loblaw to invest $1B in major store expansion, create 20,000 new jobs Sterling says their customers’ time constraints have also motivated the company to include more product selection, so a weekly shop for toilet paper, frozen pizza, workout clothes or back-to-school supplies can all be done under one roof. “The smaller store size is a competitive advantage,” she said. Along with updating its store look, the company has also been increasing its e-commerce presence. It currently has about 6,000 products online, with the option of shipping some of them to home or a local store for pickup. Retail analyst Sandy Silva, who is with market research firm NPD Group, says part of Giant Tiger’s success comes from customers who like the idea of supporting a Canadian business.

At the time I thought the event was a rarity in our community however I again have witnessed the low moral fabric of some individuals who have the privilege of driving a motor vehicle. Hit and run incidents are becoming an all too common event many of which involve personal injury and death. There could be many reasons why a person elects to run including the following:  Fearful about what they have done and the potential consequences  Eluding financial responsibility and penalties  Driving without a license or with an expired license  Driving without proper registration  Driving without insurance  Driving while intoxicated and the fear of being charged with a DUI  Driving under the influence of drugs or having illegal drugs or alcohol in the vehicle  Driving a stolen vehicle On July 15th in the parking lot of Gateway Safeway or the nearby Superstore someone struck the front bumper of my car resulting in an approximate $2,400 repair bill. Again there was no note under the windshield wiper as required by law  just the pungent air of another individual who failed to take responsibility of their actions. A week earlier someone backed into my wifes car  luckily my wife witnessed the accident and the individual admitted her responsibility. Yes three accidents in less than a month, two of which I have to bear the cost for. All three incidents require the inconvenience of having them repaired. I would like to send this message to all drivers: Dont compound a mistake. Even if you think you can get away with scraping that parked car at the mall and leaving the scene, dont. You are not only being a bad neighbour and citizen, in this day when nearly everyone carries a camera on their phone, you are likely to be eventually caught and face dire consequences. The term hit and run implies a conscious intent to abandon the scene. If you hit a parked car it is somewhat impractical to wait until the owner returns. However it is your duty within the law to leave a note detailing who you are and your full contact information. If you have nothing with which to write, leave behind an identifier, such as your registration trapped under a wiper, or something else that indicates an effort to reveal intent to claim responsibility. Alternatively memorize the licence plate number or take a picture of the plate and report the incident to the police. They will be able to contact the registered owner informing them who damaged their vehicle. In conclusion, every driver should do their best to drive calmly and minimize distractions in order to reduce the risk of accidents to begin with. I realize that accidents can happen even under the utmost care. However, when they do take full responsibility  do the right thing!

The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay", s Chief Executive Doug McMillon said. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time to get the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi Inc, the owner of sites like Diapers and Soap, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year.

(Photo: Buckeye Police Department) This week would have been Jesse Wilson's first in fourth grade at Bradley Academy of Excellence in Goodyear. Teachers, school staff and families had hoped that the 10-year-old, missing since July 18, would have been walking through the school’s halls and playing at recess with his classmates. Instead, a yellow desk with a stuffed smiley face in its seat sits at the school entrance in his honor. Yellow ribbon runs in and out of the openings of the campus fence and reads, "LEAD JESSE HOME" in big letters. It has been more than three weeks since the boy went missing from his home in Buckeye near 239th Avenue and Twilight Trail. His mother, Crystal Wilson, said she awoke about 1:30 a.m. to find him missing from his room after he had gone to bed four hours earlier. Police said Jesse slipped out his bedroom window and wandered — something he had done in the past but never for an extended period. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, Crystal Wilson recalled a day several months ago when the doorbell rang at 4 a.m. She opened the door to find a police officer and Jesse. Jesse had been found hanging out in the back of a pickup down the street. Jesse told his mother that he had just wanted to go to school — he loved school, she said. Crystal Wilson was not available to comment this week. Daniel Hughes, the charter school’s president, said even without Jesse’s presence as classes kicked back into session, those at the school remain positive and optimistic about his return. “We want him to know that we are looking forward to seeing him soon,” he said. “We started setting the tone and the feeling on how to deal with this issue right away. Everyone has been so involved with our campaign 'Lead Jesse Home.' We had families engage with children before the start of school so that they could be well-prepared." School officials have helped Wilson manage the uncertainty of her son's disappearance and acted as media liaisons for her. They allowed her to stay in a school conference room for two weeks before classes began. Teams of volunteers have been assisting Buckeye police, FBI officials and other law-enforcement agencies in the search for Jesse. They have scoured nearby desert areas and parks, with no result.

The most recent survey of kidnapping, the National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Throwaway Children, or NISMART, was conducted for the U.S. Department of Justice in 2002. It found that of the roughly 281,000 children who are abducted each year, 203,900 children are taken by a family member, often in a custody dispute. Just  90 to 115 children are victims of “stereotypical kidnappings,” according to the report. A stereotypical kidnapping, according to the study, is committed by a stranger or a distant acquaintance; the child is transported at least 50 miles from the abduction site and held for ransom, with the intention of killing or keeping the child permanently. NISMART found that the remaining 58,000 or so cases are known as “nonfamily abductions,” which occur when someone other than the child’s family takes him or her for a brief period. “The most frequent reason for a child’s disappearance, statistically speaking of course, are kids who are alienated and run away from home,” Dr. David Finkelhor, a researcher for NISMART, said in an interview with The Republic. Finkelhor also serves as the director of Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, which has extensively studied child victimization and missing-children cases. "It’s very unusual for a child that young to do that,” he said, when told about the known specifics of Jesse's disappearance. "It’s usually a child in their early teens or teens who may really have a serious conflict with their family or serious issues with school, who might have someplace to run away to or go to." "Kid that age are vulnerable to getting into situations in which they’re in physical danger in the environment,” Finkelhor said. Search for Jesse continues round the clock Sgt. Jason Weeks, a Buckeye police spokesman, said detectives have searched Buckeye Lake and canals in the area with the use of drones. He credits a local company for donating equipment to use on the weekends, allowing authorities to cover more ground and use fewer personnel. Jesse Wilson Jesse Wilson, 10, was reported missing by his mother July 17. Since then, Buckeye police, FBI and community volunteers have been searching for the boy. What we know about Jesse Wilson Boy's disappearance rattles community Police release mom's call for help Mother makes tearful plea Police continue search as Jesse's school desk sits empty Police search fields for Jesse Wilson Police brought home Jesse in April Heat has been another concern for Jesse and for those out searching for him. As temperatures stay high, along with the humidity from the Arizona monsoon season, crews can be out for only a few hours at a time, he said. “Nothing about our strategy has changed. We are searching round the clock and using every resource given to us," Weeks said about the search. "We are utilizing on-duty personnel and air assets at our disposal." Buckeye police have set up a tips line and email address. So far, police have received 24 tips to the hotline. "While we still have to follow up on a few more, the tips thus far have not led to any leads in the case," Weeks said. "I urge that anyone who may know something to please call." Other resources in use include U.S. Border Patrol tracking dogs and a "missing" poster delivered along with Domino's pizza in Buckeye. General Manager Ed Green said that Domino's wanted to do its part to help the community. Many factors could be at work Finklehor said it appeared that authorities were doing what they should be doing. “I think this would be a high-priority case for the Police Department and that they wouldn’t relent on their efforts for quite a while … for a number of months, until every lead is investigated,”  he said. “They need to be actively and as aggressively involved.” AZCENTRAL Community rallies for missing 10-year-old Jesse Wilson Finklehor said that the public shouldn’t infer much about how much time has passed since Jesse’s disappearance, or in any missing-children cases, because many different factors are at play. “You’ll sometimes hear people say something like if they don’t find a kid on the first day, that the odds are bad about what’s happened. I don’t think that’s strictly true,” he said. “It’s true that most missing-children episodes are resolved fairly quickly. It’s rare for them to go longer than a few weeks. “It really depends what has happened to the child. If the child is in custody of a parent or hiding out somewhere, then the odds of the child being recovered (are) good. If a child is subject to foul play by parents or abducted by strangers, yes, it doesn’t bode well." Finklehor said it's not just about "stranger danger"; parents need to teach their children more than not to speak with people they don’t know. “Missing-children cases have the capacity to mobilize fear in the community. It is important for the public to realize that stranger-abduction scenarios are very rare," he said. "Parents need to realize that children are more likely to come to harm’s way by someone they will know. Parents should give their children information on how to sense when somebody is not a good person to be around. They need to give their kids a strategy for how to refuse a situation and how to get help. “Families need to know when to seek help for kids who are having a hard time or struggling with conflicts because those kinds of conflicts can be the basis for kids’ disappearances for one reason or another," he said. Jesse's description and where to call with info Jesse is 4 feet tall, weighs about 60 pounds and was last seen wearing a red shirt, shorts, black socks and black shoes. He has no known medical conditions.

(WIVB) — Authorities believe whoever was making meth below the parking lot at the Walmart in Amherst used a large culvert entrance to get there. It’s open and provides easy access to anyone who wants to walk underground. Law enforcement in Amherst is still piecing through evidence that was gathered from a subterranean methamphetamine lab Monday afternoon. The lab was located beneath a high traffic area at the Walmart in Amherst. Law-enforcement collected plenty of evidence yesterday, including bottles and cans and various liquids. While officials say they did not recover any actual meth, the process was well underway. “What we determined yesterday from field testing was that there was actually no produced methamphetamine there,” said Amherst Capt. Scott Chamberlin. “But what we did have was the precursor to methamphetamine. The people that were involved in this operation were trying to make it. They just hadn’t succeeded yet. “It could’ve been dangerous just because of the fumes that are generated from the process of making methamphetamine,” he said. “It could be dangerous if people breathe them in. The chemicals when they’re being mixed, have the potential to explode, so you could have explosions.” Chamberlin also said police are looking at extensive video footage from surveillance cameras located on businesses along Sheridan Drive. As of Tuesday evening, there were no suspects.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related Posts 18-year-old charged in relation to underground Amherst meth lab Underground meth lab discovered in Amherst Police begin arresting pipeline protesters in North Dakota Acting US Attorney named following Hochul’s departure Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » WIVB.com provides commenting to allow for constructive discussion on the stories we cover.

The lab, which contained chemicals, spray paint and a substance that is believed to be methamphetamine, was discovered by patrolling officers in a sewer under the Amherst supermarket. 'It happens all over the country, all over the state.' Captain Scott Chamberlin told WGRZ. 'It's out of the ordinary for Amherst. Has it happened before? Yes.'  Patrol officers found a meth lab underneath a Wal-Mart car park in Amherst, New York, Monday. Pictured: investigators hauled up chemicals and other items from a manhole Bottles full of liquids were brought up for testing from the drain. Police said there was never any risk to the public The lab was discovered by officers on patrol, looking for unusual activity. By Monday morning, Special Operations Response Team (SORT) investigators in hazmat suits had cordoned off a section of the car park and were taking evidence from a manhole leading to the culvert. Witness Dawn Clowed told WGRZ she was worried about the situation. 'I mean, are we breathing in all this meth as we stand here?' she asked. 'Are, you know-- I mean, this is crazy. Just not a safe environment, I mean, you can't feel safe anywhere anymore.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Addict, 32, who is pregnant with the 28th child of a...

Police confirmed that the lab was no longer active  Police said there was no risk to the public; Wal-Mart, as well as much of its parking lot, was allowed to remain open.  The lab was later confirmed to be old and inactive, but the fact that it had existed at all baffled some. 'I seen men suited up, and I didn't know if somebody got hurt or, you know, I didn't know,' said Marie Jamieson of Kenmore. 'And then I was talking to somebody, and they said it was a meth lab. I'm like a meth lab? In Walmart's parking lot? You know, that's crazy!' Authorities say they plan to look at the Wal-Mart store's surveillance video to see if it shows people using the culvert. No arrests have been made yet. Investigators are now checking Wal-Mart security camera footage to see who had access to the drain.

The acquisition is expected to help Walmart refine its e-commerce businesses, while helping Jet.com expand its reach and strengthen its negotiating power with suppliers. But the implications for Walmart go even further, according to UBS analyst Michael Lasser. The deal could help Walmart shed any perceptions that it's a retail dinosaur still deeply rooted in the era when brick-and-mortar stores thrived. In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other top online retailers. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." Walmart Lasser said it will be important for Walmart to hold on to Jet.com's talent — especially founder Marc Lore — in addition to attracting new talent. "We think it will be critical for Walmart to let Jet stand alone, enabling this rapidly growing business to not get distracted by the bureaucratic culture of a large enterprise," Lasser wrote. "Plus, we think it will be important for Walmart to hold onto the talent. In particular, Mr. Lore ... [who] has proven himself to be a serial entrepreneur, which might eventually lead him to look beyond his role at Jet." The acquisition could also help Walmart attract younger shoppers that dwell in cities. Jet's shoppers tend to be young, urban millennials, according to Walmart.

Log In 0 of 3 Premium Clicks used this month Print + Online Subscriber Activation Register Subscribe News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Member Rewards log in Jet's $3 billion acquisition is a 'watershed moment' for New York's tech scene Tuesday Aug 9, 2016 at 2:03 PM Avery Hartmans Jet When Walmart bought Jet.com for $3 billion in cash on Monday, it became the biggest e-commerce deal ever. But it's also a "watershed moment" for the New York tech scene, according to investor Ben Sun from Primary Venture Partners. It's the biggest acquisition ever for a New York-area startup — the runner-up is Tumblr, which was bought in a $1.1 billion deal by Yahoo in May 2013. "You're finally getting entrepreneurs and operators who really are striving to build extremely large companies," Sun, cofounder and general partner at Primary Venture, told Business Insider. "It's so hard the first time around and all the people in the Valley, they've had that experience and they've been building large companies, or have been part of big companies. We just didn't get that experience in the tech scene in New York until I'd say the last couple of years," he said. Primary Ventures was one of Jet's first investors, taking part in a venture round led by New Enterprise Associates in 2014. The round included Accel, which is based in the Bay Area, and Bain Capital Ventures, headquartered in Boston. The fact that Jet had out-of-town investors is a good sign, Sun says. "Your good indication is, are West Coast guys coming out here? And are they doing deals?" Sun said. "We see it all the time now. The amount of interest that we get — as New York seed investors — coming from the West Coast has gone up dramatically. The big reason why is that you're actually seeing big exits." Sun says that when he met Jet CEO Marc Lore for the first time, he was expecting an intro meeting. But less than 40 minutes later, Lore had negotiated a deal with him and told him the one thing that no one else was saying yet: that he wanted Jet to be a billion-dollar company. "We were like, 'Finally! We're playing in the big leagues now, not minor-league ball,'" Sun said. Kenny Herman, a New York entrepreneur who founded SinglePlatform and recently served as vice president of business development at Shutterstock, witnessed a big acquisition from the inside when Constant Contact bought SinglePlatform for $100 million. A successful exit like Jet's has broader implications for the city, he says. "Successful exits spawn a new breed of entrepreneurs who now have the capital, network, and positive outcome necessary to roll the dice on creating their next big thing," Herman told Business Insider in an email. "Between the Jet team members who are fortunate enough to now have the means to think/build on a larger scale and the capital infused into New York-based VC and LP's, this could be a potential grand slam for the city."

Jet.com is the 16th company Wal-Mart has added to its menagerie of online retailers in an attempt to unseat Amazon. The brick-and-mortar retailer’s online sales declined again in the first quarter, whereas Amazon is experiencing consistent growth, even if investors don’t seem to care about it. For the time being, Wal-Mart said both companies will operate independently, although it will be attempting to integrate some of Jet.com’s more popular features into its searches. “Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Executive Doug McMillion said. “One of the things we really like [about Jet.com] is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay,” in part because they choose where to purchase an item from. That would difficult to accomplish if all links, however, led back to Wal-Mart — so for the time being, independence is the watch-word. That, of course, makes it difficult to evaluate whether this is actually a good deal for Wal-Mart. As retail analyst Charlie O’Shea told Reuters’ Nandita Bose, even though Jet.com has added nearly 400,000 shoppers per month since it went live in 2015, the company is still vying for what will be, at best, the second most popular online retailer — which may sound like success to normal human beings, but doesn’t actually excite Wall Street.

NY Police Discover Meth Lab Underneath Walmart Parking Lot Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share NY Police Discover Meth Lab Underneath Walmart Parking Lot Image courtesy of NBC 4 August 9, 2016 1:53 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk what would walter white say? methamphetamine labs Meth labs methamphetamines bad consumers walmart Unlike scientific laboratories, meth labs are always popping up where you least expect them, probably because they’re very illegal. For example, in a Walmart bathroom in Indiana, or more recently, nestled underneath a Walmart parking lot in New York. Police in Amherst, NY say they found the suspected underground meth lab on Monday afternoon, NBC 4 reports. While shoppers shopped, two first responders in full hazmat gear headed into the lab through a manhole. Police said officers on a routine patrol found the evidence in a culvert that runs below the parking lot, in a spot that’s tall enough to stand up in. There was nothing keeping anyone else from entering the area, officials said. “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good,” a police captain told the news station of the force’s random preventative patrols. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore.” Police found a spray paint can, “various chemicals,” and a liquid they believe to be methamphetamine. No charges have been made yet. One more time, with feeling: Breaking Bad is not real life. You are not Walter White, you are not Jesse Pinkman.

The undisputed leader in the action sports camera arena was up more than 7% by lunchtime Monday, as GPRO stock reached heights not seen since January. It’s up 2% so far today. Source: ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified) That is the second trading day in the past two weeks that’s sent GoPro through the proverbial roof, the other being July 28, with GPRO stock finishing that day up more than 12.5%. The difference, however, is that the latter was the result of a better-than-expected Q2 earnings report. What Drove the GoPro Rally? A recent FCC filing by Steven Kim, the Senior QA Compliance Engineer at GPRO, mentions an embedded GPS component in the GoPro Hero5 camera, and a supposed video clip from the Hero5 instruction manual shows an improved interface. 7 No-Name Tech Stocks That Will Make You Rich Sports enthusiasts have been waiting a long time for the release of the Hero5, which was originally expected to be out in time for the 2015 holiday shopping season. The market reacted harshly when management announced the delays. However, when news that the FCC filing included apparent GPS capability, tech enthusiasts and investors alike have again become excited about GPRO stock. The current Hero4 model does not contain an embedded GPS module because GoPro engineers have been unable to remedy power drain issues. It would seem, however, that the problems have been solved. Additionally, the inclusion of GPS capabilities popping up in action sports cameras from competitors such as Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Sony Corp (ADR) (SNE) — which, by the way, has done nothing to improve their market share — was likely a motivating factor for management to further redesign the GoPro Hero5. What This Means for GPRO Stock There’s no telling if the rally for GPRO stock will continue, but the market’s reaction to the news of the improved GoPro Hero5 is substantial. It shows that investors have confidence in the company and are excited about future releases. Twilio Inc (TWLO) Posts a Stellar Second Quarter So, even if GPRO stock gives back some of the recent gains, it’s still a keeper in my book. The real rally will come when management finally announces a firm release date for the GoPro Hero5. If it’s released in time for this year’s holiday shopping season, expect GPRO stock to surge significantly. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(WIVB) — A possible underground meth lab was discovered in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Amherst Monday afternoon. FACES OF METH: Click to view 30+ photos of Faces of Meth As Walmart shoppers ran their errands, two first responders in full hazmat suits were lowered beneath the parking lot through a man hole. “It’s a concern, I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area,” said Steve Harding, who lives about two miles from the store. Harding was one of a number of people who watched the investigation unfold. Amherst Police told News 4 that officers found the evidence in a culvert that runs below the parking lot. They said it’s tall enough to stand up in and it was not secured, so anyone could access it. “We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore,” said Capt. Scott Chamberlin. He said they did not receive any tips. The culvert was checked during a random preventative patrol. “Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day,” said Chamberlin. We asked him if it’s routine to check underground. He said, “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” Members of the NYSP Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team passed buckets of evidence up from the manhole. “Spray paint can, some various chemicals, a liquid we believe is methamphetamine,” said Chamberlin. Shoppers watched as the evidence was reviewed in the parking lot. Officials said there was no threat of air contamination or flammability. The evidence was placed in white buckets for further tests by Amherst Police. They also plan to look at Walmart surveillance video for clues. Chamberlin said they don’t know yet how long this was going on, or who was doing it. “This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line,” said resident Steve Harding.

"If Wal-Mart were starting today and we were building an e-commerce business some of the things that Jet designed into their approach would have been things we would have thought of and we would have wanted to do, and they've just done it from scratch," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC's "Squawk Box." McMillon said when he met Jet founder Marc Lore in the spring, he quickly realized the two were like-minded in many ways. By the time the meeting was over, they had already begun sketching out on a white board how a combination of the two companies could work. "I think we hit it off the first day," Lore told CNBC. "We just started talking about these amazing plans we had." Yet this isn't the first time Lore has caught the attention of a retail giant. He's best known for co-founding Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com. That company was sold to Amazon in 2010, which led to a fallout between Lore and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Though Lore told CNBC he has no relationship with Bezos, he said it's different with McMillon and Wal-Mart. "[This partnership is] built from day one on the back of trust, which is one of our core values here," he said. "I'm committed for the long haul here," he added. "This is a very different experience for me." For the Jet founder, who had already raised $565 million to fund the money-losing company, a deal with Wal-Mart was more attractive than seeking out additional financing. That's because it allowed the company to quickly accelerate its growth and leverage Wal-Mart's financials and relationships, he said. "E-commerce is a scale game and you want to get as much leverage as you can," he said. "It just gives us scale almost overnight." Getty Images Marc Lore, CEO of Jet.com and Doug McMillon, CEO of Wal-Mart Wal-Mart confirmed Monday that it would acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion, in the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company. A portion of the $3 billion in cash it's paying for Jet, along with $300 million in Wal-Mart shares, will be spent over time. Terms of those payments were not disclosed. Wal-Mart will update its guidance when it reports its second-quarter earnings next week. It previously had said it would invest $1.1 billion in e-commerce this year. Wal-Mart had $7.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of April. The acquisition is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approval. Jet will continue to operate as a separate brand, though certain design elements from its site will be incorporated at Walmart.com over time, McMillon told reporters on Monday. He added that he has been particularly impressed with Jet's algorithm, which allows consumers to snag a lower price by buying in bulk. Stocking up on large quantities of merchandise and low prices are hallmarks at Wal-Mart and Jet, McMillon said. "Basket economics are more attractive to us than unit economics," McMillon told CNBC. Acquiring Jet will also help Wal-Mart connect with more urban, millennial shoppers, and find more cost-efficient ways to ship its online orders. Though the fledgling company is not yet profitable, it has a run-rate of $1 billion in gross merchandise value after just one year of operation. McMillon said Wal-Mart's scale will help the company become profitable faster. McMillon said he has a growth number in mind for Jet, but declined to share what that was. The first goal, of the partnership, he said, is high customer satisfaction scores. Though McMillon said he is proud of what Wal-Mart accomplished on its own, a partnership with Jet was more an "and, not an or." "We've got a great team in California that's been making progress on e-commerce. We've talked before about the fact we needed fulfillment centers, we've needed an operating system. ... But we have even higher expectations and higher standards about what we ultimately want to achieve."

The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by Internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity."One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. Billions spent on online efforts Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Tags: Apps, Internet, JD.com, Jet.com, Wal Mart, Walmart Struggling Twitter to Rent Out Office Space SwiftKey Keyboard App for Android Gets an Update to Re-Enable Cloud Sync Wal-Mart Buying Jet.com to Lift Online Sales, Battle Amazon     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Ziox Mobiles Zelfie Intex Aqua E4 HTC Desire 650 Panasonic Eluga Mark 2 HTC 10 evo Ziox Mobiles Astra Prism Ziox Mobiles Astra Zing+ Huawei Mate 9 Lite Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Celkon Millennia Q599 Ufe...

The 'TJ Maxx of grocery stores' is coming for Kroger, Walmart, and Whole Foods Ashley Lutz Aug. 2, 2016, 12:55 PM 202,350 facebook linkedin twitter email print Grocery Outlet on Instagram Grocery Outlet wants to be the "TJ Maxx of grocery stores." The Los Angeles-based regional chain has 251 locations and plans to expand to 376 by 2020, according to a recent profile in Frozen & Refrigerated Buyer magazine that was cited by RetailWire. It is on track to gross $2 billion in sales this year. TJ Maxx offers lower prices than department stores by paring down the shopping experience and passing savings on to consumers. The apparel store has been blamed for the downfall of brands like Nordstrom and Macy's. Grocery Outlet says that it sells items at a 40% to 70% discount off regular stores' prices by offering surplus items, seasonal closeouts, and discontinued items. While some of its goods aren't up to manufacturer standards, none of what it sells is past the sell-by date. Here's why Grocery Outlet is becoming a viable threat to industry giants like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods: View As: One Page Slides Like TJ Maxx, Grocery Outlet says that it relies on a "treasure hunt" experience to hook consumers. Because customers don't know exactly what products they will find at Grocery Outlet, they keep coming back for the thrill. Still, Grocery Outlet executives tell Frozen & Refrigerated Buyer that it strives to make stores a place where people can do most, if not all, of their food shopping. Grocery Outlet says that it cuts costs by offering "opportunistic" products that wouldn't be sold in regular stores, such as surpluses or seasonal products. It also cuts costs by not offering traditional services like a deli, bakery, or butcher. Because Grocery Outlet can't always count on getting discounted products, it orders some staples like frozen pizza, butter, and ice cream and sells them for prices comparable to Walmart's. While Grocery Outlet doesn't offer amenities like a deli, it tries to excel in customer service. It also sells wine. At Grocery Outlet, workers will carry your bags to your car for you. While discounters like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's sell private-label products, Grocery Outlet sells brand names at a discount. Grocery Outlet is also making a big push into organic, healthy, and specialty food. It plans to open an additional 125 stores in the California and mid-Atlantic regions by 2020.   The chain does not offer coupons or promotions. Instead, it lets customers know about exciting deals in a daily email. The discounting model has proved to be a disruptive one in department stores, with TJ Maxx and Ross Stores challenging longtime giants, including Macy's. If traditional stores like Kroger and Whole Foods want to compete, then they will have to focus more on discounts.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Will Martin Aug. 9, 2016, 1:55 AM 456 facebook linkedin twitter email print People cool off at a beach in Dalian, Liaoning Province, China, August 6, 2016. Reuters/China Stringer Network Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Tuesday. The pound is heading to parity with the euro, according to HSBC. HSBC analyst David Bloom and his team believe the Bank of England will cut interest rates down to 0.10% in November, pushing the pound to 1:1 parity with the euro. The pound will fall to just $1.10 with the US dollar by the end of 2017, Bloom believes.   There's a big problem with Netflix, according to Crispin Odey. Voracious consumers are watching Netflix's content more quickly than the online streaming service can replenish it, Odey said during his hedge fund's second-quarter phone call, a 53-minute recording of which was obtained by Business Insider's Rachael Levy. The richest people in the world are spooked. They're keeping more cash in their pockets, a sign of fearfulness. Liquidity, or the proportion of their net worth in cash or cash equivalents, is now at 22.2%, according to a report by the research firm Wealth-X. Adidas and Nike are making a mistake ditching golf equipment, according to Deutsche Bank. In a note to clients about Dick's Sporting Goods, analyst Mike Baker noted that rounds of golf played have been growing over the past two years, and the growth appears to be accelerated. Chinese consumer price inflation ebbed in July, rising by the slowest amount seen since January. According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), consumer prices rose by 1.8% from July last year. The increase was in line with market expectations, but marginally softer than the 1.9% pace seen in June. The Reserve Bank of India left monetary policy unchanged on Tuesday. India's central bank kept its benchmark repo rate at 6.5%, the cash reserve rate at 4% and the reverse repo rate at 6%. The RBI's August meeting was the last to be chaired by outgoing governor Raghuram Rajan, who will return to academia at Chicago university's Booth Business School. Walmart is buying Jet.com in the largest e-commerce acquisition in history. Walmart will pay about $3 billion in cash plus about $300 million of Walmart shares for the two-year-old e-commerce site. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment, and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. China has warned Britain that bilateral ties stand at a "crucial historical juncture" over London's deferral of an 18 billion pound ($23.47 billion) nuclear power project. China's Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming wrote in the Financial Times that he hoped London would keep its door open to China and that the British government would continue to support the nuclear project and come to a decision as soon as possible. BP reportedly wants to sell its $3 billion stake in a Chinese joint venture. British oil major BP is seeking buyers for its 50 percent stake in a Chinese petrochemicals joint venture, its single largest investment in China, in a deal that would fetch $2-$3 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. BP has hired an investment bank to sell its shareholding in SECCO as part of a drive to cash out of businesses where it lacks control, the people added. A successful deal would mark BP's first significant exit from a business in China. It's production day in the UK. On Tuesday, Britain's Office for National Statistics will release data on the state of both manufacturing and industrial production in the country during June. The release will be the ONS' first data on the state of British industry since the vote to leave the European Union.

The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Reuters Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had co-founded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.   First Published On : Aug 9, 2016 10:16 IST Related News Flipkart sees huge potential in grocery, furniture to keep Amazon at bay Travels through the Amazon: Journeying through the rainforest, along Lima, Peru, Brazil Rs 500, Rs 1000 crackdown impact: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues stop Cash-on-Delivery Shoppers rejoice: Flipkart, Amazon, et al, will continue discounts at least until 2019.
