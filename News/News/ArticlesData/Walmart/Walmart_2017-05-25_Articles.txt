The council voted to approve startup funds, not to exceed $69,000, for a police storefront substation to be utilized by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, which the city contracts with for police services. The 1,299 square-foot substation will be located in Cherry Hills Plaza, 28115 Bradley Road, No. 4 in Sun City. The council’s budget appropriation anticipates a 5-year lease for the site. A vote was taken on a proposed ordinance to require property owners to address graffiti within 72 hours. The city would be allowed to fix graffiti on properties it is not fixed within the 72-hour timeframe, and may place liens on such properties. The ordinance’s second reading and adoption will take place June 7. Two Wal-Marts are currently proposed within Menifee city limits, Interim City Manager Ronald Bradley said Wednesday night. One, an approximately 182,000-square-foot store or about 208,000 square feet including an adjacent shopping center, could be built on 24.5 acres near the intersection of McCall Boulevard and Encanto Drive, just east of I-215. The store proposal is currently on its fifth submission, though the city is waiting to receive a few items for review for the submission to be considered complete, including a specific plan and environmental impact report, Bradley said. After all items are reviewed, the next step will be for the project to go before the city’s planning commission, he said. The store was first proposed in 2012. A second, similarly-sized Wal-Mart is proposed near the intersection of Scott and Haun roads after the completion the Scott Road/I-215 interchange project. “Whether they will actually build the Wal-Mart at that point in time, when the completion of the interchange comes to fruition, is yet to be determined, but that is the feedback we have from them at this moment in time,” he said. The Scott Road location was initially approved by voters in a 2011 ballot initiative and some grading has taken place in the area for future construction. Councilmember Lesa Sobek expressed concern about the McCall location, as the 2011 initiative approved only one Wal-Mart, not two. “The voters voted for one Wal-Mart in the City of Menifee, and they voted for a Wal-Mart at Scott,” Sobek said. “I’m concerned that now they’re talking about one at McCall. I look at our surrounding cities, and (the city of) Murrieta only has one Wal-Mart. The City of Temecula has one Wal-Mart.” Wednesday night’s meeting included the second reading and adoption of an ordinance prohibiting panhandling. Mayor Neil Winter also briefly discussed a bill signed by Governor Jerry Brown May 12 restoring vehicle license fee funding to four Riverside County cities, including Menifee. The funding, which was reserved for newly-incorporated cities, was taken away by a California Revenue & Taxation Code amendment in 2011, resulting in millions of dollars of lost funds for Menifee, Wildomar, Eastvale and Jurupa Valley, all of which have incorporated since 2008. Winter said the city will see the return of its funding in installments beginning in June. “Now we’ve got the money to be able to provide the services to you folks,” Winter said. “And that’s the most important thing.” Share this: Tweet More Share on Tumblr Print Email Related Menifee City Council, police storefront substation, Wal-mart Wal-Mart locations eyed by Menifee council added by Newsroom on May 25, 2017 View all posts by Newsroom → Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Abelove said the move is meant to ease court overcrowding, but police aren't happy. Setting parameters for when Walmart will summon troopers, deputies or police officers runs counter to their law enforcement training, they say. "We shouldn't be sending the message that stealing is acceptable," said Sheriff Patrick Russo, whose deputies respond to the Walmart Supercenter at 760 Hoosick Road, Brunswick. The State Police are unaware of any similar arrangements in the Capital Region, said Trooper Mark Cepiel, a spokesman for Troop G. "If we get a call, we're going to respond," Cepiel said. East Greenbush Chief Chris Lavin declined comment when asked about the policy affecting calls to the Walmart Supercenter on 279 Troy Road, which is in his department's coverage area. Abelove said he contacted Walmart about reaching a memorandum of understanding to make better use of limited resources in prosecuting cases in the Brunswick and East Greenbush town courts. The district attorney said the volume of shoplifting cases was crowding those court calendars. "We're not condoning stealing. Obviously, we're going to prosecute the cases they send us," Abelove said. "We want to concentrate on a person stealing a $500 television, not a piece of gum," Abelove said. The cases, the district attorney said, would involve first-time, non-violent offenders. The agreement between Walmart and Abelove's office is detailed in a March 9 memo obtained by the Times Union that Abelove sent to Russo, Lavin and the State Police. Abelove concludes the memo stating, "This MOU should benefit your agencies by resulting in fewer calls for service at these locations." Abelove said it was tougher than an agreement Walmart told him it had reached with Albany County. Cecilia Walsh, spokeswoman for Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares, said there is no agreement with Walmart, with stores in Glenmont and Albany, or any other retailer in the county setting rules for reporting shoplifting. Abelove's memo says, "Recently, I entered into an MOU with Walmart, with the goal of establishing practices aimed at minimizing the amount of resources to effectively accomplish each party's mission without causing an undue burden on the other or placing the public at risk." The first of six criteria cited by Abelove for Walmart to call police would be in "any case where the loss to Walmart exceeds $100.00." The other requirements are if a suspect tries to flee lawful apprehension; commits or threatens violence; has committed a previous act against Walmart that could be considered for prosecution under the MOU; disrupts business operation and/or refuses to cooperate with a lawful investigation; and cannot be identified and found to be free of warrants. In Schenectady County where there Walmart has stores in Glenville and Rotterdam, District Attorney Robert Carney said there are no such agreements with the retailer. He questioned whether issues of fairness would be raised in courts when a shoplifter arrested for stealing $50 of goods from one business is arrested while the police are not called at a business which operates under the MOU. Walmart spokesman Ragan Dickens said he could not speak to the MOU due to confidentiality concerns. He said the company has numerous programs, technology and people in place to reduce crime and calls to police. "We're encouraged by a 35% reduction in calls to law enforcement on average across the country since we began implementing new crime deterrence programs. We'll continue our outreach to law enforcement as appropriate as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customers' and associates' expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," Dickens said in a statement. Saratoga County Sheriff Michael Zurlo said he had never heard of any law enforcement agency reaching an agreement on when a crime would be reported. "We are responding to the Walmarts in our towns, Wilton and Halfmoon," Zurlo said. "We don't have any agreement with any stores in our county."   News Videos Most Popular 1 Wife kisses husband goodbye, never sees him again 2 Patient dies after ambulance crashes in Duanesburg 3 Woman left 3-year-old in car alone for 90 minutes, police say 4 The Mess Hall combines owner's military background, passion... 5 The girl dragged into water by a sea lion now has a rare... 6 Public money, lavish meals 7 A.M.

Wikimedia Commons Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has long been criticized for its massive buying power and lower prices that can drive smaller stores out of business. Now some activists are accusing the retailer of relying too much on local police for security at a store in Whitehall, and others around the country. But Whitehall Police disagree. Listen Listening... / 4:22 The Expose Walmart tour stopped at the Whitehall Walmart at 3657 E. Main Street on Wednesday. Activist Amy Ritter says it’s part of a nationwide effort to try to draw attention to Walmart corporate practices. The tour is led by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, one of the unions that have long pressured Walmart to improve wages and work conditions. Ritter points to police figures that show 1,099 police calls for service originated at the Whitehall store in 2016. Of those, police say 686 were “self-initiated,” meaning they came to the store in the course of an investigation and weren’t called by managers. The other 413 police visits were for dispatched calls. “This is coming from a multi-billion dollar giant that could easily afford to hire adequate security,” Ritter says. Ritter says the high volume of police visits to the Whitehall store follows a trend they’ve seen around the country. “When you have the largest private retailer in the country that profited $13.6 billion last year, offloading their security costs onto local police, paid for by the taxpayer, it makes you wonder if Walmart really is being the best community business that it can be,” Ritter says. But the retailer is helping foot at least some of that cost. Whitehall Deputy Police Chief Tracy Sharpless says Walmart pays to keep a special duty officer at the store 12 hours a day, seven days a week. At his department’s rate of $45 per hour, that would equal $196,560 a year. Sharpless says his department has special duty officer arrangements with 15 other businesses. “I do not think they rely too heavily on police,” Sharpless says. Neither Sharpless nor Ritter could provide figures on how Walmart compares to other large retailers, although Sharpless says his department does receive “a lot of calls” for the East Main Street store. For its part, Walmart calls itself a leader in anti-crime efforts. Corporate spokesman Blake Jackson says stores have seen a 35 percent decline in police calls since implementing a Restorative Justice program. “The program offers first-time, low-risk offenders a second chance in order to make things right by participating in an educational course in lieu of prosecution,” Jackson write in an email. “The recidivism rate (percentage of people who relapse into criminal behavior after an intervention) for Restorative Justice is just 2 to 3 percent, depending on the provider.” But that reformative justice comes at a cost: Those who choose to enroll in the program have to pay $400 if they can pay the entire amount up-front, or $500 if made in payments.

That said, more analysts are now following Wal-Mart shares and the retailer is heralded for its better-than-expected first quarter results posted a week ago amid a plethora of disappointment in the retail sector. Barron’s contributor Vito Racanelli recently noted to investors there are a few companies surviving a reset from the onslaught of online competition from Amazon. He puts Wal-Mart in that short list of survivors. Gordon Haskett Research Advisors recently initiated coverage of Wal-Mart one week ahead of earnings. The analyst rated the stock a “buy” with an agressive one-year target price of $90. “We’ve long been critical on Wal-Mart after years of under-investing and a lack of focus on its U.S. segment. However, this is not your father’s Wal-Mart anymore,” noted Chuck Grom, senior analyst with Gordon Haskett. He said on the back end of $6 billion of investments to improve e-commerce capabilities and shopping convenience to more customers, Wal-Mart looks primed to regain its productivity loop momentum with traffic already bouncing back. Grom said it’s easier to keep positive momentum than to get it. “Equally important, Wal-Mart is not backing down against Amazon. Instead, it’s building a digital ecosystem that should have tangible benefits across the enterprise. We think the stock is a prime candidate to be re-rated higher given both of the aforementioned factors,” Grom said. Wal-Mart shares are up 14.2% year-to-date trading around $78.47 at mid-day Thursday. Shares rallied to $79.20 intraday on Monday before dropping back to the $78.15 range. The $78 to $79 price range is giving a few investors reason to pause. Ben Bienvenue, an analyst with Stephens Inc., applauded the first quarter earnings results, but he kept the stock rated at equal-weight reiterating a “hold” rating. He said there’s a lot to like with decisions being made by management. “Certain initiatives are yielding benefits in many of the company’s business segments. We also like the recent management additions, as we believe the company is prudently positioning itself to compete in the increasingly important e-commerce marketplace,” he said. Bienvenue said it’s the lack of earnings growth that is keeping him on the sidelines for now. “We fear that operating margin compression will continue through the remainder of this year. We will continue to monitor the competitive landscape and would get more constructive on shares if we saw a path to significant earnings growth or a pullback in the stock price,” he added. Bienvenue said at the $78 price target shares are trading at 17.5 times earnings, which is pushing the upper limits. The better-than-expected first quarter results did cause Bienvenue to raise his full year per share earnings from $4.30 to $4.35 cents. Analysts with D.M. Martins Research see Wal-Mart shares as a “conservative play” for investors, noting the retail giant is producing positive traffic and comp-store sales which is not an easy feat for brick and mortar stores in this competitive climate. The company’s 63% increase in online sales did not come at the expense of brick and mortar and that’s nearly unheard of today, analysts said. When considering that consumer spending in the first quarter overall was up a paltry 0.3%, Wal-Mart’s same-store U.S. sales growth of 1.4% looks pretty spectacular, according to Budd Bugatch, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates. “Admittedly, the lack of near-term earnings growth stretches Wal-Mart’s valuation on a multiple basis. Nonetheless, we are steadfast in our belief that management’s actions will continue to drive traffic and comp sales growth in the coming quarters and believe the risk/reward is still favorable,” he noted. Bugatch rates Wal-Mart shares a “buy” and increased his one-year target price to $87, near the top of spectrum among analysts. The average price target among 35 analysts covering Wal-Mart is $79.55. The Telsey Advisory Group and Bank of America recently upgraded Wal-Mart to “buy” positions from neutral stances. There are about 10 analysts giving the stock a “buy” rating. But there are 19 analysts like Bienvenue on the sidelines waiting for earnings growth to increase or the share price to recede before they urge investors to jump in. Analysts from around the globe will have a chance to interview Wal-Mart execs next week (June 2) at the conclusion of the retailer’s annual shareholders’ meeting.

President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here's a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four's take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn't specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? Continued below. Related Content Korean companies are forcing their workers to go by English names Your Views: Readers' letters Labour shares details of its shoe-leather election campaign techniques It's complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. "They're paying cash or on a credit card if they didn't have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else," Kroger's CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it's difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company's entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren't disabled or raising children and don't meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. "Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump's proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don't pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize "the significant portion of a retailer's revenue that SNAP can represent." The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn't spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Walmart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal "raised a red flag." It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays "an important role in providing a safety net to those in need." HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government's overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It's a situation that is the "best possible outcome," said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people's financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there's still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a "multiplier process" in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump's proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That's because states may decide they can't afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump's administration. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi AP This story has been automatically published from the Associated Press wire which uses US spellings Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

She started her Wal-Mart career as a photo lab technician 24 years ago, before the shift to digital photography plunged Kodak and other camera-film titans into turmoil. Now, as rising online sales and changing shopping habits forever alter the role of brick-and-mortar stores, she is working to teach the company's employees new retail skills at a location in The Woodlands. "The best thing we've done is this academy," she said. Houston's size and diversity has made it a testing ground for some of Wal-Mart's recent investments in its workers, stores and e-commerce operations. To challenge online giants such as Amazon and remain competitive with physical stores, the nation's largest retailer is pouring billions of dollars into new technology, location remodels and employee retraining programs, and some local stores have been among the first to receive the upgrades. The company most recently debuted new features at a store that opened near Tomball last month. That location, which has an airier layout than some older models, offers a revamped checkout experience and ways to browse and buy items online while shopping inside the store. The store is one of three nationwide outfitted with the company's Scan & Go technology, which enables customers to bypass the standard checkout line by scanning and paying for items with their mobile phones or store-supplied devices. Wal-Mart is considering whether to introduce the technology in other stores.  Translator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.

She picked up one of scanners stacked at the front and set off down the aisles, aiming at barcodes as her young children clung to the cart. "It's the nicest Wal-Mart I've ever been in," she said. "I don't have to stand in line and be in the store any longer than I have to." Other customers gathered around large touchscreens that display a curated selection of goods available to buy online. With a few taps, a shopper can purchase an item on screen and, within two days, pick it up at the store. It's the only Wal-Mart location in the country with that feature. Store employees also will deliver goods ordered online to customers waiting in their vehicles outside, a service that some large grocers and drugstores have rolled out in recent years. But Wal-Mart, with its vast array of merchandise, offers a far wider range of items available for pickup. New investments Wal-Mart's updates to the standard Supercenter come on the heels of its purchase of Jet.com last year, a $3.3 billion investment that expanded its e-commerce reach well beyond Walmart.com. In February, the company posted year-over-year online sales growth of 29 percent during the fourth quarter, its first full reporting period after the acquisition. The shifts align the company's ongoing effort to encourage crossover between its in-store and online shopping experiences, often referred to as "omnichannel" retailing. Large retailers have for years been pursuing that ideal amid rising e-commerce sales, which grew 15 percent in 2016 alone, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Achieving such integration requires substantial investments in online platforms and distribution methods, as well employee training programs, said Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst for Moody's Investors Service. "Happy employees take better care of customers, and better-trained employees are more adaptable, more flexible," he said. For Wal-Mart, that effort began in earnest last year when it opened 40 "Wal-Mart Academies," including the one at the store in The Woodlands where Smith teaches. The company plans to open another 160 this year, part of a $2.7 billion investment in raising wages for employees and teaching them skills to improve store performance, better respond to new retail demands and advance themselves within the company. Embracing technology At The Woodlands academy, several groups of department managers and associates convened last month to cover a range of subjects, from building morale during team meetings to stocking displays within the store. One class emphasized the importance of using company technology when arranging shelves so that products appear in the right places on the Wal-Mart mobile app, which has a store-map feature. It also explained another online platform that tracks customer trends, analyzes sales by item and calculates potential losses. "We're getting them geared toward using that technology," academy manager Aaron Weddington said. "We have to embrace it." The academy, which serves 16 stores in two markets, was the fifth of seven to open last year in Texas. Wal-Mart plans to add another 10 in the state this year, including one that opened in Bryan in January. In her classes, Smith said she dives deeply on sales and inventory-management issues. She tries to convey to department managers the importance of learning what sells and adjusting products to fit a store's particular market. "The idea is to be more creative, to be a better merchandiser," she said. "It's the 'why' of what they're doing." This story has been updated to clarify Wal-Mart's plans for its Scan & Go technology.

Adam SacasaContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy A man accused of taking upskirt photos of women last week at a Jupiter Wal-Mart is back in jail after police searched his phone and found homemade child porn videos, according to a Palm Beach Sheriff’s arrest report. Deputies arrested Chad Thomas Gorman, 34, of Lake Park, for a second time on Tuesday. He was initially arrested May 19 by Jupiter Police at the Wal-Mart at 2144 W. Indiantown Rd. Security at the store said Gorman spent hours walking around the women’s apparel and that he snapped a photo under a woman’s dress with his cell phone, police said. A forensic analysis of the phone discovered 616 photos and eight videos. It’s unclear how many of those photos or videos are allegedly pornographic. Some of the videos show Gorman touching a girl and touching himself in front of her, according to the report. Gorman first told investigators he didn’t know anything about the videos, but later said he was aware of them and that the girl in the videos was 10-years old. She will turn 11 next week, according to the report. According to investigators, Gorman said the incidents with the girl began about eight months ago. He also said the girl was asleep when he was molesting her, according to the report. Investigators also noticed a partial tattoo on the arm of the man in the video which showed “Car” with flames above it. Gorman showed investigators the tattoo, which read, “Carpe Diem,” the arrest report said. Gorman had been able to bond out of the Palm Beach County Jail Saturday following his first arrest but is now being held without bond. He faces 12 counts of lewd and lascivious behavior with a victim under age 12, three counts of having a victim under 12 come in contact with bodily fluids, sexual assault with a victim under 12 and possession of obscene material charges.

Massmart reports sales drop Money Thursday 25 May 2017 - 6:34pm South African-based retailer Massmart, majority-owned by Wal-Mart Inc , reported on Thursday a near 2 percent fall in overall same-store sales. Photo: Nadine Hutton/Bloomberg via Getty Images JOHANNESBURG – South African-based retailer Massmart, majority-owned by Wal-Mart Inc , reported on Thursday a near 2 percent fall in overall same-store sales in the first five months of the current year, as outlets outside its home market underperformed. Bought into by Wal-Mart seven years ago in a $2.4 billion deal that gave the world's biggest retailer a foothold in several potentially high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Massmart has struggled with weakening economies and has therefore become more cautious in its expansion policy across the region. The company, which sells everything from food to electronic devices and building materials, said comparable store sales for the first 21 weeks of the 2017 fiscal year fell 1.9 percent, with sales in South Africa down 0.4 percent and outside South Africa down by nearly 16 percent. Sales in South Africa account for 91 percent of total turnover. Shares in the Johannesburg-based company fell 3.5 percent to R114.86, lagging behind a slightly lower JSE Top-40 index . READ: Sales growth at Massmart outstrips inflation‚ but share price falls Once at the heart of executives' expansion plans, sub-Saharan Africa growth prospects were dealt a blow in mid 2014 with a fall in the prices of oil and other commodities - export mainstays for many local economies - partly due to a slowdown in demand from leading consumer China. Massmart's chief executive Guy Hayward told a shareholder meeting that the company's performance was also affected by consumers becoming more cautious about spending and after South Africa lost two highly prized investment grade credit ratings last month. "The unfavourable impact on sales in discretionary product categories, such as general merchandise, has been notable and appears to be as strongly linked to weak consumer confidence as it is to underlying economic issues," Hayward said.

Photographer: Ethan Miller/Getty Images I recently wrote that the U.S. should reduce the corporate income tax, and replace the lost revenue with personal income taxes. But there are two other revenue sources that could substitute as well -- capital gains and dividend taxes. The goal of tax reform should be to increase business investment, which the U.S. needs more of: Less Building for the Future Business investment as a share of GDP Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economists often talk about capital gains taxes, dividend tax and corporate income tax as if they are essentially the same thing -- taxes on capital. And for someone considering investing in stocks, they are indeed fairly similar. Suppose I have $1,000 that I’m contemplating investing in Wal-Mart stock. If I do, I’ll have a claim on Wal-Mart’s future earnings. Corporate income taxes take away some of those earnings and gives them to the government. If Wal-Mart tries to hand its earnings over to me by issuing a dividend, then dividend taxes take away some of that money. And if Wal-Mart tries to give me its earnings by buying back its stock and raising the share price, capital gains taxes confiscate some of that. (Stock buybacks and dividends have a few differences, but both represent ways of returning money to shareholders.) So if I’m thinking ahead about my potential Wal-Mart stock purchase, these are just three ways that the government will take some of the value of my investment. Each of these taxes gives me an incentive to skip the stock purchase, and put my money in a bank account, or use it to consume more. If the taxes got too high, it could starve companies of the financial capital they need to expand and hire more workers, and the economy could suffer. What’s more, the taxes add to each other -- corporate earnings are taxed once at the time they are earned, and a second time when they are handed out as capital gains from stock buybacks or dividends. This is known as double taxation. For these reasons, some tax economists recommend reducing or even eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends. But there’s a big, important difference between the types of capital taxes. Suppose that instead of a prospective Wal-Mart stock buyer, I’m someone who already owns the shares. Now, the taxes affect my calculus in different ways. If I use my voting power to encourage Wal-Mart to hand over its earnings in the form of dividends or buybacks, I pay the dividend and capital gains tax immediately. But if I encourage Wal-Mart to re-invest its profits -- building new stores, buying new equipment and hiring more workers -- I pay the corporate tax when the income is earned, and the capital gains or dividend tax sometime in the future when the company decides to hand me back my money. In other words, for existing stockholders, the corporate income tax is an incentive to take money out of a business and spend it instead of reinvesting it, while capital gains and dividend taxes are a reason to delay taking money out. If the goal of tax policy is to make businesses invest more, then corporate taxes are definitely bad, but capital gains and dividend taxes are ambiguous. In the real world, dividend tax cuts haven’t done a very good job at prompting businesses to expand. In 2003 the U.S. enacted a huge cut in dividend taxes, called the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The top dividend income tax rate went from 38.6 percent to 15 percent. Dividend issuance increased somewhat. But as a 2015 paper by economist Danny Yagan found, this gigantic tax cut did nothing to stimulate business investment. Another recent study in Sweden also found no effect. Contrast this with the evidence on corporate income taxes. A number of studies have found that cutting the corporate tax does boost business investment. This fits with intuition -- corporate taxes clearly discourage business expansion, while the case for cutting capital gains and dividend taxes is unclear. This suggests that if the U.S. wants to get businesses to expand more, instead of just disgorging their cash, it should consider shifting away from the corporate income tax to capital gains and dividend taxes. Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View Sign Up There might be another reason to raise the capital gains and dividend taxes: discouraging corporate short-termism. Many industry leaders worry that financial markets focus too much on annual stock performance, forcing public companies to spend too much energy on meeting quarter-to-quarter earnings forecasts. Capital gains taxes, by encouraging investors to keep their money in a company, could blunt short-termism and lead to more investment for the long term. This idea isn’t without risks. Locking in investments could discourage investors from moving their money from old, slow-growing companies to fast-growing young ones. But with corporate borrowing rates near 50-year lows, this doesn’t seem like that big of a danger right now. So the U.S. should consider shifting the type of taxes it employs. Higher levies on capital gains and dividends, coupled with lower taxes on corporate earnings, could encourage the kind of future-oriented business expansion that the country needs.

The innovative brand of craft cocktail mixers is now available at Walmart stores throughout the country. Select favorites from its award-winning line, including Original Margarita and Sriracha Bloody Mary, will be hitting the shelves by Memorial Day, just in time for the prime cocktail-drinking summer months. The refreshing Sparkling Mojito will also be carried at select locations. “Walmart’s commitment to offering great brands at value perfectly aligns with our mission to offer quality and innovation at a value price,” said Powell & Mahoney Co-Founder and CEO Mark Mahoney. “This new opportunity allows our brand to continue to meet the nationwide demand for quality cocktail mixers.” And this demand shows no sign of slowing down soon. Consumers’ combined interest in simple yet complex tasting mixology and natural ingredients continues to trend. Powell & Mahoney prides itself on its trademark innovation and efforts to provide consumers with a cocktail experience that can deliver easy to make staple cocktails like the margarita, while at the same time providing them with the opportunity to get creative. The brand’s new line of sparkling cocktail mixers aims to provide just this, with exciting new additions like the Walmart-carried Sparkling Mojito and the Blood Orange Ginger Beer, which recently won the 2017 FABI Award for innovation. The launch of this new line is yet another step forward in Powell & Mahoney’s quest for continued innovation in the cocktail mixer category. Through partnerships with top-notch, national retailers like Walmart, the brand will continue in its efforts to quench the nationwide thirst for quality, innovative cocktails. About Powell & Mahoney Powell & Mahoney Craft Cocktail Mixers was launched in 2010, by two-beverage industry veterans who were inspired by the lack of quality mixers made available to consumers. Noticing a true need in the market, the duo combined their expertise and passion to launch the successful mixer brand. Powell & Mahoney has reinvented America’s best-loved classic cocktail recipes by swapping out artificial flavoring and preservatives for only the finest natural hand-selected juices, essential oils and pure cane sugar. Made in Williston, Vermont at a purpose-built, custom facility Powell & Mahoney mixers are handcrafted in small batches using steam kettles.

Video: Wal-Mart to ban woman who told customer 'go back to Mexico,' called another the N-word By Donie O'Sullivan CNN 17 hrs ago 9 Buy Now A screengrab from a video posted by Eva Hicks shows a woman at a Wal-Mart hurling insults. New York (CNN) — Wal-Mart says it will ask a customer to no longer shop at their stores after she was caught on video hurling racial abuse at other customers in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Monday. Video posted to Facebook on Monday night that shows a woman telling one customer to "go back to Mexico" and calling another customer a racial epithet has been viewed more than 21 million times on the social network. Eva Hicks, a mother of three, said she politely asked the woman to step to one side as she reached for medicine. It was then the woman became aggressive, Hicks told CNN. "She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me," Hicks recounted and then took out her phone and began to record the encounter. @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter.

I've known of kids that were banned from a store for shoplifting and then known them to be hired by the same store less than 6 months later.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart's Online Sales Just Exploded Online sales grew 63% in the first quarter, mostly from Walmart.com. Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) May 25, 2017 at 11:00AM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) saw its online sales growth fall into single digits last year before it decided to actually do something about it. When Wal-Mart reported just 7% growth in e-commerce sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the backlash may have been the impetus it needed to start making major e-commerce acquisitions like Jet.com. That move brought on Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur, to head up Wal-Mart's e-commerce business. It seems the moves are starting to pay off. Lore has made several major moves, and Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales grew a whopping 63% in the first quarter of 2018. What's more, CEO Doug McMillon says that most of that sales growth stems from Walmart.com, not the string of acquisitions it's made over the last year or so. Image source: Wal-Mart. Two major changes that paid off Wal-Mart made an aggressive move at the beginning of the year, offering free two-day shipping on select items for orders over $35. The company did away with its previous shipping program, ShippingPass, which competed directly with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. Wal-Mart's free shipping is available on over 2 million items. That's well short of Amazon's 50 million Prime-eligible items. Still, Wal-Mart is betting that it has a wide enough selection to fulfill most customers' needs. The second move Wal-Mart made was to offer discounts on certain items shipped to a nearby store. If Wal-Mart wants to successfully compete with Amazon it needs to use its physical stores. That strategy could be particularly valuable for big-ticket items where shipping the last mile is often costly due to weight, and customers can save a noticeable amount of money. Wal-Mart's growing third-party marketplace The selection of items on Walmart.com has grown from 10 million at this time last year to 50 million today. The growth stems largely from third-party sellers on Wal-Mart's platform. Third-party sales account for the difference in gross merchandise value(GMV)  growth and sales. Last quarter, GMV grew 69% and sales grew just 63%. Those numbers indicate third-party sales continue to increase their share of sales on Walmart.com. Third-party sales don't generate as much revenue, but Wal-Mart could generate higher profit margins from each sale since it doesn't have to handle inventory or shipping. Amazon, likewise, has seen a lot of growth from third-party merchants recently. Its Fulfillment by Amazon service takes the traditional marketplace one step further by allowing merchants to store products at Amazon's warehouses and take advantage of Amazon's shipping. That's how Amazon quickly grew the number of Prime-eligible items to 50 million. Considering Wal-Mart also has a large fulfillment network, it may consider copying Amazon's strategy. But why make acquisitions? As mentioned above, McMillon said the majority of Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth is organic. Moreover, he said the "plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success." So, if Walmart.com is growing fine on its own, why does it need to make so many acquisitions? McMillon stated, "The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up." Acquisitions like Modcloth and Moosejaw give Walmart immediate expertise in some high-margin categories. Wal-Mart is historically associated with low quality and low margins. Snatching up some high-end properties could help it sell higher-quality products with higher margins. That said, all of its acquisitions follow a similar pattern: It's buying up young brands at a discount after they've struggled to raise more funding due to slowing sales. By their nature, Wal-Mart shouldn't expect significant growth to come from the acquisitions after they've been incorporated into its e-commerce revenue. Considering the size of Walmart.com, they'll hardly move the needle for Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart's brand may still hold it back from incorporating higher-priced and higher-margin items on its main website. So, if Walmart.com is growing so well, why bother spending investors' money on e-commerce acquisitions? Overall, it was a great quarter for Wal-Mart's online business, but the company's acquisition strategy is still puzzling. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.

And the woman's attorney says it may be a case of mistaken identity. (Published Friday, May 26, 2017) The winner of Miss Black Texas 2016 says she was harassed and berated by a North Texas police chief who she said called her a "black b----," and then was unlawfully detained and arrested.  Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews Photo credit: CommerceTX.org In an interview with NBC 5, Carmen Ponder recounted her alleged interaction with Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews. The City of Commerce says statements about the incident do not align with statements from Crews and the responding officer. The city manager says Crews has been placed on leave during the investigation into the matter. GOP Candidate Charged With Assault on Eve of Election In her account, Ponder said that she was driving to a Wal-Mart in Commerce Saturday when a black truck cut in front of her car and began driving erratically, braking and accelerating. Ponder said she turned on her blinker, pulled around to pass the truck and then drove into the Wal-Mart parking lot. According to Ponder, the black truck followed her and pulled up next to her car. She said the passenger, who she believes to be Crews, exited the truck and yelled that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter how to drive and that she should not have passed his truck.  Video Appears to Show San Antonio Officer Striking Teen Girl Carmen Ponder Photo credit: Hunt County Jail Ponder said she ignored the man at first but eventually told him that that was illegal before she walked into the store. "I finally got annoyed with him trying to justify the fact that a 14-year-old was illegally driving on the road, so I turned around and I screamed, 'It's illegal,' and that’s when it was, 'Oh, whatever you black b----," she said. UK Concert Bombing Victims Were People of All Ages After making a purchase at the store, Ponder said when she walked out of the store she was charged by several other officers in plain clothes. “One of them shoved his badge in her face, told her that she ‘Better apologize to the police chief,’ but my client declined to do so,” said Ponder's attorney, Lee Merritt. “One of the officers grabbed her, pulled her back into Wal-Mart, and told her she was being detained. When other officers arrived she walked back to her car to explain what happened. An officer grabbed her and demanded she be arrested for resisting arrest. She has bruises on her arms from where she was grabbed.” Ponder was handcuffed, booked into jail and charged with evading arrest or detention. She spent 24 hours in jail. The beauty queen may have confused another man for Crews, Merritt said. Even though it may be a case of mistaken identity, Merritt said he believes Crews still violated Ponder's civil rights by arresting her. @MeritLawpic.twitter.com/LeHyS9JwHM — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 In a statement released Thursday afternoon, authorities said Crews was placed on administrative leave while an outside organization hired by the City of Commerce conducts an investigation: "On May 20, 2017, the Commerce Police Department responded to a call about a dispute between two motorists entering the Walmart parking lot. Though not on duty and present only as a customer, Police Chief Kerry Crews became engaged in the incident after being approached by one of the parties. Chief Crews made contact with the other party, but she failed to comply with his requests. As a result, she was arrested for evading arrest or detention with the responding officer arrived. She was then taken to the Hunt County Jail. Since the incident there have been a number of statements made about the details of the incident, and many of these details do not align with the statements provided by Chief Crews and the responding officer. As such, the City is engaging an outside entity to conduct an investigation into the incident to objectively review and determine the facts. For the benefit of the investigation, and in keeping with common practice, Chief Crews will be placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation. This is in no way an admission of any wrongdoing and should not be perceived as a disciplinary action. The work of the Commerce Police Department is essential to the community, and it is beneficial to both Chief Crews, the officers, and the City to allow him to serve without the distraction of an investigation clouding his day-to-day management of the department. Disciplinary action, if warranted, cannot be taken until after the investigation has concluded. At this time, the City of Commerce will hold all additional comments until the investigation has progressed." The Commerce City Council voted to hire the Fort Worth-based law firm Lynn Ross and Gannaway to investigate the matter. "We have had an incident that has been reported over the last couple of days in an incomplete manner," said Mayor Wyman Williams, saying this is why they chose for an outside entity to investigate. "We are so pleased that we have gotten media attention to an issue that is very important to not only this town, but to our country," he said, adding that Commerce takes pride in being a diverse city. 23 Million More Uninsured With GOP Health Bill, Analysts Say Crews declined to comment on the allegations, telling NBC 5 his attorneys advised him not to speak at this time. Ponder is calling for police accountability and has launched a crowdfunding page to raise money for attorney's fees to fight the charges. She writes in her youcaring.com post that she refuses to take a plea deal and is "more than willing" to go to trial. Raids, Arrests as On-Edge UK Seeks 'Network' of Attackers "My only crime...the color of my skin," she said. Ponder is the former Miss Black Texas U.S. Ambassador. She is also a Dean’s List student at Texas A&M University-Commerce and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney, according to her You Caring page. Commerce City Manager Darrek Ferrell says the city will hire a private firm to conduct an investigation, a matter the city council was expected to discuss Wednesday evening. An interim police chief told NBC 5 that Crews has been with the Commerce Police Department for more than 25 years. NBC 5's Meredith Yeomans and Homa Bash contributed to this report.

News Florida News 'Liquor wall' bill gets vetoed by Gov. Rick Scott Gov. Scott vetoed a bill that would have repealed it Gov. Scott vetoed a bill that would have repealed it Gray RohrerContact ReporterTallahassee Bureau TALLAHASSEE — Florida’s so-called “liquor wall” won’t be coming down after all. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill late Wednesday that would have removed a Prohibition-era law requiring liquor to be sold in separate stores from groceries and other retail items. Twenty-nine other states have similar laws that allow spirits in the grocery aisles, but the bill gained stiff opposition from social conservatives concerned it would lead to increased alcohol consumption, alcoholism and underage drinking. Yet it wasn’t those concerns that swayed Scott. It was the pleas of independent liquor store owners and workers that led to his veto. “I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida,” Scott wrote in his veto letter. “I was a small business owner, and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will impact their families and their ability to create jobs.” Scott gave few clues in the lead-in to his decision, but acknowledged on Tuesday that his family’s history with alcoholism — his biological father and brother both suffered from it — gave him pause. “I’ve had family members that have had the challenge of alcoholism and it concerns me,” Scott told reporters Tuesday. “So as I review the bill, I take all those things into consideration.” Big-box retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, pushed for the bill the past four years and don’t appear to be giving up on the idea. “There is a clear momentum in Florida for this common-sense approach to liquor sales,” said Michael Williams, spokesman for Floridians for Fair Business Practices, an advocacy group backed by Wal-Mart and Target. “We look forward to working with state leaders in the future to finally put an end to this outdated, Prohibition-era law.” The bill was one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of legislation this year. As big retailers pushed for the measure, independent liquor stores and Orlando-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits fought against it. Publix, which has gone to the expense of setting up liquor stores next -to its grocery stores, also opposed the legislation. Wal-Mart and Target have 30 registered lobbyists combined, and Publix and ABC have seven. Michael Corcoran, brother of House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, is a Wal-Mart lobbyist. The bill passed the House last month by a single vote, 58-57, with five members not voting. The vote in the Senate was 21-17. The lobbying came after Wal-Mart, Target, Publix and ABC all gave generously to both major parties and elected officials during the 2016 campaign and in the lead-up to the legislative session. Wal-Mart gave $50,000 to the Republican Party of Florida on March 6, the day before the start of the legislative session, and $7,500 to the Florida Democratic Party in September. It has also given $10,000 to Florida Roundtable, Corcoran’s political committee, and $204,000 to the Florida Senatorial Campaign Committee, led by Senate President Joe Negron, R-Stuart, since 2015. Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, has received $110,000 from Wal-Mart since December 2015. Publix gave $50,000 to Scott’s committee in January, and ABC gave $25,000 to the Florida Democratic Party during the 2016 campaign cycle. Scott had separate teleconference meetings with Wal-Mart’s U.S. president Greg Foran and ABC CEO Charles Bailes on Tuesday. Scott’s office also received 969 phone calls, emails and letters supporting the bill, and 6,751 calls, emails and petitions opposing the measure as of Monday. The bill would not have taken effect until next year and would have been phased in, allowing retailers that sell groceries to sell spirits in 25 percent of their stores in Florida starting July 1, 2018, rising to half their stores in 2019 and 75 percent in 2020. Gas stations with more than 10,000 square feet also could have offered liquor under the bill. grohrer@orlandosentinel.com or 850-222-5564 Tear down that 'liquor wall,' lawmakers say » Caption 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam talks to reporters during a campaign stop in Altamonte Springs, Fla., Tuesday, May 16, 2017.

President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal “raised a red flag.” It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays “an important role in providing a safety net to those in need.” HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump’s proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That’s because states may decide they can’t afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump’s administration. ——— Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi     Tags: benefits, program, would, other, percent, about, Other stories from today: Large inflatable obstacle course stolen in Phoenix burglary U.S. ambassador to U.N. hails Turkish school for Syria refugees Older Latinos more likely to tap into a retirement account     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Development trends on the Peninsula ...

Eva Hicks posted a video to Facebook of an encounter she had with an as of yet unidentified White woman. Hicks was reportedly trying to pick up her medication at the pharmacy counter when she politely asked the woman to step aside. Instead, the woman launched into racial insults, telling Hicks to “Go back to Mexico … It’s not your country … We don’t want you here.” A shocked Hicks, who has lived in the United States for 30 years, recorded the incident on her cellphone and posted the video to Facebook. But the racist woman was not finished with her insults for the day. When a Black woman customer spoke up against the racist woman, calling her rude, the White woman goes in on her saying, “That’s none of your business right now; stay out of it.” When the Black woman replies, “I don’t need to stay out of it. You are yelling loud enough for everyone to hear, stop being ignorant,” the racist woman states, “A n––a calling me ignorant?” A store manager enters the scene and tells the woman that her behavior is inappropriate and later tells her to leave the store. Since the video was posted on Monday, Walmart has announced that they have banned the racist woman from its stores. An official statement from the company reads, “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manger responded appropriately by asking her to  leave the store.” See the video below.

local impact, anticipates investing millions in North Carolina during 2017 through three store openings, 18 remodels and e-commerce enhancements, among other customer-focused priorities News provided by Walmart 25 May, 2017, 09:35 ET Share this article RALEIGH, N.C., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Walmart has released its 10th annual Global Responsibility Report, highlighting milestones in its global progress toward creating shared value for people, business, and society.  The report looks back at the company's progress during fiscal year 2017 in advancing the key areas of opportunity, sustainability and community.  Following are local examples illustrating Walmart's local impact in each of these three areas of the Global Responsibility Report: Opportunity Walmart is addressing barriers that can impede career advancement for associates. In FY2017, Walmart completed a $2.7 billion investment in U.S. associates that included increases in training, education and higher wages. North Carolina achievements include: Opening the first Walmart Academy in Garner in November 2016. Since February 2017, Walmart has opened four additional academies in Denver, Morganton, Morrisville and Fayetteville with plans for expansion throughout the year. These facilities have trained more than 2,400 associates to date. Awarding a total of more than $28 million in quarterly bonuses to North Carolina associates in FY17. Continuing its commitment to hire military veterans for a total of more than 7,000 veterans hired in North Carolina since launching the Walmart Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013. In addition to investing in its own associates, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation in 2015 launched the Retail Opportunity Initiative, a five-year, $100 million sector-wide effort aimed at strengthening the transferability of skills of the U.S. retail workforce and developing ways to make it easier for front-line workers to advance their careers.  Through the end of FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $59 million and collaborated with leading nonprofits, employers, government agencies and educational institutions such as the The League of Innovation and the Aspen Institute.  Community In FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $1.4 billion in communities worldwide, including more than $52 million in cash and in-kind contributions to non-profits throughout North Carolina.  Local non-profits awarded grants from the Walmart State Giving Program, one of several Foundation giving programs that play an essential role in the Foundation's mission to create opportunities so people can live better, include:  Support Military Spouses received $25,000 for the Military Community Job Fair and Employment Readiness Program Urban League of Central Carolinas received $100,000 for the ULCC's Continuum of Opportunity program Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina received $166,000 for their Restoring Hope and Health with food program Communities in Schools of Wake County received $25,000 for the Smart Academy As the nation's largest grocer, Walmart is uniquely positioned to support organizations that are on the front lines in the fight against hunger.  In addition to donating more than 28 million pounds of food to local North Carolina food banks – equivalent to 23 million meals – Walmart and the Walmart Foundation donated more than $50 million toward hunger relief in FY2017, including more than $306,000 for after school and breakfast in the classroom programs in North Carolina. Walmart also engages customers across the country in making an impact on hunger in their local communities.  In the U.S., Walmart stores and Sam's Club locations teamed up with customers and participating suppliers to support Feeding America through the "Fight Hunger. Spark Change." campaign, raising more than $17 million in funds in FY2017, including funds for the following North Carolina Feeding America affiliate food banks: Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, Charlotte, NC, $185,043 Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest North Carolina, Winston-Salem, NC $173,191 Second Harvest Food Bank of Southeast North Carolina, Fayetteville, NC, $55, 673 Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, Raleigh, NC, $189,352 Food Bank of the Albemarle, Elizabeth City, NC $32,552 Inter-Faith Food Shuttle, Raleigh, NC, $56,334 MANNA FoodBank, Asheville, NC, $82,367 Walmart associates are deeply engaged in their communities and in FY2017, associates overall volunteered more than 1.2 million hours generating more than $12 million in Walmart donations, including more than 17,000 hours with local non-profits and charitable causes in North Carolina, marking another way in which the company supports and impacts the local communities it serves. In FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation supported communities after 30 disasters. A total of $6.8 million in cash donations was given specifically for disaster preparedness and relief, including $170,000 in North Carolina to assist with food supplies following Hurricane Matthew, as an example. 2017 North Carolina Innovations and Investments Walmart's most recent earnings report shows continued positive momentum in U.S. sales, customer traffic and customer feedback, which is attributed to many of the innovations and investments the company has been making in store operations and its workforce. Walmart is planning the following investments in North Carolina this year: Open three new stores/clubs across the state creating approximately 700 new jobs statewide. Recently opened four training academies with plans for additional academy openings across the state.

In FY2017, Walmart completed a $2.7 billion investment in U.S. associates that included increases in training, education and higher wages. North Carolina achievements include: Opening the first Walmart Academy in Garner in November 2016.

Continuing its commitment to hire military veterans for a total of more than 7,000 veterans hired in North Carolina since launching the Walmart Veterans Welcome Home Commitment in May 2013. In addition to investing in its own associates, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation in 2015 launched the Retail Opportunity Initiative, a five-year, $100 million sector-wide effort aimed at strengthening the transferability of skills of the U.S. retail workforce and developing ways to make it easier for front-line workers to advance their careers.  Through the end of FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $59 million and collaborated with leading nonprofits, employers, government agencies and educational institutions such as the The League of Innovation and the Aspen Institute.  Community In FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $1.4 billion in communities worldwide, including more than $52 million in cash and in-kind contributions to non-profits throughout North Carolina.  Local non-profits awarded grants from the Walmart State Giving Program, one of several Foundation giving programs that play an essential role in the Foundation's mission to create opportunities so people can live better, include:  Support Military Spouses received $25,000 for the Military Community Job Fair and Employment Readiness Program Urban League of Central Carolinas received $100,000 for the ULCC's Continuum of Opportunity program Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina received $166,000 for their Restoring Hope and Health with food program Communities in Schools of Wake County received $25,000 for the Smart Academy As the nation's largest grocer, Walmart is uniquely positioned to support organizations that are on the front lines in the fight against hunger.  In addition to donating more than 28 million pounds of food to local North Carolina food banks – equivalent to 23 million meals – Walmart and the Walmart Foundation donated more than $50 million toward hunger relief in FY2017, including more than $306,000 for after school and breakfast in the classroom programs in North Carolina. Walmart also engages customers across the country in making an impact on hunger in their local communities.  In the U.S., Walmart stores and Sam's Club locations teamed up with customers and participating suppliers to support Feeding America through the "Fight Hunger. Spark Change." campaign, raising more than $17 million in funds in FY2017, including funds for the following North Carolina Feeding America affiliate food banks: Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, Charlotte, NC, $185,043 Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest North Carolina, Winston-Salem, NC $173,191 Second Harvest Food Bank of Southeast North Carolina, Fayetteville, NC, $55, 673 Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, Raleigh, NC, $189,352 Food Bank of the Albemarle, Elizabeth City, NC $32,552 Inter-Faith Food Shuttle, Raleigh, NC, $56,334 MANNA FoodBank, Asheville, NC, $82,367 Walmart associates are deeply engaged in their communities and in FY2017, associates overall volunteered more than 1.2 million hours generating more than $12 million in Walmart donations, including more than 17,000 hours with local non-profits and charitable causes in North Carolina, marking another way in which the company supports and impacts the local communities it serves.

A total of $6.8 million in cash donations was given specifically for disaster preparedness and relief, including $170,000 in North Carolina to assist with food supplies following Hurricane Matthew, as an example. 2017 North Carolina Innovations and Investments Walmart's most recent earnings report shows continued positive momentum in U.S. sales, customer traffic and customer feedback, which is attributed to many of the innovations and investments the company has been making in store operations and its workforce.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Team Red, White & Blue kicks off 2nd Annual Eagle Charge Race TAMPA, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Registration is now open for the 2nd Annual Eagle Charge, a virtual event organized by Team Red, White & Blue (Team RWB) where thousands of veterans and supporters gather in different locations around the nation to run or walk four or seven miles. Over 200 communities across the country will bring people together through the Eagle Charge to encourage the physical and mental wellbeing of veterans and their supporters through recreation and sport from July 1-July 9. As active duty military transition to civilian life, some struggle with reintegration. They miss the camaraderie and solidarity they had with their platoon, crew, or unit. Team RWB works to foster fellowship by creating bridges between transitioning military and their communities through regular fitness activities, social gatherings, and community service events, like the Eagle Charge. Walmart returns this year as the presenting sponsor of the Eagle Charge. As a long-time supporter of Team RWB and veteran reintegration, Walmart has a deep history with the military community having been founded by Sam Walton who served as a U.S. Army Captain during World War II. In May 2013, the company announced its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment pledging to hire 250,000 veterans by 2020. To date, Walmart has hired more than 170,000 veterans and promoted more than 22,000 to jobs of greater responsibility. “We see value in the leadership and entrepreneurship a military career can provide a company and a community. Supporting our veterans as they transition from active duty to civilian life is key to their overall well-being,” states David Hoke, senior director of associate health and well-being for Walmart. “Team RWB does an outstanding job bridging the gap between those who have served and the communities in which they live. We proudly support the work they do and are honored to be part of the Eagle Charge.” “The Eagle Charge is an amazing opportunity to reach veterans and civilians throughout the country as they run, walk, ruck or even stroll together while celebrating Independence Day,” said Brandon Young, Director of Development for Team RWB. “Veterans cannot reintegrate in isolation. There is tremendous power in human connection and through this collaboration with Walmart in 2017 and 2018 we will be creating thousands of opportunities for veterans and communities to connect in positive, healthy ways as they incorporate the Eagle Charge into their existing July 4th traditions.” Team RWB offers local, consistent and inclusive programming designed to bring civilians, veterans and active duty service members together through sport, recreation, fitness and social activities. The Eagle Charge is one example of this inclusive programming. To register, visit donate.teamrwb.org/eaglecharge. About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

Travis Hoium, Reuben Gregg Brewer, and Timothy Green (TMFFlushDraw) May 25, 2017 at 8:43AM Motley Fool contributors are constantly scouring the market for great investment ideas to share with our readers. And every once in a while, one sticks that gets us particularly excited.  This week, three of our contributors highlighted the stocks they are the most excited about. The surprising list includes Hormel Food Corp (NYSE:HRL), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR).  Image source: Getty Images. Growing fond of SPAM Reuben Gregg Brewer (Hormel Food Group): Hormel Food Corp isn't a name you would normally call exciting, but I'm super excited to have added it to my portfolio recently with its 2% (or so) yield. That may not sound exciting, but note that the company has increased its dividend for 51 years -- and the average annualized dividend increase over the past decade has been a massive 15%, roughly five times the historical rate of inflation! Hormel's long-term debt, meanwhile, makes up just 5% of its capital structure, putting the food maker on a rock solid financial foundation. HRL Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts That 2% yield, meanwhile, is toward the high end of the company's historical range. It's been higher, but 2% is about the point where the stock gets interesting, valuation wise. (I'll eagerly buy more if the yield goes higher...) What's pushing the stock down, and the yield up, is the fear that packaged foods are falling out of favor with consumers. Hormel is the maker of SPAM, Hormel Chili, and Dinty Moore, among other things, so this is a real concern. But Hormel isn't sitting still. It recently added Wholly Guacamole, Muscle Milk, and Justin's nut spreads to the portfolio, shifting into categories and brands that resonate with consumers. And its fresh meats businesses, including pork and turkey, aren't as exposed to the packaged food problem. Meanwhile, with debt at such low levels, it has plenty of financial flexibility to change with the times as needed. I'm excited because this was, in my opinion, a rare opportunity to add a great company to my portfolio at a very reasonable price. That doesn't happen very often. An online retail growth story Tim Green (Wal-Mart): Mega-retailer Wal-Mart is finally taking e-commerce seriously. The $3.3 billion acquisition of start-up Jet.com last year, while expensive, put Jet founder Marc Lore in charge of the company's entire e-commerce operation. The biggest move so far: free two-day shipping on all orders over $35. This not only made Amazon Prime less attractive for those who care mainly about free shipping, but it made Amazon's non-Prime free shipping offer look stingy in comparison. Amazon's $49 minimum for free 5-to-8-day shipping has now been slashed twice, first to $35 and then to $25. Those moves were likely in direct response to Wal-Mart. Even as Wal-Mart is aggressively going after online sales, the company's stores are performing well. Wal-Mart has enjoyed a long streak of comparable sales growth in a retail environment that has given many retailers trouble. Profits are taking a hit due to these investments, but the company is positioning itself to maintain its brick-and-mortar dominance while becoming a major e-commerce player. With Amazon dominating online retail today, it's easy to imagine a future where the company is completely unstoppable. But retail is not a business conducive to monopoly. Even Wal-Mart, as dominant as it is, accounted for less than 6% of U.S. retail sales in 2016. Online retail changes the game, but the idea that Wal-Mart can't compete with Amazon is dead wrong. The potential of Wal-Mart's online business makes the stock an exciting one to watch. I don't own it, but it's been on my list for quite some time. If Wal-Mart can keep up the e-commerce momentum, it could make for a great long-term investment.  The biggest financial opportunity in the world Travis Hoium (SunPower): A recent presentation from GTM Research estimated that the solar industry would be worth $2.8 trillion between now and 2035. As disruptive as solar energy has been, if that estimate is correct it could just be getting started. And SunPower is a leader in the solar revolution. Where SunPower made its name is with high efficiency solar cells, which allow it to pack more energy production on a roof or in a field than any other company. But the company has faced challenges as competitors from China rapidly cut costs and undercut the company's competitive advantage. 2017 will be a transitional year, but I think 2018 will allow SunPower to emerge as a healthier, better positioned company in a booming industry. SunPower's high efficiency products are gaining traction in residential and commercial markets, where space is constrained and efficiency is highly valuable.  In the power plant business, SunPower is now making a panel called the P-Series, which will leverage high efficiency commodity cells, and the "Oasis" platform, which will become a cost effective offering around the world. And 2018 is when that product should really start gaining steam.  The market has been very pessimistic about solar stocks in general lately, but the industry is improving. As power is concentrated in the hands of the best companies -- like SunPower -- it should lead to greater profits and higher returns. And that's why I'm excited about this stock in 2017 and beyond.  Reuben Brewer owns shares of Hormel Foods. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Sam’s Club launched a flagship online store on Chinese retailer JD.com. MILITARY PAY DIFFERENTIAL This week Wal-Mart announced a new pay policy for its employees who take time off to serve in the military for voluntary and involuntary assignments. The retail giant said it will cover the difference in pay when an employee’s military salary is less than what they would earn at Wal-Mart. The policy covers any military assignment from three days up to five years. The company already offers differential pay to some active service members. The new policy expands the existing program, and it now covers employees who want to do “voluntary services,” which includes basic training. Former Brigadier General Gary Profit, director of military programs at Wal-Mart, said the majority of employees who leave for military duty would take a pay cut without the program. Wal-Mart said it has hired 170,000 veterans since 2013 as it continues toward its pledge to hire 250,000 veterans who have been honorably discharged by 2020. STORE CLOSURE IN BOULDER Less than four years after opening a Neighborhood Market store in Boulder, Colo., Wal-Mart said it will close the store on June 16. The decision to shutter the store was motivated by the changing nature of retail, including the shift to online shopping, according to Wal-Mart corporate spokeswoman Anne Hatfield. She told the media the Boulder store closing was an isolated event. Overall she said the format is doing well with more than 600 locations around the country. The Boulder store employs around 70 workers who will be given the option to transfer to other stores. Wal-Mart has just the one store in Boulder and said it has no plans to remain in the city, but there are nearly 100 Wal-Mart and Sam’s Clubs operating across the state. SAM’S CLUB JOINS JD.COM It’s been several months in the making but Sam’s Club recently launched a flagship store on the Chinese online retailer JD.com website offering Chinese consumers imports from Sam’s Club in the U.S. Sam’s is initially offering about 200 products for shoppers in China. The initial focus is on selling personal care products, nutritional items and baby supplies that mostly aren’t available in country. Wal-Mart owns a 12% stake in JD.com, the second largest e-tailer in China behind Alibaba. Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright said last year that Sam’s Club was popular with Chinese consumers. He said as incomes are rising, so is the desire for U.S. imports which can be purchased at Sam’s Club. The retailer operates 15 physical stores, but now the online store on JD.com will give more consumers access to items like Waterpik Ultra as well as 30 Member’s Mark products and glucosamine joint health tablets. “Sam’s Club has a strong focus on quality, which is one of the key reasons in winning our members’ trust, and why JD is such a great match,” said Andrew Miles, president, Sam’s Club China. “The ‘Member-First’ priority has been our unchanged belief since entering China. … The JD Worldwide platform enables us to offer an extended range of new and quality products to JD’s 236 million customers directly from US Sam’s Clubs and further make our members in China truly feel that life in better in the club.” Comments comments Previous post New Sam’s Club set to open in Springdale, third club in Northwest Arkansas Next post Landfill gas plants are located in 44 states Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Tamika Edwards Ending poverty one judgment at a time Stacey Mason 15 skills to build Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Camel backs and last straws Robert Coon In defense of Goldilocks Todd Turner Deceptive Trade Practices Act changes will harm Arkansas consumers Latest Popular Wal-Mart finding favor with some on Wall Street, but not everyone is buying 11 hours ago McLarty Daniel encourages student attendance with car giveaway 12 hours ago Former banker buys Altitude Trampoline franchise location in Little Rock 13 hours ago Flooding in Northeast Arkansas could have more than $300 million economic impact on agriculture industry 14 hours ago Fort Smith Director blasts Civil Service Commission for nixing police chief’s hiring plan 14 hours ago Tacos 4 Life secures land for Benton County location 2,097 views Businesses encouraged to gear up for Arkansas’ new medical marijuana law 1,363 views State official says ‘review and investigation’ of Fort Smith recycling program underway 1,044 views Lt.

Bought into by Wal-Mart seven years ago in a $2.4 billion deal that gave the world's biggest retailer a foothold in several potentially high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Massmart has struggled with weakening economies and has therefore become more cautious in its expansion policy across the region. The company, which sells everything from food to electronic devices and building materials, said comparable store sales for the first 21 weeks of the 2017 fiscal year fell 1.9 percent, with sales in South Africa down 0.4 percent and outside South Africa down by nearly 16 percent. Sales in South Africa account for 91 percent of total turnover. Shares in the Johannesburg-based company fell 3.5 percent to 114.86 rand, lagging behind a slightly lower JSE Top-40 index. Once at the heart of executives' expansion plans, sub-Saharan Africa growth prospects were dealt a blow in mid 2014 with a fall in the prices of oil and other commodities - export mainstays for many local economies - partly due to a slowdown in demand from leading consumer China. Massmart's chief executive Guy Hayward told a shareholder meeting that the company's performance was also affected by consumers becoming more cautious about spending and after South Africa lost two highly prized investment grade credit ratings last month. "The unfavourable impact on sales in discretionary product categories, such as general merchandise, has been notable and appears to be as strongly linked to weak consumer confidence as it is to underlying economic issues," Hayward said.

To calculate CEO pay, Equilar adds salary, bonus, stock awards, stock option awards, deferred compensation and other components that include benefits and perks.

Rick Scott vetoes 'liquor wall' bill A look at the raging debate over whether grocery stores should be able to sell liquor. A look at the raging debate over whether grocery stores should be able to sell liquor. Gray RohrerContact ReporterTallahassee Bureau Privacy Policy TALLAHASSEE — Florida’s so-called “liquor wall” won’t be coming down after all. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill late Wednesday that would have removed a Prohibition-era law requiring liquor to be sold in separate stores from groceries and other retail items. Twenty-nine other states have similar laws that allow spirits in the grocery aisles, but the bill gained stiff opposition from social conservatives concerned it would lead to increased alcohol consumption, alcoholism and underage drinking. Yet it wasn’t those concerns that swayed Scott. It was the pleas of independent liquor store owners and workers that led to his veto. “I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida,” Scott wrote in his veto letter. “I was a small business owner, and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will impact their families and their ability to create jobs.” Scott gave few clues in the lead-in to his decision, but acknowledged on Tuesday that his family’s history with alcoholism — his biological father and brother both suffered from it — gave him pause. “I’ve had family members that have had the challenge of alcoholism and it concerns me,” Scott told reporters Tuesday. “So as I review the bill, I take all those things into consideration.” Big-box retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, pushed for the bill the past four years and don’t appear to be giving up on the idea. “There is a clear momentum in Florida for this common-sense approach to liquor sales,” said Michael Williams, spokesman for Floridians for Fair Business Practices, an advocacy group backed by Wal-Mart and Target. “We look forward to working with state leaders in the future to finally put an end to this outdated, Prohibition-era law.” The bill was one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of legislation this year. As big retailers pushed for the measure, independent liquor stores and Orlando-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits fought against it. Publix, which has gone to the expense of setting up liquor stores next -to its grocery stores, also opposed the legislation. Wal-Mart and Target have 30 registered lobbyists combined, and Publix and ABC have seven. Michael Corcoran, brother of House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, is a Wal-Mart lobbyist. The bill passed the House last month by a single vote, 58-57, with five members not voting. The vote in the Senate was 21-17. The lobbying came after Wal-Mart, Target, Publix and ABC all gave generously to both major parties and elected officials during the 2016 campaign and in the lead-up to the legislative session. Wal-Mart gave $50,000 to the Republican Party of Florida on March 6, the day before the start of the legislative session, and $7,500 to the Florida Democratic Party in September. It has also given $10,000 to Florida Roundtable, Corcoran’s political committee, and $204,000 to the Florida Senatorial Campaign Committee, led by Senate President Joe Negron, R-Stuart, since 2015. Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, has received $110,000 from Wal-Mart since December 2015. Publix gave $50,000 to Scott’s committee in January, and ABC gave $25,000 to the Florida Democratic Party during the 2016 campaign cycle. Scott had separate teleconference meetings with Wal-Mart’s U.S. president Greg Foran and ABC CEO Charles Bailes on Tuesday. Scott’s office also received 969 phone calls, emails and letters supporting the bill, and 6,751 calls, emails and petitions opposing the measure as of Monday. The bill would not have taken effect until next year and would have been phased in, allowing retailers that sell groceries to sell spirits in 25 percent of their stores in Florida starting July 1, 2018, rising to half their stores in 2019 and 75 percent in 2020. Gas stations with more than 10,000 square feet also could have offered liquor under the bill. grohrer@orlandosentinel.com or 850-222-5564 Tear down that 'liquor wall,' lawmakers say » Caption 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam talks to reporters during a campaign stop in Altamonte Springs, Fla., Tuesday, May 16, 2017.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) NEW YORK (AP) — A proposal to curtail the nation's food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Story continues below video × Advertisement Here's a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four's take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn't specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It's complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. "They're paying cash or on a credit card if they didn't have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else," Kroger's CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it's difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company's entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren't disabled or raising children and don't meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. "Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump's proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don't pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize "the significant portion of a retailer's revenue that SNAP can represent." The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn't spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received financial support from the Walmart Foundation and grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal "raised a red flag." It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays "an important role in providing a safety net to those in need." HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government's overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It's a situation that is the "best possible outcome," said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people's financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there's still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a "multiplier process" in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump's proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That's because states may decide they can't afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump's administration. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

"About 35 minutes in because I was already getting sick of it," Perry said with a laugh. "I started really listening to the music and realized that it's just non-stop. And then the lighting and everything. ... I was starting to lose my mind. After a little bit you get into this state where you just feel out of it." But still, the two Southport High School graduates and Indianapolis natives soldiered on. And they did so in the name of YouTube comedy. Together, Perry, an IU junior studying liberal studies, and Maxwell, a senior studying media, produce The Christian and Noah Show on YouTube. They upload shows on Mondays and Thursdays, and in their two months of posting clips online, the pair has attracted 333 subscribers. Previous videos include clips like "Two Dumb Millennials Catch a Giant Fish," "Don't Ever Rob a Canadian" and "Visit to Abandoned Warehouse Goes Wrong." So far, their visit to Walmart is their biggest hit to date, bringing in more than 6,100 views in five days. It's also a spiritual sequel of a video Maxwell uploaded in May 2016 when he spent 24 hours in Walmart by himself. That 13-minute clip has generated more than 370,000 views. As far as why they decided to give it a go, Perry said it was a combination of curiosity and frustration with others who take the challenge. "You'll see other challenges and stuff, and some people have done it with the 24 hours, but they don't show proof with like a timer or anything ... we decided on 48 hours and to make it legit," he said. "I would say it was a blast, but it really wasn't." From there, they did what they could to make their time inside Walmart enjoyable. They played every game in the electronics section and arcade. They read books and product labels. They listened to podcasts and attracted dirty looks from security. "We quickly realized if we buy stuff like every three hours, they can't really say anything to us because we're customers. So we spent a lot of money in there," Perry said. "I bought a bunch of gum and Noah kept buying food. ... We ate at the Subway in the store. We even got haircuts at the salon." For rest, they made a fort in the toilet paper section and tried to get some sleep. But Perry said the highlight for him was some alone time in the Walmart bathroom. "At one point I just went in there and sat down on the toilet for like an hour. It was the only place that was quiet and away from the lights," he said. "It was probably the best time I had." At the end of their adventure, the only Walmart staff member they told about their two-day stay was the greeter working when they left. The man at the front door didn't really react to the news as he shook Perry's hand. Instead, the greeter began singing the folk song Man of Constant Sorrow, made popular to younger generations because of the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. Perry joined him, making the performance a duet. Perry said most people who see the clip still can't wrap their minds around the idea of spending that much time in a Walmart, and he says he doesn't plan on stepping foot inside one of the stores again in a very long time. But in the end, Perry, a former star running back at Southport High, said it was all about bringing a few laughs to whoever sees it. They plan to move to Los Angeles when school is over to continue writing, performing and sharing comedy with the world. "I actually just stopped with football because this is my passion," he said. "Making people laugh is something we both love to do. It just takes people away from their problems." Follow Justin L.

That launch comes nearly a year after Walmart and JD.com, China’s biggest online retail service provider by revenue, formed a strategic alliance and more than a month since Walmart’s British supermarket chain Asda opened a store on the same platform. “Walmart is committed to providing the most trusted retail experience to consumers in China,” Ben Hassing, the senior vice-president of e-commerce at Walmart China, said in a joint announcement on Thursday. The New York-listed company, which has 433 total bricks-and-mortar retail sites on the mainland as of October last year, said it examined the shopping habits of Chinese customers and then handpicked more than 1,700 of the most-purchased items to offer on Walmart’s flagship online store. It assured mainland customers they would be buying only authentic, quality goods – with categories including food, consumables, general merchandise, toys and apparel – since all items are sourced through the same supply chain system that Walmart China’s network of stores use. “We have seen a tremendous response from customers on the JD Daojia platform and expect to see similar enthusiasm from customers on JD.com,” Hassing said. Walmart made a US$50 million investment last October in New Dada, the joint venture between JD.com and delivery specialist Dada that operates the mainland’s largest on-demand logistics and online-to-offline grocery platform. That investment was an extension of Walmart’s broader agreement with JD.com and cooperation with New Dada, which includes using New Dada’s network to offer customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Walmart stores through the JD Daojia Dada mobile app. Customers in many first- and second-tier cities on the mainland who order before 11am will receive their packages the same day, delivered by JD.com employees to their door, according to Walmart. It said more customers outside of those cities will be able to enjoy same-day delivery service in future, in line with JD.com’s same- and next-day delivery network that covers more than 600 million of the country’s population. By the end of March, New Dada had partnered with 80 Walmart stores and 165 Yonghui Superstores to provide consumers with one-hour home delivery of groceries ordered through the JD Daojia Dada app. JD.com invested 4.3 billion yuan (US$624 million) to acquire a 10 per cent stake in Fuzhou-based Yonghui in 2015. “We hope to further surpass customer expectations by leveraging both companies’ highly effective and excellent supply chain systems in future,” said Carol Fung, the president of JD.com’s fast moving consumer goods business. JD.com had 236.5 million active customer accounts at the end March. Orders placed through mobile accounted for 81 per cent of the total orders fulfilled by the company in the first quarter. The deeper alliance between Walmart and JD.com could help bolster e-commerce spending on the mainland, already the world’s largest online retail market. The average online shopper in the country is forecast to spend 12,198 yuan online this year, a 7 per cent increase over last year, according to iResearch. JD.com posted total revenue of US$28 billion last year, compared with rival Alibaba Group’s turnover of US$22.9 billion in the 12 months ended March 31. New York-listed Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. Mainland China is forecast to become the first market to reach US$1 trillion in total online retail sales by 2020, driven by a rise in mobile e-commerce transactions, according to Forrester Research.

Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

The bill has been heavily opposed by Publix and local liquor stores. Emily Michot Miami Herald File Photo State Politics May 23, 2017 5:42 PM Gov. Rick Scott’s family history of alcohol abuse could decide ‘liquor wall” bill BY STEVE BOUSQUET Herald/Times Tallahassee Bureau LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE Gov. Rick Scott must decide Wednesday whether to let Walmart and other big-box stores sell liquor, and he says a factor in his decision is the history of alcohol abuse in his family. Scott has the last word on one of the session’s most heavily-lobbied issues — one that divided powerful special interests. The bill on his desk would repeal a decades-old law that prohibits groceries from selling vodka, gin and other spirits, even though they can sell beer and wine. It’s rare for Scott to offer clues as to how he will act on a bill. But he told reporters Tuesday that this issue has personal significance. “I’ve had family members who have dealt with the challenge of alcoholism,” Scott said. “It concerns me, and so as I review the bill, I take all those issues into consideration.” Scott has a brother in Texas who has coped with alcohol and drug abuse. The governor’s late mother, Esther, said in his first campaign in 2010 that Scott’s birth father was an abusive alcoholic who abandoned the family when Scott was an infant. The bill (SB 106), sponsored by Republican Sen. Anitere Flores of Miami, passed the Senate, 21-17, and in a moment of high drama, it squeaked through the House on a vote of 58 to 57. One House member switched his vote from yes to no right after the electronic roll call vote. Had he done so sooner the bill would have died, but by then, it was too late. Now Scott must sign or veto the bill. He also could allow it to become law without his signature, but a governor rarely uses that option on such a controversial and high-profile issue. Walmart would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the bill, but supporters say other chains that would also sell liquor include Target, Costco, Whole Foods, Sam’s Club and Walgreens. Scott scheduled separate phone calls Tuesday with a key bill supporter, Walmart USA’s chief executive Greg Foran, and an opponent, Charles Bailes III, chief executive of the Florida-based ABC Fine Wine & Spirits chain. Scott’s office had received more than 3,000 emails and phone calls on the issue through Tuesday, with opponents leading supporters by nearly a 7-1 margin. “I do not believe that Florida needs to increase access to alcohol by allowing spirits to be sold on grocery store shelves,” Dr. Gary Cox, pastor of Grace Presbyterian Church in Madison in North Florida, wrote to Scott. “Consumers are not asking for this legislation. Large corporations are.” Taking the other side, Audrey Jackson of Melbourne wrote: “As a consumer, I want to buy spirits and groceries in the same place. We all want a convenient shopping experience.” Supporters of tearing down the so-called “liquor wall” have emphasized Scott’s own core philosophy of Florida being a welcoming state for business by reducing burdensome regulations on businesses. Opponents argue that removing the liquor wall would eliminate jobs by hurting local chain liquor stores and would make it easier for minors to illegally buy alcohol or steal it. Spearheading the opposition is Publix, a powerful force in state politics for decades. The grocery giant has spent millions building free-standing liquor stores near, but separate, from its food stores. The bill would phase in the repeal over four years to give the grocery giant time to end leases on some liquor stores. Supporters counter that local liquor stores such as the ABC chain offer door-to-door delivery of liquor in many Florida cities. According to the Florida House website, 125 lobbyists registered to lobby for or against the bill this session, representing Walt Disney World, breweries, restaurants, hotels, chain liquor stores and major big-box retailers. As Scott ponders whether to sign or veto the bill, he has powerful friends and enemies on opposite sides. A Scott ally, Senate Appropriations Chairman Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, favors keeping the wall in place. House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, who was Scott’s biggest nemesis all session long on funding tourism and jobs programs, supports repeal of the wall and voted for it. The issue was not a legislative priority for him, but the speaker’s brother, Michael, has been a lobbyist for Walmart for a number of years in Tallahassee.

"About 35 minutes in because I was already getting sick of it," Perry said with a laugh. "I started really listening to the music and realized that it's just non-stop. And then the lighting and everything. ... I was starting to lose my mind. After a little bit you get into this state where you just feel out of it." But still, the two Southport High School graduates and Indianapolis natives soldiered on. And they did so in the name of YouTube comedy. Together, Perry, an IU junior studying liberal studies, and Maxwell, a senior studying media, produce The Christian and Noah Show on YouTube. Related: Photo: Deer wrangled in Minnesota Walmart Truck crashes into Iowa Wal-Mart, three dead They upload shows on Mondays and Thursdays, and in their two months of posting clips online, the pair has attracted 333 subscribers. Previous videos include clips like "Two Dumb Millennials Catch a Giant Fish," "Don't Ever Rob a Canadian" and "Visit to Abandoned Warehouse Goes Wrong." So far, their visit to Walmart is their biggest hit to date, bringing in more than 6,100 views in five days. It's also a spiritual sequel of a video Maxwell uploaded in May 2016 when he spent 24 hours in Walmart by himself. That 13-minute clip has generated more than 370,000 views. As far as why they decided to give it a go, Perry said it was a combination of curiosity and frustration with others who take the challenge. "You'll see other challenges and stuff, and some people have done it with the 24 hours, but they don't show proof with like a timer or anything ... we decided on 48 hours and to make it legit," he said. "I would say it was a blast, but it really wasn't." From there, they did what they could to make their time inside Walmart enjoyable. They played every game in the electronics section and arcade. They read books and product labels. They listened to podcasts and attracted dirty looks from security. "We quickly realized if we buy stuff like every three hours, they can't really say anything to us because we're customers. So we spent a lot of money in there," Perry said. "I bought a bunch of gum and Noah kept buying food. ... We ate at the Subway in the store. We even got haircuts at the salon." For rest, they made a fort in the toilet paper section and tried to get some sleep. But Perry said the highlight for him was some alone time in the Walmart bathroom. "At one point I just went in there and sat down on the toilet for like an hour. It was the only place that was quiet and away from the lights," he said. "It was probably the best time I had." At the end of their adventure, the only Walmart staff member they told about their two-day stay was the greeter working when they left. The man at the front door didn't really react to the news as he shook Perry's hand. Instead, the greeter began singing the folk song Man of Constant Sorrow, made popular to younger generations because of the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. Perry joined him, making the performance a duet. Perry said most people who see the clip still can't wrap their minds around the idea of spending that much time in a Walmart, and he says he doesn't plan on stepping foot inside one of the stores again in a very long time. But in the end, Perry, a former star running back at Southport High, said it was all about bringing a few laughs to whoever sees it. They plan to move to Los Angeles when school is over to continue writing, performing and sharing comedy with the world. "I actually just stopped with football because this is my passion," he said. "Making people laugh is something we both love to do. It just takes people away from their problems." Follow Justin L.

(Photo: Robert F. Bukaty / AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE New York — A proposal to curtail the nation’s food stamp program would pinch families struggling to pay for groceries and ripple through other areas of the economy, including supermarkets and discounters, as people shuffle their budgets. President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. Here’s a look at what we know. WHO USES SNAP, AND WHERE ARE THEY SHOPPING? SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. WHAT HAPPENED WITH PREVIOUS SNAP CUTS? It’s complicated. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. But how companies are affected can vary and it’s difficult to pinpoint the impact of any one change on sales, which can be affected by weather, competitive pressure and other factors. After the 2013 rollback in benefits, Wal-Mart blamed a 0.4 percent quarterly sales decline on the reduction, though the sales figure was down for the company’s entire fiscal year. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. Dollar General, which has said it gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits, compared the impact of the reduction last year to what happened in 2013. “Our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar to as it did now,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said last summer. WHAT CHANGES FOR RETAILERS? Trump’s proposal suggests that retailers pay a fee for authorization to accept food stamps. Companies currently don’t pay to participate, which the proposal says fails to recognize “the significant portion of a retailer’s revenue that SNAP can represent.” The proposed budget estimates the fees would raise about $2.4 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t spell out how the fee would be calculated. Imposing a fee could result in smaller stores or chains deciding not to seek authorization, said Craig Gundersen, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois who has received grants from the agency that administers the food stamp program. That would reduce the number of places where people who use SNAP could get groceries. The National Grocers Association said the fee proposal “raised a red flag.” It otherwise declined to comment on how its members might be affected by the proposed changes, but said the SNAP program plays “an important role in providing a safety net to those in need.” HOW DO SNAP CUTS AFFECT THE LARGER ECONOMY? The government’s overall SNAP spending declines when the economy improves and fewer people rely on the program. It’s a situation that is the “best possible outcome,” said Stacy Dean, vice president of food assistance policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dean said cutting benefits when people’s financial situations are not improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their food budget. So there’s still an impact to the overall economy, she said. Putting off other purchases could affect other departments at superstores or separate retailers. A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion. Trump’s proposal could have more significant effects than the rollbacks in 2013 and last year, said Gundersen. He said shifting costs partially to states would be unprecedented and likely lead to cutbacks. That’s because states may decide they can’t afford to fund benefits during tough economic times, or cut benefits for other reasons. Maine Gov. Paul LePage has asked to ban the purchase of candy and soda with food stamps. LePage has expressed optimism that his push could gain traction under Trump’s administration. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was apparently shopping at the Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart on Monday when the racist incident took place and was caught on video. Her target was initially another shopper, who happened to be Hispanic. However, as the viral video demonstrated, she quickly got vulgar and abusive with an African-American customer and a store manager who tried to defuse the situation. The video of the racist encounter was shared to Facebook on Monday evening, and in it, the woman who Walmart now plans to ban can be heard telling Eva Hicks, a mom of three, to “go back to Mexico.” When an unidentified African-American woman refers to her behavior as “ignorant,” the soon-to-be banned shopper can be seen and heard on video responding, “a n***er’s calling me ignorant?” According to Hicks, the entire altercation began when she politely said “excuse me” and asked the woman to move so that she could reach some medicine on the shelf behind her. After video of the racist Walmart incident went viral, the retail chain responded by saying that their manager did the right thing by asking the irate woman to leave the store. However, as CNN reports, hundreds of people took to social media to say that they believed the woman deserved a harsher punishment for her racist Walmart tirade. Walmart took to social media to assure those angry about Eva Hicks’ treatment, including Shaun King (who demanded that she be banned for life), that the behavior of the woman in the viral video “cannot be tolerated.” Through @WalmartNewsroom, a Walmart spokesperson also vowed that the retail giant was “continuing to look into the matter.” @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter. Below is our official statement: pic.twitter.com/BkKKVDrjE6 — Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) May 23, 2017 On Wednesday afternoon, media outlets began to report that they will be asking the unidentified woman to no longer shop at any of its stores as a result of her racist attack caught on tape. According to Eva Hicks, the primary victim of the woman’s allegedly unprovoked verbal abuse, the woman became aggressive as soon as Hicks politely asked her to move. As the woman’s torrent of hate continued in the Walmart medicine aisle, Hicks decided to take out her phone and start recording the unbelievable incident. “She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me. I am an American citizen, I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here, I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up.” Walmart shopper tells woman to 'go back to Mexico' in incredibly racist rant.https://t.co/5mahfb7Qtu pic.twitter.com/kJOqutgaDA — someecards (@someecards) May 23, 2017 In the video, the woman can be heard telling Hicks to “go back to Mexico,” that “we” don’t want her here, and that the United States is not her country. Hicks says that while she was born in Mexico City, she has lived in the U.S. for over three decades and is a U.S. citizen. What’s more, she says that in more than 30 years, she has never been subjected to the kind of racist treatment she endured while shopping at Walmart on Monday. @DailyMail It's Trump Land.

She claims that she has seen an increase in people reporting this kind of public racism over the last few months, and she believes that she knows why the unidentified woman felt empowered and emboldened to unleash a racist tirade in the middle of an Arkansas Walmart — namely, a new presidential administration. “I have seen a lot of these incidents lately, I believe ever since the Trump administration came into power, he can say hateful things to other races and other countries, these people think it’s okay for them to do the same.” Racist woman launches tirades against Mexican and black shoppers https://t.co/O9195e0oiE — Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) May 23, 2017 A spokesperson for Walmart claims that the woman in the racist viral video has yet to be identified, but that Walmart is working to figure out who she is. The spokesperson added, “once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores.” What do you think about the way this incident was handled? Did Walmart make the right decision by choosing to ban the woman behind the racist verbal assault, or is a lifetime ban too extreme? Let us know in the comments section below.

Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

(Image Source: Twitter Video screenshot) 239 Follow Share Tweet A viral video showing a white woman using racist epithets against a Hispanic woman and a black woman at a Wal-Mart will result in a lifetime ban from the retail store giant. The incident happened at the Bentonville, Arkansas, Wal-Mart. The video begins in the middle of the altercation as the Hispanic woman says that she was just saying, “excuse me,” when the woman tells her “go back to Mexico.” Another shopper intervenes, and the white woman tells her, “A n****r’s calling me ignorant?” After that she tells the Hispanic woman, “We don’t want you here.” The video was posted by the Hispanic woman on her Facebook page, and garnered over 18 million views. “I never in my life thought this would happen to me. Yes me. Just on a simple trip to the grocery store after a hard day of work. I love this country and I will stay in this country. Friends please share,” she wrote. A store manager asked the white woman to leave while allowing the Hispanic woman to stay shopping. Initially, Wal-Mart released a statement simply decrying the altercation. “We value and respect everyone who visits our stores,” the statement read. “We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” But since then Wal-Mart has also told NBC news that it will ban the woman who hurled the racist slurs for life as soon as she is identified.

Eva Hicks posted the video, which was shot in a Centerton Walmart, on Monday night (May 22). Hicks said she asked the woman to move so she could reach something in the medical aisle. The video starts with the woman telling Hicks to "go back to Mexico." When Hicks defends her right to be in the store, the woman says a variety of statements saying that she is not welcome in America. When a third shopper steps up to defend Hicks, the woman responded by saying, "A n***** is calling me ignorant?" A Walmart manager overheard the interaction, and quickly stepped in. He reassured Hicks that she is welcome -- and wanted -- both in the store and in the country. The manager told the woman that her comments were inappropriate and that she needed to leave the store. Walmart released a statement saying they do not tolerate the woman's comments: "We value respect for everyone who visits our stores, whether they’re customers or associates. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store." Walmart said they will be reaching out to Hicks.

Follow @rawstory Twenty-three-year-old beauty queen Carmen Ponder was arrested and charged with evading arrest this weekend after avoiding a swerving truck on a road. The truck, however, was being driven by Hunt County Police Chief Kerry Crews. According to the Dallas Morning News, Ponder said that she was driving to a Walmart when she was cut off by a black truck driving erratically. She explained that the truck was driving in and out of lanes and made several sudden stops. She feared it was a drunk driver and drove around the truck before turning into the store’s parking lot. She said that the truck then pulled in beside her, Crews got out and began screaming profanities at her. He told her that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter how to drive and that Ponder should not have driven around their truck. Ponder informed him that it was illegal for a 14-year-old to be driving and turned to walk into Walmart. According to Ponder, Crew then shouted back at her, “Oh, whatever, you black b*tch!” As she walked out of the store an officer in plain clothes approached her with his badge and began yelling at her. He said that she upset the police chief and should apologize. Ponder declined and continued walking to her car. She said that the officer then grabbed her arm and told her she was being detained. Other officers then arrived in plain clothes and claimed she was evading arrest. She was then handcuffed, taken into custody and held for 24 hours before being charged with evading arrest. Charges were ultimately dropped but Ponder’s attorney said that they are requesting the chief be fired and assault charges be filed against the officer who grabbed and bruised her. @MeritLaw pic.twitter.com/LeHyS9JwHM — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 Crews disputes Ponder’s account, saying that it was she that approached him and that she “failed to comply with [Crews’] requests.” As a result, she was arrested for “evading arrest or detention.” NEW: Press release just issued by City of Commerce disputes Carmen Ponder's account of racially-charged exchange w/ police chief. @NBCDFW pic.twitter.com/hs6D2v75K3 — Meredith Yeomans (@YeomansNBC5) May 25, 2017 Report typos and corrections to [email protected] About the Author Next on Raw Story > Trump says the IRS regulates churches too much — here’s why he’s wrong By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Starting with just a spinning mill in 1954, Kamal Limited today represents a vertically integrated textile conglomerate with $150 million in exports annually.  Recently, the company entered the world of retail with its brand ?So Kamal.? BR Research sat down with Ahmed Kamal to discuss the brand, the future of the company, and the ongoing issues in the textile industry. Below are edited transcripts of the interview. Business Recorder Research: Tell us a little bit about your company and its history. Ahmed Kamal: I' m a third-generation businessman. My grandfather started this company. He came back from Calcutta after independence and put up a factory in Faisalabad that was one of the first few factories that started in Pakistan. Then, we diverted towards the chemical side, but we came back to textile as we believed that textile is the basic industry of Pakistan and it had opportunity to grow because of cotton availability. So, the family concentrated towards the textile sector. In our group, we have all the operations - spinning, weaving, printing, processing, home textile, garment manufacturing, socks manufacturing, and now retail. BRR: How many employees do you hire? AK: Around 12,000 BRR: What is the total volume of your exports? Which markets do you export to? AK: Kamal Limited is 95 percent export-oriented. As a group, we do around $150 million. Our growth is more than 10 percent every year. We are everywhere in the world ? US, Europe, South America. BRR: Which is the lion?s share? AK: Home textile - about $100 million. BRR: How did your business benefit from GSP Plus? AK: GSP Plus has played a very key role and our business has grown 30-40 percent in Europe since then. It was a big advantage for Pakistan ? Bangladesh already enjoyed GSP Plus facility before, but now with this facility given to Pakistan I see a big opportunity in garments. In home textile, we always had an edge on Bangladesh and India, but when we talk about the progress in exports in Bangladesh it is all based on garments. Garment is a segment that fetches more value-addition than home textiles. The key to their success was GSP Plus; that facility gave them the opportunity to grow their business to a level where buyers got interested in that country. And when the buyers got interested in that country, you?ll be amazed to know that today, directly and indirectly, there are more than 200 brands sitting in Bangladesh. If you talk about Pakistan, there are maybe 10 brands with their buying offices here. In value-addition, our exports are $6 billion whereas out of Bangladesh?s $32 billion textile exports, $28 billion is garments. It is the customer that wants to come to the factory, wants to see the production in front of them, improve the techniques, learn what new products they can get from the factory, etc. If there is a free flow and the customer can come with security and peace to your manufacturing facility, it can really facilitate the growth of your business. I talked to the Commerce Minister. I told him that instead of these expos and bringing in small retailers or unrelated ?delegates? to just fill up the slots, what we should do is make a proper strategy and target customers. As a Commerce Ministry, they should target ten big brands of garment, home textile, and knitted garments; we should approach them, visit them, give them the facility that they should come and open their offices here. I have been telling the Commerce Ministry that if you can have a diplomatic enclave, why can?t you have a buyer?s enclave? They should be treated like a VIP. If those brands come and have a presence in Pakistan, it will really boost our exports. For example, we were supplying to Sainsbury?s. One day, Sainsbury?s called my team from UK and said they will not be able to buy from us anymore. They told us that although we had the highest marks in this category and were one of the best performers, their board has decided that we are not going to source our goods from a country where we cannot travel. BRR: How do you differentiate our commercial counselors/commercial attach‚s to counterparts in India and Bangladesh? AK: As far as their competence and commitment go, there is nothing wrong with them. They need the proper direction, tools, and resources to tap those accounts. Sometimes a commercial counselor doesn?t have that profile to go and meet the president of Sainsbury?s or Tesco or Disney or Wal-Mart. You might need your ambassador or commerce minister to go there; to invite them, call on them, and market as a country. The target for Commerce Ministry should be to bring 50 big brands to Pakistan. BRR: Do you think cost competitiveness is an issue in our declining exports? AK: Yes. In textile, the biggest cost after raw material is energy. You can have this energy produced by either gas, electricity, or burning. For example, in my processing area I have three kinds of energy resources: I need electricity to run my machines, steam to wash my cloth and heating for certain purposes. I make my electricity either from gas or I buy it from WAPDA. The industry pays 100 percent of what it consumes from WAPDA. Yet, the government is imposing Rs3.6 surcharge as theft surcharge. The cost of electricity is Rs10 plus Rs3.6 surcharge which other sectors are stealing. Why should I pay for somebody else?s theft? And when I will pay for that, I will put it in my cost. Why would Wal-Mart pay for that? How does that make me competitive? The government asked me to put up coal steam boilers because there was no gas. I already pay 30 percent of the cost to bring the coal from Karachi to here and then when the whole of Faisalabad put up coal plants to make steam, they put duty on it. In our factories, we have put up power plants three times. First, they asked us to put power plant on diesel, then they gave a policy that you should use furnace oil because they reduced the duty on it. Now they said gas will be available to you and then one fine morning, there was no gas for Punjab. BRR: Tell us about the issue of refunds. Are you cash-strapped? Is it hindering your business? AK: Of course. Today, 30-35 percent of our equity is stuck up in refunds, because for one year they have not paid us our sales tax. There is no tax on an exporter as a sales tax. We were a collecting agent. They did a very good thing that from July 2016 they made us zero-rated. Still, the packaging material that you buy will be subjected to sales tax, no refund. On a macro level, Pakistan is doing well and has seen industrial growth, but only those industries which are protected and pampered. You say power companies are doing really well. Why? You give them an upfront tariff of 17 percent. They are guaranteed a 17 percent return in dollar terms whether they produce or not. You say banking industry is doing really well. Where in the world is there a spread of six percent? Government is giving protection to banking, fertilizer, and automobile sectors. I am not against their protection. I am against the fact that on my sector, you are charging surcharge of theft done by others; you are making me a withholding agent and not paying my money back after one year. In China, it is refunded in seven days; my refunds are stuck up for 14 months. I don?t have customers coming here because of law and order situation. I have to travel; at this time, three of my teams are traveling in different parts of the world. One is in Spain, one in Primark in Dublin, and one is in the US for my garments. I am paying for all of this. BRR: Have you gone through any expansion in your textile business? AK: Yes, we have just put up one more weaving unit using the facility of Long-term financing. That?s for our exports. BRR: Is your spinning unit catering exclusively to your own use or are you giving it to the market as well? AK: We mostly use it within the company. We buy a lot of yarn also as our spinning capacity is much less than our consumption. BRR: Tell us about the company?s growth. What were your exports five years ago and what will your exports be five years down the line? AK: Five years ago, exports were half of what they are today. We doubled in five years and if things are right, we can double it again! We have the capacities available. We need the resources; we need only our money should be paid back to us and the incentives that the government announced should be given. BRR: How much of your installed capacity is being deployed? AK: We are 20 percent under-utilized. BRR: You have room to develop it by 20 percent, but you plan to double exports. Are you planning for that expansion? AK: I am not planning anything per se, because I am not seeing a good opportunity for textile. I have been advised not to invest in textile anymore and divert to other areas. BRR: Do you think that in CPEC, the Chinese would go back to the value-added industry within China after importing from here? AK: It?s a very simple calculation. The freight for bringing in a 20-feet container from China is $2500-3000. If you want to send a 20-feet container back to China, it?s $30. That shows how many goods are coming from China. When you are bringing in the container from China, they are charging you the freight for coming and taking the empty container back. That is your parity with China. What you are going to sell to China? You think that your productivity and labour cost is less? I have in my small factory 32 security guards. In China, a factory 100 times bigger than mine doesn?t have one security guard. Business is done on competitiveness. Customers come to you when you are competitive. BRR: When did you come into the retail business? Your brand is So Kamal. What do you make? AK: Three years ago. We are concentrated mostly on lawn for women, stitched and unstitched. We have 25 stores ? we are present exclusively in Punjab. BRR: How much of your revenues from retail are in proportion to your exports? AK: Just three to four percent. BRR: Where do you see that in the future? AK: Depends on government policies! No retailer is making money right now. No one is expanding. Retail business is suffering because of the smuggled goods; just go to any local market and see how much fabric is from here and how much is from China. It?s a musical chair ? the brands are coming up, and non-branded goods are going down. Before, there were non-branded sales. Now, the manufacturers are selling directly themselves because they are coming into retail, so you are seeing the brands: Sitara, Five Star, Gul Ahmed. BRR: How many stores do you see by 2020? AK: The growth in the business always comes with profit. If there is going to be profit, I?ll grow. We have 25 stores but now we are stagnant for the last six months. With CPEC and new developments, we are very cautious. We don?t know what is going to happen to the market. This country is becoming a trade, retail, import-oriented country. At the moment, my retail is based on my own manufacturing. Many tiles manufacturers here, they have built their brand, but now they?ve closed down manufacturing and are bringing in tiles from China and selling under their own brand. Many shoe manufacturers are doing this as well; they were manufacturing here, but now they?re just importing from China. If my manufacturing will stay competitive, my retail business will be increasing. If my manufacturing business will not stay competitive, my retail business cannot increase. This is the strategy for my business; I am not an importer and retailing it over here. I don?t bring anything to my retail shops which I don?t manufacture myself. BRR: Do you think the current policies are business-friendly? AK: Policies are very good, they are not implemented. They are business-friendly in the books. I don?t know who is responsible for non-implementation. When I meet the government officials, they look very positive. BRR: Is sticky currency having an impact on your exports? AK: When there is an ego involved, it is bad for business. Currencies in the world are rated with the market forces. Either you are a free economy or you are regulated. My father told me once that if you lie three or four times, you start believing it?s the truth. When the Euro came down from $1.40 to $1.10, the whole world depreciated their currencies. Why did we not? With one rupee, with $70 billion of borrowing, you get a deficit of $700 million! If you do not devalue, you have to give some sort of support to your exports. One percent of devaluation is equal to five percent of rebate ? $700 million. They have realised it after four years, they have given the policy of DLTL, but let?s see if they implement it. BRR: So Kamal is not into home textile retail. Why? AK: We have it but it?s not our bread and butter. It is not a trend in Pakistani retail generally speaking ? Gul Ahmed, Al-Karam, they are also home textile retailers, but the percentage of home textile in their retail is very low. BRR: What is the rent-to-sale ratio in order to be viable? AK: It should be 1:10. Rent should be two to three days of your sale. Rents have gone very high. I have seen 1:5 and 1:6, and I don?t think those brands would be doing too well. BRR: How much of your retail is online? AK: It?s increasing. It's about ten percent. BRR: Twenty years from now, how do you see your retail growing? Currently you said it?s 3-4 percent of your revenues. AK: Retail will be 10-15 percent. BRR: What are your margins like? AK: The margin in textile is usually 3-5 percent. BRR: What about on your exports? AK: It's the same - 3-5 percent. It's the turnover that matters. Just look at any brand: look at Zara, look at target.

Paul Sakuma AP Politics & Government May 23, 2017 11:18 AM Target CEO tells Congress that GOP’s proposed import tax would hurt his customers By Alex Daugherty adaugherty@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON A proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as a way to overhaul the nation’s tax system received a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and reception to the plan by business leaders and House Republicans was mixed. The tax on imports, dubbed the border adjustment tax, has divided Republicans. Proponents argue the tax would help American manufacturers while raising $1 trillion over 10 years, and opponents say the plan would result in higher prices for consumers and cause businesses to lay off workers. Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have said the border adjustment plan doesn’t have a chance of passing the Senate, while the White House has remained relatively silent over the proposal in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the CEO of Target testified against the idea to the House tax-writing committee, as many large retailers are leery of a tax on the thousands of products they import from foreign markets. “Under the new border adjustment tax, American families – your constituents – would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell. “Eighty-five percent of Americans shop at Target every year. We believe this new tax would hit those families hard, raising prices on everyday essentials by up to 20 percent.” But the former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart was cautiously optimistic. “I have weighed the considerable challenges this proposal presents to retail with the significant benefits it will deliver to the economy as a whole and have concluded that properly implemented, it is in the best interest of our country for this to be considered,” William Simon said. Simon retired in 2014, and Wal-Mart is opposed to the border adjustment plan. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:08 USM survives CUSA elimination game against Louisiana Tech Pause 1:16 Four killed in Jackson County wreck 0:30 Home security video captures theft of golf clubs 0:37 Matt McDonnell tells the Lions Club his plans for life after politics 3:41 His hospital staff rushed to fulfill his final wish: to marry his fiancé 0:54 Tips on how to stay fit after retirement 1:13 New Gulfport casino will be smoke-free 1:02 His Pepsi truck got stuck.

White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said the plan is “the most significant tax reform legislations since 1986.” C-SPAN A few Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voiced reservations to the tax Tuesday. Minnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen, who represents a competitive district and did not vote for President Donald Trump, said he was opposed to the border adjustment tax. “This has to be done in a very thoughtful way, a way that addresses the very real and valid concerns,” Paulsen said. “I cannot support the border adjustability provisions as introduced last year in the blueprint. I really want to urge this committee to listen, to be educated and to address these concerns that we heard.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Other Republicans on the committee, including Reps. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania and Jim Renacci of Ohio, pushed Cornell and Simon over the implications of the tax for consumers. “I’ve been skeptical of the border adjustment as a central element of the blueprint, but I’m trying not to be,” Renacci said. “Does border adjustment pick winners and losers? Who will the tax burden ultimately shift to, and is it compliant with our international treaty obligations?” It is unclear at this point whether the World Trade Organization would take punitive action against the United States for implementing the tax. Tuesday’s hearing brought a change in messaging from Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who said the proposed border adjustment tax would end what he and others call a “made in America tax” for domestic manufacturers. There isn’t any such tax – American manufacturers are, like all exporters, taxed on their exported goods by foreign governments – but it’s an argument the House Republican leadership hopes will convince the president and his supporters that border adjustment would help middle- and working-class Americans. “In the tax reform blueprint we propose to end the ‘made in America’ tax and instead tax all products and services equally when they are sold in America at a low rate of 20 percent,” Brady said. “And we lift the tax on ‘made in America’ products and services when they are sold abroad — for the first time leveling the playing field for American workers, businesses and farmers.” Democrats are generally against the border adjustment tax and say Ryan and Brady’s plan doesn’t help middle- and working-class employees enough. “There are many unknowns about the border adjustment tax,” said Ways and Means ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass. “What would the BAT’s impact be on American jobs? Who will be the winners and losers as a result of the BAT?” The tax overhaul plan supported by Ryan and Brady also reduces corporate taxes to a flat rate of 20 percent, establishes three personal income-tax brackets instead of the current seven and eliminates many deductions. The nation’s tax system has not been overhauled since Ronald Reagan’s administration. Brady said he wanted to pass a tax overhaul plan by the end of the year. Alex Daugherty: 202-383-6049, @alextdaugherty House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, is in favor of imposing a 20 percent tax on imports as part of a tax overhaul plan that reduces the corporate and personal income tax rates. Other Republicans oppose the plan.

CDT May 25, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST COMMERCE, Texas -- Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews was placed on administrative leave Thursday amid a growing investigation surrounding the arrest of a Texas A&M-Commerce student over the weekend. Carmen Ponder, 23, told WFAA on Wednesday she was arrested for evading arrest, she says for failing to apologize to the chief after a heated verbal exchange. "I just want it to not happen to anyone else," Ponder said. What exactly happened remained disputed by the city of Commerce and Crews on Thursday. Ponder says it started when she was driving to Wal-Mart in Commerce on May 20 and noticed the black truck in front of her driving slowly and erratically. “I thought it was a drunk driver, so I went around them and then proceeded to turn into Walmart," Ponder told WFAA. She says the driver then followed her to her parking spot and began verbally berating her for cutting in front of him and his 14-year old daughter, who he was teaching how to drive, according to Ponder. "I ignored him," Ponder said. "I kept my window up. I looked at him to let it be known that I hear him, but I just got my keys from my car and kept walking into Wal-Mart.”  She says the man continued to ask her to apologize. "I turned and I'm like 'It's illegal to have a 14-year old driving,'" Ponder recalled. "And that was when he said, 'Whatever you black (expletive).'" Ponder said she didn't respond and continued into the store. She says what happened as she walked out landed her in jail, though she still has no idea why. Ponder, who plans to graduate in December, says she saw two adult males and adult female approached her. "One of them showed me a badge and said, 'This here is my chief and what he says goes, and you’re going to apologize to him,'" Ponder said. "And I told him I was not going to apologize to him, I was going to continue walking to my car and I was going to go home.” Ponder did not go home. The paralegal studies major spent 24 hours in the Hunt County jail before being released Sunday afternoon on a $1000 bond. Ponder says after she viewed photos of Crews online, she concluded he was the same person who engaged her in the verbal exchange and made the racially insensitive remark. Commerce Police have not released the police report or arrest affidavit for Ponder, citing the on-going investigation. On Thursday, the City of Commerce said Crews was not involved in the initial altercation between two parties, but was at Wal-Mart as a customer. "Chief Crews became engaged in the incident after being approached by one of the parties," the city said in a statement. "Chief Crews made contact with the other party, but she failed to comply with his requests. As a result, she was arrested for evading arrest or detention when the responding officer arrived." Crews was placed on leave pending the results of the investigation. Attorney Lee Merritt represents Ponder and told WFAA that he is demanding the resignation of Crews and the filing of criminal charges against him and the attending officers for assault, wrongful arrest and official corruption. When asked on Thursday if his client still believed the man who yelled at her prior to entering Wal-Mart was the police chief, Merritt responded she "doesn't know." The embattled chief said he can not grant interviews right now, but told WFAA on Thursday he did not say anything inappropriate to Ponder. "I don't even have a 14-year old daughter," he said. The Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas represents officers, including Crews. Charley Wilkison with CLEAT said the narrative being spread online in the first 24 hours was not accurate. "Social media is the gossip over the fence in 2017," Wilkison said. "We think in every way that his reputation will be returned as much as possible. Everything that's been said about him and his character, his professionalism, is a lie." Wilkison said the investigation will reveal Crews conducted himself appropriately. "The fact is he gave her a lawful order. She didn’t comply and the only other thing that could happen is that person would be taken into custody.” Jasmine Crockett is representing Ponder for the misdemeanor charge and voiced concern about available visual evidence to corroborate either account definitively. “We won’t have bodycam footage. We won’t have dashcam footage. We won’t have anything except their word against hers,” Crockett said. There are cameras inside and outside the Wal-Mart location that investigators will examine. Two sources close to the investigation that spoke to WFAA on condition of anonymity said more than one officer on scene was wearing a body camera and at least one cell phone video from a bystander may add more perspective on what happened. Also on Thursday, a group of a dozen or so community members who called themselves "Concerned Citizens of Commerce" asked the public for "patience and calmness as pieces of this unfortunate incident are connected." "As the days and weeks move forward, we believe that this matter can best be resolved with local citizens' input and oversight rather than outside forces interfering with investigators," the statement read. Late Thursday, city council emerged from executive session after a special called meeting. The council unanimously approved the hiring of Lynn, Ross & Gannaway, a private Fort Worth-based firm to conduct the internal affairs investigation into the arrest. City manager Darrek Ferrell told WFAA the city turned to a private company after the Texas Rangers declined, citing the lack of a criminal investigation. © 2017 WFAA-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Video shows child stealing packages from homes 1 killed, 1 wounded in shootout at gas station parking lot Raw: Police chase leads to suspect search in N.

By Hayley Miller Commerce PD/Twitter Miss Black Texas 2016 is calling for a North Texas police chief to be removed from his job after he allegedly called her a “black bitch” and unlawfully arrested her for passing his 14-year-old daughter on the road. Carmen Ponder, an intern at the Hunt County district attorney’s office and a recent graduate of Texas A&M University, tweeted Tuesday that she experienced “road rage” from Kerry Crews, the police chief in Commerce, Texas. Police brutality and Abuse of Power from a Police Chief. Let me talk to my lawyer and I'll fill y'all in #blacklivesmatter— Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 22, 2017 Ponder says she was on her way to a local Walmart when a black truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically. She says she decided to pass the vehicle to avoid a potentially dangerous situation because she believed the driver to be drunk. She had parked her car outside the Walmart before realizing the black truck had followed her, she says. Crews, who had not identified himself as a cop, apparently yelled at Ponder for passing his daughter, whom he had been teaching to drive at the time. “Whatever, you black bitch,” Crews allegedly told Ponder after she reminded him that it’s “illegal” for a 14-year-old to drive. It’s just a reminder that our skin color ... is seen as something hostile, dangerous and illegal. Lee Merritt, civil rights attorney Ponder says she walked away from the confrontation and made her way into the store. She alleges that Crews, his daughter and at least one other man were waiting for her when she returned. One of the men allegedly informed Ponder that Crews is a police chief and that she should apologize to him for being disrespectful. Ponder refused and began walking to her car, apparently prompting the man to grab her by the arm and tell her she was going to be detained. When more police arrived on the scene, Ponder approached them for help. But she claims the man who initially grabbed her told the officers that she was resisting arrest and instructed them to detain her. Ponder was handcuffed, put in the back of the a police car, and detained for roughly 24 hours. She was released but still faces a charge for evading arrest. Read Ponder’s description of the ordeal below. @MeritLaw pic.twitter.com/LeHyS9JwHM— Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 Crews did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. He told a local NBC affiliate that his attorneys had advised him not to speak. The Commerce Police Department declined to comment on the incident.  Ponder’s attorney is Lee Merritt, a civil rights lawyer. He told HuffPost that a Walmart employee heard Crews swear at Ponder and apologized on his behalf. Walmart referred HuffPost to the Commerce Police Department when asked for a comment.  Merritt said Ponder suffered bruising on her arms and is hesitant to leave her house because she’s afraid of being threatened by Crews’ supporters. “If this is how [Crews] behaves when he feels someone disrespected him ... how does he handle people who he suspects of committing real crimes?” Merritt said.  Ponder is calling for the charge against her to be dropped, for Crews to be fired and for the other involved officers to face disciplinary action. “It’s just a reminder that our skin color, speaking specifically about the African-American community, is seen as something hostile, dangerous and illegal,” Merritt said.  Merritt also represented Jacqueline Craig, the black mother from Forth Worth whose arrest went viral after being captured on a cellphone video. A white cop arrested Craig and her two daughters in December after they called the police to report a neighbor for attacking Craig’s 5-year-old son.

According to NBC DFW, Carmen Ponder says she was driving to Walmart on Saturday when a truck cut her off while driving erratically. She passed the truck and pulled into the Walmart parking lot. Ponder says the truck followed her and she was accosted by Commerce police chief Kerry Crews, who was in the passenger seat. Ponder says Crews was "yelling and cussing" at her that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter to drive and that Ponder shouldn't have passed them. She says Crews called her a "black bitch" when she informed him that letting his 14-year-old daughter drive was illegal. Ponder says when she left the store, she was confronted by plain clothes officers who demanded she apologize to Crews. She refused and was arrested. Ponder was later charged with evading arrest. In a Facebook post, Ponder's attorney says his client's only crime was "the color of her skin." The city has placed Crews on leave during an investigation into the incident, but it states Ponder's account conflicts with that of Crews and another officer. Crews says he wasn't involved in the initial argument between two motorists and only got involved when one of them approached him. The city doesn't say who the other motorist was. Ponder is a Dean's List student at Texas A&M and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   11% Hilarious 10% Intriguing 23% Depressing 8% Brilliant 22% Scary 26% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 166 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Bomber Said to Have Pleaded 'Forgive Me' Before UK Blast Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 166 comments George939 1 hour, 15 minutes ago Picked on the wrong person there, she has some pull and recognition. BTW who teaches their kid(s) to drive on the streets? I find large parking lots, long streets/alleys behind stores, yeah not really public streets still it's a long straight strip that leads from the loading docks on side or back into the larger parking lot. As it is, my daughter still crashed my car, lol then she blamed me cause I yelled at her to stop, hit the breaks, get off the gas pedal. Minor damages. IndependentGeorge 1 hour, 48 minutes ago Uh, it's a two-lane highway there, so she has every right to pass up a slow/erratic driver as long as she does so safely and legally. Perhaps she didn't pass safely and legally--maybe she cut them off when she got in front and suddenly slowed down to make a turn---and the cop was rightfully angry about putting his child's life in danger, but his response is not proportional at all. What occurred next seems like an abuse of power. GodSAveAmerica May 25, 2017 11:29 PM CDT So she claims she "passed" the truck? More likely a case of road rage and she "cut off" the truck.

Costco Is Thriving Because People Still Don’t Buy Their Toilet Paper Or Steak On Amazon Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Costco Is Thriving Because People Still Don’t Buy Their Toilet Paper Or Steak On Amazon Image courtesy of (joelgoodman) May 25, 2017 7:14 pm EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup exceptions to the apocalypse costco brick and mortar retail retail warehouse clubs richard galanti quarterly earnings As retailer after retailer closes up shop, and big box stores like Target and Walmart put increased focus on e-commerce, Costco continues to not only stay open, but to grow, despite having virtually no online retail presence. Why? Because people aren’t yet turning to Amazon to fill up their kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. The warehouse retailer announced its latest quarterly earnings today, and in a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti shared the news that comparable store sales for the last nine months are up 3%, and sales across the whole company are up 8% compared to the same period last year. Costco is beating the odds by offering things that. things that are impossible or annoying to order online. Most of what people go to the warehouse club for is food, and the top sellers in food are booze, deli items, and candy. While other physical stores (except Walmart) complain that foot traffic is down, Costco knows that its members are visiting 4% more often than they were last year. Gasoline is an important thing that brings customers back to the physical store, getting customers into the parking lot. While they’re there, they might as well walk around the store and see what special items are around that day. That’s another factor that Galanti cited: The “treasure hunt,” or finding special one-off items that won’t be there next week or even tomorrow. Sure, it’s exciting to grab a box of Kirkland Signature golf balls online, but people just love an in-person treasure hunt. Costco is very slowly expanding its online presence, running fulfillment out of 19 distribution centers. It comprises 3.5% of the company’s sales and increases modestly. Consumers overall have been resistant to grocery shopping online, wanting to pick out their own produce. Specific to Costco, in some markets, Instacart is catching on, partly because it makes Costco’s inventory available (at a markup) to non-members in 40 cities, with orders coming from 240 stores. What Costco doesn’t plan to do, Galanti emphasized a few times in response to analyst questions, is keep up with competitor Walmart (which also owns the warehouse chain Sam’s Club) by acquiring e-commerce companies and increasing its online sales in less than a year. You know, like how Walmart bought Jet. “We’re doing things offensively, not defensively, online,” he told listeners, mentioning e-commerce acquisitions directly or indirectly multiple times during the call. Instead of imitating competitors like Walmart, Costco plans to do its own thing and gradually offer more of its merchandise to online shoppers.

Fellow comic James “Jimmy Mack” McNair was killed; Morgan was hospitalized with broken bones and a brain injury. He was briefly in a coma. Almost two years later, Morgan made his return to the stage with his Picking Up the Pieces tour; an October appearance in Red Bank, New Jersey, not far from where the accident happened, was filmed for Netflix, which has been investing in high-profile stand-up specials by comics including Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Amy Schumer, Maria Bamford and Jim Gaffigan. Morgan’s premieres Tuesday for streaming, under the title “Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive.” The special begins with a filmed opening, with nods to “Saturday Night Fever,” as Morgan cruises Brooklyn with a Wal-Mart bag full of settlement money; he buys three slices of pizza instead of two, and he eats them piled one on top of another. A gag transports him into a John Travolta white suit and onto the stage of the theater, which is set with a table and armchair into which he occasionally collapses. One suspects this may be a matter of necessity, but mostly, he is on his feet and moving, encouragingly, and carrying an hour of material in his head. There is a shape to it; with a few video projections and lighting cues, you could call it a theater piece. Jokes and digressions are threaded on the story of his accident and recovery — in the coma, coming out of the coma, after the coma, on Earth and in heaven: “When I was in that coma, y’all, I saw that white light, but I didn’t go to it, because I thought it was police. I got warrants, man. You can’t get into heaven with priors.” Donna Summer’s “On the Radio” makes a motif. To be sure, the hour is rife with “F” words, “B” words, “P” words and other words I can’t write in this paper and would avoid even if I could. Morgan has provoked controversy for his jokes before, including editorial chastisement over remarks about homosexuality (for which he apologized). As with all comedy, mileage varies, from listener to listener, and for any given listener, from joke to joke; you don’t decide what to laugh at, after all, you just laugh, or you don’t. I laughed at times, winced at others. But Morgan stays mostly within bounds here; not everyone will like his impression of a joint-rolling Jesus, or his sexual meditations on Caitlyn Jenner, or his taste for breast milk (“and Splenda”). Apart from taking shots at members of his own family (“Because of my settlement, they think I’m supposed to pay for everybody’s funeral ... They think I’m supposed to put all their kids in college”), he stays largely positive. His recovery is not only physical, but also spiritual — a pitch for self-acceptance, self-improvement and maturity, relatively speaking. He argues for fidelity, restraint and age-appropriate dancing: “When you get to a certain age, this is dancing,” he says demonstrating. “Two-stepping, that’s all you got to do, just one move — stomach out, stomach in, stomach out, stomach in.” Morgan allows himself a smile now and again, but mostly, he is intent and intense — which is not to say angry. (“I forgave that driver,” he says of the man who hit him. “I’m not even mad at him,” and notes, “When I was in a wheelchair I still shopped at Wal-Mart — you still can’t beat their prices.”) If comedy concerts don’t always translate well to the screen — it’s an art best experienced in the room, surrounded by laughter — there are moments, between lines, when the camera does its work. Moving in close, it gives us a glimpse of the comic as human, even more intimate than his altogether unembarrassed prepared remarks. ‘Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive’ Grade: B Netflix 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

A video of a racist tirade at an Arkansas Walmart going viral. FOX’s Anna Eliopoulos reports: (Hicks) “Just because I have a different color skin and I have an accent, and my country of origin is not the U.S. does not mean that you’re better than me.”  Eva Hicks decided to go to her local Centerton Walmart Monday to purchase some items, when a woman was blocking the medicine that she needed. That’s when Hicks, who is of Mexican descent, told the white woman excuse me, prompting the woman to go on a racist rant, telling the woman to go back where she came from: “This is my country. We don’t want you here.”  An African-American woman came to help, but racial insults were also directed at her. Eventually, a manager asked the woman to leave. Walmart says they are working to ID the woman and ban her from all their stores. Anna Eliopoulos, FOX News. Thomas Byrne You May Be Interested In...

The company is attempting to identify the woman in order to ban her.   (Facebook) (Newser) – Walmart is attempting to identity the racist Arkansas customer seen in a viral video this week in order to ban her from shopping at its stores, BuzzFeed reports. The video was posted to Facebook on Monday by Eva Hicks, a mother of three. Hicks tells CNN she nicely asked the unidentified woman to move her cart so she could get medicine from the shelf, and the woman blew up at her. She started filming when the woman's comments turned racist. "Go back to Mexico," the woman says in the video. She goes on to tell Hicks, "We don't want you here" and that she's the the one being rude by being in America. Another woman steps in and tells the woman to stop being "ignorant." The unidentified woman responds: "A n---er's calling me ignorant?" Walmart is asking the unidentified woman to no longer shop at its stores. "We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer," the company says in a statement. Hicks says she supports Walmart banning the woman but doesn't want anything worse to happen to her; she only posted the video to raise awareness of racism. She blames President Trump for emboldening racists. Hicks, who has been in the US for three decades, says the incident left her feeling "insulted and unwanted." She says another Walmart customer hugged her and helped her to her car to make sure she was safe. "I love this country and I will stay in this country," Hicks says in her Facebook post.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   14% Hilarious 4% Intriguing 36% Depressing 15% Brilliant 10% Scary 21% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 281 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Aly Raisman: 'Sexist' TSA Agent Doubted My Muscles Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 281 comments tigerbalm2010 May 25, 2017 11:22 PM CDT Would be fun to find this racist fart and stone her. julianpenrod May 25, 2017 10:59 PM CDT And, again, only a white is seen displaying contempt for another race or another group. By the “evidence”, it can be concluded that Asians, Hispanics, blacks, American Indians are all squeaky clean, as pure as the driven snow. But, then, too, like Greg Gianfante's “body slamming” Ben Jacobs over a purely innocuous question about the purported Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act, a question that wasn't embarrassing for Gianfante, this sounds oddly overdone to the point of being suspicious. It looks very much like there is a pattern of staged incidents intended to try to bludgeon whites. reg May 25, 2017 10:16 PM CDT New Law Whenever you go outside You must wear overalls that cove your skin color.

Suzannah WeissMay 25, 2017 4:59PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of Facebook/Lee Merritt Carmen Ponder, the winner of the 2016 Miss Black Texas competition, has accused a police chief of police brutality and abuse of power, The Root reported. Ponder recounted her story on Twitter. While she was on her way to Walmart in Commerce, Texas, a car cut in front of her and kept braking, she said. After she passed the vehicle and entered the store's parking lot, a man she later identified as Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews got out and shouted at her for passing him while he was giving his 14-year-old daughter a driving lesson. "He continued yelling and cussing me out, and I finally turned around and said 'It's illegal,' when he kept saying that it was a 14-year-old driving," she wrote. "That's when he screamed, 'Oh, whatever, you black b*tch!' " Despite these alleged verbal attacks, Ponder went inside the store to shop. When she was done, she said a group of police officers met her outside. One of them demanded she apologize, and after she refused another dragged her inside the Walmart and detained her, she recounted. "When other officers arrived, she walked back to her car to explain what happened," Carmen's lawyer, Lee Merritt, told NBC 5. "An officer grabbed her and demanded she be arrested for resisting arrest. She has bruises on her arms from where she was grabbed.” https://twitter.com/CarmenSierraaa/status/867170450408968192 Ponder ended up in jail for 24 hours and was charged with evading arrest. On Twitter, she referred to the incident as "police brutality and abuse of power from a police chief." On the site youcaring.com, where she is asking for help with legal fees, Ponder says she "[refuses] to take a plea deal and [is] more than willing to go to trial." https://twitter.com/CarmenSierraaa/status/866673510739058688 In a Facebook post, Merritt wrote that Ponder's "only crime" was "the color of her skin." He's filing charges against Crews and his fellow police officers and demanding that Crews resign. "Unfortunately, as an official representative of ‘Black Texas,’ Carmen’s story embodies the black experience with law enforcement,” Merritt told The Root. “It is our responsibility to address this reality with sobriety and commitment. We demand justice in this case and will seek it from every possible angle.” NBC 5 reported that Crews was placed on administrative leave and an investigation by an outside organization hired by the city has been initiated, according to authorities. Crews would not provide comment on the allegations to NBC 5.

Shaw  |  May 25, 2017 4:24 PM EST  |  2 A simple drive to Walmart led to a Black woman being harassed, jailed and called a “Black b—.” The incident involved Miss Black Texas U.S. Ambassador Carmen S. Ponder who was driving in Commerce, Texas on May 20. According to the Miami Herald, Ponder encountered an inexperienced driver who happened to be the 14-year-old daughter of the city’s police chief Kerry Crews. Crews was allowing his 14-year old daughter, who doesn’t have a learner’s permit, to drive illegally. While on the road, Crews’ daughter drifted in and out of the lane, and abruptly smashed on the breaks and gas several times. Ponder decided to drive around the car because she figured the driver was drunk. However, when she pulled into the Walmart parking lot, she realized the car was following her. When Ponder parked, Crews got out of his car and began yelling at her. He told Ponder that he was teaching his daughter how to drive and that she should not have passed the vehicle. Ponder told Crews that it was illegal to allow a 14-year-old to drive before attempting to walk away. Crews then called Ponders a “Black b—.” Ponder decided to ignore Crews’ racist remark and walked into the store. When she returned to her car with purchased items in hand, Crews grabbed her by her arm and attempted to arrest her. Ponder called 911 to report the harassment. But when the police arrived, they arrested her for evading an arrest. She was sent to jail and had to spend 24 hours behind bars. Ponder did not break any law by passing an inexperienced driver and Crews never had a right to detain her without probable cause. Crews broke the law by allowing his inexperienced 14-year-old daughter to drive and he also called her a racial slur. It’s another example of an unqualified person who is allowed to serve as an officer to the public. His racist and illegal actions should cause him to be terminated. Along with being Miss Black Texas U.S. Ambassador, Ponder is currently a Dean’s List student at Texas A&M University-Commerce. Authorities claim that a special investigator is looking into the incident, but they have yet to reveal the person’s name who would head the investigation.

Follow @arshaw SrAgri If this story is true, the police chief should be fired and the other officers involved should be disciplined. Who in their right mind would have a 14-year-old without so much as a permit driving on the road? Take her to a field or an empty parking lot. She obviously wasn’t in a position to be driving, so the police chief should be charged for her reckless driving. Mark Lee “Violation of one’s civil rights under color of law” is a gross violation of both the the maniacal cop and the arresting officer who reports to him and very serious offenses – hopefully felonies – which would would, upon conviction, deprive each of the right to own or possess firearms, the right to vote, and in any sane community, the ability to serve in a law enforcement capacity. I Sincerely hope that both cops and the town where they are situated suffer the full consequences in both criminal and civil courts. From https://www.justice.gov/crt/deprivation-rights-under-color-law SUMMARY: Section 242 of Title 18 makes it a crime for a person acting under color of any law to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. For the purpose of Section 242, acts under “color of law” include acts not only done by federal, state, or local officials within the their lawful authority, but also acts done beyond the bounds of that official’s lawful authority, if the acts are done while the official is purporting to or pretending to act in the performance of his/her official duties. Persons acting under color of law within the meaning of this statute include police officers, prisons guards and other law enforcement officials, as well as judges, care providers in public health facilities, and others who are acting as public officials. It is not necessary that the crime be motivated by animus toward the race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin of the victim. The offense is punishable by a range of imprisonment up to a life term, or the death penalty, depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and the resulting injury, if any. TITLE 18, U.S.C., SECTION 242 Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if bodily injury results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include the use, attempted use, or threatened use of a dangerous weapon, explosives, or fire, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnaping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.

He declined to specify which details. “We’re in discussions with an independent investigator so everything can be looked at objectively,” Ferrell said. He declined to name the independent investigator. Carmen S. Ponder said in her own account and through an attorney that she was driving on Saturday behind a car that kept randomly braking, suddenly accelerating and drifting out of the lane in Commerce, Texas. Thinking the driver of the vehicle could be drunk, Ponder said she signaled and drove around the vehicle. She said she drove into a Walmart parking lot, but the car followed her and a man started yelling at her, saying he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter to drive and Ponder should not have driven around her. Ponder said she ignored the man at first but eventually told him that that was illegal before she walked into the store. She said the man responded, “oh whatever, you black bitch.”   Ponder said she came back outside after she had purchased her items and another man approached her, showed her a police badge and “started screaming.” Her attorney, Lee Merritt, said it was a plain clothes officer and the officer told Ponder the man who had been yelling at her was Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews, and she had “better apologize.” Ponder said she declined and kept walking to her car, when the officer grabbed her and told her she was being detained. Merritt said she then called 911 on her cell phone, and when those officers arrived the plain clothes officer told them she was evading arrest. The officers arrested Ponder, and she said she was held in jail for 24 hours and charged with evading arrest. Ferrell said he could not speak to how long Ponder spent in jail but that she had been charged with evading something, though he was unsure what the exact charge was. “Miss Black Texas spent the night in jail,” Merritt wrote on Facebook. “Her only crime ... the color of her skin.”   Ponder is trying to raise $10,000 on You Caring for attorney’s fees to fight the charges. “My family is a typical middle class family and we do not have any wiggle room to afford the attorney’s fees and city charges. I am a full-time student looking for permanent employment and this charge will hinder my job search,” Ponder wrote. “I will not be able to pass a background check for anything.” Ponder is the former Miss Black Texas U.S. Ambassador, which the website says is a position meant “to encourage, empower and enlighten, communities’ states and nations. Our purpose is to be a rising voice in the community and to make difference, by providing educational forums and events that focus on health disparities, poverty, violence and major issues plaguing the African American community.” Ponder is also a Dean’s List student at Texas A&M University-Commerce and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney, according to her You Caring page.

Shares of MoneyGram International, Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Applied Optoelectronics produced big gains in the past 12 months, but for very different reasons. The real question is, which ones are sustainable? Rich Duprey (TMFCop) May 25, 2017 at 3:18PM No smart investor should consciously bet on a company in hopes of doubling their investment within a year: Your plan should be to treat the stock market as a long-term game, because anything can happen in the short run. Over time, however, the best companies will rise to the top and produce outsized returns. But if a company does rack up amazing gains in shorter time frames, who are we to argue? While stock runs of this type can often be the result of a company having bet (apparently successfully) on a risky play, other times, the market can deliver them because a well-laid business plan is working out. Read on to see which camp MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI), Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSEMKT:NAK), and Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) fell into, and what the reasons were for their stocks' phenomenal 12-month results. Image source: Getty Images. MoneyGram International (up 186.2%) Things began to look up for money transfer specialist MoneyGram International before Donald Trump was elected president, his win spurred a rise in its stock because anxiety among immigrants was seen as leading to a short-term jump in money transfers to Mexico, the nation that is the fourth-biggest recipient of remittances from the U.S., behind India, China, and Philippines. It didn't hurt that in October, MoneyGram and partner Wal-Mart launched a new program that allows money transfers from any U.S. Wal-Mart store to any Wal-Mart Mexico store. But things really began to heat up in January when Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial offered to buy MoneyGram in a deal valued at roughly $880 million. Ant's primary business is Alipay, China's largest online payments service. But the proposal raised concerns about the acquisition giving the Chinese government access to the sensitive personal and financial information of Americans, since businesses owned by the government in Beijing in turn own a big chunk of Ant. The Ant offer sparked a bidding war with U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide, which offered $1 billion for MoneyGram. Ant countered with a $1.2 billion bid, or $18 per share. As Euronet never followed up with a higher offer, MoneyGram shareholders overwhelmingly approved the Ant Financial takeover, with 97% of investors voting in favor. The deal still has to get approved by the Treasury Department committee that oversees foreign investments in U.S. companies, but Ant Financial has said it believes it will get the OK by the summer. All the drama has boosted MoneyGram International's stock more than 186%, turning a $1,000 investment in the money transfer specialist a year ago into $2,800 today. Yet it's still possible MoneyGram's stock could crash if Treasury quashes the deal. Image source: Getty Images. Northern Dynasty Minerals (up 411.4%) Exploratory-stage precious-metals miner Northern Dynasty Minerals has seemingly had one foot in the grave for years after the Environmental Protection Agency revealed its official opposition to the development of the Pebble mine in Alaska, before the miner had even submitted an application. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Pebble Limited Partnership, responded by suing the EPA, asserting that the agency had jumped the gun. Located on Bristol Bay at the headwaters of a major spawning run to which 40 million salmon return every year, Pebble is the single largest undeveloped copper-gold-molybdenum deposit in the world, with the potential to produce as much as 55 billion pounds of copper, 67 million ounces of gold, and 3.3 billion pounds of molybdenum over a near-80-year period. But that's only if it could be mined profitably, which is not a sure thing. Northern Dynasty has had two partners back out of the project -- fellow miners Anglo American and Rio Tinto -- and the site has been laying fallow. However, Trump's election gave rise to dual catalysts for Pebble: speculation that his policies would lead to higher precious metals prices, and the high likelihood that under new management, the EPA would view the project more favorably. In fact, the miner and the regulatory agency did just come to a settlement recently over Northern Dynasty's lawsuit. The EPA has said it will withdraw its previous opposition, and postpone any further decisions on Pebble until the miner actually submits an application, and an environmental impact statement of its proposal has been completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Shares of Northern Dynasty had gained as much as 1,000%, pulling it out of true penny stock status to a price of over $3 a share, but it's since pulled back by around 50% from its 12-month high, given that substantial local opposition to the project still exists, from fisherman whose livelihoods it could put at risk to indigenous peoples, and among residents of Bristol Bay in general. Today Northern Dynasty Minerals remains up 411% from where it sat a year ago, which means an investment of $1,000 would have turned into more than $5,100. But seeing as those gains were largely built on hype and hope, it unclear whether they will last. Image source: Getty Images. Applied Optoelectronics (up 565%) Fiber-optic network products provider Applied Optoelectronics has surged some 565% during the past year on a string of strong quarterly earnings reports that began last June. The cause? Customers like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft increased their demand for data center work, causing segment revenues to more than double. In its first-quarter earnings report, Applied Optoelectronics said data center revenues jumped year over year from $38 million to more than $79 million. Amazon provided 55% of AO's revenues while Microsoft accounted for almost 19%.  AO provides fiber and fiber-networking products to homes, internet data centers, and for cable television broadband -- the need for which is only increasing as ever more network-connected devices come online and demand rises for streaming video, cloud computing, social networking, and more. Primarily because Amazon.com's growth shows no signs of letting up, there's no reason to expects Applied Optoelectronics' own growth will falter either. A $1,000 investment in the fiber-optic network products specialist a year ago would be worth more $6,200 now, and it's easy to believe it can go higher still.

Carmen Ponder, 23, shared her version of an interaction she had with Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews in a Twitter post on Tuesday.  Ponder is suing the police force, and says she wants police accountability and formal charges to be filed against Crews.  Miss Black Texas 2016 claims she was harassed by a North Texas police chief who called her a 'black b****,' before being unlawfully detained and arrested Carmen Ponder is suing the police force, and says she wants police accountability and formal charges to be filed against Crews In her account, Ponder said she was driving to Walmart on Saturday when a black pickup truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically.  She said the car was braking and accelerating dangerously, and she worried it was a drunk driver.  Ponder wrote that she put her blinker on, pulled around to pass the truck and drove into the superstore parking lot.  Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews allegedly verbally attacked Ponder, leading to what she believes is a wrongful arrest According to her, the black truck followed her into the lot and pulled up next to where she'd parked her car.  She said the passenger, who was later identified as Crews, got out of the truck and started yelling and screaming that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter how to drive, saying Ponder shouldn't have passed his truck.  Ponder wrote that she ignored the man at first, but eventually turned to tell him 'it's illegal about a 14-year-old driving, before walking into the store. 'That's when he screamed "oh whatever, you black b****.' After making her purchase at the store, which she said did not take long as she only had to get one thing,  She said when she walked out she saw Crews there and was quickly charged by several other officers in street clothes.  'One guy showed me his police badge and started screaming at me. HE told me this guy was his chief and I better apologize to him now. I told him I was going to do that and was walking to my car,' she explained.  Ponder wrote about the interaction on Twitter, and explained how it started when she was driving to Wal-Mart on Saturday and black pickup truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically Next, one of the men grabbed her by the arm and pulled her roughly back into Wal-Mart, telling her she was being detained  When police came, she said: 'I began walking to the policeman when the aggressive guy pulled me by my arm again, told the cop that I was resisting arrest and demanded he arrest me.'  Her lawyer, Lee Merritt, told NBC New York she had bruises from where she was grabbed.  Ponder was then handcuffed and booked into jail, where she spent 24 hours. She was charged with evading arrest.  Ponder was then handcuffed and booked into jail, where she spent 24 hours. She was charged with evading arrest Authorities told NBC Crews was placed on administrative leave while an outside organization looks into the altercation.  Ponder is calling attention to the incident to hold the officer accountable, and has started a crowdfunding page to raise money for her attorney's fees.  She wrote on her youcaring.com  account that she will not take a plea deal, and is 'more than willing' to take it to trial.  'My only crime... the color of my skin,' she wrote.  Ponder's You Caring page also says she is a Dean's List student at Texas A&M University- Commerce and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 255 shares Most watched News videos Wife of Houston Astros pitcher sobs as husband makes MLB debut Dash cam video show Calvin Jones was violently arrested and choked by police Moment special education teacher tells student he will graduate Micha Leigh Dominguez caught being a 'fake homeless' woman panhandling 'Bunnyranch terrorist!'

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Genesco, Dollar Tree, Abercrombie & Fitch By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 25 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Guess saw earnings fall on soft Americas sales, while Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Genesco  Genesco said its first-quarter performance reflects a number of challenges, many of which were expected, early in the new fiscal year. For the three months ended 29 April, net earnings fell to US$885m from $10.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down, slipping 0.8% to $643m from $649m. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalog sales, decreased 1%, with a 5% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 1% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 10% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 3% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group. Dollar Tree US discount retailer Dollar Tree said it is "extremely pleased" with its first-quarter performance despite net income slipping US$32.2m to $200.5m. Sales meanwhile, increased 4% to $5.29bn from $5.09bn in the prior year period. Same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5%. Gross margin increased to 30.8% compared to 30.6% in the prior year. The improvement was driven primarily by lower merchandise and freight costs, partially offset by higher markdowns. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch has reported a net loss of US$61.7m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $39.6m last year. Gross margin narrowed 130 basis points to 60.3%. Net sales slipped 4% to $661.1m from $685.5m in the year-ago period, while comparable sales were down 3%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel."Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel." Burlington Stores  Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue increase in the first quarter, booking a 39.6% rise in net income from US$37.5m to $52.4m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 40.9%, while total sales meanwhile, increased 5.0%, or $63.9m, to $1.3bn. This growth was driven by an increase of $65.1m from new and non-comparable stores, as well as a 0.5% increase in comparable store sales. The 0.5% comparable store sales increase was on top of a 4.3% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Sears Holdings  US retail giant Sears Holdings moved to a profit in the quarter, with net income reaching US$244m, compared to net loss of $471m in the year-ago period. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.6%, while net revenues fell to $4.3bn from $5.4bn last year. Sears said the year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily driven by having fewer Kmart and Sears full-line stores in operation, which accounted for $557m of the decline, as well as an 11.9% decline in comparable store sales during the quarter, which accounted for $417m. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing. We recognise that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25bn restructuring program." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp has increased its earnings guidance for the year after its first-quarter earnings exceeded guidance, and despite a 69.7% drop in net income to US$70.1m from $231.6m in the year-ago period. For the quarter ended 30 April, revenue increased 4% to $1.9bn from $1.82bn last year. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 6% to $842m, while Calvin Klein revenue was not far behind, up 5% to $756m, compared to the prior year period, which includes a reduction of about $15m resulting from the November 2016 deconsolidation of the company's Calvin Klein business in Mexico. Meanwhile, revenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter decreased 3% to $391m, principally resulting from a planned shift in the timing of shipments from the first quarter into the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "Our first quarter performance underscored the power of our diversified business model and the strength in our international businesses. We believe that our brands, led by  Calvin Klein and  Tommy Hilfiger, continue to resonate with consumers and are gaining market share against our competition. As the global retail environment shifts, we continue to focus on adapting to change, while investing in our brands and operating platforms to capitalise on the opportunities for each of our businesses." Shoe Carnival Shoe Carnival saw earnings and sales slip in the first quarter, compared to last year, as net income fell to US$8.2m from $10.7m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin narrowed to 28.5% from 29%, while net sales dropped 2.7% to $253.4m from $260.5m last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.9%. CEO Cliff Sifford said: "Looking forward, our consistently strong financial position provides the financial flexibility to support our future strategies and further enhance shareholder value over time as a result of our dividend and share repurchase programs." Guess US fashion retailer Guess has booked a drop in first-quarter sales on the back of a soft performance in the Americas where the company is looking to shrink its footprint and improve profitability. Group earnings fell to US$21.3m from $25.2m a year earlier, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 31.5% from 31.8%. Net revenues finished at the high-end of expectations, reaching $458.6m from $448.8m. In Europe and in Asia, sales were up 23% and 17%, respectively, driven by new store openings and positive comp sales. In the Americas, sales were down 14.9%. Chico's Chico's said it remains "steadfast" in in executing against its strategic plan to increase profitable sales and long-term earnings after booking a mixed first-quarter. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net income increased to US$33.62m from $31.08m in the year-ago period, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 40.7% from 40.8%. Sales meanwhile, slipped 9.2% to $583.7m compared to $643m last year. The company said the fall primarily reflects a decline in comparable sales of 8.7%, driven by lower average dollar sale and a decline in transaction count. Tilly's Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's said its initiatives are gaining traction, as it narrowed its net loss to US$0.2m from $2.7m. Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.2% from 27.1% last year, primarily due to an 80 basis point reduction in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, offset by a 70 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales edged up 0.6% to $120.9m, while comparable sales were also up by 0.6% compared to a 4.1% decline in the same period last year. DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion.

L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year.

For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period.

By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year.

The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points.

Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%.

Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions. Sales for the activewear and international segments increased, while sales decreased as expected for the innerwear segment and manage-for-cash businesses. Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period.

Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

(KHBS and KHOG) – A woman shopping in a Wal-Mart in Centeron, Arkansas is the target of racist comments from another shopper. Eva Hicks was the target of the remarks. “I encountered this lady that was on my way and I asked her politely you know if I could pass, and I said excuse me, and she was being very hateful, immediately.” Woman: Get out of here. Eva Hicks: No I’m not going to get out of here. Woman: Go back to Mexico. Eva Hicks: No! No I’m not! Woman: You’re just going to stand here and argue. Eva Hicks: No, because this is my country. Woman: Your country? Eva Hicks: Yes, this is my country. Woman: This is not your country? Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Yes it is, I don’t care. Manager: “That’s not true, we do want you here.” Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Manager: That’s not true, we do want you here. Eva Hicks: I don’t care what you want or not. Manager: We do want you here. Woman: Leave me alone. Manager: That’s not true. Woman: Go. Go. Hicks said the incident upset her so much because of her love for this area. “This country has given me so much, so much opportunities for me, for my family, for my kids.  It is a beautiful country. This is a free country.” During the incident, several bystanders and a store manager stepped in to defend Hicks. “I felt love, I felt like, yes, I belong here. There is no reason for someone to treat me less, just because my skin is different, just because I have an accent, just because I was born in a different country.” The unidentified woman also made comments to another woman who was attempting to help. Hicks said she just wants to put the encounter in the past and wants the best for the other woman. “I just wish her good, it’s really sad to see somebody like that,” said Hicks. The assistant manager did ask the woman to leave the store. They also gave this statement saying quote: “We value respect for everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.” Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Video posted to Facebook on Monday night that shows a woman telling one customer to "go back to Mexico" and calling another customer a racial epithet has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on the social network. Eva Hicks, a mother of three, said she politely asked the woman to step to the side as she reached for medicine. It was then that the woman became aggressive, Hicks told CNN. "She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me," Hicks recounted and then took out her phone and began to record the encounter. The woman, who has not been identified, told Hicks to "go back to Mexico" and accused her of being rude. Another woman off-camera intervenes and tells the woman to stop being "ignorant." The woman on camera responds, "a n---er's calling me ignorant?" "I have never experienced anything like that in my life," Hicks said. "Nobody has ever talked to me like that, I felt very insulted and unwanted." Hicks, originally from Mexico City, says she has been living in the United States for more than 30 years. In the video, she tells the woman that this is her home. "It's not your country, we don't want you here," the woman retorted. "I am an American citizen. I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here. I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up," Hicks said Wednesday, adding that she posted the video to Facebook to raise awareness. "I have seen a lot of these incidents lately, I believe, ever since the Trump administration came into power. He can say hateful things to other races and other countries; these people think it's okay for them to do the same." In a statement posted online, Walmart said it had "no tolerance for the language or actions" of the customer and commended the staff member seen in the video, saying he acted appropriately by asking the woman to leave. @WalmartNewsroom via CNN @WalmartNewsroom via CNN A Walmart spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that the company was working to identify the woman and "once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores." Hicks said she hopes to meet the woman who came to her defense and was subsequently called the N-word. "I don't know her. I am supposed to meet her today," she said. "I want to meet her to say thank you and just give her a hug."   More Stories Global cyberattack: A simple explanation Meet WannaCry.

He declined to specify which details. “We’re in discussions with an independent investigator so everything can be looked at objectively,” Ferrell said. He declined to name the independent investigator. Carmen S. Ponder said in her own account and through an attorney that she was driving on Saturday behind a car that kept randomly braking, suddenly accelerating and drifting out of the lane in Commerce, Texas. Thinking the driver of the vehicle could be drunk, Ponder said she signaled and drove around the vehicle. She said she drove into a Walmart parking lot, but the car followed her and a man started yelling at her, saying he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter to drive and Ponder should not have driven around her. Ponder said she ignored the man at first but eventually told him that that was illegal before she walked into the store. She said the man responded, “oh whatever, you black bitch.”   Ponder said she came back outside after she had purchased her items and another man approached her, showed her a police badge and “started screaming.” Her attorney, Lee Merritt, said it was a plain clothes officer and the officer told Ponder the man who had been yelling at her was Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews, and she had “better apologize.” Ponder said she declined and kept walking to her car, when the officer grabbed her and told her she was being detained. Merritt said she then called 911 on her cell phone, and when those officers arrived the plain clothes officer told them she was evading arrest. The officers arrested Ponder, and she said she was held in jail for 24 hours and charged with evading arrest. Ferrell said he could not speak to how long Ponder spent in jail but that she had been charged with evading something, though he was unsure what the exact charge was. “Miss Black Texas spent the night in jail,” Merritt wrote on Facebook. “Her only crime ... the color of her skin.”   Ponder is trying to raise $10,000 on You Caring for attorney’s fees to fight the charges. “My family is a typical middle class family and we do not have any wiggle room to afford the attorney’s fees and city charges. I am a full-time student looking for permanent employment and this charge will hinder my job search,” Ponder wrote. “I will not be able to pass a background check for anything.” Ponder is the former Miss Black Texas U.S. Ambassador, which the website says is a position meant “to encourage, empower and enlighten, communities’ states and nations. Our purpose is to be a rising voice in the community and to make difference, by providing educational forums and events that focus on health disparities, poverty, violence and major issues plaguing the African American community.” Ponder is also a Dean’s List student at Texas A&M University-Commerce and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney, according to her You Caring page.

Pranksters Who Spent Two Days In Walmart Were Sick Of It After 35 Minutes Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Pranksters Who Spent Two Days In Walmart Were Sick Of It After 35 Minutes Image courtesy of Christian and Noah May 25, 2017 10:30 am EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk just why walmart pranks shopping retail If the idea of spending 48 straight hours in a Walmart store sounds like 47.5 hours too many, you’re not alone. Even the two guys who pulled off that dubious accomplishment recently say they were sick of the place not long after walking in. The two Indiana University students wanted to outdo past pranksters who have spent 24 hours in a Walmart store, or at least, they claimed to. But they quickly found out that 48 hours is a lot of time to spend under the bright lights of the store. “About 35 minutes in because I was already getting sick of it,” one of the guys told The Indianapolis Star. “I started really listening to the music and realized that it’s just nonstop. And then the lighting and everything. … I was starting to lose my mind. After a little bit you get into this state where you just feel out of it.” They were frustrated with others who attempted similar challenges, so they decided to go above and beyond by showing proof of their stay with a running timer. In order to stay for as long as they did, the guys realized they would have to buy something every three hours or so. So they bought gum, ate at the Subway inside the store, and even got haircuts at the salon. But despite making toilet paper forts for sleeping and a visit from their friend, it sounds like these guys had pretty much a terrible time. “I would say it was a blast, but it really wasn’t,” one of the guys told the Star, adding that the hour he spent sitting on a toilet away from the noise and the lights was “probably the best time I had.” When it was finally time to leave, even the one Walmart staffer they told about their stay didn’t seem fazed. Instead, he shook the guy’s hand and prompted him to sing along with him to “Man of Constant Sorrow,” quite a fitting end to what we can only guess was 48 hours of constant, intense boredom.

Kayla Tausche | Jeff Cox 16 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters GOP to drop effort to remove caps on debit card fees is win for retailers    14 Hours Ago | 00:39 A plan that would have removed limits on what banks can charge retailers for debt card fees won't be part of financial reform legislation making its way through Congress. House Republicans had planned to repeal the so-called Durbin amendment, a measure opposed by banks but supported by merchants who complained they had to shoulder the burden of rising debit card fees that issuers were charging. The House Financial Services Committee has agreed to omit the repeal language to allow the bill to get through after being met with resistance as it tallied potential votes for the legislation this week. The Financial Choice Act is the GOP's plan to change parts of the Dodd-Frank reforms passed after the financial crisis. "I've said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans," committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said in a statement to CNBC. "I believe it belongs in the Financial Choice Act, but I recognize and respect that many members of Congress feel differently." CNBC reported on May 2 that Hensarling privately had told financial industry executives and lobbyists that the Durbin amendment repeal would be excluded from the final legislation. Bankers opposing the Durbin amendment contended that the caps resulted in a windfall for retailers at the expense of financial institutions. Opponents also said that the limits actually ended up costing consumers more when banks started charging other fees to make up for the lost revenue. "The House Republicans' capitulation on Durbin repeal is a slap in the face for lower-income Americans," Iain Murray, vice president for strategy at libertarian think tank the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a statement. "All the evidence suggests the cap on debit card interchange fees resulted in a windfall for retailers who failed to pass on savings to consumers." The debate set up a heated lobbying conflict between the two sides, with retailers prevailing after it became clear that the 600-page Choice Act was unlikely to pass with the repeal in place. Analysts at FBR said that while the House bill now could make it through, its chances considerably slimmer in the Senate.

No matter where we are, we yearn to be somewhere else. For Smith, born in 1944 and raised deep in the mountains of Grundy, Virginia, there were no shackles keeping her obliged to and restrained within the confines of Hill Country. On the other hand, she understands (as the title to her preface indicates) that she was “raised to leave”. It’s a theme abundant in the lives and plots of fellow Appalachian authors, musicians, and artists. Does leaving mark the ultimate betrayal of the land and its people? If the hills protect, does the outside world corrupt? Through 14 nostalgic chapters covering various elements of her life and times as a woman from Grundy, absorbing everything from the tumult that came from coming of age in the ‘60s, developing as a writer, and watching the innocence of her hometown (including the eventual appearance of a WalMart replacing her late father’s old dimestore), this is a book that earns a balance of sweetness and heartbreak on every page. For many readers, especially in these extreme times of Red State fear and Blue state loathing, where all that space between New York and Los Angeles is summarily dismissed as flyover country, the prospect of sitting down to a story about a life that started and remains still influenced by the environment of Grundy is daunting. Smith seems to understand that, which is probably why the preface to this collection of essays (most of which were previously published in various journals and date back to 1998) focuses on an early 21st century O Brother, Where Art Thou? Concert in Carnegie Hall. There, singing his chilling a capella song “O Death”, was the then 76-year-old Dr. Ralph Stanley. His appearance, and the surprising popularity of the soundtrack, led Smith to these reflections: “Now, everybody in the region realizes that we don’t have to go anyplace else to ‘get culture.’… America as a whole is coming to appreciate and value its differences… our own Appalachian culture is as rich and as diverse in terms of history… as any area in the country.” Smith may not have been able to forecast the current state of mainstream American xenophobia rooted in building walls and developing alien registry lists, but the point she made approximately 15 years ago remains valid. By the beginning of the 21st Century, such revered acts as Dolly Parton were returning to traditional bluegrass recordings. Lucinda Williams and Steve Earle were establishing credibility through years of consistent authenticity. Writers like Barbara Kingsolver, and films like Anthony Minghella’s Cold Mountain (2003, based on the book of the same name by Charles Frazier) were marketable. Smith argues that “…mainstream American culture has become ‘Appalachian-ized.’” Even NASCAR, arguably the most successful export from the culture, was pervasive. It’s this question of whether acceptance and understanding from the mainstream culture results in impurity that runs through this book. In effect, cultural appropriation of the simple life, in whatever form that might take, dilutes the lessons learned about family, country, and responsibility. There’s also the issue of feeling smothered, feeling trapped. Take this line from the title essay: “Driving into Grundy was like heading into a bowl, producing that familiar sense of enclosure that used to comfort me and drive me wild at the same time when I was a teenager.” The most remarkable accomplishment of this title essay is that Smith proves more than capable of containing the full spectrum of Grundy’s lifetime within the span of 33 pages: the movies she’s seen that taught her about the power of the human voice as narrative’ the neighbors and the way they cover their real feelings in the words they choose; the lonesome song of a train’s whistle and; her father’s dimestore, which was always the center of activity. The dimestore closed in 1992. By 2012, coming to town to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local library, Smith reflects on Grundy, which by that point had become a college town: “Viewed from the top floor of Walmart, the entire town looks like a toy town, like the train set Daddy always kept set up in the dimestore’s basement toy section.” Another thread that runs through this book, and Smith treats it with grace and sensitivity, is mental illness. In the essay “Kindly Nervous”, she writes about how her father was embarrassed by his depression. Giving him a copy of William Styron’s slim and masterful memoir of near-suicidal depression, Darkness Visible (1990), was apparently a lifesaver for the family. Smith’s mother was also hospitalized several times for depression. This is another careful, thoughtful essay, and Smith makes clear to note that it should not be viewed as a “sob story”. She was never alone. When one or both parent was suffering, there was always the family of Grundy to fill in the missing pieces. In “Marble Cake and Moonshine”, Smith tells the story of how she went from the adamant conclusion that “…I was not going to write anything about Grundy, Virginia, ever, that as for sure”, to an understanding that the town and the culture was worth exploring. It involves Eudora Welty visiting her class at Hollins College. It involves being introduced to Southern Literature she hadn’t even known existed, including William Styron’s Lie Down in Darkness (1951). Again, it’s the smooth economy and grace Smith uses in her storytelling that makes us empathize, especially here: …one of the most important functions of any good writing teacher is to serve as a sort of ‘matchmaker’…’fixing up’ a new writer with the fiction of a successful published author whose work comes out of a similar background… It’s this understanding on Smith’s part that her memoir can and should serve as a guide for young writers who might need direction (whether or not they’re aware of it) that makes this an important book. The key essay to this book, and one that will resonate long for any reader who might have even a remote connection with the disorder, is “Good-bye to the Sunset Man”, originally published in 2004. It tells the story of her son Josh, who died in his sleep in 2003. The official diagnosis was acute myocardiopathy. Her son was young, a brilliant musician, and an overall troubled young person with an official diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. What makes this essay so strong is what permeates through the entire book: a refusal to fall into manipulative, emotional button-pushing. It will be remarkable to any reader that Lee Smith, writing and publishing this only a few months after her son’ s death, manages to carefully balance the emotions in this narrative. This story is as much a cautionary tale and a guide for those who might also have loved ones suffering from this as it is a tribute to her son. Consider this: “…All mental illnesses are treatable. Often, brain chemistry has to be adjusted with medication. If symptoms occur, go to the doctor.” Near the end, she quotes from James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain”, one of Josh’s favorite songs. It’s about the loss of a loved one and the singer had always though he’d see this person again, but Smith understands that’s impossible: “I know this. But what a privilege it was to live on this earth with him, what a privilege it was to be his mother. There will be a lessening of pain, there will be consolations, I can tell.” If all we take away from Dimestore is Lee Smith’s fierce determination and strength balanced with a remarkably sweet evocation of a time that will never return, then the writer has done her job. Smith’s voice is refreshingly humble where others might have spent more time pontificating and bloviating. Smith’s childhood was not perfect. Her parents were depressed, and it’s likely (though not concluded by the author) that her son succumbed to that illness in his short life. That said, this book stands as a testament to the strength of the writing life. Smith’s essays are rich with nostalgia but open to the necessity of change and moving forward, of understanding that the “simple life” as might have been evoked in TV classics like The Andy Griffith Show and Hee Haw (not mentioned here but strong pop culture benchmarks of the past 50 plus years) is much more complex than we ever thought. In better words, here’s how she sums up her profession at the end of “A Life In Books”: Simply to line up words one after another upon a page is to create some order where it did not exist… Writing cannot bring our loved ones back, but it can sometimes fix them in our fleeting memories as they were in life, and it can always help us make it through the night. Dimestore should take its place alongside Eudora Welty’s One Writer’s Beginnings (1984) and Stephen King’s On Writing (1999) as a beautiful and haunting memoir about the American journey. </p><p> Dimestore: A Writer's Life Rating: Christopher John Stephens is an adjunct college English Instructor at Northeastern University and Bunker Hill Community College.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Genesco, Dollar Tree, Abercrombie & Fitch By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 25 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Guess saw earnings fall on soft Americas sales, while Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Genesco  Genesco said its first-quarter performance reflects a number of challenges, many of which were expected, early in the new fiscal year. For the three months ended 29 April, net earnings fell to US$885m from $10.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down, slipping 0.8% to $643m from $649m. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalog sales, decreased 1%, with a 5% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 1% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 10% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 3% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group. Dollar Tree US discount retailer Dollar Tree said it is "extremely pleased" with its first-quarter performance despite net income slipping US$32.2m to $200.5m. Sales meanwhile, increased 4% to $5.29bn from $5.09bn in the prior year period. Same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5%. Gross margin increased to 30.8% compared to 30.6% in the prior year. The improvement was driven primarily by lower merchandise and freight costs, partially offset by higher markdowns. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch has reported a net loss of US$61.7m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $39.6m last year. Gross margin narrowed 130 basis points to 60.3%. Net sales slipped 4% to $661.1m from $685.5m in the year-ago period, while comparable sales were down 3%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel."Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel." Burlington Stores  Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue increase in the first quarter, booking a 39.6% rise in net income from US$37.5m to $52.4m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 40.9%, while total sales meanwhile, increased 5.0%, or $63.9m, to $1.3bn. This growth was driven by an increase of $65.1m from new and non-comparable stores, as well as a 0.5% increase in comparable store sales. The 0.5% comparable store sales increase was on top of a 4.3% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Sears Holdings  US retail giant Sears Holdings moved to a profit in the quarter, with net income reaching US$244m, compared to net loss of $471m in the year-ago period. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.6%, while net revenues fell to $4.3bn from $5.4bn last year. Sears said the year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily driven by having fewer Kmart and Sears full-line stores in operation, which accounted for $557m of the decline, as well as an 11.9% decline in comparable store sales during the quarter, which accounted for $417m. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing. We recognise that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25bn restructuring program." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp has increased its earnings guidance for the year after its first-quarter earnings exceeded guidance, and despite a 69.7% drop in net income to US$70.1m from $231.6m in the year-ago period. For the quarter ended 30 April, revenue increased 4% to $1.9bn from $1.82bn last year. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 6% to $842m, while Calvin Klein revenue was not far behind, up 5% to $756m, compared to the prior year period, which includes a reduction of about $15m resulting from the November 2016 deconsolidation of the company's Calvin Klein business in Mexico. Meanwhile, revenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter decreased 3% to $391m, principally resulting from a planned shift in the timing of shipments from the first quarter into the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "Our first quarter performance underscored the power of our diversified business model and the strength in our international businesses. We believe that our brands, led by  Calvin Klein and  Tommy Hilfiger, continue to resonate with consumers and are gaining market share against our competition. As the global retail environment shifts, we continue to focus on adapting to change, while investing in our brands and operating platforms to capitalise on the opportunities for each of our businesses." Shoe Carnival Shoe Carnival saw earnings and sales slip in the first quarter, compared to last year, as net income fell to US$8.2m from $10.7m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin narrowed to 28.5% from 29%, while net sales dropped 2.7% to $253.4m from $260.5m last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.9%. CEO Cliff Sifford said: "Looking forward, our consistently strong financial position provides the financial flexibility to support our future strategies and further enhance shareholder value over time as a result of our dividend and share repurchase programs." Guess US fashion retailer Guess has booked a drop in first-quarter sales on the back of a soft performance in the Americas where the company is looking to shrink its footprint and improve profitability. Group earnings fell to US$21.3m from $25.2m a year earlier, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 31.5% from 31.8%. Net revenues finished at the high-end of expectations, reaching $458.6m from $448.8m. In Europe and in Asia, sales were up 23% and 17%, respectively, driven by new store openings and positive comp sales. In the Americas, sales were down 14.9%. Chico's Chico's said it remains "steadfast" in in executing against its strategic plan to increase profitable sales and long-term earnings after booking a mixed first-quarter. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net income increased to US$33.62m from $31.08m in the year-ago period, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 40.7% from 40.8%. Sales meanwhile, slipped 9.2% to $583.7m compared to $643m last year. The company said the fall primarily reflects a decline in comparable sales of 8.7%, driven by lower average dollar sale and a decline in transaction count. Tilly's Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's said its initiatives are gaining traction, as it narrowed its net loss to US$0.2m from $2.7m. Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.2% from 27.1% last year, primarily due to an 80 basis point reduction in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, offset by a 70 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales edged up 0.6% to $120.9m, while comparable sales were also up by 0.6% compared to a 4.1% decline in the same period last year. DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn. "We delivered a solid first-quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year. We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands."

For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year.

Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses.

Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points. CEO William Dillard said that while the company's sales decline weighed heavily onits operating results, it still ended the quarter with $302m of cash, largely due to better cash management. Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked first-quarter earnings in line with expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net earnings were up 37% to US$63m, from $46m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.7% to $3.3bn, compared to $3.2bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.8%. This was consistent with trends experienced over the past year, Nordstrom said. Meanwhile, online sales were 24% of total net sales, driven by 11% growth at Nordstrom.com and 19% at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Hudson's Bay Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) has booked a drop in comparable sales in what it described as a difficult first-quarter, particularly in the US where the group has experienced lower store traffic across all its banners. On a constant currency basis, consolidated comparable sales were down 2.9%. DSG (Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor, and Home Outfitters) saw sales fall 2.4%, while Saks Fifth Avenue sales fell 4.8%. In Europe, HBC sales were remained flat. Comparable digital sales were up 5.4%. Macy's US department store retailer Macy's says its first-quarter sales and earnings results were consistent with its expectations, and that it remains on track to meet its 2017 guidance. Earnings in the period dropped to $71m from $115m last year, while gross margin narrowed to 38.1% from 39.1% in the prior year period. Sales totalled $5.34bn, a drop of 7.5% on sales of $5.77bn in the same period last year, reflecting, in part, store closures. Comparable sales on an owned basis were down 5.2%. Kohl's US department store retailer Kohl's has booked mixed first-quarter results as earnings climbed but sales fell. Earnings were up 14% to US$66m from $58m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 83 basis points to 36.4%. Sales, meanwhile, were down 3.2% to $3.84bn. CEO Kevin Mansell, however, said there had been a "significant improvement" in sales and traffic for the March and April period, after a weak February. "Continued strong inventory management led to a major improvement in gross margin, and our teams managed expenses exceptionally well." Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%. Earnings dropped to $16.7m from $17.4m, while gross margin widened slightly to 39.7% from 39.6% last year. "The transformation of our business is well underway with our strategy focused on elevating our most powerful brands with consumers, delivering continuous product innovation and sustained organic growth, and unlocking incremental operational efficiencies, with an emphasis on pace and speed," said CEO Blake Krueger. Iconix Brand Group Iconix moved to a loss in its first-quarter on the back of declining sales as the the company looks to implement initiatives aimed at improving its balance sheet and driving organic growth. Losses amounted to US$4.3m from earnings of $18.6m a year earlier. Operating income declined 27% to $33.6m, while licensing revenue fell 13% to $58.7m. Separately, Iconix announced the sale of its entertainment segment for $345m in cash. Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends said total sales in the 13 weeks to 29 April increased 3.2% to US$200m, compared to $193.7m in the year-ago period. Comparable store sales meanwhile, were up 1% from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions. Sales for the activewear and international segments increased, while sales decreased as expected for the innerwear segment and manage-for-cash businesses. Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period. Brand revenue at Vans was up 5% and by 6% at The North Face., but fell 5% at Timberland. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record first-quarter net sales of US$543.8m, a 4% increase compared with net sales of $525.1m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Genesco, Dollar Tree, Abercrombie & Fitch By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 25 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Guess saw earnings fall on soft Americas sales, while Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Genesco  Genesco said its first-quarter performance reflects a number of challenges, many of which were expected, early in the new fiscal year. For the three months ended 29 April, net earnings fell to US$885m from $10.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down, slipping 0.8% to $643m from $649m. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalog sales, decreased 1%, with a 5% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 1% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 10% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 3% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group. Dollar Tree US discount retailer Dollar Tree said it is "extremely pleased" with its first-quarter performance despite net income slipping US$32.2m to $200.5m. Sales meanwhile, increased 4% to $5.29bn from $5.09bn in the prior year period. Same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5%. Gross margin increased to 30.8% compared to 30.6% in the prior year. The improvement was driven primarily by lower merchandise and freight costs, partially offset by higher markdowns. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch has reported a net loss of US$61.7m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $39.6m last year. Gross margin narrowed 130 basis points to 60.3%. Net sales slipped 4% to $661.1m from $685.5m in the year-ago period, while comparable sales were down 3%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel."Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel." Burlington Stores  Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue increase in the first quarter, booking a 39.6% rise in net income from US$37.5m to $52.4m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 40.9%, while total sales meanwhile, increased 5.0%, or $63.9m, to $1.3bn. This growth was driven by an increase of $65.1m from new and non-comparable stores, as well as a 0.5% increase in comparable store sales. The 0.5% comparable store sales increase was on top of a 4.3% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Sears Holdings  US retail giant Sears Holdings moved to a profit in the quarter, with net income reaching US$244m, compared to net loss of $471m in the year-ago period. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.6%, while net revenues fell to $4.3bn from $5.4bn last year. Sears said the year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily driven by having fewer Kmart and Sears full-line stores in operation, which accounted for $557m of the decline, as well as an 11.9% decline in comparable store sales during the quarter, which accounted for $417m. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing. We recognise that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25bn restructuring program." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp has increased its earnings guidance for the year after its first-quarter earnings exceeded guidance, and despite a 69.7% drop in net income to US$70.1m from $231.6m in the year-ago period. For the quarter ended 30 April, revenue increased 4% to $1.9bn from $1.82bn last year. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 6% to $842m, while Calvin Klein revenue was not far behind, up 5% to $756m, compared to the prior year period, which includes a reduction of about $15m resulting from the November 2016 deconsolidation of the company's Calvin Klein business in Mexico. Meanwhile, revenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter decreased 3% to $391m, principally resulting from a planned shift in the timing of shipments from the first quarter into the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "Our first quarter performance underscored the power of our diversified business model and the strength in our international businesses. We believe that our brands, led by  Calvin Klein and  Tommy Hilfiger, continue to resonate with consumers and are gaining market share against our competition. As the global retail environment shifts, we continue to focus on adapting to change, while investing in our brands and operating platforms to capitalise on the opportunities for each of our businesses." Shoe Carnival Shoe Carnival saw earnings and sales slip in the first quarter, compared to last year, as net income fell to US$8.2m from $10.7m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin narrowed to 28.5% from 29%, while net sales dropped 2.7% to $253.4m from $260.5m last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.9%. CEO Cliff Sifford said: "Looking forward, our consistently strong financial position provides the financial flexibility to support our future strategies and further enhance shareholder value over time as a result of our dividend and share repurchase programs." Guess US fashion retailer Guess has booked a drop in first-quarter sales on the back of a soft performance in the Americas where the company is looking to shrink its footprint and improve profitability. Group earnings fell to US$21.3m from $25.2m a year earlier, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 31.5% from 31.8%. Net revenues finished at the high-end of expectations, reaching $458.6m from $448.8m. In Europe and in Asia, sales were up 23% and 17%, respectively, driven by new store openings and positive comp sales. In the Americas, sales were down 14.9%. Chico's Chico's said it remains "steadfast" in in executing against its strategic plan to increase profitable sales and long-term earnings after booking a mixed first-quarter. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net income increased to US$33.62m from $31.08m in the year-ago period, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 40.7% from 40.8%. Sales meanwhile, slipped 9.2% to $583.7m compared to $643m last year. The company said the fall primarily reflects a decline in comparable sales of 8.7%, driven by lower average dollar sale and a decline in transaction count. Tilly's Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's said its initiatives are gaining traction, as it narrowed its net loss to US$0.2m from $2.7m. Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.2% from 27.1% last year, primarily due to an 80 basis point reduction in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, offset by a 70 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales edged up 0.6% to $120.9m, while comparable sales were also up by 0.6% compared to a 4.1% decline in the same period last year. DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn.

We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will continue to "evaluate and adjust" its business model, and is taking actions to reduce its expense structure in order to fund and develop its longer-term strategic initiatives. TJX Companies TJX Companies said it has  great confidence in the continued, successful growth of the company after booking increases in both sales and earnings in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 January, net income reached US$536.3m, compared to $508.3m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin was 29.0%, up 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year.

Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points. CEO William Dillard said that while the company's sales decline weighed heavily onits operating results, it still ended the quarter with $302m of cash, largely due to better cash management. Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked first-quarter earnings in line with expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net earnings were up 37% to US$63m, from $46m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.7% to $3.3bn, compared to $3.2bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.8%. This was consistent with trends experienced over the past year, Nordstrom said. Meanwhile, online sales were 24% of total net sales, driven by 11% growth at Nordstrom.com and 19% at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Hudson's Bay Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) has booked a drop in comparable sales in what it described as a difficult first-quarter, particularly in the US where the group has experienced lower store traffic across all its banners.

Earnings in the period dropped to $71m from $115m last year, while gross margin narrowed to 38.1% from 39.1% in the prior year period. Sales totalled $5.34bn, a drop of 7.5% on sales of $5.77bn in the same period last year, reflecting, in part, store closures. Comparable sales on an owned basis were down 5.2%.

Earnings were up 14% to US$66m from $58m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 83 basis points to 36.4%. Sales, meanwhile, were down 3.2% to $3.84bn.

Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%.

Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions. Sales for the activewear and international segments increased, while sales decreased as expected for the innerwear segment and manage-for-cash businesses. Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period.

Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record first-quarter net sales of US$543.8m, a 4% increase compared with net sales of $525.1m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

Bought into by Wal-Mart seven years ago in a $2.4 billion deal that gave the world's biggest retailer a foothold in several potentially high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Massmart has struggled with weakening economies and has therefore become more cautious in its expansion policy across the region. The company, which sells everything from food to electronic devices and building materials, said comparable store sales for the first 21 weeks of the 2017 fiscal year fell 1.9 percent, with sales in South Africa down 0.4 percent and outside South Africa down by nearly 16 percent. Sales in South Africa account for 91 percent of total turnover. Shares in the Johannesburg-based company fell 3.5 percent to 114.86 rand, lagging behind a slightly lower JSE Top-40 index . Once at the heart of executives' expansion plans, sub-Saharan Africa growth prospects were dealt a blow in mid 2014 with a fall in the prices of oil and other commodities - export mainstays for many local economies - partly due to a slowdown in demand from leading consumer China. Massmart's chief executive Guy Hayward told a shareholder meeting that the company's performance was also affected by consumers becoming more cautious about spending and after South Africa lost two highly prized investment grade credit ratings last month. "The unfavourable impact on sales in discretionary product categories, such as general merchandise, has been notable and appears to be as strongly linked to weak consumer confidence as it is to underlying economic issues," Hayward said.

Hey, what is that design? It’s called a Moroccan trellis. And it’s everywhere. by Linda Falkenstein May 25, 2017 5:00 AM Back to Search Results RSS Print × Expand Left to right: The Moroccan trellis shows up in porcelain tile from Home Depot, a bunching table from Walmart, a dress from Lands’ End and curtains from JCPenney. You may know it as the lantern design, or “lucky clover” or “Casbah trellis.” If you watch any HGTV shows, get furniture catalogs in the mail, or even have been shopping at Kohl’s recently, you’ve seen it. Perhaps best known as the “Moroccan trellis” or as a variation on a quatrefoil, the pattern is, suddenly, everywhere — from rugs to kitchen backsplashes. “Recently, there’s been an increase in popularity in Moroccan design in general,” says Mark Nelson, associate professor of design studies in the School of Human Ecology at UW-Madison. “People now speak of a ‘Moroccan Style’ that goes beyond this pattern and is applied to entire interiors.” Nelson notes the motif is “sometimes seen as a variation of the Christian quatrefoil pattern, or even a combination of the quatrefoil with the Star of David.” The quatrefoil is an ornamental design of four lobes that somewhat resembles a perfectly symmetrical four-leaf clover, without a stem. (Why Christian? Its quadrants are said to represent Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.) It’s rounder than the Moroccan trellis shape, which usually features triangular points somewhere — between the lobes, or replacing them at the top and bottom (noon and 6) to create more of an onion or minaret shape, or on either side to make something more similar to a badge. But there are infinite variations, with the shape sometimes stretched vertically or horizontally, fatter or thinner widths to the spaces between the repetitions, and designs placed within the shape itself. Karina Cutler-Lake, associate professor of art at UW-Oshkosh, thinks the current popularity of the pattern “has a lot to do with how it can function within a variety of styles. It appeals to those who like a clean, geometric, modern look while at the same time speaking to those who favor the more ornamental and baroque styles of the past.” Doug Zander of Zander’s Interiors on Monroe Street points to this style of ornamental motif (and almost paisley-like prints becoming more popular in fabrics) gaining popularity because they’re complementary to the elements of rustic chic — barnboards, vertical wooden siding and broken stone flooring — increasingly being used inside houses. The more natural, rustic elements and the colorful patterning are also a reaction to the more austere aspects of modern design popular for the past decade, says Zanders. “These more ethnic patterns go with those elements,” says Zander.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Genesco, Dollar Tree, Abercrombie & Fitch By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 25 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Guess saw earnings fall on soft Americas sales, while Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Genesco  Genesco said its first-quarter performance reflects a number of challenges, many of which were expected, early in the new fiscal year. For the three months ended 29 April, net earnings fell to US$885m from $10.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down, slipping 0.8% to $643m from $649m. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalog sales, decreased 1%, with a 5% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 1% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 10% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 3% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group. Dollar Tree US discount retailer Dollar Tree said it is "extremely pleased" with its first-quarter performance despite net income slipping US$32.2m to $200.5m. Sales meanwhile, increased 4% to $5.29bn from $5.09bn in the prior year period. Same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5%. Gross margin increased to 30.8% compared to 30.6% in the prior year. The improvement was driven primarily by lower merchandise and freight costs, partially offset by higher markdowns. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch has reported a net loss of US$61.7m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $39.6m last year. Gross margin narrowed 130 basis points to 60.3%. Net sales slipped 4% to $661.1m from $685.5m in the year-ago period, while comparable sales were down 3%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel."Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 11% to $286.4m, while Hollister sales were up 3% to $374.7m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 4% to $409.1m in the US, and 3% to $252m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "While we anticipate the second quarter environment to remain promotional, we expect results to improve further in the second half of the year, as we see returns from our strategic investments in marketing and omnichannel." Burlington Stores  Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue increase in the first quarter, booking a 39.6% rise in net income from US$37.5m to $52.4m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 40.9%, while total sales meanwhile, increased 5.0%, or $63.9m, to $1.3bn. This growth was driven by an increase of $65.1m from new and non-comparable stores, as well as a 0.5% increase in comparable store sales. The 0.5% comparable store sales increase was on top of a 4.3% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Sears Holdings  US retail giant Sears Holdings moved to a profit in the quarter, with net income reaching US$244m, compared to net loss of $471m in the year-ago period. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.6%, while net revenues fell to $4.3bn from $5.4bn last year. Sears said the year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily driven by having fewer Kmart and Sears full-line stores in operation, which accounted for $557m of the decline, as well as an 11.9% decline in comparable store sales during the quarter, which accounted for $417m. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing. We recognise that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25bn restructuring program." PVH Corp Apparel giant PVH Corp has increased its earnings guidance for the year after its first-quarter earnings exceeded guidance, and despite a 69.7% drop in net income to US$70.1m from $231.6m in the year-ago period. For the quarter ended 30 April, revenue increased 4% to $1.9bn from $1.82bn last year. PVH's Tommy Hilfiger business recorded the highest growth at 6% to $842m, while Calvin Klein revenue was not far behind, up 5% to $756m, compared to the prior year period, which includes a reduction of about $15m resulting from the November 2016 deconsolidation of the company's Calvin Klein business in Mexico. Meanwhile, revenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter decreased 3% to $391m, principally resulting from a planned shift in the timing of shipments from the first quarter into the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. CEO Emanuel Chirico said: "Our first quarter performance underscored the power of our diversified business model and the strength in our international businesses. We believe that our brands, led by  Calvin Klein and  Tommy Hilfiger, continue to resonate with consumers and are gaining market share against our competition. As the global retail environment shifts, we continue to focus on adapting to change, while investing in our brands and operating platforms to capitalise on the opportunities for each of our businesses." Shoe Carnival Shoe Carnival saw earnings and sales slip in the first quarter, compared to last year, as net income fell to US$8.2m from $10.7m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin narrowed to 28.5% from 29%, while net sales dropped 2.7% to $253.4m from $260.5m last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.9%. CEO Cliff Sifford said: "Looking forward, our consistently strong financial position provides the financial flexibility to support our future strategies and further enhance shareholder value over time as a result of our dividend and share repurchase programs." Guess US fashion retailer Guess has booked a drop in first-quarter sales on the back of a soft performance in the Americas where the company is looking to shrink its footprint and improve profitability. Group earnings fell to US$21.3m from $25.2m a year earlier, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 31.5% from 31.8%. Net revenues finished at the high-end of expectations, reaching $458.6m from $448.8m. In Europe and in Asia, sales were up 23% and 17%, respectively, driven by new store openings and positive comp sales. In the Americas, sales were down 14.9%. Chico's Chico's said it remains "steadfast" in in executing against its strategic plan to increase profitable sales and long-term earnings after booking a mixed first-quarter. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net income increased to US$33.62m from $31.08m in the year-ago period, while gross margin narrowed slightly to 40.7% from 40.8%. Sales meanwhile, slipped 9.2% to $583.7m compared to $643m last year. The company said the fall primarily reflects a decline in comparable sales of 8.7%, driven by lower average dollar sale and a decline in transaction count. Tilly's Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's said its initiatives are gaining traction, as it narrowed its net loss to US$0.2m from $2.7m. Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.2% from 27.1% last year, primarily due to an 80 basis point reduction in buying, distribution and occupancy costs, offset by a 70 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns. Total sales edged up 0.6% to $120.9m, while comparable sales were also up by 0.6% compared to a 4.1% decline in the same period last year. DSW DWS said sales were challenging in the first quarter, but trends did improve with comps turning positive in April. For the thirteen weeks ended 29 April, net sales increased 1.4% to US$691.1m from $681.3m in the year-ago period, including $22.3m of revenues from Ebuys. Comparable sales decreased 3% compared to last year's 1.6% slip. Net income meanwhile, slipped to $23m compared to $30m last year. Gross margin decreased 180 bps to 28.2% from 30%, driven by planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys, offset by disciplined markdown management and favourable sourcing costs. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "As expected, planned clearance activity and the addition of Ebuys drove lower gross margin and operating income. The investments we have made in our digital capabilities, such as our redesigned website and mobile app, drove robust growth in digital demand. We are intently focused on driving sequential top line improvements through key product and customer initiatives while balancing strategic investments with disciplined expense management." New York & Co New York & Co has booked first-quarter results in line with company expectations thanks to celebrity collaborations, a double-digit percentage increase in e-commerce sales and strong gross margin expansion to its highest level in the first quarter since 2008. Net losses narrowed to US$4.2m from $5.7m a year earlier, while gross margin improved 300 basis points to 30.7%. Net sales, however, dropped to $209.9m, a decline of 2.9% from $216m in the prior year, reflecting growth in e-commerce, offset by decreases in brick-and-mortar stores due to the combination of a lower store count (463 this year versus 488 last year) and a 0.7% drop in comparable store sales. JC Penney Retail giant JC Penney said it saw an improvement in women's apparel, despite widening its net loss to US$180m in the first quarter, compared to net loss of $68m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3 %, positively impacted by improved selling margins throughout the quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth in the company's online and major appliance businesses. Net sales meanwhile, slipped 3.7% to $2.7bn from $2.8bn last year. Comparable store sales were down 3.5% for the quarter. CEO Marvin Ellison, said: "We continue to make encouraging progress in the company's competitive and financial position despite our top-line performance during the first quarter. While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February." Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn.

The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively.

Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period.

By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands."

Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions. Sales for the activewear and international segments increased, while sales decreased as expected for the innerwear segment and manage-for-cash businesses. Hanes has also launched a multiyear initiative to increase investment for growth, reduce costs, and drive cash flow. Project Booster, is expected to drive the company's Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash business strategy and is expected to generate about $100m in annualised net cost savings, and $300m of incremental annual net cash from operations after annualised growth reinvestment of $50m. The company has also recently announced the departure of CFO Richard Moss who will retire at the end of 2017. Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period. Brand revenue at Vans was up 5% and by 6% at The North Face., but fell 5% at Timberland. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record first-quarter net sales of US$543.8m, a 4% increase compared with net sales of $525.1m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

News “Cash Me Outside” Teen Danielle Bregoli Threatens To Sue Walmart For Ripping Catchphrase by admin — May 25, 2017 In what became a viral video, Danielle Bregoli was mocked for her rebellious antics during an episode of the Dr. Phil show. Bregoli, who is only 14 years old, has used her notorious status to her advantage and has acquired an entourage, as well as shot a video. Popularizing the phrase, “Cash me ousside, how bout dat” when talking to her mother and the Dr. Phil show audience to elicit a fight, Bregoli has now turned from clueless in the public eye to oddly famous. Refinery29 reports that Bregoli is receiving an MTV Movie & Television award nomination for her Dr. Phil appearance and subsequent fame. Her nomination will be under the new category of “Trending,” which the MTV press release states that it “will commend some of the greatest viral moments in movies and television from the past year,” and is presented by Time Inc.’s INSTANT, which is “a social-first media outlet dedicated to covering the lives and projects of the Internet famous.” Refinery29 finds this praise for Bregoli counterproductive, as the Internet first discovered her being extremely disrespectful to her mother and other adults, but now she is being rewarded for it. Now, it feels “icky and exploitative on both sides of the nomination.” Grocery and clothing store powerhouse Walmart has also decided to cash-in on the fame, as they are now displaying apparel with the phrase printed on it for sale. TMZ reports that this has drawn the ire of Bregoli, as she does not feel that they should profit from her catchphrase. As a result, her legal team has issued a letter to the retail store, demanding them to pull all articles of clothing related to her infamous phrase from the shelves within the next five days. If this does not happen, Bregoli’s legal team has threatened a lawsuit to commence. To add to the saga, her legal team also is demanding Walmart to disclose the earnings so far from the apparel that has already been sold. #gossip #TMZ Danielle Bregoli Threatens to Sue Walmart for Selling ‘Cash Me Outside’ Gear (PHOTO) https://t.co/0NAFbsstgJ pic.twitter.com/E38PAoMCXC Walmart is seemingly taking this claim seriously, as a representative has stated that although he has yet to read the letter, an investigation will take place to make sure that it does not go as far as the courts. Bregoli and her team want to make sure that only she is profiting from her phrase, and are willing to take on any company who tries to make an earning, no matter how big or small. Bregoli is continuing her media fame, as she has recently been a celebrity fashion critic on social media. She has also been a part of fashion shoots, looking to expand her popularity even further. 0-100 real quick ???????????????????? pic.twitter.com/wHJvNP99IO — Danielle Bregoli (@TheBhadBhabie) April 29, 2017 Interestingly, Bregoli is amassing a sizable following, as people are showing her support for her current endeavors. Her fans on social media were posting their thoughts on how she should have been invited to the 2017 Met Gala, which is a fundraising gala for the benefit of the Costume Institute section of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This gala has been an active event for over 70 years, and the 2017 Honorary Event Day Chairs were Katy Perry and Pharrell Willaims. On social media, Bregoli and her followers are sending out campaigns to hit a certain amount of subscribers. As of the beginning of May, she now has over 250,000 followers on Twitter, and counting. Thankfully, Bregoli does not promote negativity exclusively on her social media, as she recently posted a funny video of her running out to her electric toy car – since she is not old enough to get a driver’s license – and driving a very short distance to her mailbox to grab a lollipop. — Danielle Bregoli (@TheBhadBhabie) April 30, 2017 [Featured Image By Danielle Bregoli/Facebook] Share this post Tweet Author: admin Visit Author: All Posts Comments are closed.

It was a normal trip to the grocery store for Eva Hicks until she turned down the medicine aisle. “I encountered this lady that was on my way and I asked her politely, you know, if I could pass, and I said, ‘Excuse me,’ and she was being very hateful, immediately,” Hicks said. The confrontation was caught on camera. Woman: Get out of here. Eva Hicks: No I’m not going to get out of here. Woman: Go back to Mexico. Eva Hicks: No! No I’m not! Woman: You’re just going to stand here and argue. Eva Hicks: No, because this is my country. Woman: Your country? Eva Hicks: Yes, this is my country. Woman: This is not your country? Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Yes it is, I don’t care. Manager: That’s not true, we do want you here. Woman: We don’t want you here Eva Hicks: Oh yes it is. Manager: That’s not true, we do want you here. Eva Hicks: I don’t care what you want or not. Manager: We do want you here. Woman: Leave me alone. Manager: That’s not true. Woman: Go. Go. Hicks said the incident upset her so much because of her love for the area. “This country has given me so much, so much opportunities for me, for my family, for my kids. It is a beautiful country. This is a free country,” Hicks said. During the incident, several bystanders and a store manager stepped in to defend Hicks. “I felt love. I felt like, yes I belong here. There is no reason for someone to treat me less, just because my skin is different, just because I have an accent, just because I was born in a different country,” Hicks said. The unidentified woman also made comments to another woman who was attempting to help. Shopper: Stop being ignorant Woman: A n***** is calling me ignorant? Hicks said she just wants to put the encounter in the past and wants the best for the other woman. “I just wish her good, it’s really sad to see somebody like that,” Hicks said. The assistant manager did ask the woman to leave the store. They also gave a statement saying, “We value respect for everyone who visits our stores. We have no tolerance for the language or actions of this customer and are proud to see that our assistant manager responded appropriately by asking her to leave the store.”   WHAT OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON: BOTULISM DEATH REPORTED IN NAPA COUNTY 9-YEAR-OLD OAKLAND BOY SHOT WHILE WALKING HIS DOG ON HIS BIRTHDAY  DANVILLE BANK ROBBER WITH FAKE BEARD ID’D AS FORMER COP SAN FRANCISCO STATE BUILDING EVACUATED DUE TO BOMB THREAT PREGNANT SENIOR NOT ALLOWED TO WALK AT GRADUATION TOXICOLOGIST TESTIFIES ON SIERRA LAMAR’S KILLER’S PESTICIDE EXPOSURE MUG SHOT: ‘JOKER’ ARRESTED FOR POINTING GUN AT CARS FATHER OF SUSPECTED MANCHESTER BOMBER SAYS SON IS INNOCENT >> MORE TOP STORIES Share this: Click to email (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Related Posts VIDEO: Thief ‘ghost rides’ to snatch woman’s purse, spends $5k on stolen credit cards VIDEO: 14 killed by storms and flooding in South and Midwest VIDEO: Employees get into brawl at Houston 99-Cents Only store Police: Woman caught switching flour with baby formula Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Hutchinson say free trade ties important to Arkansas BusinessLatest NewsManufacturingTalk Politics by Wesley Brown (wesbrocomm@gmail.com) 1 day ago 221 views  Tags: Arkansas exports 0 SHARES Share Tweet A top executive for Walmart’s international operations expressed deep support for maintaining strong bilateral free trade alliances abroad, advising more than 200 people at an annual luncheon spotlighting the state’s top exporters that there is great opportunity in global trade. Maggie Sans, senior vice president and chief affairs officers for Wal-Mart Stores’ China operations, told the audience at the Arkansas District Export Council’s annual Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade, that the Bentonville retail giant is a “vociferous advocate” for free trade. “Many of you here know Wal-Mart well, and you know everything for us begins with the customers,” said Sans, the keynote speaker. “Around the globe, our goal is to save people money so they can live better.” Sans told the business-friendly crowd at the Governor’s Mansion that since Wal-Mart established its first international presence with a Sam’s Club location in Mexico City, the company is now serving some 260 million customers a week in 28 countries across the globe. Sans said Wal-Mart has the same goal as most Arkansas companies involved in trade overseas. “While our businesses are different in size and scope, we all want the same thing. We want to serve customers well, and we want to run a profitable and sustained business,” Sans said. Sans said as the digital economy has exploded, the service sector has also grown significantly and impacted the company’s foreign investment and trade. She said with inconsistent rules and tariffs in different countries, Wal-Mart has had to navigate many hurdles to get products to market in a cost-effective manner. Sans also noted a recent Kinsey Global Institute estimating that more than $67 trillion in new infrastructure will be necessary over the next 15 years to meet global demand. “The opportunities for American companies doing business will grow with it, and I hope Arkansas businesses can be on the winning side of that growth,” she said. After Sans’ speech, Gov. Asa Hutchinson presented the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade to five Arkansas manufacturers and service providers that contribute to the Arkansas economy through international trade. Before he made the presentations, Hutchinson talked about recognition for Arkansas that came from the Organization for International Investment (OII), which said that in the past five years Arkansas’ foreign direct investment employment growth of 41.5% has doubled the national average. Hutchinson first mentioned the OII recognition during a speech last week at an economic development conference in Pine Bluff that focused on the Arkansas Delta. Maggie Sans, senior vice president and chief affairs officers for Wal-Mart’s operations, speaks at annual luncheon for the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade. “Trade is vitally important for Arkansas. Increasing exports of Arkansas-made and Arkansas-grown products results in two excellent outcomes,” said Hutchinson, who has made several trade missions abroad during his nearly 2-1/2 years in office. “It produces extra capital for companies to invest in their facilities and creates new employment opportunities for Arkansans.” Hutchinson, who plans to make additional trips to Europe and the Far East later this summer, told the audience a story about his interaction with President Donald Trump during a White House visit earlier this year where they discussed global trade. “I made the point to the president that he talked a lot about being tough on global trade, but I wanted to remind (him) that in Arkansas, we’re part of that global marketplace,” Hutchinson said. “Whether it’s rice that we export, or aero-defense products or electrical machinery, exports are so important to us … and I made that point to the president.” Following are some of this year’s winners of the Governor’s Awards for Excellence in Global Trade. • Arkansas Rising Star – Lycus, Ltd., LLC – El Dorado • Advance Technologies & STEM Exporter – Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control – Camden • Small Manufacturer Exporter – Garreco Dental, LLC – Heber Springs • Medium Manufacturer Exporter – AK Industrial Contractors – Searcy • Large Manufacturer Exporter- Cooper Tire & Rubber Company – Texarkana This is the eighth year for the program which is co-sponsored by the Arkansas District Export Council, Arkansas Economic Development Commission, U.S. Commercial Service, and the Arkansas World Trade Center. Council members are appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and actively encourage manufacturers across the state to consider exporting as a realistic opportunity for growth. Judging criteria was based on factors such as most recent percentage of export sales to total sales, growth of export sales over the past three years, the company’s goals and commitments internationally and the number of jobs saved or created due to the company’s export performance if applicable. According to U.S. Commerce Department data, Arkansas’s export shipments of merchandise in 2016 totaled $5.7 billion. Additionally, there are 2,365 companies and almost 50,000 jobs that depend on Arkansas exports. The state’s largest trade partners in 2016 were Canada ($1.2 billion), France ($783 million), Mexico ($686 million) and Japan ($281 million).

The latest effort is with Utah's Powder Mountain, designed as a purpose-built community. This photo is not of author Steve Andrews.               The invite email for the Summit Series said to check in by 4 p.m. but it's 3:45 p.m. and I'm still roughly half an hour away according to my phone's map. It's hard to keep my eyes on the road because I'm passing incredible possibilities for untouched powder lines as I weave through Utah's Ogden Canyon. I had to make an emergency pitstop at Wal-Mart after the timely realization that I never took my underlayers out of the dryer. At least the lightbulb went off before I got to the hill. Surely there has to be some buffer time to allow for late arrivals like myself, considering the majority of the guests for this weekend are flying into Salt Lake City on a Friday.  As I race through Eden — population 600 with only one gas station and no stoplights — I fail to consider that a lack of cell-phone reception prevents me from checking the directions in my email. I remember reading the check-in location is called Bower Lodge, so I speed uphill on Powder Mountain. I ask a few people where to find Bower, only to meet puzzled faces with no idea what I'm talking about. I zigzag my way between lodges with no luck until I finally reach the top where a ski-patrol shack sits at the end of the road. Surely they will know where it is. They are friendly and welcoming, but after telling them my intention to write a story on the changes taking place here, the room goes quiet and they look around at one another. Another patroller remarks: "No comment" while everyone else laughs.  Another one pipes up: "Come back with a bottle of tequila and we'll tell you some stories."  The guy to my left realizes that the lodge in question is the old clubhouse at the golf course back down in the valley. I thank them and speed back down to check in with no time to spare. While weaving back down toward Eden, my first note-to-self is: Fun-looking mountain but at US$40 million they could probably afford a couple of signs. The Summit Series started as an offer for a free ski weekend from a college dropout wanting to fast-track how to become a successful entrepreneur.  Elliot Bisnow and his "dream list" of 19 people has now blossomed into a community of more than 10,000 individuals who converge under the Summit banner several times a year.  According to their website: "Summit creates unique gatherings designed to catalyze entrepreneurship, creative achievement, and global change to create a more joyful world." To put it another way, they produce events that bring together people who want to meet other big-idea people.   Four years ago, the same people crowd-sourced the funds to purchase Powder Mountain and the land that it's built upon. After 10 years as a brand, Summit now has a home as stewards of an old ski resort that bears the oxymoron of being famous for the fact that nobody knows about it. The group intends to develop a town roughly the size of Telluride — at about 180 hectares with a population of about 2,300 — to serve as a hub for innovators, artists, and anyone else who dreams of a better society. But who doesn't, really? Especially when it comes to the jargon we see in developer's marketing collateral. What makes these guys different? Is it possible to balance their lofty ideals with the end goal that all investors will turn a profit? Is the Summit weekend just an elaborately produced effort to attract buyers to a new purpose-built community in which a few investors stand to make a huge pile of money? That's certainly one way to look at it, and even if that were the only motive, it could be a brilliant marketing campaign in mountain-resort real estate. The founders share high ideals and a grand vision that includes creating co-op work spaces, open venues to encourage interaction, and Burning-Man inspired art installations throughout their new town. But Summit's founders aren't from the mountains, they bought into it. Will the fast-paced city mentality influence the mountain community they hope to create? Or can it be the other way around where the landscape and open spaces help these high-profile influencers not take themselves and life too seriously? FIRST STEPS Powder Mountain has operated as a ski resort for more than 45 years. Rising high above Eden, the area is relatively unknown in comparison to nearby Park City and the resorts within the Cottonwood Canyons.  Eden itself is nothing more than a prime example of resort gentrification: large parcels of land subdivided over the past few decades to make room for townhouses that pack in weekenders from Salt Lake City and points beyond. The mountain's 4,000 hectares receive over 12 metres of Utah's famously dry snow yearly; enough to cause most snow-lovers to take notice. But until the latest change of ownership occurred just over three years ago, the local skiers and boarders rejoiced in their well-kept secret of the lack of crowds.It was their biggest asset. Now that Summit is at the helm, there is potential for Powder Mountain to show up on a radar of skiers and non-skiers: their market is the rich, elite city dwellers from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere who are keen to escape their urban habitat and connect with other like-minded individuals here. Summit began 10 years ago on the Utah ski slopes. The then-22-year old Bisnow wanted to connect with bright minds. In 2005 Bisnow and his father founded Bisnow Media, which last year they sold for a reported $50 million. But early on, as a fresh college dropout, Bisnow admittedly was in over his head. "In my quest to just meet other entrepreneurs and get advice I cold-called 20 people that I'd read about," Bisnow said. "I invited Blake (Mycoskie) from TOMS shoes, and Ricky (Van Veen) and Josh (Abramson) who started (the popular video website) Collegehumor. We went skiing in Alta, which is just over an hour from Powder Mountain. I actually paid for the trip on my credit card and got sponsors to cover the costs. And that was the first Summit." That first meeting was so successful that the group decided to meet again six months later — that time inviting a few more friends and business associates. Steadily the word got out of a gathering of like minds across a wide spectrum of industry with the shared assumption that humanity as a whole is greater than the sum of its individuals. The events became more polished and headline speakers included Quentin Tarantino, Erin Brockovich, and Kendrick Lamar. Additionally you can meander between a full slate of activities including yoga, meditation sessions, even arts and crafts: I made a leather bracelet on Sunday afternoon that I'm pretty proud of. Deals were made and companies were born. Over a short time, the Summit events blossomed and became a destination for self-professed visionaries who were keen to interact and rub shoulders with each other. PURCHASING A MOUNTAIN Greg Mauro, Venture capitalist by day and skier by heart, had been looking for a mountain home for some time. His parents owned a house in Aspen, where his love of the mountains was fostered. But by the turn of the millennium, Aspen had morphed into an overwhelming monstrosity of a resort destination that had lost its small-town charm. He tried living in different areas, including Whistler in 2001. Eventually he discovered the relative solitude of Powder Mountain and fell in love. He invited friends to visit, but on the condition that any photos they took or tales of endless powder runs should be misrepresented as Park City in fear this secret would get out. In 2011, the owners put Powder Mountain up for sale. Originally the plan was to develop three golf courses and a town of 10,000, a vision that sounded all too familiar to this Whistlerite. But those owners couldn't cut it. It was the aftermath of the 2008 recession and their vision was dead in the water. Mauro saw the opportunity to make a deal and approached Summit with an out-of-the blue offer. "We flew out the next day," Bisnow said of the response to Mauro's offer. "He (Mauro) said there's this unbelievable 10,000-acre ski area called Powder Mountain. I think we can get in there and buy it for an unbelievable price and could do something really special." As the Summit members and Mauro looked over the expansive Wasatch mountain range and Salt Lake Basin on a site that would eventually become the Sky Lodge, an unexpected alliance formed virtually overnight. Mauro would ensure that the day-to-day operation of the resort was profitable and the Summit team would focus on building a community by attracting buyers through their trademark events.  In 2013 Powder Mountain changed ownership for $40 million with a consortium of young Millennials at the helm — the first time a group from the new generation was in charge of this type of resort development.  To finance the deal, they crowd-funded the purchase and had no trouble raising the money. The new owners produce events, but they didn't know squat about mountain-community development. "We studied about 30 different mountain communities from all over the world," Bisnow said. "We looked at Aspen, Park City, Telluride. We also looked to communities in Europe and even places like SoHo and Windward Walls in Miami." Bisnow's main concern is the ski-resort explosion of "McMansions" and the "era of huge houses."  In an effort to prevent that from happening at Powder Mountain, they are limiting house sizes to 4,500 square feet, with the majority of the homes taking up around 2,500. The ideal is to blend the homes with the natural environment.  And lots are selling like hotcakes, ranging from $225,000 to more than $2 million. WHO BUYS INTO THIS? On this weekend in late January, the candle-lit steps direct us upstairs toward the commotion taking place inside the Timberline Lodge. At 40 years old, it's the closest thing to a historical building on the mountain. I introduce myself to anyone and everyone and in less than half an hour I meet venture capitalists, app-developers, real-estate tycoons, a New York Times columnist, and a famous movie director as we gather at a long-table dinner that encourages a family-style meal among strangers. Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal tells us that the mission "is to inspire entrepreneurs and innovators from different backgrounds." The criteria has always been the same, he says: "Are you innovators of your discipline, regardless of your level or age? And are you nice people who we want to be around, regardless of personal or professional success?" It sounded fairly clichéd to me. Of course, you want to be around the people you are around, nothing profound there. But at the same time it hints at exclusivity: who judges whether or not a candidate is someone they want to be around? And what if that perception changes? Human nature being what it is, what he said sounded nice, but I know that you can't build a community under those pretenses, no matter how hard you try. He also set a few ground rules: No social media content inside the lodges; and no drinking and driving. Through a Cadillac sponsorship the event featured brand-new black Escalades as shuttles to the venues between mountain and valley. Riding in the $100,000 SUV helped me feel special, but it isn't enough for me to want to drink the Kool-Aid. This event took place a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the U.S., a fact that is unavoidable in conversation. To my relief, many here are as dumbfounded as I am at what had happened. Through dozens of discussions I realize this crowd is well-off, but they're not ostentatious. As everyone finds seats at the table, I sit down next to Colin Eckles: He's in his early 30s and made his fortune selling real estate in China. He now splits his time between Los Angeles and Hawaii, and is developing his own community on 200 hectares on Hawaii's big island — a community that will feature biodynamic agriculture and follow permaculture principles. He wants to construct seven buildings to serve as spiritual centres, coinciding with the seven chakras. "I did the tour," he says, referring to the Summit realty team's guided mountain tour. "And I'm in. I bought a lot."   Eckles was not the only person I spoke to over the weekend who purchased a lot after seeing the land and Summit's plans to orchestrate a new community.  Sitting down for a rest at the Sky Lodge on Saturday afternoon, I met a board member of a high-profile sports brand who made the deposit last year and finally pulled the trigger this weekend to secure his lot. "Now I just have to tell my wife," he says with a nervous grin. At prices up to $2 million or more per home site, it is similar to the Sea to Sky market; although this purpose-built community has a collective intention for 'good business.' The people I meet seem to have an earnest desire to grow a community that differs from other mountain towns. Bisnow himself is building a family home where he plans to raise his kids in this exclusive little hub. This is not a pump-and-dump scheme, and the endgame will be — for now — a mountain community in which everyone is from a similar socio-economic background and shares the same modus operandi of getting rich off of really big, successful ideas. Comparisons could be made: Is it a rich-kids' club? Cult-like? Maybe a bit of both. The people running the show regard art, intelligence, and community as their biggest assets, at least on paper. Their plans promise a respect for Mother Nature and the hope to symbiotically coexist and not to conquer. But come on, don't we all buy into this? And haven't we been duped before? What was obviously missing from the weekend was the dirtbags. This was an affluent, educated bunch of people, but they weren't from the mountains. The group was still coated with their veneer from New York or San Francisco, showing that it's easier said than done to take the city out of the city folk. Mountain culture is much different from SoHo or the Mission district and a big indicator of success will be whether this community can adapt to mountain life by not taking itself too seriously. Will they buy a new jacket when it rips after shredding through the trees, or easily fix it with a strip of duct tape? The urban intellectuals have descended upon the mountains, but will these guys rent out one of their rooms to the dishpig in the back of the kitchen working tirelessly at one of their marquee dinners? Where the Summit team will really have to prove itself is in how well they coexist with the third and fourth generation of Weber County locals who call Powder their home mountain; who love it for its lack of outside attention.  After Summit bought Powder Mountain, Facebook comments were quick and dirty: "Just a bunch of trust-a-farian douchebags that are going to ruin the valley. If you like waste, conspicuous consumption, and rich, overprivileged assholes that drive Escalades in $500 worth of couture "winter apparel" that has never seen actual use, by all means keep making these human-shaped bags of spiders more rich by buying lift tickets to their private mountain. To the very last person, they are a complete waste of blood and organs..." After I followed up with the guy who posted that, he had this to say: "I was unfortunate enough to work for Powder Mountain during the buyout, and subsequently walked off the job with most of the food and beverage staff because they fired the long-time F&B (food and beverage) director with no notice, to bring on a Summit kid." That Feeling The frigid morning air stings my face as I step outside the condo, a gorgeous unit that Summit must have rented from a local family. I can only assume the family owns it from the abundance of creepy portraits where everyone wears the same outfit. The clear blue sky is accentuated with a purple alpenglow sunrise on the eastern hillsides, beckoning all the early-birds who had the discipline to get home at a reasonable hour last night. I run into my new buddy Eckles and we head up the lift. It hasn't snowed for more than five days so I'm not hopeful of finding fresh powder. Yet Powder Mountain's slogan is: Preserving the Powder. There are still countless untracked lines right next to the lift that opened only today. The policies here differ from other resorts: They don't open every lift immediately, which ensures they can still open new terrain in between storms; and they cap day-ticket sales at 2,000 a day. Yes — so across this 4,000-hectare terrain, it means there is always plenty of untracked snow for everyone, even five days after the last storm. For an extra fee of $18 you can take a snowcat up Lightning Ridge toward James Peak for some of the longest off-piste freeride terrain in Utah — something I see as a selling point but may be deemed as extreme by most. The terrain can't hold a candle to what we have in the Coast Mountains, but to be fair, not much can. If Summit is true to its slogan and wants to preserve powder, my main wish would be to save these incredible runs for those who really work for it. Although tracks are present in the trees, the most difficult lines are still fresh for me to leisurely shralp without the pressure to go, go, go like I do at home. Whether hiking, taking a cat or bus, or just eyeing good runs from the lift, there is enough terrain to keep me interested. I find challenging, yet easy-access lines that would have been tracked out at resorts with a bigger scene. This is not an advanced group of skiers and boarders attending this weekend, and for the majority the rolling terrain is more than enough to satisfy. But the Paradise chair was ripe with enough cliffs and pillows to keep even the most discerning powder hound content until the closing bell. It gives me a sense of privacy and solitude that I haven't felt at a ski resort, and it is enough for me to consider that if I were wealthy enough to buy a lot, I would also see a return beyond the financial. I'd be one of the best skiers or boarders on the mountain and would have my pick of challenging terrain without fear of it getting tracked out. My riding partner and I differ greatly in ability but it doesn't matter. Part of the magic of snow sports is the ability to choose your own line and meet up at the bottom of the pitch. As I learn more about Eckles and his past I see how much this trip means to him: He tells me of his high-stress, high-stakes real-estate ventures and the resulting epiphany that life is not all about money. I admire his altruistic intentions for his own development plans, which give me a bit of reassurance that I chose the right path for myself by neglecting the city life and opting to live in the mountains. Like most of us, we come alive when we are given the freedom to creatively express our movement in nature. It's a decidedly first-world luxury that does have its purpose: it helps us lighten up and be present.  The world certainly needs more of that. As much fun as it is to make a new friend, the urge to push myself is too great and I split with Eckles to find some more challenging terrain. I find it in Powder Country, a zone that has no lift at the bottom but instead has a bus that takes you up the canyon back into the resort. Deep snow, a steep pitch, and a few drops are enough to satisfy my craving before heading back into the Sky Lodge for lunch. Steve Andrews was a guest of the Summit Group. He really enjoyed the buffets, free beer, meeting amazing people, and exploring those untracked lines. But for the price tag of $1 million to $2 million, he would put his lessons learned at Summit toward building his own mountain utopia somewhere up north.

But the start of construction could change based on the length of the permitting process, which is now ongoing for the site at the intersection of South 74th Street and Illinois 15, according to a project manager. On Thursday night, the Belleville Zoning Board of Appeals unanimously approved five requests from Walmart, including one for a liquor permit. The board is tasked with giving a recommendation to the City Council, which has the final decision on whether to approve the requests. Aldermen will hear the Walmart requests June 5. The site is already zoned commercial, but the zoning board is still required to hear variance requests. Here’s a rundown of the other variances approved by the zoning panel: ▪  Walmart plans to have a 10-foot fence around the bale and pallet enclosure and the trash compactor enclosure. City code limits fences to 7 feet high. ▪  The store wants the parking lot aisles to be 24 feet wide instead of the 25 feet required by code. Parking lot spaces will be 19 feet long. ▪  Walmart is asking that the combined square footage of eight various signs on the property facing Illinois 15 be allowed to have a total of 638 square feet, which would be 338 square feet over the “cap” required by code. Rick Rohlfing, a project manager with BFA Engineering in Washington, Mo., told the zoning board that the store will have a place for shoppers to drive up and have someone load the groceries they ordered online. Walmart also plans to build a gas station at the front of the parking lot. “We’ve been working on this project for quite some time now,” Rohlfing told the panel. He said one of the challenges for the project is that the site is undermined. Research is ongoing as to how to mitigate the undermining. The Walmart Supercenter on the east side of Belleville was built on a site that was undermined, but the old coal mines were filled before the store off Carlyle Avenue opened about 10 years ago. Shoppers will enter the west Belleville store off South 74th Street. Direct access from Illinois 15 will not be allowed. No one from the public spoke against the Walmart requests. Also, Walmart has not asked for tax incentives from Belleville for this store, although the city granted tax incentives for the Green Mount Commons shopping center that includes Walmart.

Carmen Ponder tells KXAS-TV that Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews had her arrested Saturday after a confrontation that led to him directing a racial and sexist slur at her. Ponder said she passed a truck and pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot. The truck pulled up beside hers and the passenger, who she believes to have been Crews, said he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter to drive. He berated Ponder for passing him, then called her a "black b----" when she told him it was illegal. Her attorney, Lee Merritt, said she entered the store and when she emerged, several officers in plain clothes confronted her and demanded that she apologize to the chief. When she refused, she was arrested for evading arrest, handcuffed and jailed for 24 hours.

Pelosi: Democrats Will Immediately Pass $15 Minimum Wage If They Take House Sanders, Mulvaney Have Heated Exchange Over Trump Budget Share Tweet Email BY: Charles Fain Lehman Follow @CharlesFLehman May 25, 2017 3:08 pm Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Thursday found themselves in a heated clash over the White House's budget proposal. The two interrupted each other and raised their voices during a Senate Budget Committee hearing, the Hill reports. Sanders initially focused on the budget's repeal of the estate tax, which he claimed would give massive tax breaks to the nation's wealthy, estimating the Trump family would save $4 billion and the Walton family of Wal-Mart would save $52 billion. Sanders contrasted this tax break with those who would lose federal food and welfare subsidies under the budget. Sanders also objected to Republican attacks on Republican-appointed Congressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall. Mulvaney started to respond to Sanders's concerns about Hall, but the Vermont Senator cut him off. "Your opinion is that the results are terrible, I’m suggesting that it was a member of the Trump administration who appointed this gentleman," Sanders said. "So we can agree that the CBO puts out bad data," Mulvaney said. "No, we can’t. We can agree that you guys are beating up on a man you appointed because you don’t like his results," Sanders said. The two fought over federal funding for the Meals on Wheels program, before returning to Sanders's central concern: the claimed $52 billion tax break for the ultra-wealthy Walton family. Mulvaney attempted to respond that the tax repeal was part of the overall replacement of ObamaCare. But Sanders wasn't satisfied. "Ordinary people are paying more," Mulvaney said. "No, ordinary people don’t have $128 billion," Sanders interjected. "You’re not answering the question. Answer the question!" At this point, concerns over healthcare arose. "We don’t cut Medicaid. We’re talking about ObamaCare repeal," Mulvaney said. "Which throws 23 million people off health insurance!" Sanders said. "We’re talking about a CBO number that I think you just agreed could be wrong," Mulvaney said. Sanders denied that he had agreed. In the end, the back-and-forth was ended by the expiration of Sanders's time. Before the clock was up, the two agreed on at least one thing: everyone will die eventually.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman May 1 – 7: Bristol’s Weekly Traffic Alert BRISTOL – In an effort to keep motorists informed, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) provides weekly information about highway construction and maintenance projects in southwestern Virginia.

Ariel Edelman When Ahmed Badr was 8 years old, his family's home in Baghdad was bombed in the midst of the Iraq War. The family was uninjured. They moved to Syria, which was peaceful then, and in 2008, they came to the U.S. as refugees. U.S. In 'Long War,' Iraq And Afghanistan Vets And Refugees Tell Their Stories Writing helps Badr deal with what he's been through, and he wants to give other young people the same outlet. Now a student at Wesleyan University, Badr founded the website Narratio to empower others to tell their stories. Badr used writing to figure out what it meant to be an Iraqi-American kid. His life had dramatically changed since coming to the U.S. — in Baghdad, his parents were civil engineers; in the U.S., they worked minimum wage jobs at Home Depot and Wal-Mart. Overtime, Badr realized that writing on his personal blog helped other people understand who he was and where he came from.

They came to the U.S. as refugees in 2008, and Badr used writing to understand his experience. Courtesy of the Badr family "There was this feeling of empowerment that was just overnight, all of sudden people were interested in my story," Badr says. "... And so with that in mind, two years passed, and I thought, 'OK, well this was great, but this is only helping me. This is only helping my own expression. So how about I take that feeling and that space that I created for myself and turn it into something that allows youth, refugee or otherwise, all over the world to do the same exact thing.' " So Badr created Narratio, where young people from around the world submit poems, essays and stories. Badr curates them, and he's expanded the program into workshops to help young people learn how to express themselves. Badr tells NPR's Ari Shapiro they are looking for pieces with a theme of empowerment. "You're telling your story. You're expressing yourself through your own experience, and it's very very hard to dispute that," he says. "It's very hard to denounce someone's own personal experience. I think that's something that's incredibly beautiful about storytelling is that storytelling doesn't have to be divisive. Storytelling is meant to bring people together."

He says he feels personally responsible to give Iraqi youth — 18 million of whom are younger than 19 — an outlet to express themselves. "I want to be able to turn that guilty feeling that I had when my cousins asked me, 'What are you up to?' into a responsibility ... and make it possible for them to be able to answer that question as freely as they would like to," he says.

The bill would increase the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25, to $15 by 2024, and tie future increases to the median wage growth. It would also gradually eliminate the current exception to the minimum wage for tipped workers. "Just a few short years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was 'radical,'" Sanders said. "Our job in the wealthiest country in the history of the world is to make sure that every worker has at least a modest and decent standard of living."

Sanders kicked off the hearing by charging that the budget's repeal of the estate tax would give massive breaks to the country's wealthiest families -- including President Trump's family, which he estimated would save $4 billion, and the Walton family of Walmart fame, which he said would save $52 billion. Sanders asked Mulvaney to explain why America's richest family needs a $52 billion tax break, while people who rely on programs such as Meals on Wheels and Medicaid would be left out in the cold under Trump's budget. He also expressed anger that Republicans were impugning the work of Congressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall, even though he was appointed by Republicans.

The survey shows that 76 percent of respondents want U.S. leaders to focus on policies that help Americans while a similar majority -- 75 percent -- say the United States must remain part of the U.N. and other international groups to protect against policies that could cost manufacturing jobs here, according to the data compiled by Morning Consult. The Hill's Vicki Needham has more about the survey here: http://bit.ly/2qSGxG4 OPEC to extend oil production cuts: OPEC agreed on Thursday to extend its oil production limits for at least the next nine months as a way to ensure higher crude prices. Delegates at an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) gathering in Vienna decided to maintain the production cuts they initially implemented late last year, Reuters reports. Members of the 13-country organization, as well as a dozen non-members including Russia, will likely abide by the output limits, according to Reuters. OPEC initially decided to cut production levels last December, when a sustained global supply glut and increasing production from non-OPEC members -- including the United States -- caused oil prices to sag. A barrel of crude oil cost over $100 in July 2014; by February 2016, the price briefly dipped below $27. The December agreement -- when OPEC producers decided to cut output by 3.7 percent, to 32.5 million barrels per day -- was the first production limit instituted by OPEC since 2008. In the months that followed, prices rose to over $58 per barrel.

Ponder, 23, alleged that she was driving to a local Walmart on Saturday when an erratic driver cut in front of her. To avoid an accident, Ponder said she passed the truck and turned into the store parking lot. The vehicle followed her and Crews, who was a passenger, allegedly got out and began cursing at her. “He screamed that he was teaching his 14-year-old how to drive and I shouldn’t have drove around her,” she said on Twitter. “I kept my window up and ignored him.” According to Ponder, she headed into the store as Crews kept berating her and shouting expletives. “He continued yelling and cussing me out and I finally turned around and said ‘it’s illegal’ when he kept saying it was a 14-year-old driving,” Ponder said. “Thats when he screamed ‘oh whatever you back b-tch!'” Police brutality and Abuse of Power from a Police Chief. Let me talk to my lawyer and I’ll fill y’all in #blacklivesmatter — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 22, 2017 When she returned from making a purchase, the pageant winner said there were cops out of uniform waiting for her. “One of them shoved his badge in her face, told her that she ‘Better apologize to the police chief,’ but my client declined to do so,” Ponder’s attorney Lee Merritt told DFW-TV. Ponder was handcuffed, taken into custody and charged with evading arrest. According to Merritt, his client was left with bruises from being detained. The City of Commerce said that Crews has been placed on administrative leave while the incident is under investigation.

Ariel Edelman When Ahmed Badr was 8 years old, his family's home in Baghdad was bombed in the midst of the Iraq War. The family was uninjured. They moved to Syria, which was peaceful then, and in 2008, they came to the U.S. as refugees. U.S. In 'Long War,' Iraq And Afghanistan Vets And Refugees Tell Their Stories Writing helps Badr deal with what he's been through, and he wants to give other young people the same outlet. Now a student at Wesleyan University, Badr founded the website Narratio to empower others to tell their stories. Badr used writing to figure out what it meant to be an Iraqi-American kid. His life had dramatically changed since coming to the U.S. — in Baghdad, his parents were civil engineers; in the U.S., they worked minimum wage jobs at Home Depot and Wal-Mart. Overtime, Badr realized that writing on his personal blog helped other people understand who he was and where he came from.

They came to the U.S. as refugees in 2008, and Badr used writing to understand his experience. Courtesy of the Badr family "There was this feeling of empowerment that was just overnight, all of sudden people were interested in my story," Badr says. "... And so with that in mind, two years passed, and I thought, 'OK, well this was great, but this is only helping me. This is only helping my own expression. So how about I take that feeling and that space that I created for myself and turn it into something that allows youth, refugee or otherwise, all over the world to do the same exact thing.' " So Badr created Narratio, where young people from around the world submit poems, essays and stories. Badr curates them, and he's expanded the program into workshops to help young people learn how to express themselves. Badr tells NPR's Ari Shapiro they are looking for pieces with a theme of empowerment. "You're telling your story. You're expressing yourself through your own experience, and it's very very hard to dispute that," he says. "It's very hard to denounce someone's own personal experience. I think that's something that's incredibly beautiful about storytelling is that storytelling doesn't have to be divisive. Storytelling is meant to bring people together."

He says he feels personally responsible to give Iraqi youth — 18 million of whom are younger than 19 — an outlet to express themselves. "I want to be able to turn that guilty feeling that I had when my cousins asked me, 'What are you up to?' into a responsibility ... and make it possible for them to be able to answer that question as freely as they would like to," he says. "And so, if I can do that by giving them a website that they can share their stories on, that's a step in the right direction." refugees Iraq war Iraq Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1" />

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter declared on Bloomberg TV: "The guy isn't qualified. I don't know how to say that more clearly."   Now, the blunt-speaking analyst admitted in an email to CBS MoneyWatch: "I underestimated him." Pachter wasn't alone. Shares of the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer leaped 21.5 percent today, or $10.83, to close at $61.25, after it reported quarterly earnings that far exceeded Wall Street's expectations. That puts the stock price at an all-time high, and the jump made Best Buy the day's top performer among the S&P 500.

Revenue rose 1 percent to $8.53 billion, topping estimates of $8.28 billion, helped by strong performance in video games and mobile phones. Comparable store sales, a key retail metric measuring activity at stores open a year or more, rose 1.6 percent, better than the decline analysts had expected. Online sales soared 22 percent. "There are earnings beats, and then there are uber earnings beats," said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst with Loop Capital Markets, who rates Best Buy as a "buy." "This was an eye-opening quarter, no question about that." Other retailers, including Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD), have reported better-than-expected quarterly results. And off-price shops such as Ross Stores (ROST) that appeal to shoppers interested in the "treasure hunt" for deals are also holding their own against online rivals. But chains that are based in malls, like Macy's (M), continue to struggle and shutter underperforming locations as consumers shift their spending online.  Boosting Best Buy's results was the popularity of Nintendo's (NTDOY) new Switch gaming system, Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 smartphone and the unlimited data plans that wireless companies sell at Best Buy.  The chain also is benefiting from Joly's decision back in 2012 to match prices from Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals. At the time, Joly was trying to combat "showrooming," the practice of consumers going to a brick-and-mortar store to see a product and then buy it online at a lower price. Play Video CBS This Morning Why Sears is facing financial troubles Sears Holdings, the parent company of Sears and K-Mart, is facing financial struggles. Shares of the company's stock fell more than 12 percent We... "I remember when he first got there, the talking heads on the CNBCs of the world saying this is the next Circuit City" (which went bankrupt in 2008), said Chukumba. "This isn't even close to the next Circuit City." For one thing, Best Buy is much better managed and has far greater scale than either Circuit City or HHGregg, another consumer-electronics chain that foundered. Last month it announced that it's going out business after failing to find a buyer. "HHgregg made some poor decisions over the years," Chukumba said, adding that the chain employed a "commissioned sales force, which consumers were just not comfortable with." Best Buy is adding new services such as Best Buy Smart Home where in-store experts will help customers select from products such as smart locks, lights and thermostats that will be in 400 stores by the December holidays. It also began selling smart nurseries (including "wireless-enabled monitors, thermometers and a changing pad/scale, plus other innovative essentials," according to the website) in the quarter. And it expanded its test of 24/7 tech support for any device a customer owns regardless of whether it was purchased at the chain. Best Buy can't afford to rest on its laurels. As Chukumba noted, electronics is a "tough business," with products that "become more and more obsolete by the day." Mindful of these challenges, the retailer announced plans to save $600 million by the end of fiscal 2021.  Pachter, however, remains skeptical about Best Buy's long-term future, noting that the HHGregg bankruptcy and the struggles at Sears (SHLD) are giving Best Buy's sales a temporary boost. He rates the stock as "underperform." "That isn't sustainable, and they should return to declining sales again next year," he said. "Yes, they're doing much better on cost controls and share buybacks than I expected, but they're a melting ice cube." © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Sears shares surging just two months after warning it may not be around. The struggling retailing icon posted its first quarterly profit in nearly two years. But it wasn't due to sales, which continued their years-long decline. It made money by cutting costs and selling its Craftsman tools brand for over half a billion dollars. Sears was once the largest U.S. retailer. But it has been struggling amid rising competition from Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. In March its stock got hammered after it warned about its ability to continue as a "going concern" following years of losses and shrinking sales. Sears' drive to bounce back comes amid a retail wreck. Quarterly same store sales have fallen at traditional chains like Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney. In addition to facing online competition, a potential tax on imported goods could slam retailers. U.S. Bank portfolio manager Eric Wiegand: SOUNDBITE: ERIC WIEGAND, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, U.S. BANK, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Certainly one of the big issues confronting retailers and their stocks as well beyond the actual economic results will be what transpires as far as tax reform is concerned. This whole border adjustment tax can have a profound impact on the retail space." On Thursday, Sears shares catapulted as much as 33 percent - on course for their best one-day gain in more than two years. The retailer has been closing stores and cutting jobs in a bid to cut costs and turn around the company.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman War of The Worlds Movie Set in Victorian Era Now Available in the UK and Throughout The World on DVD! “”War of the Worlds The True Story is clever like Wells. Hugely inventive and ambitious…packed with a truly impressive — and clever — mix of editing (a reported 3 1/2 years’ worth), special effects, visual artistry and offbeat storytelling.” – Los Ang” As the BBC prepares its new period set version of War of the Worlds scheduled to go into production a year from now, there is a proper period version set in the Victorian era with rave reviews available for viewing now. What if the Earth/Mars battle from H.G. Wells’ classic novel The War of the Worlds wasn’t fiction but actually fact? That’s the story of Timothy Hines’ WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY, contender in the 85th Academy Award Oscars, including consideration for best adapted screenplay, best editing and best original score. Like the famous 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast that caused Americans to believe an actual invasion was in progress, the movie assumes an Earth/Mars War actually occurred in the year 1900 and is presented as the eyewitness memoir of journalist Bertie Wells, the last living survivor as he struggles to find his wife amidst the destruction of humankind at the hands of terrifying alien invaders. Created by Timothy Hines (10 Days in a Madhouse, Chrome – the miniseries, due out September 7, 2017) and his producing partners, Susan Goforth and Donovan Le, WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY is now available in the UK, EU, GERMANY and throughout the world in all regions on DVD. Years before Spielberg’s production of War of the Worlds, in 2001, Hines was in the works with a large budget movie of the H.G. Wells story. With a budget of $42 million and with Charlize Theron and Michael Caine planned to star, the movie was abruptly halted along with a slew of action driven Hollywood pictures when the 9-11 terrorist attack in the US occurred. Following the shutdown, Hines, Goforth and Le spent years remounting the movie. In 2005 unscrupulous distributors released his rough cut to WalMart before he was finished to beat the Spielberg version. Hines says, “It was disastrous and I was metaphorically pelted with stones by fans and critics.”  Undaunted, six years later the movie was finished. Hines was finally able to triumphantly bring the Victorian epic version of the H.G. Wells classic to the screen. The result was the ambitious, breathtaking movie, WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY. Having played in theaters across the United States to fan raves, critics’ praise, and qualifying as an Oscar contender for the 85th Academy Awards. You can purchase your copy here: http://www.thewaroftheworldsmovie.net/  The streaming version is available in the US now through Amazon and is being prepared by Amazon to be released in the UK and EU in August. [embedded content] Video Link: http://www.youtube.com/embed/dp7-XtVbeyk Ain’t It Cool News critic Ambush Bug raved, “The best film I had the privilege of seeing this week was WAR OF THE WORLDS: THE TRUE STORY.” With glowing praise, he went on to say things such as, “Even the sci-fi effects feel authentic with all of the shaky and grainy camerawork. I especially loved watching the attacks of both the aliens and the giant machines…Everything is treated with a serious and dire tone and there’s even a touching love story in the middle of it all as well to add an extra bit of depth that, coming from the narrator’s POV, will definitely make your heart swell.” Ain’t It Cool News critic then summed it up by saying, “WAR OF THE WORLDS: THE TRUE STORY is one of the coolest little films I’ve come across in quite a while. As if the Orson Welles radio broadcast wasn’t mythic enough, along comes this mock-doc to add a whole new layer of intrigue to H.G. Wells’ fascinating story. Highly recommended to those who love revisionist history, alien invasion films, and thrilling real life documentaries.”  Critic Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said, “’War of the Worlds The True Story is clever like Wells. Hugely inventive and ambitious, a mock sci-fi docudrama packed with a truly impressive — and clever — mix of editing (a reported 3 1/2 years’ worth), special effects, visual artistry and offbeat storytelling.”  Frank Scheck, critic of The Hollywood Reporter called the movie, “Impressive for its technical achievements…Director/Editor Hines weaves the various styles of footage together in expert fashion.” “Ever since the 1953 movie adaptation of War Of The Worlds there have been numerous other translations of Wells’ novel, even a 1988 short lived TV series, but of all the ones I have seen the only two—yes, only two—I find worthy of repeated viewings is the ’53 film and this new 2013 docudrama.” – Shawn Francis, You Won Cannes  Steven Rose Jr. of the Sacramento Examiner gave the movie 5 out of 5 stars and said, “’The True Story’ carries the suspense and drama of both the 1953 movie and Spielberg’s 2005 version but in a more realistic manner through its documentary style.” “The aliens are unsettling, with bright, evil eyes and writhing tentacles. The designs of the tripods and the aliens are much truer to the book than other versions,” said reviewer Tristan Hiegler of the PT Leader “I loved this movie…it’s the ultimate ‘what if?’ movie…Buy it, watch it, and relive the classic. You won’t be sorry!” – Dave Reneke, ASTRO SPACE NEWS Australia’s #1 Astronomy News Service. The movie review site Apocalypse Later lavishes raves for WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY, a movie that competed in the 85th Academy Awards and has gained critical acclaim from critics and movie audiences.  Critic Hal C F Astell for the review site Apocalypse Later said, “Critics hear the word ‘journey’ a lot and it doesn’t usually mean much, but here it’s quite clearly about as appropriate as it gets.” And “It’s a tribute to the dedication of Hines and his more honest and loyal partners that War of the Worlds: The True Story was even started, let alone finished and released to critical acclaim. A worthy movie that stayed true to Wells’s original vision is a task perhaps best left to masochists, but Hines stuck it out and it clearly paid off.” Critic Astell went on to compare the movie to delicious desert and fun events, ”I love that idea enough that it isn’t just strawberries, it’s strawberries with cream, served during Wimbledon.” He discussed the large scope of the picture, “Destruction on a scale that even Spielberg can’t compete with.” His review talked about the technical aspects of WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY, “That rapid editing does its best to move everything along and wash over us like a visual overdose. Impeccable technical work that went on to make this seem like authentic footage. Watch this and you’ll swear that there were tripods in World War I…To say the stock footage is well integrated is understating the case. The slavish devotion to detail is admirable and it pays off. Military historians would certainly have a field day deciphering the variety of source material in evidence, not only to identify where it came from but also what was actually original…Where were your grandparents when the Martians invaded?” The movie uniquely uses Cutting Edge Visual Effects to blend a modern cast with Battalions of Actual Fighting Soldiers, Golden Age Movie Stars, and previously undisclosed images of Tentacled Alien Creatures and their 10-Story High, 3-Legged Fighting Machines. War of the Worlds the True Story can be watched in the US now on Amazon here: https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-True-Story-Jack-Clay/dp/B00HH0VG5E  War of the Worlds The True Story is being prepared by Amazon to be released in August in the UK and EU.

Having just watched her daughter, 44, and husband of 67 years spend their final days hooked up to hospital machines, this quiet Michigan woman rebelled and announced: ‘I’m 90 years old. I’m hitting the road!’ She wanted to join her retired son, Tim, and his wife Ramie on their freewheeling travels around America. Norma kept a journal as the trio travelled around America, gaining social media fame as they documented their trip under the name 'Driving Miss Norma' - and this is the result The couple lived in an old motorhome, parking up outside national parks and in Walmart car parks as the whim took them. Although thrilled by Norma’s unexpected zest for life, they worried the doctors would think them reckless. But this one surprised them. He lit up. ‘As doctors,’ he said, ‘we see what cancer treatment looks like every day. You’re doing exactly what I’d want to do in your situation. Have a fantastic trip!’ This life-affirming book is an inspirational account of that trip. It’s about three people learning to let go of their fears and find love and trust in each other and the world around them.

Share this article Share But it’s not all plain sailing: there is a new, wheelchair-friendly RV to be acquired. And Norma’s son and his wife, who until now had lived only for each other, would also have to learn to share their intimate space, curtail their long dawn hikes and become full-time carers. As Tim’s second wife, Ramie had not known Norma long. She had also suffered from depression and feared that life with a dying nonagenarian would leave her feeling ‘insignificant and isolated’. Tim shared her anxiety. ‘I had forgone having a family of my own because I did not want this kind of responsibility,’ he says. An adopted child, he had lived miles away from Norma for decades. ‘Could Mom, in her time of old age, fragility and illness, count on me?’ he wondered. But this one surprised them. He lit up. ‘As doctors,’ he said, ‘we see what cancer treatment looks like every day. You’re doing exactly what I’d want to do in your situation. Have a fantastic trip!’ ‘Dad was the frontman . . . always ready with a smile and a bad joke,’ he writes. ‘Mom smiled and laughed at his jokes. It seemed to me that she had gone most of her life without engaging with others in her own voice.’ But, to his delight, he finds her growing ‘spunky’ in widowhood. When conventional medication left her feeling drained and dizzy, they suggested swapping it for cannabis cream. They expected Norma to be shocked, but she negotiated the ‘pot shop’ with nonchalance. Tim and Ramie thought they would be ‘showing’ Norma the world. In the event, she showed them how to appreciate it anew — she didn’t have a ‘bucket list’, and after a life dominated by routine, she craved spontaneity and silliness.

All we have is the moment that is unfolding right now. And no matter where any of us are, that now can be filled with beauty, joy, love and possibility. Mom was living proof of that - Norma's son, Tim The family had as much fun visiting goofy attractions, such as the 55ft statue of the Jolly Green Giant in Minnesota, as they did at Yellowstone National Park The family had as much fun visiting goofy attractions, such as the 55ft statue of the Jolly Green Giant in Minnesota, as they did at Yellowstone National Park. Norma surprised them at every turn, managing her first horse-riding experience with grace and relishing her first ever gin and tonic. Her husband had always wanted to go hot-air ballooning, so they took a trip in his memory. Ramie recalls the contentment on Norma’s face as they floated over Florida. When Ramie began blogging about their adventures, invitations to ride in parades, meet sea lions and board aircraft carriers flooded in. Norma had focused on the little things: baby goats, peppermint creams and a good perm. She wanted to be remembered simply as ‘a kind lady’ As followers of their ‘Driving Miss Norma’ Facebook page soared from the tens to the thousands, the media started begging for interviews. Tim fretted that his private mother would be overwhelmed or exploited, but she took to celebrity enthusiastically, giggling at the freebies as she encouraged others to seize the day. The fun couldn’t last for ever, though, and after a year, Norma’s heart began to fail and the motor home became a rolling hospice. Ramie sang her to sleep at night. Norma surprised them at every turn, managing her first horse-riding experience with grace and relishing her first ever gin and tonic Norma died, aged 91, in October. When Tim and Ramie found the journal she’d written on the trip, they were startled to find no mention of either cancer or fame. She had focused on the little things: baby goats, peppermint creams and a good perm. She wanted to be remembered simply as ‘a kind lady’. ‘It is trite but true,’ writes Tim. ‘All we have is the moment that is unfolding right now. And no matter where any of us are, that now can be filled with beauty, joy, love and possibility.

So what is the message this White House is sending? First, it raises a long, fat middle finger pointed at the working class voters who helped to put Trump in office. For them, this budget isn’t a con job; it is a stunning betrayal. Second, it constitutes a wet kiss for House Speaker Paul Ryan and right-wing Republican efforts to reward the rich and punish the poor. It even recycles the transparent lies that are standard Ryan fare – that top-end tax cuts will pay for themselves, that a budget that slashes taxes, raises money on the military, protects Social Security and Medicare will magically end up balanced in 10 years, that giving the rich more money will produce jobs and the poor will benefit from reversing efforts to assist them. Senator John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate has called the budget, “dead on arrival.” Its savage cuts even earned a rebuke from the House leader of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows, who objected to eliminating “Meals on Wheels.” Trump released his budget while he was on the other side of the world, suggesting he wanted to distance himself from its betrayal of his working class supporters, were he capable of shame. The elements were already exposed in his “skinny budget,” this document just provides more detail, but the detail itself is shocking. Medicaid is savaged, cut nearly in half by the end of the 10 years. Millions of lower income workers and their families will be deprived of health care. Their kids will go to public schools without pre school, with fewer resources and fewer after school programs. They will find college less affordable and training less available. Their families will suffer from fouled water and and air. Those struggling with the opioid epidemic will get less treatment. Women will find health care services less available. Workers at Wal-Mart, fast food and other lower wage employers will be stripped of the food stamps and tax credits that help them make ends meet. The $1.7 trillion in domestic spending cuts will eliminate rural development programs, and ravage farm subsidies. Cuts in workplace safety and enforcement against wage theft will leave more workers injured on the job and more gouged by crooked employers. Trump turns his promise of a $1 trillion, 10-year bipartisan jobs program into a joke. In the first year, his budget cuts more investment in infrastructure than the $5 billion it adds. The total spending over 10 years averages a paltry $20 billion a year; the rest goes to bribes “incentives” for private investors. That insures that working families will get it in the ear – beginning with Trump’s call for charging tolls on existing free interstate highways. Eisenhower would be turning in his grave. Senator Bernie Sanders, the senior non-Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, railed at the betrayal, wondering out loud to reporters how Republicans would justify this budget to their supporters: “Yeah, I just voted for incredibly large tax breaks for billionaires. Oh, by the way, we’re going to cut Head Start and child care and after-school programs and health care and education!” With the betrayal comes the full package of Republican lies and hypocrisies.White House talking points say the budget replaces “dependency with the dignity of work.” “We looked at this budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the bills,” said Trump’s noxious OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. But a budget that cuts education and training, science and technology, burlesques infrastructure investment, and savages programs that make work pay – from food stamps to the Earned Income Tax Credit to child tax subsidies – will leave workers with more dependence and less dignity. Based on this budget, billionaires are far more rapacious than even Bernie Sanders suggests. It will give them millions in tax breaks at the cost of throwing millions off of health care, cutting education and college assistance, home heating, Meals on Wheels, aid to the disabled, support for schools and college. The budget parrots Ryan’s fantasies about reaching a balanced budget. But the lies about balanced budgets are far less important than the reality of how this budget plans to use the money. The Trump-Republican Congress priorities will supercharge current trends. The military will be our only industrial program. Leadership in renewable energy and energy efficiency – the growth global markets of the next years –will be squandered. Our edge in science and technology abandoned. Our infrastructure will grow ever more dangerous and decrepit, even as profiteers lay on pervasive “user fees.” America will grow more unequal; its working people with less opportunity and declining longevity. Trump’s extreme cuts won’t pass, but don’t dismiss this budget. In essence, Trump not only shafts his supporters, he gives the Republican right-wing Congress, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan, an open door to do extreme damage. Republicans can now parade as moderates compared to Trump, even as they savage America’s prospects, succor the rich, and add to the burdens on workers and the poor. Democrats will seek to the limit the damage. But this budget, in the hands of this Congress, ensure that damage will be done. _______ About author Robert Borosage is the founder and president of the Institute for America’s Future and co-director of its sister organization, the Campaign for America’s Future.

BUSINESS Banks want higher debit-card 'swipe fees,' but an effort to allow them has crumbled Alex Milan Tracy / TNS A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. (Alex Milan Tracy / TNS) Jim PuzzangheraContact Reporter Banks had hoped Congress would let them charge merchants higher fees to process debit card purchases, but an effort to allow that has crumbled — a victory for retailers and, possibly, shoppers who might have had to shoulder those costs. In the latest chapter of a long-running fight, a repeal of federal limits on so-called swipe fees no longer will be part of a House financial regulation bill, said the legislation’s author, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he decided to strip the provision from the bill because many lawmakers are balking at removing the limits. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew healthy economic growth for all Americans,” Hensarling said of his Financial Choice Act in a statement late Wednesday. Retailers — including big players such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. — argued that banks charged much more than necessary to process debit card transactions as that method of payment became more popular. Those fees were passed on to consumers, retailers said. In 2011, the Federal Reserve capped the fees at 21 cents per transaction, plus a small percentage of the purchase price and a possible 1-cent fraud prevention adjustment. The limit was well below the average 44-cent fee retailers were paying at the time. Banks strongly objected to the cap and have been fighting it ever since. They argued the limits didn't take into account fraud losses and other costs. Regulators were ordered to cap the fees by a provision known as the Durbin amendment — named for its author, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) — that was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Financial Choice Act, a sweeping dismantling of Dodd-Frank, included a repeal of the debit-card fee limits when the legislation was approved by the House Financial Services Committee this month. “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said. “I believe it belongs in the Financial Choice Act, but I recognize and respect that many members of Congress feel differently.” Durbin said there was a bipartisan consensus to keep the fee limits he championed. Repealing the caps “would be like dropping an $8-billion-per-year tax increase on Main Street businesses, causing prices to spike at the grocery store and the gas pump, all for the benefit of big banks already making record profits,” he said Thursday. The National Retail Federation trade group said Hensarling’s decision was “a major victory” for consumers. “Repeal of reform would have allowed banks to return to the uncompetitive market that allowed them to set these fees as high as they liked,” said Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel. “The progress that was made toward competition would have been lost, and consumers would have seen nothing but higher prices.” The banking industry hasn’t given up the fight, although there appears to be little appetite in the Senate to repeal the fees. Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Assn., said the cap amounted to “government price controls.” “Until it’s repealed, big-box retailers will continue to reap the billions in profits they promised to pass along to their customers,” he said. “That’s wrong and Congress should fix it.” Caption The CBO, a nonpartisan office, analyzed the health bill passed by the House.

The limit was well below the average 44-cent fee retailers were paying at the time. Banks strongly objected to the cap and have been fighting it ever since. They argued the limits didn't take into account fraud losses and other costs. Regulators were ordered to cap the fees by a provision known as the Durbin amendment — named for its author, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) — that was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Financial Choice Act, a sweeping dismantling of Dodd-Frank, included a repeal of the debit-card fee limits when the legislation was approved by the House Financial Services Committee this month. “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said. “I believe it belongs in the Financial Choice Act, but I recognize and respect that many members of Congress feel differently.” Durbin said there was a bipartisan consensus to keep the fee limits he championed. Repealing the caps “would be like dropping an $8-billion-per-year tax increase on Main Street businesses, causing prices to spike at the grocery store and the gas pump, all for the benefit of big banks already making record profits,” he said Thursday. The National Retail Federation trade group said Hensarling’s decision was “a major victory” for consumers. “Repeal of reform would have allowed banks to return to the uncompetitive market that allowed them to set these fees as high as they liked,” said Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel. “The progress that was made toward competition would have been lost, and consumers would have seen nothing but higher prices.” The banking industry hasn’t given up the fight, although there appears to be little appetite in the Senate to repeal the fees. Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Assn., said the cap amounted to “government price controls.” “Until it’s repealed, big-box retailers will continue to reap the billions in profits they promised to pass along to their customers,” he said. “That’s wrong and Congress should fix it.” Caption The CBO, a nonpartisan office, analyzed the health bill passed by the House.

BUSINESS Banks want higher debit-card 'swipe fees,' but an effort to allow them has crumbled Alex Milan Tracy / TNS A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. (Alex Milan Tracy / TNS) Jim PuzzangheraContact Reporter Banks had hoped Congress would let them charge merchants higher fees to process debit card purchases, but an effort to allow that has crumbled — a victory for retailers and, possibly, shoppers who might have had to shoulder those costs. In the latest chapter of a long-running fight, a repeal of federal limits on so-called swipe fees no longer will be part of a House financial regulation bill, said the legislation’s author, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he decided to strip the provision from the bill because many lawmakers are balking at removing the limits. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew healthy economic growth for all Americans,” Hensarling said of his Financial Choice Act in a statement late Wednesday. Retailers — including big players such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. — argued that banks charged much more than necessary to process debit card transactions as that method of payment became more popular. Those fees were passed on to consumers, retailers said. In 2011, the Federal Reserve capped the fees at 21 cents per transaction, plus a small percentage of the purchase price and a possible 1-cent fraud prevention adjustment.

BUSINESS Banks want higher debit-card 'swipe fees,' but an effort to allow them has crumbled Alex Milan Tracy / TNS A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. A Visa debit card is pictured with a chip-enabled card. (Alex Milan Tracy / TNS) Jim PuzzangheraContact Reporter Banks had hoped Congress would let them charge merchants higher fees to process debit card purchases, but an effort to allow that has crumbled — a victory for retailers and, possibly, shoppers who might have had to shoulder those costs. In the latest chapter of a long-running fight, a repeal of federal limits on so-called swipe fees no longer will be part of a House financial regulation bill, said the legislation’s author, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he decided to strip the provision from the bill because many lawmakers are balking at removing the limits. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew healthy economic growth for all Americans,” Hensarling said of his Financial Choice Act in a statement late Wednesday. Retailers — including big players such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. — argued that banks charged much more than necessary to process debit card transactions as that method of payment became more popular. Those fees were passed on to consumers, retailers said. In 2011, the Federal Reserve capped the fees at 21 cents per transaction, plus a small percentage of the purchase price and a possible 1-cent fraud prevention adjustment. The limit was well below the average 44-cent fee retailers were paying at the time. Banks strongly objected to the cap and have been fighting it ever since. They argued the limits didn't take into account fraud losses and other costs. Regulators were ordered to cap the fees by a provision known as the Durbin amendment — named for its author, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) — that was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Financial Choice Act, a sweeping dismantling of Dodd-Frank, included a repeal of the debit-card fee limits when the legislation was approved by the House Financial Services Committee this month. “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said. “I believe it belongs in the Financial Choice Act, but I recognize and respect that many members of Congress feel differently.” Durbin said there was a bipartisan consensus to keep the fee limits he championed. Repealing the caps “would be like dropping an $8-billion-per-year tax increase on Main Street businesses, causing prices to spike at the grocery store and the gas pump, all for the benefit of big banks already making record profits,” he said Thursday. The National Retail Federation trade group said Hensarling’s decision was “a major victory” for consumers. “Repeal of reform would have allowed banks to return to the uncompetitive market that allowed them to set these fees as high as they liked,” said Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel. “The progress that was made toward competition would have been lost, and consumers would have seen nothing but higher prices.” The banking industry hasn’t given up the fight, although there appears to be little appetite in the Senate to repeal the fees. Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Assn., said the cap amounted to “government price controls.” “Until it’s repealed, big-box retailers will continue to reap the billions in profits they promised to pass along to their customers,” he said. “That’s wrong and Congress should fix it.” Caption The CBO, a nonpartisan office, analyzed the health bill passed by the House.

News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Site Archive Sears revenue continues decline amid tough landscape Thursday May 25, 2017 at 3:00 PM May 25, 2017 at 3:18 PM The Associated Press   NEW YORK (AP) — Sears' extended decline in sales continued during the first quarter and the storied retailer vowed additional spending cuts to offset its slowing business. The company's losses widened to $222 million, or $2.15 per share on weak sales. The company has been closing stores and selling brands long affiliated with Sears, including Craftsman. A year ago the company reported a loss of $181 million. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $4.3 billion, and same-store sales fell 11.9 percent. In March, Sears Holdings Corp. said there is "substantial doubt" it could continue as a viable concern with intense pressure coming from companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. Asset sales have bought the retailer time, but it said recently that pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January that it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing," Chairman Eddie Lampert said in a company release. "We recognize that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25 billion restructuring program." Lampert's hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep Sears afloat. The company remains in a "tenuous" position, according to Evercore analyst Greg Melich, with operating losses showing no sign of improvement and sales in freefall. "Sears does not appear well positioned for the rest of 2017," Melich said, citing its weak store base, anemic sales and continued market share loss in most major categories. Despite the weak results, the shares surged $2.26, or 30 percent, to $9.72 in morning trading Thursday. Prior to the market opening, shares of the Hoffman Estates, Illinois, company had dropped 20 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock had fallen 38 percent in the last 12 months. Bottom line: An operationally challenging start to 1Q with large cash burn, offset by the same playbook we've seen for years of asset sales and cost cuts partially offsetting the operating losses. Improving the cash burn rate is imperative as the company shrinks, and SHLD remain very far from sustainable levels of loss that does not require external liquidity.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services My Profile Advertise With Us Customer Service Newspaper in Education Internships Contact Us Market Place Shop Cars Homes Free Classifieds Ad Classifieds Community Info Community Served About us Historic Headlines Peoria History Forms Anniversaries Births Engagements Weddings 100th Birthday Jobs in Peoria Pets Place a Classified Ad Real Estate Rentals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Conducting the burn in cooperation with the property owner mitigates the annual fire hazard and provides valuable training experience to personnel. The training burn is subject to the weather, and if conditions are not ideal, the department will postpone the burn.

Goodin from North Dakota, and he earned $3.3 million By Timothyna Duncan For Dailymail.com Published: 15:18 EDT, 25 May 2017 | Updated: 18:20 EDT, 25 May 2017 e-mail 35 shares 56 View comments Not all states are created equal - at least when it comes to how much each Chief Executive Officer is paid. According to the latest survey put together by The Associated Press and Equilar, an executive firm, CEOs in the East and West coasts are earning significantly more than their counterparts in the South and Midwest. The survey considered only publicly traded companies with more than $1 billion in revenue that filed their proxy statements - statements all firms need to file that show their salary, bonus, stock awards and perks such as personal use of company aircraft - between January and May  last year. The list includes CEOs who have been in place for at least two years. To calculate their pay, Equilar added salary and other forms of compensations like bonuses and stock awards. Pictured are the top 10 highest paid CEOs in 2016, according to a study carried out by executive compensation data firm Equilar and The Associated Press. On top row, from left: Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge; CBS CEO Leslie Moonves; Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger; Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav; and Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick. On bottom row, from left: Comcast CEO Brian Roberts; Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes; IBM CEO Virginia Rometty; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals CEO Leonard Schleifer; and Wynn Resorts CEO Stephen Wynn This shows some of the top-paid CEOs by state for 2016. On top row, from left: General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt; Wynn Resorts CEO Stephen Wynn; Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. On bottom row, from left: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz; UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley; Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Sanderson Farms CEO Joe Sanderson THE 10 HIGHEST PAID FEMALE CEOS  1. Virginia Rometty, International Business Machines: $32.3million 2. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo: $27.4million 3. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo: $25.2million 4. Mary Barra, General Motors: $22.4million 5. Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics: $21.2million  6. Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin: $19.4million 7. Irene Rosenfeld, Mondelez International: $15.8million 8. Lynn Good, Duke Energy: $13.5million 9. Heather Bresch, Mylan NV: $13.3million 10. Susan Cameron, Reynolds American: $13.1million  The CEO atop the majority-male list may not be as familiar as other household names like Howard Schultz. His name is Tom Rutledge, and he earned $98 million dollars - $ 29.4 million dollars more than the runner-up on the list - for running a telecommunications company called Charter  Communications, the second largest cable provider in the Unites States.  In 2015, he was 122nd on Equilar's list of highest paid CEOs because he earned a meager $16.4 million, which means that his salary increased by more than six times last  year. David Zaslav rather came out on top of the list in 2015 because he earned $156 million. In 2016, he came in fourth on the list with $37.2 million - $100 million dollars less. Other CEOs like Les Moonves, who runs CBS, and Robert Iger have been more consistent and have more or less earned the same amounts, when compared to 2015. The first five are either in the East Coast or the West Coast, while the bottom five are mostly from the South and Midwest. The top five are from Connecticut, New York, California, Maryland and Pennsylvania while the bottom five are from North Dakota, Idaho, Mississippi, Hawaii and New Hampshire. Greg Maffei, who runs Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive, earned $30.2 million - almost 500 times the median pay of a nurse - and was the highest ranked CEO who was neither from the East or West coast. The least paid CEO was David L. Goodin, from North Dakota, who runs an energy company called MDU Resources Group , and he earned $3.3 million. CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz, who stepped down for the second time, earned $21.8 million and came in at 17th.

(Carie Canterbury / Daily Record) Jim Wiles, executive director of the Golden Age Center, left, and Dave and Lynda Lambert of Cañon Signature Mortgage, sit inside the new Cañon City Trolley that will begin a route through town Tuesday. (Carie Canterbury / Daily Record) Beginning Tuesday, the new Cañon City Trolley will make its way through town four days a week, offering people a lift to shopping and eating establishments and other stops along the way. The pilot program will run May 30 through Sept. 2. Dave and Lynda Lambert of Cañon Signature Mortgage purchased the 23-passenger trolley that was used for weddings in Estes Park, and they now lease it to Fremont County Transit, which is operated through the Golden Age Center. "The goal of this is to be able to transport visitors through Cañon City without them having to deal with our parking issues downtown," said Jim Wiles, executive director of the Golden Age Center. "If this works out the way we have it planned, we will be able to bring people from hotels and bring them down to shopping along the route." The trolley also will be available for locals who need a ride. The route initially will run from the Royal Gorge Route Railroad parking lot near Veterans Park to Main Street, where it then will travel to 15th Street and transition into Fremont Drive, then travel to the Best Western behind IHOP and turn around and do the same route in reverse. No signs are posted at this point, but anyone needing a ride is asked to flag down the trolley for it to stop. When stops are later designated, signs will be installed. The trolley likely will make stops/pickups at Walmart, the Winery at Holy Cross Abbey and hotels and businesses along the route. A stop at the Shops at Fourmile Creek at Justice Center Road and U.S. 50 and also at Village Inn may be added. Wiles said consumer demand ultimately will dictate the stops. Advertisement To begin, hours will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. The route from one end to the other is expected to be about half an hour. As the program gets going, hours may change and Saturday service may be added. In the beginning, the fare will be a suggested donation of $2, but a system, like a punch card, likely will be established for people who make several stops along the route. Drivers will not be able to make change. Drivers are all volunteers who have their commercial driver's licenses. The program is recruiting more volunteer drivers who would like to participate in the project. "I am hoping that merchants along the way will find it to be beneficial enough to where they can help support it financially," Wiles said. CDOT helps with funding for the transit program, but the organization is unable to help with the trolley because it does not have a lift, so additional financial support is imperative. If the program is successful this summer, Wiles would like to add a second trolley next year and eventually include service to the Royal Gorge area, as well as a trolley designated for the Florence downtown. Wiles said he appreciates the support of the Lamberts who have made the program possible. "Having a dream doesn't help if you don't have the whole package — they made that happen," Wiles said. "I appreciate very much their interest and their efforts." Dave Lambert said being on Main Street, they see a lot of people walking. "We see so many people walking — young and old — walking clear to Safeway and Walmart," he said. "No one sees it unless you're on Main, and we see a lot of foot traffic. Our main goal is for tourists, but it's also here to help somebody in need to travel." The estimated cost to operate the trolley for the season is $16,000, which covers gas, maintenance and insurance. In an effort to keep fares low for passengers, Wiles is looking for businesses interested in becoming financial supporters. Individuals with a CDL who would like to volunteer as a driver may call Wiles at 719-275-5177 or email him at 1director@ccgac.com. Individuals in need of door-to-door service, or those in need of an ADA accessible ride, also may call the same number or visit www.fremontcountytransit.com. Businesses interested in having advertising placed on the trolley, or individuals interested in renting the trolley for a special event after hours, during the weekend or after the season, may call Lambert at 719-275-2999.

Sears Holdings Corp. reported earnings on Thursday, May 25, 2017. Sears' extended decline in sales continued during the first quarter and the storied retailer vowed additional spending cuts to offset its slowing business. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — Sears’ extended decline in sales persisted during the first quarter and the storied retailer vowed to make additional spending cuts to offset its slowing business. The company’s operating loss widened to $222 million, or $2.15 per share, on weak sales. Sears Holdings has been closing stores and selling brands long affiliated with Sears, including Craftsman. A year ago the company reported a loss of $181 million. Still, the company registered a profit of $244 million, or $2.28 per share, counting a gain from the sale of assets. Its shares surged $1.63, or 22 percent, to $9.10 in trading Thursday. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $4.3 billion, and sales at established stores fell 11.9 percent. In March, Sears Holdings Corp. said there is “substantial doubt” it could continue as a viable concern, with intense pressure coming from companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. It has insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. Asset sales have bought the retailer time, but it said recently that pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding.

The company’s operating loss widened to $222 million, or $2.15 per share, on weak sales. Sears Holdings has been closing stores and selling brands long affiliated with Sears, including Craftsman. A year ago the company reported a loss of $181 million. Still, the company registered a profit of $244 million, or $2.28 per share, counting a gain from the sale of assets. Its shares surged $1.63, or 22 percent, to $9.10 in trading Thursday. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $4.3 billion, and sales at established stores fell 11.9 percent. Register now to learn how DHS and Commerce are implementing CDM strategies. Advertisement In March, Sears Holdings Corp. said there is “substantial doubt” it could continue as a viable concern, with intense pressure coming from companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. It has insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. Asset sales have bought the retailer time, but it said recently that pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding.

The company's stock, which is heavily shorted, posted its biggest intraday percentage gain in more than three months as the results provided some relief a couple of months after Sears flagged doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. Quarterly sales, however, continued their years-long decline, while the company's cash balance fell to $264 million as of April 29 from $286 million at Jan. 28. Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling for years to turn around its business amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc. The worsening retail environment hasn't helped either, and Sears, like others including Macy's Inc, has been closing stores and squeezing costs to cope. Sears, which sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc in March, said it had cut up to $700 million in costs to date since February as part of a program to reduce costs by $1.25 billion. Total costs in the first quarter ended April 29 fell to $4 billion. The company's shares are down 18 percent since the retailer raised going concern doubts in March. Short interest in the stock amounted to 13.5 percent of outstanding shares, as of May 15. DECLINING SALES Hedge fund investor and Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said on Thursday that the company needed to speed up efforts to improve performance but added that the quarter had "clearly demonstrated" its commitment to return to solid financial footing. Lampert recently blasted the media for "unfairly singling out" the company over the past decade and blamed "irresponsible" coverage for the retailer's woes. Sears, which has not posted an annual profit in six years, has also struggled with a big debt pile. Total liabilities at the end of the quarter was $12.6 billion, down from $13.19 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. "The reported results pertain to the one-time gains has zero impact, in our view, on the credit story for Sears," David Silverman, senior director, U.S. corporates at Fitch Ratings told Reuters. Sales at Sears' U.S. stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart they declined 11.2 percent. Total revenue fell by more than a fifth to $4.30 billion. Net income attributable to Sears' shareholders was $244 million, or $2.28 per share, within the range of the company's forecast. Excluding restructuring items, the company reported a net loss of $2.15 per share, compared with the $3.05 per share loss two Wall Street analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company's shares were up 17 percent at $8.74 in early trading on Thursday. However, sales continued the years-long decline, hurt by lower demand for groceries, apparel and home appliances at the retailer's Sears and Kmart stores. Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Sales at Sears' U.S. stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart it declined 11.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29. The company said in April it expected a net profit of between $185 million and $285 million for the first quarter, through a cost-cutting plan, which included store closures and cutting management jobs. Selling and general expenses decreased about 16 percent to $1.27 billion in the quarter, leading to a near-third drop in total costs to $4 billion. Sears said it cut up to $700 million in costs to date since announcing the plan in February. The company in March sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc for an upfront payment of $525 million. Net income attributable to Sears' shareholders was $244 million, or $2.28 per share, compared with a loss of $471 million, or $4.41 per share, a year earlier. Excluding such one-time items, the company reported a net loss of $2.15 per share. Revenue fell 20.3 percent to $4.30 billion. Sears, which has been closing stores and divesting businesses for years to cope with falling sales and a growing debt pile, warned in March about its ability to continue as a going concern. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen 18 percent since the retailer raised going concern doubts.

About US Contact US Registration Thursday May 25th, 2017 Languages English French Language German Language Italian Language Portuguese Language Spanish Language Latest Intel MIL Analysis-Reportage Report Assesses Corporate SDG Reporting By Foreign Affairs Publisher  /  May 26, 2017  /  Comments Off on Report Assesses Corporate SDG Reporting       Print       Email MIL OSI – Source: Small Island Developing States Headline: Report Assesses Corporate SDG Reporting May 2017: The UN Global Sustainability Index Initiative (UNGSII) released the ‘SDG Commitment Report 100’ (SCR 100). The document presents the first-ever analysis using annual reports as the sole metric to assess corporate commitments to the SDGs. The report aims to help investors identify the companies most aligned with long-term business and environmental needs. Since annual reports are legally required, they provide a better source for a company’s sustainability than voluntary sustainability reports, according to Roland Schatz, UNGSII. Alfred Berkeley, Chairman of Princeton Capital Management and former NASDAQ president, adds that including sustainable development themes in legal documents like the annual report “makes them a matter for the whole board of directors and the CEO, and brings to them a level of attention that they would not otherwise have.” The assessment reviewed the annual reports of 100 large companies, representing each continent. The report finds that 82% of the companies made some mention of sustainable development themes in their 2016 annual reports, with climate change, gender equality and education among the most-mentioned issues, and 24% made explicit mention of implementing the SDGs. SDC100 ranks Volvo, Novartis, Sainsbury the most highly, while Apple, Disney, Walmart and GE are at the bottom of the list, as sustainable development themes are not present in their annual reports. The report finds that Chinese energy company Sinopec made the most references to alleviating poverty, and Tesco referred the most to ending hunger. Also on business leadership for the SDGs, the UN Global Compact has invited nominations of “SDG Pioneers,” as part of its Making Global Goals Local Business campaign. The Pioneers are individual business leaders taking action to advance the SDGs through their own company or by mobilizing other businesses, and supporting the SDGs while also contributing to business success. Nominations can be submitted until 2 June 2017. Individuals working at any UN Global Compact signatory company – or a company that applies to join the Compact by 2 June – are eligible. Up to ten SDG Pioneers will be selected and announced at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit, convening on 21 September 2017 in New York, US. PwC Canada’s Mel Wilson outlines recommendations for businesses on reporting their contributions to the SDGs. He explains that much of the necessary performance information is already available to businesses, as long as they have been reporting through the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The difference is that the SDGs provide a more specific context for the company’s actions, and are globally shared, Wilson writes. For example, a report that a company “reduced our total water consumption by 2.3%,” could become, in the SDG reporting context, “Our overall goal, in line with our commitments to the SDGs, is to reduce our overall water consumption by 10% by 2030. Last year we were able to achieve a 2.3% reduction. We remain confident we are on track to meet our 2030 goal.” The author recalls that sustainability reporting by private companies began with social accountability reports in the 1970. In the late 1990s, GRI issued its reporting guidelines, and corporate sustainability reports “started to become coherent, consistent, and comparable.” This was followed by the 2015 request by governments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for companies to report on their progress against the SDGs. Wilson argues that the introduction of the SDGs represents the next phase in the evolution of sustainability reporting, by providing both direction and context for performance indicators. He suggests that companies align their reporting with the SDGs by: establishing a baseline year for each Goal and/or target, such as 2015; identify the company’s aim for the year 2030, and broadly describe the approach to achieving it; and report progress annually, using the KPIs and data that are normally reported. In other news, health technology company Royal Philips announced an agreement with a consortium of 16 banks for a €1 billion Revolving Credit Facility, with an interest rate that will depend on the company’s improvement in sustainability performance. ING acts as the sustainability coordinator for the facility, and the other member banks of the consortium include ABN AMRO, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ICBC, JPMorgan, Mizuho Bank, Morgan Stanley, MUFG, Rabobank, Société Générale and UBS.

Huh) NEW YORK (AP) — Sears' extended decline in sales persisted during the first quarter and the storied retailer vowed to make additional spending cuts to offset its slowing business. The company's operating loss widened to $222 million, or $2.15 per share, on weak sales. Sears Holdings has been closing stores and selling brands long affiliated with Sears, including Craftsman. A year ago the company reported a loss of $181 million. Still, the company registered a profit of $244 million, or $2.28 per share, counting a gain from the sale of assets. Its shares surged $1.63, or 22 percent, to $9.10 in trading Thursday. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $4.3 billion, and sales at established stores fell 11.9 percent. In March, Sears Holdings Corp. said there is "substantial doubt" it could continue as a viable concern, with intense pressure coming from companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. It has insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. Asset sales have bought the retailer time, but it said recently that pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January that it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February. The company has lost more than $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. "While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing," Chairman Eddie Lampert said in a company release. "We recognize that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25 billion restructuring program."

Lampert's hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep Sears afloat. The company remains in a "tenuous" position, according to Evercore analyst Greg Melich, with operating losses showing no sign of improvement and sales in freefall. "Sears does not appear well positioned for the rest of 2017," Melich said, citing its weak store base, anemic sales and continued market share loss in most major categories. Prior to the market opening, shares of the Hoffman Estates, Illinois, company had dropped 20 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock had fallen 38 percent in the last 12 months.

By Doug HarlowMorning Sentinel Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-612-2367 Share Comment Read Article Owner Julie Swain fits a safety vest on a dog mannequin Wednesday beside many products sold at the new Dog Not Gone factory outlet store inside the Maine Stitching Specialties company in Skowhegan. Staff photo by David Leaming SKOWHEGAN — Bill and Julie Swain have come a long way with their Stitching Specialties LLC and Dog Not Gone Visibility Products since they started operations in 2005 in their home in Kingfield. The couple bought the former Dirigo Stitching Co. factory in Skowhegan in 2014, and by last year, their products for pets and people were being shipped to Wal-Mart stores all across New England. Citing walk-in demand for their product line — Dog Not Gone tick and mosquito-repelling outerwear for dogs and humans — the Swains last week opened a factory outlet store at the building on Dane Avenue across from North Elementary School. “People are always coming in asking about the tick-repelling products and the American flags — that’s been a really big seller, especially lately with Memorial Day and the Fourth of July coming up next month,” Julie Swain said from the store Wednesday. The ticks are really bad in Maine this year, she said, and people are worried. The store sells caps, hats, scarves, bandannas and vests — all treated with a special solution called Permethrin that is added during the manufacture of the fabric — and gaiters made of a socklike fabric with a Velcro closure that is worn over the pant leg to keep ticks from climbing in and up. “It’s amazing how effective they are. It’s almost like it’s too good to be true,” she said of the bug repellent and visibility products for people, dogs, cats and horses. “The baseball hats have been huge. Not only do they repel ticks, but they repel mosquitoes and back flies. We do things for the top and the bottom — of you.” Julie Swain said the prices at the factory outlet are lower than prices listed on their website and are currently 25 percent off. She said the Permethrin is woven into the fabric and is insoluble, so it doesn’t come off on a person or a pet. The store is open from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Bill Swain, speaking by cellphone Wednesday from the road, said Permethrin is safe for people and pets. He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider the chemical to pose virtually no risk and recommends the products for pregnant women and children to avoid insect bites. The new line of apparel under the brand name of No Fly Designs now will offer superior tick and insect protection for every outdoor activity, he said. Bill Swain said that, with the manufacturing of the products in the factory space upstairs, they decided to use a vacant office on the ground floor as a retail store. He said the outlet store has all of the products that are carried at retail and big-box stores. “We have a number of retailers who carry our products, but no single retailer carries them all,” he said. “They either have our pet line, or our people line, or parts of it, but never the whole thing. So we said we could display all of our products in our own store.” Swain said local stores, including Campbell’s True Value, carry some of their products, as does Renys, Paris Farmers Union, Blue Seal Stores, some Tractor Supply stores and 19 Wal-Mart stores. He said sales have increased at a pace reflecting the news that ticks have become a problem in Maine. “We’ve seen a significant upturn, especially in our human apparel items. The increased presence of ticks virtually everywhere in Maine now has really got the interest growing in our products,” he said.

Known as the Durbin Amendment, the measure was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to limit how much money banks can charge retailers when consumers use their debit cards. While House Republicans have proposed a bill to rip up most of Dodd-Frank, they’ve concluded that they don’t have the votes to pass the legislation as long as it includes a repeal of Durbin, said two congressional aides with direct knowledge of the matter. The decision to leave the debit-fee cap in place likely clears the way for a full House vote on the Dodd-Frank overhaul as soon as next month, said the aides. Bloomberg News The decision on Durbin is a victory for the retail industry, which has spent millions of dollars lobbying politicians. The issue has always been a sensitive one for lawmakers, many of whom are loath to pick sides in a fight between powerful corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Members of Congress generally want cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. Debit-card fees are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The provision that mandated the fee cap, which is named after Democratic Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bill to revamp Dodd-Frank’s post-financial crisis reforms was written by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, and included the repeal of the fee cap. Hensarling’s panel approved the legislation earlier this month, but he has faced resistance from other GOP lawmakers over the Durbin amendment. Hensarling said on Wednesday he would remove the provision. When House Republicans held an internal vote count this week, they found that scrapping Durbin would derail Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, said the aides who asked not to be named because the vote was private. House Republicans are eager to move the bill forward, as removing constraints that Dodd-Frank imposed on the finance industry is a top goal that is shared by President Donald Trump. Administration officials have repeatedly blamed Dodd-Frank for curtailing lending and economic growth. “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said in a statement. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important-priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew economic growth for all Americans.” "We welcome today’s news that Congress is listening," said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association. While other aspects of Dodd-Frank get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- repealing Durbin has been one of the finance industry’s top priorities in Washington for years. The American Bankers Association, a lobbying group, pledged to keep fighting over the issue despite Wednesday’s setback. “This is unfortunate, but certainly not the end of this debate," James Ballentine, an ABA executive vice president said in a memo sent to banks. The group will “continue to work with and educate members who are interested in removing this language.” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group Inc., predicted the battle between retailers and banks is far from over, which he said is good news for lawmakers. “This is a great issue to fund-raise off of given how much it matters to banks, credit unions and merchants," Seiberg said in a note. Banks will continue to lobby for a removal of the cap and retailers may push for it to be expanded to include credit cards, he added. Regardless of what happens in the House, Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act faces long odds in the Senate, where most bills need some Democratic support to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this month that he’s not optimistic Congress will overhaul Dodd-Frank because of a lack of Democratic votes. The bill is H.R. 10.

The survey considered only publicly traded companies with more than $1 billion in revenue that filed their proxy statements with federal regulators between Jan. 1 and May 1. It includes CEOs who have been in place for at least two years. Not every state had a publicly traded company headquartered there that was large enough to be included. To calculate CEO pay, Equilar adds salary, bonus, stock awards, stock option awards, deferred compensation and other components that include benefits and perks. The typical CEO in the Standard & Poor's 500 index made $11.5 million last year. Alabama: Grayson Hall, Regions Financial Corp., $8 million Arizona: Richard C.

Sanders kicked off the hearing by charging that the budget’s repeal of the estate tax would give massive breaks to the country’s wealthiest families — including President Trump's family, which he estimated would save $4 billion, and the Walton family of Walmart fame, which he said would save $52 billion. Sanders asked Mulvaney to explain why America’s richest family needs a $52 billion tax break, while people who rely on programs such as Meals on Wheels and Medicaid would be left out in the cold under Trump's budget. ADVERTISEMENT He also expressed anger that Republicans were impugning the work of Congressional Budget Office Director Keith Hall, even though he was appointed by Republicans. Mulvaney began responding to the remark about Hall when Sanders cut him off. “Your opinion is that the results are terrible, I’m suggesting that it was a member of the Trump administration who appointed this gentleman,” Sanders aid. “So we can agree that the CBO puts out bad data —” Mulvaney responded, before Sanders cut him off. “No, we can’t. We can agree that you guys are beating up on a man you appointed because you don’t like his results,” Sanders said. “That’s not right,” Mulvaney shot back. Mulvaney and Sanders went on to spar over where Meals on Wheels funding comes from and whether it would cut in the Trump budget, both increasingly exasperated and talking over each other. Sanders returned to his central question: his contention that the budget gave a $52 billion tax break to the wealthiest family in the country. Mulvaney attempted to reply that tax breaks were part of ObamaCare repeal, but Sanders interrupted again, coming back to the question of the $52 billion. “Ordinary people are paying more,” Mulvaney said. “No, ordinary people don’t have $128 billion,” Sanders interrupted. “You’re not answering the question. Answer the question!” “We don’t cut Medicaid. We’re talking about ObamaCare repeal,” Mulvaney said. “Which throws 23 million people off health insurance,” Sanders retorted. “We’re talking about a CBO number that I think you just agreed could be wrong,” Mulvaney said. “I didn’t agree to that at all,” Sanders replied.  In the end, as Sanders’s time ran out, they were able to agree on one point regarding the estate tax: that everyone will eventually die.

Video posted to Facebook on Monday night that shows a woman telling one customer to “go back to Mexico” and calling another customer a racial epithet has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on the social network. Eva Hicks, a mother of three, said she politely asked the woman to step to one side as she reached for medicine. It was then the woman became aggressive, Hicks said. “She moved back her cart and immediately started saying that people bother her on every aisle, and started saying more hateful things to me,” Hicks recounted and then took out her phone and began to record the encounter. The woman, who has not been identified, told Hicks to “go back to Mexico” and accused her of being rude. Another woman off-camera intervenes and tells the woman to stop being “ignorant.” The woman on camera responds, “a n***er’s calling me ignorant?” “I have never experienced anything like that in my life,” Hicks said. “Nobody has ever talked to me like that. I felt very insulted and unwanted.” @ShaunKing @Walmart @ShaunKing, we agree that this cannot be tolerated and are continuing to look into the matter. Below is our official statement: pic.twitter.com/BkKKVDrjE6 — Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) May 23, 2017 Hicks, originally from Mexico City, says she has been living in the United States for more than 30 years. In the video she tells the woman that this is her home. “It’s not your country, we don’t want you here,” the woman retorted. “I am an American citizen, I consider this home. I am not going to leave, I am going to stay here, I am not going to shut up, I am going to speak up,” Hicks said Wednesday, adding that she posted the video to Facebook to raise awareness. “I have seen a lot of these incidents lately. I believe ever since the Trump administration came into power, he can say hateful things to other races and other countries, these people think it’s okay for them to do the same.” In a statement posted online, Wal-Mart said it had “no tolerance for the language or actions” of the customer and commended the staff member seen in the video, saying he acted appropriately by asking the woman to leave. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the company was working to identify the woman and “once identified we will ask she no longer shops at our stores.” Hicks said she hopes to meet the woman who came to her defense and was subsequently called the N-word. “I don’t know her, I am supposed to meet her today,” she said. “I want to meet her to say thank you and just give her a hug.” 36.372854 -94.208817 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

hits a price point to please many News provided by Rand McNally 25 May, 2017, 10:18 ET Share this article SKOKIE, Ill., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nine months after launching the highly praised OverDryve™ 7 connected-car device, Rand McNally today revealed that it has produced a new OverDryve™ 7C unit that is more affordable but maintains most of the key features of the original device.  OverDryve™ 7C provides a powerful combination of hands-free information, entertainment, navigation, and safety features on a simple magnetic mount – making it the least expensive way to bring OverDryve's advanced luxury vehicle technology to any car. The new dashboard tablet is available at Walmart now with a suggested retail price of $199. OverDryve™ 7C Front OverDryve™ 7C "We are excited to expand the successful OverDryve™ line and provide drivers with an even more affordable connected-car hub. Rand McNally is on a mission to help drivers maximize capabilities while minimizing distractions," said Stephen Fletcher, CEO of Rand McNally. Fletcher debuted the OverDryve™ system last year at a packed press event at the Chicago Auto Show. The original OverDryve™ 7 device was sold exclusively at Best Buy through 2016 year end. Earlier this month the company unveiled a commercial version of the OverDryve™ product, the OverDryve™ 8 Pro for professional truck drivers. "OverDryve™ 7C delivers all the goodness of the original device in a streamlined package and simple mount," said Fletcher. "Just like the original, this new device has the power to modernize any vehicle by bringing the luxury car features we all want to any make, model, or vintage car." With more than 260 million cars and trucks on U.S. roads, the market for such a device is vast. In 2016, the average age of the American car increased to 11.6 years, according to IHS Markit.* That means a majority of the cars on the road don't have advanced connected luxury and safety features that newer vehicles offer. Key features include: Bluetooth® hands-free calling and texting Siri® and Google Now™ voice assistance A built-in dash cam The ability to stream music, news, weather, traffic, sports, and more – all through the car speakers Award-winning navigation from Rand McNally with lane guidance, warnings and other safety features A sleek, magnetic mount that makes attaching and removing the device a snap Plus, available tire pressure monitor and backup camera Everything about the OverDryve™ products was designed with the driver in mind. The OverDryve™ 7C features an elegant user display that provides access to key items at a glance. Off the mount – for passengers in the car or after the drive – OverDryve™ 7C is a fully loaded entertainment tablet that can be used to watch movies, access social media, and check email. In addition, a host of add-on accessories, sold separately, are available to sync with the device: The Rand McNally Wi-Fi® Backup Camera works with the OverDrvye™ 7C to give a full-screen picture of what's behind a vehicle. There's no need for an extra dashboard screen; the camera app is pre-loaded on the OverDryve™ 7C. The Rand McNally Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) enables drivers to monitor pressure and temperature on individual tires through the OverDryve™ 7C, helping with tire safety and efficiency. Celebrating its 161st anniversary this year, Rand McNally has been quietly shifting gears into a technology company in recent years. A major player in the commercial transportation markets – for 81 years – the company has leveraged its fast-growing telematics and fleet management expertise along with its award-winning commercial navigation to create a highly advanced, connected-car platform that is affordable and can be used in any car or light truck.

The new dashboard tablet is available at Walmart now with a suggested retail price of $199. "We are excited to expand the successful OverDryve [™] line and provide drivers with an even more affordable connected-car hub. Rand McNally is on a mission to help drivers maximize capabilities while minimizing distractions," said Stephen Fletcher, CEO of Rand McNally. Fletcher debuted the OverDryve [™] system last year at a packed press event at the Chicago Auto Show. The original OverDryve [™] 7 device was sold exclusively at Best Buy through 2016 year end. Earlier this month the company unveiled a commercial version of the OverDryve [™] product, the OverDryve [™] 8 Pro for professional truck drivers. "OverDryve [™] 7C delivers all the goodness of the original device in a streamlined package and simple mount," said Fletcher. "Just like the original, this new device has the power to modernize any vehicle by bringing the luxury car features we all want to any make, model, or vintage car." With more than 260 million cars and trucks on U.S. roads, the market for such a device is vast. In 2016, the average age of the American car increased to 11.6 years, according to IHS Markit.* That means a majority of the cars on the road don't have advanced connected luxury and safety features that newer vehicles offer. Key features include: Bluetooth [®] hands-free calling and texting Siri [®] and Google Now [™] voice assistance A built-in dash cam The ability to stream music, news, weather, traffic, sports, and more – all through the car speakers Award-winning navigation from Rand McNally with lane guidance, warnings and other safety features A sleek, magnetic mount that makes attaching and removing the device a snap Plus, available tire pressure monitor and backup camera Everything about the OverDryve [™] products was designed with the driver in mind. The OverDryve [™] 7C features an elegant user display that provides access to key items at a glance. Off the mount – for passengers in the car or after the drive – OverDryve [™] 7C is a fully loaded entertainment tablet that can be used to watch movies, access social media, and check email. In addition, a host of add-on accessories, sold separately, are available to sync with the device: The Rand McNally Wi-Fi [®] Backup Camera works with the OverDrvye [™] 7C to give a full-screen picture of what's behind a vehicle. There's no need for an extra dashboard screen; the camera app is pre-loaded on the OverDryve [™ ] 7C. The Rand McNally Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) enables drivers to monitor pressure and temperature on individual tires through the OverDryve [™] 7C, helping with tire safety and efficiency. Celebrating its 161 [st] anniversary this year, Rand McNally has been quietly shifting gears into a technology company in recent years. A major player in the commercial transportation markets – for 81 years – the company has leveraged its fast-growing telematics and fleet management expertise along with its award-winning commercial navigation to create a highly advanced, connected-car platform that is affordable and can be used in any car or light truck.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs Still Worth Buying Some stocks hit highs once and never come close again. These three stocks are different. Anders Bylund, Chuck Saletta, and Brian Feroldi (TMFZahrim) May 25, 2017 at 10:15AM Stocks breaking new ground with strong price gains are a dime a dozen. Often, 52-week highs can be frustratingly transient peaks, levels reached for very particular reasons and then never seen again. In the long run, you're really looking for stocks primed to set price records -- again and again. We asked three of our top Motley Fool contributors to share a few investment ideas in that vein, for which prices are riding high today but likely to soar even further in the future. Read on to see why they selected Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT). Image source: Getty Images. The gift that keeps on giving Anders Bylund (Netflix): Digital-video veteran Netflix has gone from strength to strength in recent quarters, and its share price has risen more than 60% in 52 weeks. The five-year picture looks even better, including a 7-for-1 stock split and a near-worldwide service expansion -- along with returns of 1,500%. In the last 10 years, Netflix has evolved from DVD mailers to digital streaming, survived the Qwikster debacle, and destroyed the old-school video-rental market along the way. Against that backdrop, Netflix investors have enjoyed a 4,650% gain. If you thought Netflix had reached its maximum value in the summer of 2011, you've missed out on its share price more than quadrupling from that high point. The stock also more than doubled from the all-time highs set three years ago, gained 33% from what might have felt like the end of the line in late 2015, and gained 27% in 2017 alone. And it reached fresh all-time record prices as recently as last week. If you think that it's different this time -- that Netflix shares are destined to head for lower prices and might never soar this high again -- I'm afraid you still don't see the big picture. The company has largely completed its worldwide rollout of streaming-video services and turned the spigot to "profit generation." Cash flows will remain negative for another few years due to Netflix's ambitious and cash-intensive content-production schedule, but that line will also turn green eventually. Share prices will surely follow suit. There may be a few bumps in the road ahead, but the long-term value-creation picture is clear. Netflix is the gift that keeps on giving, and will continue to be for years to come. A trading platform with room to run Brian Feroldi (MarketAxess Holdings): Stock investors have been buying and selling securities electronically for decades, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that transactions on the fixed-income market happen that way too. However, that's not the case at all. Even today the majority of fixed-income trading takes place in one-on-one transactions over the phone or by email. MarketAxess Holdings is a company that is trying to change that. It has created what has become the largest electronic bond-trading platform in the world, which enables its users to buy, sell, and research fixed-income securities with ease. Big money managers have been rapidly adopting this new platform for its increased transparency and rapid execution. Being a top dog and first mover in this marketplace has provided MarketAxess with a big advantage over potential rivals. Buyers and sellers naturally want to gravitate toward the biggest platform since it maximizes their trading opportunities and liquidity. That's allowed MarketAxess' top line to head in the right direction for years.  What's wonderful about this business is that MarketAxess' platform is highly scalable. Adding one more user and processing one more transaction costs very little, which allows the company's profit growth to outpace revenue growth. As an example, last quarter the company's revenue grew by 17% but its pre-tax income jumped more than 25% thanks to margin expansion. This has been going on for years, which is a big reason why the company's profits -- and stock price -- have been rising quickly. MKTX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. While MarketAxess has made a lot of progress at bringing the bond markets into the 21st century, the company still has plenty of market share left to capture. That potential hints that MarketAxess' profits should continue to soar for years to come, which I think makes this a top-notch stock to buy even though it is trading at a premium. An old-school retail titan that's proving it can still keep up with the times Chuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Fresh off the news that its online sales surged by over 60% year over year in the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart saw its shares near 52-week highs. The dramatic increase in its ability to sell stuff online -- including a strong push into grocery pickup I suggested four years ago -- is helping the company leverage its physical presence for its electronic sales. That Wal-Mart is finally figuring out ways to flex its incredible physical-distribution advantage to drive online sales is giving the market hopes that it can thrive in our ever more connected economy. What makes the stock still worth buying today despite trading near its 52-week high is the fact that its shares still look reasonably valued, even after that recent lift. Wal-Mart recently traded hands at just under 18 times its trailing earnings and around 17 times its forward earnings estimates. In addition, current market prices give shareholders a respectable 2.6% dividend yield, and Wal-Mart has increased that dividend for over 40 consecutive years. In a time when the S&P 500 is trading at around 25 times its trailing earnings and only pays a 1.9% dividend yield, Wal-Mart looks like a relative bargain. The competition driving the shifting marketplace is real, and Wal-Mart is only starting to establish its course in this era of merging online and offline retail. It has to continually prove its ability to thrive, but as of now, it looks like a recent marketplace winner with the opportunity to continue to grow. Anders Bylund owns shares of Netflix.

Gartner Announces Rankings of the 2017 Supply Chain Top 25 Unilever Retains the Top Spot in Rankings as Amazon Joins the "Masters" Winners Revealed at Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference in Phoenix, AZ. May 25, 2017 10:34 AM Eastern Daylight Time PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gartner, Inc. has released the findings from its annual Supply Chain Top 25, identifying supply chain leaders and highlighting their best practices. Analysts announced the results at the Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference, which is being held this week at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa in Phoenix, AZ. "2017 marks the 13th year of our annual Supply Chain Top 25 ranking," said Stan Aronow, research vice president at Gartner. "This year we have an impressive group of leaders with new lessons to share, including two more recent entrants from the high-tech and consumer product sectors." "Despite some striking performances, however, today's supply chain leaders face a much different business environment than just 12 months ago," said Mr. Aronow. "A general trend toward protectionism, as evidenced by Brexit and the policies of the current U.S. administration, has caused some companies to shift supply network design decisions and create contingency plans in anticipation of new trade policies. Continued investment in innovative supply chain capabilities will be required to meet this changing landscape." Unilever topped the Supply Chain Top 25 ranking for the second consecutive year in 2017, followed by McDonald's, Inditex, Cisco and H&M (see Table 1). Two new companies made the Supply Chain Top 25, with Nokia rejoining after a seven-year hiatus and Diageo making the list for the first time. Perennial supply chain leader Amazon joined Apple and P&G in qualifying for the "Masters" category, which Gartner introduced in 2015 to recognize sustained leadership over the last 10 years. "Hardly a day goes by without another announcement of Amazon's foray into a new market, ownership of its own logistics capabilities or filing of patents to improve customer experience," said Aronow. One indicator of Amazon's outsized influence on retail is the simultaneous real estate boom in distribution centers and bust of brick and mortar stores in the U.S. over the past two years. Apple continues to improve and innovate both its solutions and the means of producing them. While the company has backed off plans to produce its own cars, it is still actively working on autonomous vehicle technology and experimenting with augmented reality (AR) technologies. Consumer product giant P&G continues to innovate through digital automation of workflows, and the use of algorithm-driven tools to reduce exceptions and enable end-to-end planning. In recent years, P&G has also accelerated its investment in people and environmental initiatives. Along with the Masters category, the Supply Chain Top 25 continues to offer a platform for insights, learning, debate and contributions to the rising influence of supply chain practices on the global economy.

Source: Gartner (May 2017) Three key trends stand out this year for the supply chain leaders that are accelerating their capabilities, separating them further from the rest of the pack. Digitalization of Supply Chain The past few years have seen a massive shift in companies creating digital connections within and across their supply chain operations. Leading companies view digitalization as an opportunity to not only provide agile support for existing products, but to reduce time to market for new ones. Some of the most disruptive and impactful technologies include solutions combining Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, cloud computing and advanced analytics. Simulation and optimization capabilities have moved into the mainstream and now cognitive computing capabilities, including machine learning, are in the labs of the most advanced supply chains. The digital pieces of the supply chain puzzle are coming together in a way that will enable more holistic, real-time management of the entire ecosystem. Adaptive Organizations and Capabilities Interrelated with digitalized supply chains is the ability of companies to be more adaptive to changes in their value chains. More specifically, leaders are creating adaptive organizations and capabilities to survive and win independent of future supply-related constraints or customer needs. "Some of the more impressive supply chain organizations have created a modular supply chain service model that allows for variants of functional capabilities to be combined into "plug-and-play" segments, such as make-to-stock, configure-to-order or engineer-to-order manufacturing profiles," said Aronow. "This approach allows them to more quickly and flexibly support different business needs and outcomes, and speeds up activities such as M&A integration." Developing and Fostering Healthy Ecosystems Leading companies realize that supply chain success depends on the health and well-being of the critical ecosystems within and around them. The people aspect of supply chain ecosystems applies to relationships with suppliers, partners, employees and customers along the value chain. Leading supply chains focus as much on ethical sourcing and supporting customer well-being, as they do on talent acquisition and development. Environmental sustainability is another priority for top supply chain organizations that set ambitious stewardship goals in the areas of emissions, water and other natural resources. Companies that are further along in developing mature corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices tend to have moved beyond mere regulatory compliance and are linking these efforts back to support for their underlying corporate strategies. Gartner clients can read more in "The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2017." About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 The Supply Chain Top 25 rankings comprise two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and CSR data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past, while the opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score. Gartner analysts derive a master list of companies from a combination of the Fortune Global 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. In an effort to maintain the list of companies evaluated at a manageable level a general annual revenue threshold of $12 billion has been applied.

Republicans Say No by Elizabeth Dexheimer More stories by Elizabeth Dexheimer and Billy House @HouseInSession More stories by Billy House May 24, 2017, 7:56 PM EDT May 25, 2017, 12:41 PM EDT House said to strip contentious measure from Dodd-Frank revamp Durbin amendment has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion Wal-Mart and other retailers have beat back the finance industry’s latest lobbying campaign to let banks charge stores higher fees when customers use debit cards, according to two congressional aides with direct knowledge of the matter. House Republicans have been working on legislation to kill off key parts of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law, which imposed restrictions on Wall Street in the aftermath of the financial crisis. While banks dislike many aspects of the 2010 law, they have particular disdain for a provision known as the Durbin amendment that limits swipe fees, saying the caps have cost them billions of dollars in lost revenue. But the fee cap is a boon for retailers, which have repeatedly told lawmakers that consumers will be hurt if it’s removed. House GOP leaders have concluded they don’t have the votes to overhaul Dodd-Frank if their bill includes a repeal of Durbin, the two aides said. The decision to leave the debit-fee cap in place likely clears the way for a full House vote on the Dodd-Frank revamp as soon as next month, the aides said. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The decision on Durbin is a victory for the retail industry, which has spent millions of dollars lobbying politicians. The issue has always been a sensitive one for lawmakers, many of whom are loath to pick sides in a fight between powerful corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Members of Congress generally want cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. $9 Billion Debit-card fees are set by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. The provision that mandated the fee cap, which is named after Democratic Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, has cost lenders an estimated $9 billion, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bill to revamp Dodd-Frank’s post-financial crisis reforms was written by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, and included the repeal of the fee cap. Hensarling’s panel approved the legislation earlier this month, but he has faced resistance from other GOP lawmakers over the Durbin amendment. Hensarling said on Wednesday he would remove the provision. When House Republicans held an internal vote count this week, they found that scrapping Durbin would derail Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, said the aides who asked not to be named because the vote was private. House Republicans are eager to move the bill forward, as removing constraints that Dodd-Frank imposed on the finance industry is a top goal that is shared by President Donald Trump. Administration officials have repeatedly blamed Dodd-Frank for curtailing lending and economic growth. Contentious Provision “I’ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,” Hensarling said in a statement. “We won’t let this one provision hinder passage of an important-priority bill that will end bank bailouts and help renew economic growth for all Americans.” While other aspects of Dodd-Frank get more attention -- such as the Volcker Rule restriction on banks’ trading -- repealing Durbin has been one of the finance industry’s top priorities in Washington for years. The American Bankers Association, a lobbying group, pledged to keep fighting over the issue despite Wednesday’s setback. “This is unfortunate, but certainly not the end of this debate," James Ballentine, an ABA executive vice president said in a memo sent to banks. The group will “continue to work with and educate members who are interested in removing this language.” Fundraising Issue Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Group Inc., predicted the battle between retailers and banks is far from over, which he said is good news for lawmakers. “This is a great issue to fund-raise off of given how much it matters to banks, credit unions and merchants," Seiberg said in a note. Banks will continue to lobby for a removal of the cap and retailers may push for it to be expanded to include credit cards, he added. Regardless of what happens in the House, Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act faces long odds in the Senate, where most bills need some Democratic support to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this month that he’s not optimistic Congress will overhaul Dodd-Frank because of a lack of Democratic votes. The bill is H.R. 10.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rand McNally Develops and Ships Second Connected-Car Device, the OverDryve(TM) 7C The latest device from the OverDryve(TM) platform hits a price point to please many SKOKIE, Ill., May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nine months after launching the highly praised OverDryve™ 7 connected-car device, Rand McNally today revealed that it has produced a new OverDryve™ 7C unit that is more affordable but maintains most of the key features of the original device.  OverDryve™ 7C provides a powerful combination of hands-free information, entertainment, navigation, and safety features on a simple magnetic mount – making it the least expensive way to bring OverDryve's advanced luxury vehicle technology to any car. The new dashboard tablet is available at Walmart now with a suggested retail price of $199. "We are excited to expand the successful OverDryve™ line and provide drivers with an even more affordable connected-car hub. Rand McNally is on a mission to help drivers maximize capabilities while minimizing distractions," said Stephen Fletcher, CEO of Rand McNally. Fletcher debuted the OverDryve™ system last year at a packed press event at the Chicago Auto Show. The original OverDryve™ 7 device was sold exclusively at Best Buy through 2016 year end. Earlier this month the company unveiled a commercial version of the OverDryve™ product, the OverDryve™ 8 Pro for professional truck drivers. "OverDryve™ 7C delivers all the goodness of the original device in a streamlined package and simple mount," said Fletcher. "Just like the original, this new device has the power to modernize any vehicle by bringing the luxury car features we all want to any make, model, or vintage car." With more than 260 million cars and trucks on U.S. roads, the market for such a device is vast. In 2016, the average age of the American car increased to 11.6 years, according to IHS Markit.* That means a majority of the cars on the road don't have advanced connected luxury and safety features that newer vehicles offer. Key features include: Bluetooth® hands-free calling and texting Siri® and Google Now™ voice assistance A built-in dash cam The ability to stream music, news, weather, traffic, sports, and more – all through the car speakers Award-winning navigation from Rand McNally with lane guidance, warnings and other safety features A sleek, magnetic mount that makes attaching and removing the device a snap Plus, available tire pressure monitor and backup camera Everything about the OverDryve™ products was designed with the driver in mind. The OverDryve™ 7C features an elegant user display that provides access to key items at a glance. Off the mount – for passengers in the car or after the drive – OverDryve™ 7C is a fully loaded entertainment tablet that can be used to watch movies, access social media, and check email. In addition, a host of add-on accessories, sold separately, are available to sync with the device: The Rand McNally Wi-Fi® Backup Camera works with the OverDrvye™ 7C to give a full-screen picture of what's behind a vehicle. There's no need for an extra dashboard screen; the camera app is pre-loaded on the OverDryve™ 7C. The Rand McNally Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) enables drivers to monitor pressure and temperature on individual tires through the OverDryve™ 7C, helping with tire safety and efficiency. Celebrating its 161st anniversary this year, Rand McNally has been quietly shifting gears into a technology company in recent years. A major player in the commercial transportation markets – for 81 years – the company has leveraged its fast-growing telematics and fleet management expertise along with its award-winning commercial navigation to create a highly advanced, connected-car platform that is affordable and can be used in any car or light truck.

Shares of the company, headed by hedge-fund billionaire Eddie Lampert, were up 17 percent at $8.74 in early trading on Thursday. However, sales continued the years-long decline, hurt by lower demand for groceries, apparel and home appliances at the retailer’s Sears and Kmart stores. Sears, once the largest US retailer, has been struggling to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon. Sales at Sears’ US stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart it declined 11.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29. The company said in April it expected a net profit of between $185 million and $285 million for the first quarter, through a cost-cutting plan, which included store closures and cutting management jobs. Selling and general expenses decreased about 16 percent to $1.27 billion in the quarter, leading to a near-third drop in total costs to $4 billion. Sears said it cut up to $700 million in costs to date since announcing the plan in February. The company in March sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker for an upfront payment of $525 million. Net income attributable to Sears’ shareholders was $244 million, or $2.28 per share, compared with a loss of $471 million, or $4.41 per share, a year earlier. Excluding such one-time items, the company reported a net loss of $2.15 per share. Revenue fell 20.3 percent to $4.30 billion. Sears, which has been closing stores and divesting businesses for years to cope with falling sales and a growing debt pile, warned in March about its ability to continue as a going concern. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had fallen 18 percent since the retailer raised going concern doubts.

We’re collecting all of the stories here [https://www.sbnation.com/why-we-are-fans] and featuring the best ones across our network as well. Come Fan With Us! Hello. My name is John Lowe and I have been writing for the Smoking Musket for about 9 months (since August). Like many West Virginia fans, I was born in to being a Mountaineer. My dad went to WVU three times. Class of 1982 for petroleum engineering, class of 1988 for civil engineering, and class of 2000 for law. His sister also went to Morgantown for college and graduated with a degree in pharmacy in the early-mid 70s. Right now I’m pursuing a bachelor’s in journalism (Class of 2019) and my sister is working toward a degree in Spanish. Both at WVU. Most of my early WVU memories come from watching games on TV with my dad. Here we are at a NASCAR race in 2001. Pretty normal stuff for most Mountaineer fans. My fandom comes with the added wrinkle of being a townie. When I say townie, I mean EXTREME TOWNIE. I was born in 1995 at Mon General Hospital and have basically lived here ever since (My dad was transferred to Richmond, VA from 2000-02, but other than that...). I grew up in a Morgantown without the University or Suncrest Town Centers. There was only one Wal-Mart and it was in the Mountaineer Mall up off of 857. St. Francis High School was still behind the Burger King on Patterson Drive. University High School was on Price Street, not in the middle of nowhere. Mountaineer Field was MOUNTAINEER FIELD, not Milan Puskar Stadium, and seating stretched all the way around the field without those suites in the north endzone. The first WVU game that I remember was in 1998. We were playing Navy. I remember nothing from the game itself, but I just remember that we went. I’ve been a fan since the Mountaineer Field turf was teal After we came back from Richmond in 2002 (this is when I really start remembering stuff), we didn’t go to a whole lot of WVU football or basketball games. Either my dad couldn’t because of his schedule or we couldn’t afford tickets for all four of us. So, most of my entertainment came from MHS games. I was going to watch the Mohigans back when they won three state titles in four years. Plus, there was still that weird old track around the Pony Lewis Field... As you can clearly see that’s 2002. That season was the first of three state titles for MHS over the next four years The first game I really remember watching live was the 2005 Thanksgiving Backyard Brawl. I was wearing five layers. It was FREEZING out. Pat White ran all over Pitt, mainly because there was nothing stopping WVU that season and the Panthers were just awful. I kept watching games with my dad. We’d try to go to a game every year just the two of us. Those included the 2006 Cincinnati game, the 2007 East Carolina game (and another game that year I don’t want to mention), the 2008 Marshall game, and the 2009 Liberty game and we went to the 2010 Gator Bowl as a family. By this time, I was getting into middle school and I was beginning to figure out that I wanted to be a sports reporter. I’d start to keep nerdy sports statistics on my computer and keep track of every single college football and basketball game (something I still do to this day). During this time, I also played some middle school football. At South Middle, I played on the same team as another well-known WVU townie, Nathan Adrian. He probably doesn’t remember me, but I have interviewed him for the Associated Press after a few WVU games the past couple of years. He was our quarterback during the one season I played on the team and helped lead us to an 8-0 record and a Mon County Championship. When I was at Morgantown High, I was in the marching band. The band isn’t really a group of nerdy outcasts at MHS like it is at most other high schools across America. About 1 in every 5 MHS students were in the band because of all the awesome trips we took. In 2013, I got to be in the Rose Bowl Parade. I bring this up because another thing the band gets to do is sell those seat backs at WVU games. So during high school, I would go to every game to sell those things just so I could watch every Mountaineer game. My dad and I got to endure the 2011 Marshall game this way. RIP Stuart Scott Once every season during and just after high school, one of my best friends Derek would help get me into a game without having to work to do it. His dad is the maintenance supervisor of all of the university’s athletic facilities, so it was always easy. He would always get me into the big games too. These included the 2011 LSU game, the 2012 Baylor game, the 2013 Texas game, and the 2014 TCU game. At the TCU game, I almost got trampled by a Horned Frog running back (I’m the guy in the West Virginia hoodie): So this happened yesterday... A post shared by John Everett Brooke Lowe (@johneverettbrooke) on Nov 2, 2014 at 9:45am PST In 2014, I took a year off between high school and college, but I did get to enjoy some of the really great stuff that happened that season. Including the Baylor game, College Gameday, and the Liberty Bowl Grid View My GameDay sign ESPN College GameDay Liberty Bowl FUNNY SIDE STORY During my freshman year, I still got to be a fan for most of the football season (my first game in the press box was the 2015 Iowa State game). One of the first people I met at orientation was Chris Jackson (give him a follow @CJacksonWVU, one of the best at breaking WVU news). Over time, we have become good friends and have worked together at the DA. He has become relatively emotionless during games that he’s working (If you’re press, you have to be. I struggle to contain my fandom, just ask anyone who works at the DA or U92), but he wasn’t during our freshman year. He wrote a piece for the DA predicting that Jovon Durante would be the next great wide receiver out for WVU before he even played a snap. Related Jovon Durante could be next great playmaker for WVU passing game Chris would find out that he was right during the Georgia Southern game. When Durante caught that long TD pass, Chris LOST HIS MIND. He kept was jumping up and down in the student section screaming “I WAS RIGHT!” (Maybe Jovon should deliver a little more on that prediction this season. Am I right?) Since Thanksgiving weekend 2015, I’ve been doing most of my cheering in my head. I have been working media ever since. I know this was a lot of jumbled thoughts, but the university and Mountaineer football and basketball have been part of the fabric of my life since birth. As a townie, WVU has had an affect on every single day of my life. That’s why I’m a fan. NO PURCHASE NECESSARY.

Scott Vetoes Bill to Deregulate Stores FlaglerLive | May 25, 2017 He’ll have to wait: a prohibition-era law prevails. (FlaglerLive) Pointing to concerns about preserving small-business jobs, Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday vetoed a heavily debated and lobbied measure that supporters said would repeal a relic of the nation’s emergence from Prohibition.   The so called “liquor wall” law, which requires hard spirits to be sold in separate facilities from most retail goods, will remain in place after Scott’s veto of the repeal bill. The veto was a victory for independent liquor-store owners, ABC Fine Wine & Spirits and Publix Super Markets, which fought the bill during the legislative session that ended May 8.   Scott’s decision on the proposal (SB 106) also ends for now the noisy legislative battles about the issue. Supporters of eliminating the law, including retailers Target, Costco and Walmart, argued that a repeal would promote free markets and customer convenience.   “We have made tremendous progress in the last four years, and there is a clear momentum in Florida for this common-sense approach to liquor sales,” said Michael Williams, a spokesman for the group Floridians for Fair Business Practices, which supported the repeal. “While Governor Scott ultimately chose to veto Senate Bill 106, we look forward to working with state leaders in the future to finally put an end to this outdated, Prohibition-era law.”   Scott, in a letter accompanying his first vetoed bill of the year, said the proposal’s impact on small businesses outweighed his desire to further cut regulations.   “I carefully reviewed this bill and I have met with stakeholders on both sides,” Scott said. “I listened closely to what they had to say and I understand that both positions have merit. Nevertheless, I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida. I was a small business owner and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will impact their families and their ability to create jobs.”   “I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida.” Opponents of the bill argued that a repeal would hurt small liquor stores, eliminate jobs, result in a greater ability for minors to get liquor and lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol.   “We applaud Governor Scott for saving hundreds of Florida small businesses that employ thousands of Floridians, while at the same time keeping safeguards in place for minors,” ABC Fine Wine & Spirits Chief Executive Officer and President Charles Bailes said in a prepared statement.   Along with the independent liquor stores, Publix has been involved because it operates stand-alone liquor stores in many of the same shopping centers as its grocery stores. Meanwhile, retailers such as Target and Walmart — battling online sales — have been looking to sell liquor in the same stores where shoppers pick up groceries and other goods.   The bill was highly controversial, passing the Senate in a 21-17 vote and the House by a 58-57 margin.   Members of the Florida Independent Spirits Association, which also opposed the repeal, mobilized after the bill received final legislative approval April 26.   “More than 1,000 letters and 3,000 petitions from around the state were delivered to the governor with the message that vetoing this bill would save our Florida small retailers and jobs that help our local economies,” Florida Independent Spirits Association President Rory Eggers said in a release thanking Scott.   In addition to repealing the Depression-era law, the bill would have prohibited new package stores from being licensed within 1,000 feet of schools; required small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter; and required that checkout clerks under the age of 18 be supervised by people 18 or older when alcohol is purchased. To help Publix with its existing leases, the bill would have staggered the repeal, limiting the percentage of liquor that could have been stocked in chain stores over a four-year period.   Scott had until Wednesday to act on the bill. As the deadline approached, he offered little as to what he would do.   Scott on Tuesday scheduled a telephone call with Walmart President and CEO Greg Foran and a meeting at the Capitol with Bailes of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits.   Bailes said after his meeting he had no indication how Scott would handle the bill.   “I think he’ll do the best thing for the state,” Bailes said. “He gave me the opportunity to state what our position is, which hasn’t changed, and he was very gracious about it.”   On Wednesday, Scott attended the summer board meeting for the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, which was part of the coalition pushing to tear down the wall. –Jim Tuner, News Service of Florida Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions?

The Hoffman Estates-based company’s losses widened to $222 million, or $2.15 per share on weak sales. The company has been closing stores and selling brands long affiliated with Sears, including Craftsman. A year ago the company reported a loss of $181 million. Revenue fell 20 percent, to $4.3 billion, and sales at established stores sales fell 11.9 percent. In March, Sears Holdings Corp. said there is “substantial doubt” it could continue as a viable concern, with intense pressure coming from companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon.com. It has insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. RELATED: Sears gets more time to pay creditors Sears CEO blasts power tool supplier in blogpost Sears in $900 million deal to sell iconic Craftsman brand Asset sales have bought the retailer time, but it said recently that pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January that it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February. The company has lost more than $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. “While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing,” Chairman Eddie Lampert said in a company release. “We recognize that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25 billion restructuring program.” Lampert’s hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep Sears afloat. The company remains in a “tenuous” position, according to Evercore analyst Greg Melich, with operating losses showing no sign of improvement and sales in freefall. “Sears does not appear well positioned for the rest of 2017,” Melich said, citing its weak store base, anemic sales and continued market share loss in most major categories.

These companies have developed fantastic brands and wonderful products and services, but the downside to the proliferation of superstar companies is equally real: They are destroying local economies, driving down workers’ wages, shackling growth, depressing entrepreneurship and increasing the inequality that’s ripping our country apart. And for all the talk about disruptive technologies, it’s getting worse. Census Bureau statistics show that about three-fourths of U.S. business sectors have become more concentrated in the past 20 years, as indicated by an ever-growing market share for the top companies in hundreds of sectors, from dog food to health insurance. About 10% of the economy is deemed to be highly concentrated, with almost all of the revenue in those niches going to just a few companies. Many industries are effectively controlled by fewer than 10 companies. And it’s not obscure backwaters of the economy. These are goods and services we buy every day. Think of big-box retailers, airlines, express-delivery companies, drug makers, car makers, insurers, banks, media companies, phone companies, software companies, electronics makers, aerospace firms, vast swathes of the internet and even slaughterhouses. Think of companies like Alphabet (GOOG) Apple (AAPL) Facebook (FB) Microsoft (MSFT) General Motors (GM) AT&T (T) UPS (UPS) Altria (MO) Wal-Mart (WMT) and American Express (AXP) and dozens more. The largest highly concentrated businesses Segment Market share of top four companies Annual revenue in segment (2012) Warehouse clubs & supercenters 93.6% $406 billion Drug wholesalers 72.1% $319 billion Auto & truck manufacturing 68.6% $231 billion Drug stores 69.5% $230 billion Mobile-phone service 89.4% $225 billion Airlines 65.3% $157 billion Administration of pension funds 76.3% $145 billion Landline-phone service 73.4% $142 billion Cable TV 71.1% $138 billion Airplane manufacturing 80.1% $113 billion As of the 2012 Economic Census The list includes almost all of the biggest companies in America. Almost all of the gains in the stock market come from these few corporations. And they earn almost all of the profits. In many cases, the dominant companies have licenses, patents, copyrights or other intellectual property that lock out potential competitors. They have powerful brands that command a premium. They take advantage of network effects, which create natural monopolies. They lobby governments for subsidies or special regulatory favors. To snuff out competition, they acquire potential rivals or lock up supplies of essential inputs, including skilled labor. They control distribution channels. In some cases, those few companies act more like a cartel than they do competitors. Their size gives them economies of scale that smaller rivals can’t match. In other words, these companies are protected by high barriers to entry, what famed investor Warren Buffett calls a “moat.” A moat protects the company, keeping profits higher than they would be if it faced real, fair competition. “So what’s the problem?” you may say. After all, these companies are winners, they’re giving the people what they want — stop punishing success. For decades, economists, jurists and policy makers thought the same thing. As long as consumers weren’t harmed, they ignored the increasing concentration of American and global industries, figuring that there wasn’t much to worry about. But lately, there’s been a lot more attention paid to the downside of the monopolization of America. Here are the three biggest problems with our winner-take-all economy. Wages are lower; profits are higher The most damning charge is that the trend toward larger companies is driving a wedge between the few at the top who are paid spectacularly well and the majority at the bottom whose wages are stagnant. Economists David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen concluded in a recent paper that the rise of “superstar” firms with high profits and relatively small workforces has contributed to the shrinkage in workers’ share of national income and a corresponding increase in the share of profits. Economists Jason Furman and Alan Krueger argue that some firms are able to tamp down wages through what’s called monopsonistic behavior, such as collusion and noncompete agreements. (A monopsony is a company that exercises power as the only buyer, analogous to a monopolist who is the only seller.) Collusion to depress wages is prevalent in high-tech, entertainment and health care.© Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. The median corporation gets a return on invested capital of about 20%, but the top 10% of companies hit 100%, a sign that they are extracting economic rents due to their market power. Furman and Peter Orszag, meanwhile, found that a small number of companies use their market power to capture extraordinary 100% returns on invested capital, compared with typical profits of 20% or so. Local economies are hollowed out Once upon a time, back in the economy’s golden age, every city had a local department store or two, as well as other businesses with deep roots in the community, such as banks, newspapers, TV stations, factories, drug stores, utilities and others. The owners and the top managers of those businesses lived in the community, and felt a sense of civic pride that went beyond noblesse oblige. They were the paternalistic philanthropists who funded the arts, the parks, the libraries, the schools and the hospitals. The money generated by those businesses stayed local, keeping the regional economy chugging along. But now the owners and top managers have moved on, replaced by the faceless, faraway investors that George Packer described in “The Unwinding.” The new bosses have no place for sentimentality, as Christopher Lasch observed in his prophetic “The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy” more than 20 years ago. They care about their bottom line, their summer house and their private school; they don’t care about Youngstown. Locally owned businesses are better for communities, many researchers have found. They hire more local workers, they buy from local suppliers, and the revenue they receive is recycled locally, rather than in the Hamptons or Shanghai. The presence of lots of local businesses even seems to lower the crime rate. Local businesses appear to be a public good, something state and local economic development agencies should consider the next time they try to lure a big multinational corporation. Business dynamism suffers The potential profits and wealth earned by a winner-take-all company ought to provide a great incentive for entrepreneurs to start new businesses with the hope of becoming a dominant firm themselves, but the trend is going the wrong way: For all the talk about disruptive companies, there are fewer startups now than there were decades ago, in part because the barriers to entry into these lucrative markets are so high that few entrepreneurs even try. © Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. The number of new companies formed each year is down sharply. Many of the new tech startups never get the chance to compete with the established companies, because as soon as they prove their technology, they are acquired. The big five tech firms — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — have acquired more than 500 companies in the past decade. The most profitable companies in America aren’t reinvesting much in their businesses. For them, it’s more profitable to restrict production and dampen supply than it is to invest in expanding their capacity. If would-be rivals can’t mount an effective attack on their moat, the entrenched companies have a reduced incentive to research and develop the next big thing. Innovation suffers, and that means the economy isn’t growing as fast as it could. Conclusion The economy is indeed rigged against the majority in favor of a few. It’s not just a few banks that are “too big to fail.” It’s not just a few heavily regulated industries, or the new frontiers of high-tech. Most of the highly successful businesses are privileged. Many critics of our stagnant economy say the problem is globalization, and their answer is to control the borders. But the problems of business concentration would be just as debilitating if the United States were a completely closed economy. The global nature of these businesses isn’t the core problem; concentration is. The winner-take-all economy is making losers out of American workers and communities. We desperately need more competition. Our economy needs to be constantly renewed through the process of creative destruction, but that’s not happening.

The company's shares were up 17 percent at US$8.74 in early trading on Thursday. However, sales continued the years-long decline, hurt by lower demand for groceries, apparel and home appliances at the retailer's Sears and Kmart stores. Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc . Sales at Sears' U.S. stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart it declined 11.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29. Advertisement Advertisement The company said in April it expected a net profit of between US$185 million and US$285 million for the first quarter, through a cost-cutting plan, which included store closures and cutting management jobs. Selling and general expenses decreased about 16 percent to US$1.27 billion in the quarter, leading to a near-third drop in total costs to US$4 billion. Sears said it cut up to US$700 million in costs to date since announcing the plan in February. The company in March sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc for an upfront payment of US$525 million. Net income attributable to Sears' shareholders was US$244 million, or US$2.28 per share, compared with a loss of US$471 million, or US$4.41 per share, a year earlier. Excluding such one-time items, the company reported a net loss of US$2.15 per share. Revenue fell 20.3 percent to US$4.30 billion. Sears, which has been closing stores and divesting businesses for years to cope with falling sales and a growing debt pile, warned in March about its ability to continue as a going concern. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen 18 percent since the retailer raised going concern doubts.

Trump will be attending the G-7 summit later this week. The senators warned that backing out of the Paris Agreement after years of painstaking negotiations and strong U.S. leadership it took to get the world to this point would be a self-inflicted injury to America's credibility and influence on the world stage. More than 1,000 companies of all sizes - worth more than $1.2 trillion annually - have affirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement by signing the Business Backs Low-Carbon USA pledge, they say. They include ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Walmart, Microsoft, Google, and Mars. Earlier this week, more than 200 global investors wrote to the leaders of the G7 nations, who are set to meet May 26-27 in Sicily, Italy, urging them to stand by the Paris Agreement. Trump has been highly critical of the Paris Agreement, and according to a Trump Administration official, the President would stay in this international deal only if he feels that it would improve the U.S. economy and create jobs. The U.S. Government in March revoked the Clean Power Plan, introduced by the Obama administration in 2015 to restrict greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired U.S. power plants.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Miami Marlins Debut CLR Roasters Home Game Commercial MIAMI, FL–(Marketwired – May 25, 2017) – CLR Roasters‚ Café La Rica espresso, „The official Cafecito of the Miami Marlins”, formally debuted its home game commercial video on the main ballpark jumbotron of the 37,442-seat Marlins Park during the 7th Inning Stretch on May 10. The video was launched and incorporated into the Marlins’ game against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 1:22 minute video, with its energetic Cuban-inspired beat, showcases coffee making, preparation and enjoyment — from CLR production to ballpark cup — featuring select Marlin Fans and the CLR Roasters’ staff. Miami-based CLR Roasters is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Youngevity International, Inc. (OTCQX: YGYI). Watch Video Here: http://youngevity.com/index.cfm/blog-and-resources/news-articles/seventh-inning-stretch-may-2017/ The video was an enjoyable part of the „seventh-inning stretch” tradition, held in the middle of the seventh inning, enabling Marlins fans to get up, stretch their arms and legs, walk around and enjoy refreshments. It is a popular interval for enjoying snacks and beverages — as food and beverage vendor sales end after the seventh inning. „Café La Rica espresso and CLR Roasters are respectively, a homegrown Miami coffee beverage and a homegrown Miami company,” stated Ernesto Aguila, President of CLR, and Founder of the Café La Rica Brand. „What better opportunity than to co-brand the Company and the Espresso with the hometown MLB team, the terrific Miami Marlins and their loyal Miami fans. When not at their favorite baseball game — fans can purchase Café La Rica espresso at Publix, Presidente, Fresco Y Más, Sedanos, Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie and a variety of local independent stores. Perhaps that terrific Café La Rica espresso that fans sample at Marlins Park will be the espresso brand that they can enjoy at home.” „We are excited to showcase our partnership with CLR Roasters,” stated Brendan Cunningham, SVP of the Miami Marlins. „The fan reaction to Café La Rica has been beyond our expectations, and we look forward to a long and mutually prosperous relationship.” Café La Rica espresso is a unique blend of the finest coffees, offering a fine aroma, thick crema, and a bold flavor true to the authentic Cuban coffee tradition. Over the course of the past 3 years, Café La Rica has become one of the fastest growing espresso brands in the Southeast United States. This co-branding opportunity with the Miami Marlins is expected to further enhance Cafe La Rica’s relationship with its retail partners. Acquired in 2011, CLR is a full-sized coffee roaster division that operates a 50,000 sq. ft roasting plant and distribution facility. CLR produces gourmet coffees under its own boutique brands, private label brands, and for Youngevity under JavaFit® and Be the Change Coffee. One hundred percent of the profits from Youngevity Be the Change Coffee support operations for the Youngevity Be The Change Foundation. CLR Roasters maintains the following certifications: USDA Organic, Fair Trade, Café de Colombia (sustainability focused) and OU Kosher. The division has obtained its Safe Quality Food (SQF level) two Certification. About CLR Roasters Youngevity’s coffee manufacturing division, CLR Roasters, was established in 2001 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary.
