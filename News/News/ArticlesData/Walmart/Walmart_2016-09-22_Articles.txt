The proposed route. Proposed schedule for the new 'Route 65' in North Adams. PreviousNext BRTA Considering New Loop Route for North Adams By Tammy DanielsiBerkshires Staff 06:24PM / Friday, September 23, 2016Print | Email Administrator Robert Malnati says he rides the bus when he can to see how things are working. NORTH ADAMS, Mass. — The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority is considering a new loop in North Adams as a way to get its riders where they need to go in a faster and cost-neutral manner. Dubbed "Route 65" for the moment, the loop as currently proposed would start and end at the Walmart Supercenter on Curran Highway every hour starting at 6:30 a.m. Route 1 from Walmart south would continue until 6:30 p.m. The loop route would hit the Ocean State Job Lots plaza (turnaround), Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Main Street, two stops at Mohawk Forest, Berkshire Medical Center North Adams, and then the reverse. The Walmart and Main Street stops would be timed to line up with Route 1 (Pittsfield-North Adams) and Route 3 (Williamstown-North Adams), respectively. Currently, Route 1 travels from Pittsfield to Main Street, North Adams, but changes to Route 31 as it heads to Mohawk Forest. Then it changes Route 33 to BMC North. The creation of the North Adams loop is expected to cut a half-hour of travel between the two cities. Administrator Robert Malnati said the input from public hearings like Friday morning's at First Baptist Church would inform plans to be presented to the BRTA board of director next week. If approved, any changes would likely start near the beginning of November. The wish list for years has been to add evening and possibly weekend services, he said. Those have consistently shown up on surveys dating back some years. "If we had that extra money, this is how we would spend it," Malnati said the agency has told Beacon Hill. "We would implement later evening services, we would try out a few different routes, see how they go how that would be received and eventually morph into a Sunday service, maybe Saturday." But that's not happening this year, he told the handful of residents at the public hearing on route changes. "There is no extra money coming from the state, in fact, our budget is based on a budget from two years ago." The regional transportation funding for the entire state has been set by the governor at $80 million; in fiscal 2015 and 2016, legislators had overridden that to bump up funding. RTAs had hoped for more in this fiscal year, but it didn't happen. "We're stuck at an $82 million pot for us," Malnati said. "That translates to about $2.5 million for us. Fixed route service alone costs us over $4 million to put on the street as it is. ... "What we're trying to do is tweak it and make it more user-friendly, to go where we need to go without incurring additional costs because we know it's not coming from the state." Regular rider Yesmine Sarkis wondered if there was a way that customers could help. "It affects the economy overall. People can't afford to go back and forth to work," she said. "I wish we could get the public on board as well." Malnati, however, said the transit authority was heavily subsidized by the state and that raising fares as revenue would affect those who couldn't afford it. Walmart was determined as a good waypoint because people often needed to go there whether working or shopping. In response to questions, Malnati said the company had in the past provided bus shelters for its stop but the BRTA had not approached it about further funding. The idea was to develop more of an express along the routes by using the Walmart as a transfer point. A smaller bus would be used for the North Adams loop and riders would pick up the larger bus headed for Pittsfield. "We want to make sure people understand that this should be the same amount of time and Walmart is not the end of the destination," Malnati said. Kenneth Birck, also a regular rider, said riders are going to be worried about making their connections and transfers. "There are going to be a lot of people unhappy ... because they have to transfer," he said. A stop at the Cheshire post office on Route 1 would only be used on demand. That alleviated some of the concern raised by Richard Greene about safety issues with the large bus exiting from Richardson Street in Cheshire on its northbound runs. Malnati said they would look into a turnaround to have the bus return to Route 8 at the light on Church Street if it stops at the post office. The Route 7 bus, which is subsidized in part by Williams College to provide access for its students to local schools and Pittsfield, may be discontinued or reduced to only morning and afternoon because of low ridership. Malnati said the route would be weighed at the end of the month when the numbers are in. He also said off-service buses, those ending or starting their shifts, could be become active. It didn't make sense for a bus ending its run by going to Pittsfield, or starting by leaving Pittsfield, not to carry passengers. Those attending did not have any comments specifically opposed to the route change but did warn that the BRTA may run into some problems. Kenneth Birck, also a regular rider, said switching to a smaller bus could cause congestion at the beginning of the month because many people were doing their shopping at Walmart. "Even the big buses get busy on the first of the month at Walmart," he said, especially with the added number of people using wheelchairs. "You're ridership is way up ... first of the month you see a huge increase in ridership." Sarkis said the bus drivers are often in a situation where someone in a wheelchair or with too many items has to be left behind for the next bus. "That poor driver is trying to be courteous but someone gets left behind," she said. "During that first part of the month, you might want to have the big bus." They also suggested having a backup vehicle. Those who are eligible for paratransit don't always use it because of the cost, said Birck. "That's something we're going to have to wrestle with. Do we need another bus and where would we stage it?" Malnati said. There were also questions on small amounts left on Charlie Cards that bus drivers can't accept; those can be brought to the Intermodal Center in Pittsfield to be combined or added to. Malnati said the BRTA has no control over the administration of the cards. People are also bringing their bikes more, which Malnati said was a good thing but which, at the same time, illustrated that the BRTA wasn't serving some populations because they needed bikes to get home because no buses were running. The authority now has two-bike racks on buses and is looking at installing three-bike ones. Malnati also plans to ask the general manager about adding a transfer point in Allendale in Pittsfield because riders now have to go back to the Intermodal Center to pick up Route 1 back to North Adams. Several people also encouraged the BRTA to have more information posted on buses to let riders know what was happening and said drivers should be able to provide updated information. Both Birck and Sarkis said BRTA drivers, in general, were a conscientious and friendly group who often know their riders and their families. "There's a genuine caring there," Sarkis said, calling the daily riders and drivers a kind of family. "They care about what's going on in our life."

Customers using the free service can browse about 30,000 items in Walmart’s grocery inventory, and millions of additional items available at Walmart.com. A $30 minimum purchase is required. They choose a pickup location and time they intend to arrive — from later that day up to three weeks in the future. The customers are then instructed by e-mail and phone where at their store to seek out their purchases. Typically, they would not have to leave their cars but just call a phone number provided to them.

LOCAL L.A. Now Boy on scooter sets fire to Walmart merchandise and causes $1 million in damage, police say Walmart fire AFP/Getty Images A 12-year-old boy was arrested after starting a fire inside a Walmart in Barstow and causing $1.2 million in damage, deputies said. A 12-year-old boy was arrested after starting a fire inside a Walmart in Barstow and causing $1.2 million in damage, deputies said. (AFP/Getty Images) Veronica Rocha With the flick of a lighter, a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the crafts section of a Barstow Walmart this week, causing at least $1 million worth of damage, police said. The boy rode off after setting fire to the merchandise around 2 p.m. Wednesday, police said. He was found later that day in a neighborhood nearby and arrested on suspicion of arson, said Barstow Police Lt. Chris Kirby. The giant retail store at 621 Montara Road has remained closed due to water, fire and smoke damage throughout the building, he said. “That’s a substantial loss for Walmart,” Kirby said, adding that the incident also required many firefighting resources. The boy wasn’t with his parents when he set the fire, police said. Surveillance video showed the boy — who was wearing a backpack and green T-shirt with distinct markings — igniting the crafts and then riding out of the store on his scooter, Kirby said. Several Walmart employees attempted to douse the flames with fire extinguishers but were unsuccessful, police said. Three employees suffered from smoke inhalation and were treated at the scene. Eventually, firefighters from Barstow Fire Protection District were able to snuff the blaze. After discovering that the fire was likely arson, police began talking to witnesses and looking at evidence. They searched surrounding neighborhoods for the boy. Finally, police spotted the boy as he rode his scooter near Rimrock Road and Opal Street. He was taken into custody and his parents were notified, police said. He has not been identified because he is a minor.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Justin Timberlake Abandons Sexy, Premieres Trolls Soundtrack in Every Walmart in America Anna Gaca // September 23, 2016 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Getty Images Did you go to Walmart this week? What were you looking for? A 64-pack of paper towels? A rifle? The sudden realization that your teen idols will never again carry the glow of youth and creativity they once did? Well, you were in luck: Yesterday, Bud Light Platinum enthusiast Justin Timberlake, once hailed for bringing sexy back, premiered the soundtrack to Trolls, an animated film based on a fad toy, at Walmart. At every Walmart. Trolls: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack debuted “in all 3,900 Walmart stores across their in-house radio station, Walmart Radio,” Sony/RCA said in a press release. (Not to nitpick, but: there are actually only 3,868 U.S. Walmarts.) Walmart Radio, yes, is a real station—it’s played in every Walmart store since 2015. It even has real human DJs, plucked from the ranks of ordinary Walmart employees, who probably never get a chance to premiere much of anything. If you didn’t shop at Walmart yesterday, you aren’t missing much. You’ve almost certainly already heard Timberlake’s lead single, the insipid “Can’t Stop the Feeling.” But have you heard the remix, featuring the backing vocals of his Trolls co-stars James Corden, Zooey Deschanel, Anna Kendrick, and Gwen Stefani? That’s four more unstoppable feelings. There’s also “What U Workin’ With?,” a Stefani/Timberlake collab. True story: I’ve abandoned brick-and-mortar stores mid-purchase because “Can’t Stop the Feeling” came on. No material item is worth getting that thing stuck in my head. Its success as a #1 single doesn’t change the fact that this whole endeavor should be beneath the Timberlakes and Stefanis of this world. The worst part, honestly, is that Trolls isn’t even out yet; this dumb movie doesn’t even hit theaters until November 2. That’s five and a half more weeks of “Can’t Stop the Feeling” on the radio, and then you’re going to end up seeing the movie with your baby cousins over Thanksgiving weekend and you’ll have to hear the whole soundtrack in action. Prepare yourself.

Barclays analyst Karen Short raised her rating on Wal-Mart’s stock WMT, -0.30%  to overweight from equal weight, and said the company was her “top pick” in the U.S. food and staples retailing sector. She raised her price target on the shares to $87, which is 20% above Friday’s closing price of $72.35, from $70. But Short said there is a good chance--“with a 70% probability”--that the shares could run up to $95, which would be 5% above the Jan. 8, 2015 record close of $90.47. “After years of struggling, we believe the changes made under new Walmart U.S. leadership are gaining traction, and we believe the turnaround is in the early stages,” Short wrote in a note to clients. “We also believe competitors have become somewhat dismissive of Walmart, and we believe this will prove to be a fatal strategic error.” FactSet The good news for potential investors, is that despite the recent improvement in sales results and the rally in the stock price, Short doesn’t believe the turnaround is priced in yet. She said only about one-fifth of the Wall Street analysts covering Wal-Mart have a bullish rating on the stock. The ratio of Wal-Mart’s stock price to earnings per share over the last 12 months—P/E ratio—was 15.59, according to FactSet. That compares with the implied P/E ratio of 20.04 for the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLP, -0.08%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08%  P/E ratio of 17.65. “The stock is trading at a meaningful discount to the staples universe, and is clearly not being valued as a turnaround,” Short wrote. Don’t miss: Wal-Mart’s market share gain is Target’s loss, analysts say. That appears to already be changing, as Wal-Mart’s stock has run up 18% so far this year, while the consumer staples ETF has gained 5.6% and the Dow has tacked on 4.8%. The following are some changes Wal-Mart has made that Short believes helped trigger the turnaround: • Labor—The multiyear downtrend in the number of employees per U.S. store, and employees per 1,000 square feet of store space, bottomed last year. The company announced the first of two wage increases in April 2015, and offered all hourly U.S. employees an opportunity at a quarterly bonus of $550 based on sales, profit and customer experience. • Service—Walmart has implemented goals for achieving milestones for being clean, fast and friendly. Investments in wage rates and training have led to employees who were more engaged with customer service. • Fresh—A commitment was made to improve the quality of its grocery offerings, to have more locally sourced and organic products. • Assortment—New systems were put in place to help store managers use sales data more effectively. Managers were also given control over certain merchandise space for localization and the ability to markdown products. • Digital-to-physical—The company has joined other retailers in expanding the option to order groceries online and then pick them up at the store, which is known in the industry as click-and-collect. The company also announced in August plans to buy discount e-commerce retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion.

Attorney Michael Wright, who represents the family of John Crawford III in a federal wrongful-death lawsuit delayed by the department's investigation, told the Dayton Daily News (http://bit.ly/2ctqeKm) he is meeting with Lynch on Sept. 30. "We would hope that they would give us a little insight with regards to the investigation on why it's taking so long," Wright said Thursday. Department of Justice officials didn't immediately return calls for comment Friday. Officers went to the Beavercreek Wal-Mart on Aug. 5, 2014, after a man called 911 to report, in a recorded call, that someone was walking around waving an apparent rifle and "pointing it at people." Police said they believed Crawford had a real weapon and didn't respond to commands to put it down. Crawford had an air rifle from a store shelf. Officer Sean Williams, who shot Crawford, was cleared by a Greene County special grand jury a month after the shooting. Wright had sent a letter to Lynch in July asking the Department of Justice to wrap up its investigation by the end of August. "We want the investigation to either move forward or to stop," Wright said. "Because at this point, it is preventing us from doing anything in this case." Wright wants to depose Williams and another officer, but a federal judge has allowed the officers to avoid that process because of the Department of Justice investigation. "I don't know who's not doing what, but something has to be done," Wright said. "Something has to be done to prevent the types of killings that we are seeing day in and day out in this country." Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. ___ Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Tom Mirandi, vice president of real estate at RD Management, said tenant announcements are expected in early 2017 at Academy Plaza, a brand new project to be anchored by Academy Sports + Outdoors and surrounded by 36,000 square feet of additional mid-sized retail space. Demolition is nearing completion at the site, which was home to Walmart until fall 2014 when the retailer moved to 3031 Memorial Parkway S.W. "We've gotten a lot of interest in the property," Mirandi said. "Unfortunately, we're unable to disclose anything specific, but we are speaking with a number of retailers, mostly national retailers, to occupy that space." Academy Sports will span about 63,000 square feet and create approximately 100 jobs when it opens next year. The nearest Academy stores are on U.S. 72 in Huntsville-annexed Madison County and Wimberly Drive in Decatur. Additional retail could be single-use or multi-tenant, but Mirandi doesn't expect any freestanding restaurants at the site, which has a two-way average traffic count of 93,000 cars per day and a population of 63,419 within three miles. When Walmart left the Drake Avenue site nearly two years ago, many residents worried about blight at the property. Mirandi said the redevelopment of the prime retail corridor is a "tremendous opportunity" for the community. "We own shopping centers all over the country so we are very adept at doing these kinds of projects," Mirandi said. "We have relationships with retailers all over the country so I think everybody will be very pleased at the end of the day with the outcome of the development, especially considering where it's coming from: from a large vacant box to something that's going to be new and vibrant."

A short straddle is an options strategy that profits when a stock's price doesn't move. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Sep 23, 2016 at 1:06PM Image Source: Getty Images A short straddle is a neutral options strategy that entails writing uncovered, or naked, calls and puts simultaneously, at the same strike price and expiration, on a certain underlying stock. With a short straddle, the potential for profit is limited, but the downside risk is not. Setting up a short straddle A straddle means to either buy or sell a call and a put option on the same underlying stock, at the same strike price and expiration. A long straddle consists of buying both a call and a put, and is essentially a bet on a large price movement in the stock. On the other hand, a short straddle consists of selling both a call and a put -- it is a bet that the stock will go nowhere. For example, let's say that I'm convinced that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) will stay around its current price for at least the next month or so. As I write this, Wal-Mart trades for just shy of $73, so I could set up a short straddle using options expiring in about four weeks as follows: Sell one call option with a strike price of $73 for $1.27 per share Sell one put option with a strike price of $73 for $1.38 per share Keep in mind that since options contracts are written for 100 shares apiece, this trade would generate $265 in premium income for each call-put pair you sell. The best-case scenario The ideal case would be for the stock to close exactly at the strike price when the options expire. If this were to occur, you would keep the options premium you collected and both contracts would expire worthless, leaving you with no further obligation. In our Wal-Mart example, this means that our maximum profit is $265, minus whatever trading commissions you pay. Unfortunately, this isn't a perfect world, and this ideal case doesn't usually happen. So, let's take a look at the other ways this trade could play out. Breakeven points and loss potential Your breakeven points for a short straddle are the strike price of the options, plus or minus the total premium you collected. In the Wal-Mart example, this translates to $70.35 and $75.65. If the stock ends up within this range at expirations, you'll make money. If it ends up outside of this range, you'll end up with a loss. Source: Author It's important to point out that with a short straddle, you can lose money quickly if the trade doesn't go your way. Let's say that a market correction hits and Wal-Mart falls to $60 per share. If this were to happen, you'd be sitting on a loss of more than $1,000. Because there is technically no limit to how high a stock's price can climb, the amount of money you can lose on a short straddle is unlimited. Make sure you keep this in mind as you decide whether the relatively small profit is worth the risk. The bottom line on short straddles Short straddles can lose money fast, so they are rarely the best approach to make a profit from a neutral outlook. There are several good alternatives, such as a butterfly spread, iron butterfly, or iron condor, just to name a few. All of these earn profits if the stock stays in a narrow range, but have components that help limit your loss potential. I'm not saying that a short straddle never makes sense -- rather, I'm saying that you need to know exactly what you're getting into. And you'd better be pretty confident about the trade.

 Walmart forges processing partnership with Chase BI Intelligence Sep. 23, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,524 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. BII See Also American Express has linked up with Global Payments Chase has debuted a new card aimed at small businesses Green Dot is looking to a younger audience JPMorgan Chase announced that it will begin processing Chase Visa payments made at US Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, along with Sam's Club's website, through ChaseNet, the bank’s closed-loop processing network for Chase Visa cards. The partnership marks an expansion of the relationship between ChaseNet and Walmart, which was previously confined to Walmart e-commerce processing.  It’s probable that Chase Visa cards comprise a significant share of Walmart’s overall card payments. Eighty percent of US consumers prefer debit or credit cards for both in-person and online payments, according to TransFirst, which means it’s likely that a considerable amount of Walmart’s purchasing comes from payment cards. Because Chase, which issues predominantly Visa cards, is the largest US bank by assets, it’s likely that it’s the issuer of a decent share of cards used for spending at Walmart. As such, it’s likely the number of payments the partnership will cover is not insubstantial.  That makes the expansion of the partnership a major opportunity for ChaseNet. ChaseNet was already processing Walmart e-commerce payments. Last year, Walmart’s digital sales totaled $14 billion, according to Fortune. And that’s a segment that’s growing — global online sales grew nearly 12% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2016. But the expanded partnership gives them much more access. Walmart’s shopper traffic in-store is also growing, according to Fortune, which means ChaseNet will also get access to this population. In addition, adding Sam’s Club’s online business, which grew by46% in Q4 2015, gives ChaseNet access to another large and fast-growing revenue stream.   And it could also help lower interchange payments for Walmart, which has been a sticking point for the retailer in recent months. Walmart pays a considerable amount in card fees annually. And earlier in 2016, the retailer sued Visa over its fee structure. But for its partners, ChaseNet provides fixed-rate and often discounted interchange pricing on eligible cards, which means that Walmart would pay considerably less on any purchase made via a Chase Visa card, thereby decreasing fees on a number of purchases. That could help relieve tensions between Walmart and Visa in other areas by making fees across the board more affordable. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on payments gateways that explains what they do, the benchmarks on which they compete, their growth drivers, and the key players. It also assesses the potential for gateways to impact legacy processors.  Here are some key takeaways from the report: Payment gateways help e-commerce merchants accept online transactions. They serve as the online version of a payment terminal and front-end processor for online and mobile sellers. Gateways typically sell bundled services, including payment acceptance, data reporting, and fraud management. Gateways have an opportunity to capitalize on the growing online processing market. BI Intelligence estimates that the US online processing market — from which gateways extract some of their revenue — will be worth about $10.7 billion this year. The market will grow to $17.5 billion by 2020, driven by the increase in online shopping. As online sales rise, gateways' addressable audience — e-commerce merchants — is getting both larger and more valuable, affording gateways an opportunity to seize and compete for more potential revenue. Gateways pose threats to the old guard as more merchants embrace the online-to-offline (O2O) business model. Many of the most successful tech companies, like Uber and Airbnb, leverage an O2O model, in which customers pay for in-person goods and services digitally. With an early-mover advantage among these types of retailers, gateways might begin to displace revenue from legacy processors because they will substitute rather than complement in-store processing volume. In full, the report: Explains how gateways function and compete with each other in the payments ecosystem. Identifies the factors enabling gateways to capture long-term growth. Forecasts the size of the online and in-store processing markets to give context on the industry gateways operate within. Lists the key gateway providers and explains what makes each successful.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 23, 2016 12:02pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Thursday Nasdaq Holds Leadership Baton Again; Best Buy Soars On Earnings (Investor's Business Daily) Related SFM Strong Sector-Wide Grocery Performance Monday Leads Director To Add Shares 7 Stocks That Rallied Four Days, Then Sold Off Yesterday Barclays initiated coverage of the food and staples retailing industry with a Neutral view and categorized the 19 stocks in their coverage into four groups, namely: "growth stars, stable staples, in transition and attempting to reinvest." In a note released Thursday, the firm said it is Overweight only on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ: SFM) and Performance Food Group Co (NYSE: PFGC). Barclays analyst Karen Short noted that most stocks in the sector have declined notably in the year-to-date period. The analyst sees challenging times for the food retailers, given successive years of deflation. With Wal-Mart acting as the disruptor, the analyst sees most companies in her universe facing risk. Related Link: Barclays Neutral On Food & Staples Retailing Stocks Accordingly, Barclays feels many names will remain range bound for the next several quarters. Naming Wal-Mart as its top pick (upgraded to Overweight), the firm noted that it has assumed coverage on the retailer and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) at Equal Weight. Explaining the rating from the returns perspective, Barclays noted that its Overweighted stocks are likely to generated returns of 17.9 percent compared to 4.9 percent for Equal Weight and -0.4 percent for Underweight. The four segments Barclays used to categorize companies in its coverage is based on whether a company can generate or reduce shareholder value in the context of growth top line and increasing return on invested capital. Those categorized as growth stars or stable staples are gaining share and have appropriate long-term strategies. Meanwhile, companies in the transition quadrant may be kept in the quadrant in the intermediate term due to secular challenges despite their best efforts and appropriate strategy or need to alter their strategy to create incremental shareholder value and transition to being a growth star or stable staples. Those in the attempting to reinvent quadrant face meaningful secular challenges, and in most cases, valuations reflect these challenges. Barclays Segmentation Of Food Retailers Growth Stars: Casey's General Stores Inc (NASDAQ: CASY): Equal Weight, $116 price target. Sprouts: Overweight, $24 price target. Five Below Inc (NASDAQ: FIVE): Equal Weight, $42 price target. Smart & Final Stores Inc (NYSE: SFS): Equal Weight, $13 price target. Stable Staples: Costco: Equal Weight, $158 price target. Wal-Mart: Overweight, $87 price target. Kroger Co(NYSE: KR): Equal Weight, $33 price target. SYSCO Corporation(NYSE: SYY): Underweight, $48 price target.

When it comes to buying one of our main necessities, food, we have a lot of options.  We have choices within our home communities, we have choices in neighbouring communities and we have choices in larger regional centres.  Overall, in Canada, there are lots of choices, especially as non-traditional grocers, like Wal-Mart, continue to enter the market.    Consumer choice means that stores are fighting to differentiate themselves and increasingly, price is where they are choosing to compete. Food is a necessity and low food prices are extremely important to all Canadians.  The problem is that these low prices must come from somewhere and in almost all cases, they are being pushed further down the chain, towards the producer. Last year, Wal-Mart’s extra aggressive cost cutting put it in the news. The retail giant has always been known for driving a hard bargain with suppliers, but last year, when faced with weak earnings, the retailer began asking for additional cuts. Reuters reported that unlike previous years, where negotiations took place between suppliers and the retailer, last year, the retailer took a more aggressive stand. The concessions demanded including asking suppliers to take money earmarked for joint advertising and displays and to instead use this money to lower the prices charged to the retailer. The problem is that Wal-Mart represents such a big share of the retail landscape, companies are hesitant to push back and find themselves no longer on those shelves. Wal-Mart isn’t the only one driving a hard bargain. This summer, Loblaw Cos. Ltd. was reported to have sent a letter to its suppliers asking for a price decrease of 1.45 per cent for shipments beginning in September. In response United Grocers, the buying group that represents many of Loblaw’s competitors, also sent a letter insisting that they be given the same price cut as their competitor. The problem isn’t just a lot of competition, it’s compounded by increased concentration, which is creating larger, more powerful buying groups. We have to think about what that means not just to us as consumers, but also as suppliers. Statistics Canada tracks food prices as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). From July 2015 to July 2016, the price of food purchased from stores increased by 1.1 per cent. However, not every type of food increased in price.  Some of the decreases were seen in fresh or frozen meat excluding poultry (1.7 per cent), non-fish seafood (1.7 per cent), dairy and eggs (0.9 per cent), bakery products (0.1 per cent), cereal grains and cereal products (0.9 per cent) and preserved fruit and fruit preparations (0.2 per cent). Interestingly, most of these products are closest to their raw, from the farm, form. On the flip side, StatsCan’s Farm Product Price Index (FPPI) measures the changes in prices that farmers receive for the agricultural commodities they produce and sell. The most recent release finds that the FPPI fell by 0.3 per cent in June 2016, compared to June 2015. Most of the decline was driven by falling cattle prices, which were down 7.8 per cent.  This release marked the fifth consecutive month where the index has shown a year over year decline. As shoppers, we all want low prices and for many families, low prices are an undeniable necessity in order to put food on their tables.  But at some point, we have to consider where the relentless drive for lower prices will take us, and if it’s somewhere we want to go.

The two participated in the event for the first year. (Ashley Stewart/People’s Press) OWATONNA — More than 20 Steele County law enforcement officers scrambled through aisles of shoes and racks of clothing Wednesday evening at Wal-Mart in Owatonna. The officers, part of the Minnesota State Patrol, Steele County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff’s Posse, Owatonna Police Department and Blooming Prairie Police Department, assisted 24 area children back-to-school shop. “It’s such a worthwhile program,” said Gina Shepherd, case manager at the Salvation Army in Owatonna. “I just love to see the smiles on the kids’ and the officers’ faces.” Shop with a Cop, a referral program started in 2008 by the Salvation Army, is designed to offer children between kindergarten and sixth grade in Steele County the opportunity to have a positive interaction with law enforcement, she said. Before 6 p.m., officers and children started trickling into the west entrance of Wal-Mart, where they were greeted by Salvation Army volunteers, who provided red “Shop with a Cop” T-shirts and name tags for the children and matched them with an officer. Most were matched at random, but 9-year-old Ashton Little approached the check-in table requesting Blooming Prairie Police Officer Dan Peach, an officer he hadn’t met but heard about from his grandmother who lives in Blooming Prairie. This year, there were at least 24 matches, each including a child and an officer. After being paired, the matches had their photo taken before either eating supper at Subway or shopping for new clothes, shoes and other school-related items. Peach, who had supper with Little before shopping, said it was his first time participating in the program. “I’m pretty excited,” he said, noting he enjoys working with children. “Me, too,” Little chimed in before taking another bite of his sandwich. Little said he was looking forward to the evening with Peach because he wants to service his country by being a cop or a member of the U.S. Army someday. “There’s nothing like hanging out with a cop for two hours,” he said. Little had his eyes set on some new clothes and shoes, while Donovon Scott, a 10-year-old paired with Blooming Prairie Police Officer Shane St. John, was looking forward to picking out shirts and pants. “You’ll be dressed pretty well after this,” St. John said. St. John participated in the program for his first year, too. “It’s an awesome opportunity,” he said. “I’m looking forward to hanging out and shopping.” After they finished eating, they each grabbed a shopping cart and ventured through Wal-Mart. The Salvation Army allotted $150 per child and officers were provided a list of the child’s needs and sizes for clothes. “Ready to shop ‘til you drop?” Peach asked Little, who nodded. Their first stop was the necessities: socks and underwear before checking out the shoe aisle, where many other matches were. Steele County Sheriff’s Posse Deputy Joe Schwering and his wife, Marilyn, were there assisting 6-year-old Eli Fedderly find his size in a pair of blue and black shoes. The Schwerings were also first-time participants of the program. “We thought it’d be interesting and good public relations,” Joe Schwering said. “And fun,” Marilyn Schwering added. After picking out a pair of shoes, Fedderly picked out a pair of green dinosaur slippers and a superhero backpack. The sheriff’s posse had about six officers helping with the program, making the sheriff’s office’s total 11, Shepherd said. While shopping, Wal-Mart employees scrambled to make snow pants and winter coats that weren’t out and priced available to the children and the officers. Nearly every child left the store with a new pair of snow pants, a winter coat and a hat and gloves. After checking off all the items on the children’s lists, the officers tallied the items’ totals to ensure each child got as much as he or she could before checkout. “Some over, some under, so it balances out,” Shepherd said. “Ultimately, the goal is the relationships.” She said the program is funded through the Salvation Army’s annual Red Kettle Campaign, which begins after Thanksgiving. Last year’s campaign, which brought in about $102,000 from community donations, allowed the Salvation Army to help more children through its backpack and Shop with a Cop programs, but Shepherd said the need is greater than the 27 children they helped this year. “There’s such a demand,” she said. “I wish we could bring in more every year.” Linda Seljeseth, service unit chairwoman at the Salvation Army, said of all the things the Salvation Army does, Shop with a Cop is her “most favorite thing to do.” And it was evident why as they chatted and joked with officers until their parents picked them up. “I’m truly thankful for the law enforcement in town because they work so well with us,” Shepherd said. “What other town can say they have this great of a response?” Reach reporter Ashley Stewart at 444-2378 or follow her on Twitter.com @OPPashley ASHLEY STEWART Owatonna People's Press reporter covering Steele County, Blooming Prairie and Medford government as well as health, transportation and community happenings.

The new feature allows customers to register online, pick out your items then pick them up curbside at the nearest Walmart location that has the option. "You can plan so you won't over shop," said Teresa Gaines of Ridgeland but she works in Pearl.  "There's a lot of positive things. They can have the innovatory pushed out so it's a quicker procedure so it has a lot of advantages." "I think it's going to save a lot of people some time and take some stress off some moms because moms have a lot to do," said Brianna Peacock of Star. The feature is aimed to helping busy moms or people who may have a physical handicap. "I'm sure it will help the business and save a lot of standing in line," said Otis Lichlyter of Brandon. "I think it's a tremendous convenience and I think it will help the business in many ways." Here's how it works: You go online, register, put in your zip code and if the Walmart nearby allows you to online shop, you can start making your list. You must have a minimum order of $30 dollars. "We'll have Designated parking spots on the side of the building to where the customer can pull in, call a number. Let the associate know that they're here and we will be bringing their groceries right out showing them their products and loading them up in their vehicles," said Matthew Nagorka, store manager of Pearl. Some people like the idea, but they'd rather use it for non-perishable items. "Fruit and vegetables. Produce, fresh things, no I want to go and shop those items for myself," Gaines explained. "I think it will be a good idea. I know SAMs has it too but I just never buy that much at SAMs but here at a regular store it probably will be better," said Phyllis Allen of Brandon. This online shopping option will be available at the Flowood, Clinton and Pearl locations. It launches on October 3. Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

From staff and wire reports Aetna ending small group plans to curb losses Aetna is discontinuing small group health insurance plans in Allegheny and 15 other Western Pennsylvania counties next year in a continuing effort by the Hartford, Conn.-based carrier to curb losses sustained in government-sponsored marketplaces. The cutbacks, which affect groups with fewer than 50 members, will include 10 counties in West Virginia. Md. firm buying Canonsburg pharmacy software provider Bowie, Md.-based health care analytics firm Inovalon has an agreement to acquire Creehan Holding Co. Inc. of Canonsburg for $105 million in a cash and stock deal. Creehan is the parent company of Creehan & Creehan, an independent provider of specialty pharmacy and medications management software-as-a-service platforms with annual revenues of about $27 million, according to an Inovalon release. The acquisition is expected to close near Oct. 1. Covestro adds to leadership Philipp Polenz was named head of commercial operations for Covestro’s North American polycarbonates business. He also was named to the North American Leadership Team and Polycarbonates Global Leadership Team. Germany-based Covestro’s North American headquarters is in Robinson. Mr. Polenz, 37, most recently was Covestro’s head of regional project management for polyurethanes in Hong Kong, and head of mergers and acquisitions based in Germany. Third American Airlines regional carrier increases pilot pay Piedmont Airlines said Thursday it will join PSA Airlines and Envoy Air, two other regional carriers for American Airlines, in boosting first-year pilot pay to $58,800 with a guaranteed job at American Airlines. Starting wages at the Salisbury, Md., carrier will increase from $29.38 to $38.80 an hour. Piedmont will offer new pilots a $15,000 signing bonus, and a $20,000 retention bonus paid in installments after one year of service. PSA Airlines and Envoy Air (formerly American Eagle) announced similar pilot wage increases last week in an effort to lure new aviators at a time when many senior pilots are near the mandatory retirement age of 65, and it’s more difficult and expensive to become a pilot. The three carriers operate short-haul or “express” flights for American and merger partner US Airways. PPG to sell stake in fiberglass ventures PPG said it will sell its 50 percent stake in two PFG Fiber Glass joint ventures located in Taiwan and China. Nan Ya Plastics, which owns the other 50 percent of each venture, will buy PPG’s shares. PPG and Nan Ya created PFG in 1987. Nan Ya is an affiliate of Formosa Plastics Group. PFG makes electronic yard fibers for circuit boards and fiberglass used in automotive parts. Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery A U.S. judge is granting class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico. In a ruling this week, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Ark., dismissed Wal-Mart’s argument that the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey ruled that the pension fund showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method is preferable. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public. McDonald’s exec heads to Dunkin’ Donuts A longtime McDonald’s executive who resigned abruptly last week has been named the president of Dunkin’ Donuts in the U.S. and Canada. David Hoffmann was the president of McDonald’s high-growth segment, which includes countries like China and Russia. The company announced his resignation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. McDonald’s, headquartered in suburban Chicago, said that Mr. Hoffmann failed “to satisfy certain conditions upon his departure, including execution of a noncompete agreement.” As a result, he will forfeit certain benefits, including all unvested cash and equity incentive awards, the company said in the filing. Lennar, WCI join to create powerhouse in Florida Lennar will spend $643 million to acquire luxury homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., tying up two of the largest home construction companies in Florida as the U.S. real estate market improves. Construction activity has accelerated for much this year. Builders are optimistic about sales growth, a reflection of how steady job gains are leading more Americans to purchase new houses and sign leases for new apartments. U.S. home sales fell in August Americans retreated from home-buying in August, as a worsening inventory shortage appears to be hurting sales and pushing prices higher. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said. The monthly setbacks happened after a period of steady gains that have lifted home sales up 3 percent so far this year. Historically low mortgage rates have combined with an improved job market to bolster demand from possible buyers. But drastically fewer sellers are coming into the market. The number of properties for sale is dwindling despite buyer enthusiasm. Inventory has collapsed 10.1 percent from a year ago to 2.04 million homes.

Wal-Marts offering Spoolies: Buena Park Foothill Ranch Huntington Beach Irvine Laguna Niguel Orange Spoolies are back. The husband-and-wife team of Jeanne and Tim James of Dana Point has restored the quirky hair gadget through the couple’s company, San Juan Capistrano-based Spoolies Hair Curlers. The heatless curlers are available in 400 Wal-Mart stores. Users wrap a section of dry hair around the spool and fold it to secure the hair. Before long, the Spoolies make their mark, leaving the user’s hair curled. A five-pack on Wal-Mart’s website costs just under $6. “I used them when I was a little girl, and I remembered loving these curlers,” Jeanne James said. “They aren’t around anymore, so I looked into manufacturing them.” The Jameses manufacture Spoolies in San Clemente. Their deal with Wal-Mart is part of a commitment by the retailer to buy $250 billion in U.S. products by 2023. “Production close to conception is smart business,” said Cindi Marsiglio, vice president of U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart. “It keeps our items on our shelves, and it has a great community impact. It keeps more manufacturing jobs in the U.S.” Marsiglio said that where a product is made is becoming increasingly important to Wal-Mart shoppers, making brands like Spoolies “a very attractive proposition.” Spoolies once was a patented Conair product. The beauty giant canceled the trademark in the early 2000s, and James jumped at the chance to use the name. After a three-year quest, she claimed the trademark in 2006, then worked on improving the product by redesigning the curlers, making them hypoallergenic and heat resistant. A portion of the profits from every Spoolies sold will benefit girls education projects in Kenya, she said. Spoolies also will be found as an impulse-buy item near Wal-Mart checkout counters and hanging on clips around some 300 more stores next year, James said. “It will give us more visibility and is really a huge opportunity for us,” she added. James said Wal-Mart is constantly ordering more Spoolies, keeping the company busy. “Everyone is looking for healthy curlers, girls are softening their hair with soft waves, and people want things healthy and natural and organic,” she said. “People don’t want to use heat and damage their hair, and this is a great alternative, which is why they are so popular right now.” The company is developing a serum to make the curls last longer. Every year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. hosts a summit to help U.S. manufacturers and suppliers grow, in addition to something called Open Call, which seeks new products made in the U.S. Spoolies attended the company’s most recent Open Call session. “They are a great example of a small supplier based in the U.S. with a new, fun item contributing to our commitment,” Marsiglio said. Products like Spoolies go in select stores to see how they will do and “prevent overwhelming the manufacturer.” Two-thirds of products sold in Wal-Mart are made in the U.S., Marsiglio said. The figure includes food sold at the stores. Contact the writer: hmadans@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular O.C.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 22, 2016 at 8:02PM Wind turbines at a Wal-Mart store in Worcester, Mass. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has long been the bogeyman of the left as its low wages, union-busting, and monopolistic ways have made it a popular target among liberals. But on at least one important liberal issue, Wal-Mart is a shining exemplar. The nation's largest retailer, known for its rural and conservative values, is actually the biggest corporate solar power consumer in the country. In fact, Wal-Mart has been the biggest solar user for several years running. Last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wal-Mart had 142 megawatts of solar capacity, more than double all but one other U.S. company, Prologis, and Wal-Mart has completed 348 installations. The company's solar installations have accelerated in recent years, increasing from 59 installations in 2011 to 75 installations last year. A history of green business In 2005, former CEO Lee Scott set a goal for Wal-Mart to be completely powered by renewable energy. The company uses wind, fuel cells, and hydropower in addition to solar. Renewable energy sources now make up 26% of its global energy consumption, and those efforts have reduced the company's energy costs per square foot by 9%.   The company has a goal of reaching 7 billion kilowatt hours of green energy by 2020 and reducing energy per square foot intensity 20% from 2010 levels.    In addition to solar, the corporate giant has also made significant steps in using wind energy. Last year, Wal-Mart agreed to buy 58% of the output from Pattern Energy Group's new 200 MW Logan's Gap Wind Facility in Texas, serving 380 stores.  Wal-Mart has also experimented with wind turbines in stores, building 12 small wind turbines at a Worcester, Mass., location when it opened in 2010. It removed those turbines last year as subsidies for the small engines had been reduced, but the company has since made a number of other installations, including a large-scale wind turbine system in a California distribution center, a 265-foot tower with a blade with a 250-foot diameter.   Burnishing the bottom line and its image Unsurprisingly, a company with the motto "Save Money, Live Better" is focused primarily on saving money with its green program. According to one estimate, its global energy costs are around $1 billion, so even a 9% cut in those expenses would constitute a meaningful addition to the bottom line as well as free up cash that can be better spent elsewhere. But the steps the company's taking to be more environmental may also help warm it up to a demographic generally opposed to the retail giant. CEO Doug McMillon seems to be focused on undoing many of the sources of Wal-Mart's negative perceptions since taking the helm in 2014. McMillion boosted the company's minimum wage from $7.25/hour all the way to $10/hour over the last two years, setting off a ripple effect across the retail industry as peers like Target, TJX Companies, and McDonald's all followed its lead. Last year, when the governor of Arkansas (Wal-Mart's home state) was considering signing a "religious freedom" bill that would restrict LGBT rights, McMillon spoke out against it, saying: "Every day, in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve," helping to persuade a veto of the bill. Repairing its image is key if Wal-Mart wants to continue to grow domestically. The retailer is underrepresented in major cities and is still without a store in New York City. Its best-performing store type of late is its Neighborhood Market, smaller-format grocery stores that are intended for cities, which often don't have the real estate to accommodate a supercenter. Recently, it's slowed the pace of its store growth, but the urban frontier still presents ample opportunity, especially as it invests in e-commerce. Urbanites are among the most frequent online shoppers and are also the cheapest to serve, explaining why Amazon.com has been able to roll out its Prime Now one-hour delivery service in cities across the country. Going green makes good business sense for Wal-Mart, and if it can make it more attractive to potential customers, that'll be a big win for the company as it looks to turn its business around.

Read: Sign of Bad Taste: A Walmart's 9/11 Soda Display Removed After It Sparks Outrage Mary Thomaston, a hairdresser from Panama City Beach, recently shared photos taken by Kiersten Grant on Instagram of her daughter's blue, purple and yellow dyed hair. "I really didn't want the dark blonde anymore, so I decided to color it," 6-year-old Lyra told InsideEdition.com. Her mom added, "I'm always doing fun colorful hair. She sees it all the time, and I have it myself so of course she's going to want it." But not everyone believed the decision was that simple. "Sometimes we forget they’re little and not a little doll," one person commented. Another wrote, "Oh no I would never let my baby do this [...] she can wait [until] she is older." But, Thomaston said she pays the negative comments no mind, responding in another post: "Don't worry folks it'll wash out. She wasn't harmed in the process. [...] It's hair....it'll grow back!" Thomaston told InsideEdition.com that in the three times Lyra has asked for her hair to be dyed, she used Manic Panic NYC's semi-permanent hair dye, which are advertised as non-toxic, ammonia-free, vegan, and temporary, despite people worrying the chemicals will harm her young daughter.  In fact, she said the hair dye even helps her daughter embrace her individuality.  "It helped her come out of her shell," Thomaston said. "She definitely likes to talk about it to everyone she sees, and it's really made her shine."  Read: Concerned Mom Speaks Out After She Said She Witnessed Man Pull Daughter by the Hair Through Walmart Clearly, Lyra has no plan to stop dyeing her unicorn-colored hair.

Witnesses have described the chaos of the assault. i By Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The alleged attackers at a Shawnee Wal-Mart earlier this month waited in a maroon van in the parking lot for more than an hour and 20 minutes while their victim was inside shopping with her 8-month-old child. Then when the mother returned to her car, which was parked next to the van, two men emerged from the van. The woman was attacked, struck in the head five to eight times before she was able to get away. Screaming for help, she then returned to the car to get her child before running back to the store while bleeding profusely. Those details and the further chaos that ensued are outlined in a court affidavit filed by the district attorney’s office against Arthur Fred Wyatt III, one of the men who was allegedly in the maroon van that Sunday afternoon. The affidavit relies upon witness accounts as well as surveillance video from the Wal-Mart parking lot. One of the men in the van, John Wesley Simmons III, was shot and killed by a good Samaritan who was in the parking lot at the time. But that was not before Simmons shot and critically wounded another good Samaritan, Joshua James Owen, who was not armed but who intervened in the attack on the woman. Police found Simmons dead and Owen wounded in the parking lot when they were called to the scene at 1:37 p.m. Sept. 11. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:31 KC Crime Stoppers seek suspects responsible for multiple burglaries Pause 0:54 Out-of-control car careens toward Merriam police officer working crash 1:08 KCK Police investigate shooting death of man found in backyard 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:30 KC police investigate shooting death on Jackson Avenue 0:39 Fairway police investigate shooting death 2:55 Boy rescued from attic now an honorary deputy 1:10 Kansas City officer injured following brief scuffle 3:08 Darryl Burton gives sermon at United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood 0:34 Kansas City police SUV collides with stolen Jeep 4:22 Raw video: Dashcam shows Independence police using StarChase GPS tags Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Police describe people coming to aid of Shawnee Wal-Mart robbery victim Two Good Samaritans came to the aid of a woman who was being attacked in a Shawnee Wal-Mart parking lot on Sunday afternoon. Police describe what took place during the attempted robbery that ended with one attacker dead and the woman and one Good Samaritan in the hospital. Laura Bauer, Joe Ledford and Robert A. Cronkleton The Kansas City Star   Based on the video, prosecutors say there was an encounter between the woman, identified only as M.D.J., and a man, and then “multiple people suddenly converge on the two vehicles.” At some point, a second man is seen getting out of the passenger side of the van. The woman later told authorities she was attacked from behind by at least two people. She said they initially pushed her toward her car’s open door and then began pulling her left arm away from the vehicle. That is when she broke free and ran. According to the affidavit, Simmons was then seen getting back into the maroon van on the driver’s side and closing the door. Owen approached the driver’s side door, and Simmons got out on the passenger side. Owen then ran around the van and tackled Simmons to the ground. The two men rolled and fought in the parking and when they separated, “Simmons raises his hand and appears to be firing a weapon at Owen.” Owen was struck by three bullets, in the wrist, chest and face. Part of his nose was shot off, and the left side of his face was damaged. A GoFundMe page for Owen had raised more than $140,000 for his medical bills as of Thursday afternoon. The second good Samaritan, whose name was redacted in the affidavit, “then comes toward the area, draws a weapon and fires at Simmons,” the affidavit said. “Simmons was struck multiple times and died at the scene.” The second man from the van was seen running east in the direction of a Target store. An employee of that store called police, saying a man in the store appeared jittery and was talking on a cellphone in a “low, shaky hyper voice.” The man was seen on Target surveillance video being picked up by someone in a dark-colored passenger vehicle. Speaking with Simmons’ family, police learned he had spent time that morning with an acquaintance named Art, whose Facebook profile identified him as Art Tha Topp Hatt. Photos on the page fit witness descriptions of the second man in the van at Wal-Mart. Information from Facebook led to Wyatt in a police database, the affidavit said. A witness, whose name also was redacted in the affidavit, told police Simmons and Wyatt had dropped her off at church that morning in a maroon van. The clothing she said Wyatt was wearing matched the Target video, and she positively identified the man in the video as Wyatt. Wyatt’s father, Arthur Fred Wyatt Jr., later told police he picked his son up at the Target store and he appeared to be nervous. Wyatt Jr. said his son told him he and Simmons had been at Wal-Mart, and he had fled when there was an altercation between Simmons and a woman. But another man who had been in the Wal-Mart parking lot and had tried to help the woman being attacked gave police descriptions of the two men. The larger one, matching Simmons, pointed a gun at him, the man said. The other one, matching Wyatt, was striking the woman over the head with a gun. The woman’s wounds required 26 staples to close. Wyatt is charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery.

In some parts of open-carry America, even a trip to Wal-Mart can require an AR-15 By Terrence Mccoy Washington Post Twitter Facebook Email Reddit WINDER, Ga. – All Jim Cooley wants to do is buy some soda. “You want to come to Wal-Mart?” he asks his wife. “No,” Maria says. “Pretty please?” Jim asks. “I’m not going to sit there and have the police called on you. I mean, I don’t want to see that crap,” Maria says, knowing what a trip to Wal-Mart means. She knows her 51-year-old husband has two guns inside the house, and this afternoon it won’t be the 9 mm, which he straps on with a round in the chamber when grabbing lunch at his favorite fast-food restaurant or visiting a friend’s auto shop. It’ll be the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which he brings when going somewhere he thinks is dangerous, like the Atlanta airport, where he’s taken it loaded with a 100-bullet drum, or Wal-Mart, where he thinks crowds could pose easy targets for terrorists. In a country of relaxing gun laws where it’s now legal to open-carry in 45 states and there are 14.5 million people with carry permits, every day seems to bring a new version of what open carry can mean. In Kentucky, it’s now legal to open-carry in city buildings. In downtown Cleveland, people carried military-style rifles during the Republican National Convention. In Howell, Michigan, last month, a father went openly armed to his child’s middle-school orientation. In Mississippi, it’s now legal to open-carry without a permit at all. And in Georgia, which has passed a “guns everywhere” bill and has issued nearly 1 million carry permits, Jim Cooley is staking out his version of what’s acceptable as he keeps pleading with his wife. “I got to get soda.” Maria sighs. She worked the night before assembling air-conditioner compressors at a nearby factory, and in a few hours, she knows she’ll have to leave for another third shift. “Yeah,” she says, giving in. “I might as well get this travesty out of the way.” “What travesty?” “You carrying a big ol’ rifle in the store, scaring the hell out of all the Wal-Mart shoppers.” “There’s no difference between carrying a rifle and carrying a handgun,” he says. “You tried that last time, remember?” Maria says, stepping into a pair of flip-flops and running her fingers through her hair. “And what happened? Barrow County sheriffs. Three or four of them.” “They can’t tell me what and what not to carry,” Jim says. “You know I wouldn’t listen to them anyway.” “Well, you go one way in the store; I’ll go the other,” Maria says. “Then when they say, ‘Ma’am, do you know this person?’ I’ll say, ‘No, I’ve never seen him before in my life.’ ” He places a lit cigarette into an ashtray, walks into his bedroom, reaches behind its door, picks up the AR-15, snaps in a magazine with 15 rounds and slings the rifle around his left shoulder so it rests against his torso. “Ready?” he asks. “Yeah,” she says, grabbing her purse and following her husband out the door for an afternoon trip to Wal-Mart to buy soda. The gun Jim Cooley carries is the ATI Omni-Hybrid Maxx AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. It cost him $579.99. It weighs 6.25 pounds, is 35 inches long, and fires bullets as fast as the trigger can be pulled, and, as Jim has learned, fits nicely between the front seats of a white minivan with peeling paint on the front and a bumper sticker on the back that says, “I (heart) Law.” Jim goes everywhere now with a gun – if not the AR-15, then his sidearm – and is so reliant on one being close by that it surprises him to think the majority of his life was lived otherwise. He was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, where he can’t imagine living now because of its strict gun laws. But they didn’t bother him then. He didn’t hunt. He didn’t fear for his safety. If his dad had a gun, no one knew. He grew up without a gun, went to church without a gun, married Maria without a gun, began raising two children without a gun, and settled into a life that felt as safe as it was dependable. But then it began unraveling, starting when he was fired from a trucking job days after telling Maria, who was pregnant with their first child, to quit her job and focus on the baby, that he could support them both. Their first bankruptcy filing wasn’t far behind, then the second, and the third, and then they were moving to Florida, where Maria had family and where Jim got a job with a grocery chain. It transferred him to Winder, and he moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood struggling with crime and drugs. Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun – a .380 semi-automatic for $100 – so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder’s only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It’s a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn’t, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn’t understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car’s passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition. But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semi-automatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house’s perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn’t count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Wal-Mart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Wal-Mart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. “What do you want me to tell him?” Maria had asked. “Say, ‘Hey, buddy, I’m going to Wal-Mart, and I’m going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it’s me,” Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called “Police State 101.” Another showed the dictionary definition of the word “law.” Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as “underground,” the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim’s Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. “At least I notified the sheriff’s department ahead of time,” he said. He looked at Maria. “Come on, come to Wal-Mart with me,” he said. “I got to get soda.” So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Wal-Mart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. The Wal-Mart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says “Home and Garden” above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. “Hey, Maria,” he calls when catching up to her. “Do we need any lunch meat?” “I’ll go get some salami,” she says. “All right,” he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it’s not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It’s a nearby sale. “Eighty-eight cents for a loaf,” he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he’s going – the soda aisle – and sees what he’s looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter’s front cart, accidentally tearing it open. “They don’t make these things like they used to,” he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. “They got strawberry swirl,” she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it’s sliding under his shoelaces. “Give me the strawberry swirl,” he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that’s when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. “Is that what I see?” one will later recall saying. “What do we do if he comes in the store?” “If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?” They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. “You know my grandfather was murdered, right?” one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a car wash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. “Can you hold onto that for me, please?” he asks Maria. “Yeah,” she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder.

The money went to the Southwest Oklahoma Community Action Group in Altus and the Community Action Development Corporation in Frederick. The group provides a hot midday meal five days a week to citizens 60 years of age or older in Greer, Harmon and Jackson County. “The senior nutrition program offers more than just meals,” said Virginia Goskey, senior nutrition program director for SOCAG. “The program gives seniors a place to socialize and develop friendships, connects them to many vital resources in the community and makes them feel accepted and cared for. In a word, the senior nutrition program gives hope.” It will be used to help with their senior nutrition programs. The Walmart Foundation grant will help pay staff salaries and buy food and supplies for the senior nutrition program, which offers senior citizens the choice of having their meal in a congregate setting or through home delivery. Every participant is given monthly nutrition education via pamphlets and/or on-site training. Congregant participants have the opportunity take advantage of monthly health checks, games and entertainment, and exercise equipment. “These two organizations do so much for our rural communities. They provide meals, they provide transportation, they work with head start. and we're just so thankful for the Walmart Foundation and all that they do to help fund organizations like these,” said Rep. Jeff Coody of District 63. Coody says the Walmart Foundation grant will offset budget cuts from federal and state grants that at one time entirely funded the programs. “Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation, understand that organizations such as Southwest Oklahoma Community Action Group are essential to building stronger communities. They share our values and are committed to helping those in need in the communities we serve,” said Rodney Walker, Walmart vice president and regional general manager. “Through this grant, we are hopeful that residents in this area will feel a positive effect, and through that effect our impact will be expanded.” The Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program supports organizations that create opportunities so people can live better, awarding grants that have a long-lasting, positive impact on communities across the U.S. To be considered for support, prospective grantee organizations must submit applications through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program’s online grant application. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in order to meet the program’s minimum eligibility criteria. Additional information about the program’s funding guidelines and application process are available online at www.walmartfoundation.org/stategiving. Copyright 2016 KSWO. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Boy arrested in Wal-Mart fire Thursday Sep 22, 2016 at 12:27 PM Sep 22, 2016 at 3:12 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero BARSTOW — Barstow police arrested a 12-year-old boy they believe started a fire in the arts and crafts section at Wal-Mart on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze caused an estimated $1 million-plus in damage to the store, authorities said. The Barstow Police Department dispatch center received a call regarding a fire inside the business and preliminary investigation indicated that it had intentionally set. A detective from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department Arson and Bomb Unit responded and determined that the fire's cause was arson. “Detectives processed the scene, interviewed witnesses, and reviewed the Wal-Mart surveillance footage,” Capt. Andy Espinoza Jr. said. “Detectives were able to identify the possible arson suspect on the surveillance video. The suspect appeared to be a young Hispanic male juvenile, wearing a green T-shirt with distinctive markings and black pants. The juvenile suspect was captured on video leaving Wal-Mart riding a push scooter and wearing a backpack.” Detectives searched the area and located a boy on a scooter near Rimrock Road and Opal Street. He was wearing the same clothes as seen on the surveillance footage, police said. Espinoza said detectives obtained additional evidence linking the boy to the arson. The boy was arrested on suspicion of arson, his parents were notified and he was transported to the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center in Apple Valley. Paramedics treated several people for smoke inhalation, according to police. The Barstow Fire Protection District extinguished the fire, which began at 1:59 p.m. Espinoza said several employees immediately tried to put out the fire with extinguishers but were unsuccessful and the store was immediately evacuated. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call Det. Keith Libby at 760-255-5134.

The allegations included that Walmart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Ark., dismissed Walmart’s argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Walmart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Walmart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. ALSO Facebook adds FacioMetrics; a mansplaining hotline Judge scolds SF, Airbnb while staying fines in short-term rental case Airbnb aims to handle full-service travel, competing with Expedia “Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification,” Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. “We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying class,” he said. Investors said Walmart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by the New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn’t alert U.S. or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Walmart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company’s Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System, did “not give rise to a reasonable reference” that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court’s dismissal. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

While e-tailing giant Amazon.com is considered an online price leader today, “the reality is they’re a little bit all over the place in pricing,” Bishop said. Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart completed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet earlier this week. As previously reported, the deal brings together fast-growing and well-funded Jet.com — which in just over a year zoomed to an estimated $1 billion in annual sales on a hot brand and “dynamic pricing” model — with Walmart, which has a considerably less sexy url, but one with ambitions to build an e-commerce brand as mighty as its store fleet. What both have in common is a reputation for price central to their brands in a way that most other competitors in the e-commerce field do not, Bishop explained. This, he said, holds the promise of distinguishing its offering, particularly in areas like grocery where shoppers can be particularly price sensitive. Walmart said it would appoint Jet founder Marc Lore to head up its combined e-commerce operations, replacing Neil Ashe. It is expected that Lore will bring Jet’s technical expertise in dynamic pricing — which rewards shoppers with lower prices for saving Jet the costs associated with virtual retailing such as volume discounts, shipping discounts and even payment method discounts — to Walmart. “Walmart bought three things with Jet,” said Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillanDoolittle, told SN. “They bought talent. They bought an algorithm. And they got Jet itself, a different brand with a slightly different shopper base. I think they feel that will help broaden their appeal.” In a blog post published earlier this week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon characterized the shopper bases as “complementary.” “Jet.com is a hit among urban Millennials, and it will continue to focus on delivering premium brands and experiences,” he said. “Walmart.com is winning value-conscious shoppers with everyday low prices by keeping costs low.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 3 rllayman on Sep 23, 2016 what's so great at being "the price leader" if the cost to ship goods is greater than the profit margin generated from selling the goods. But maybe Walmart should consider rebranding its stores for urban markets and other high income demographic RTAs. They could call the stores "Jet". Because I think their foray into urban markets is running into the problem that the company's traditional market is comprised of low income demographics, and people with options are exercising their privilege of not shopping there. reply Log In or Register to post comments Kevin C. Lavin (not verified) on Sep 23, 2016 Hard to find Bear Creek Hot & Sour soup. My favorite. Found it at Ralphs and bought a couple for $5.49. Decided to try on line and got prices all around $5-6. Stumbled upon Jet and bought a case of 18 at $2.61 each. If I continued to buy more products the price continues to drop. Ok...I would rather buy 6 but the value is worth it and will be used on 6 months. No shipping charges. Have purchased other items since. Great site! reply Log In or Register to post comments Matthew Dodson (not verified) on Sep 23, 2016 With all due respect, these old biz/new tech combinations almost never create the synergies that are projected.

The Chambers County Commission, the City of LaFayette, the Chambers County Development Authority, and AL Solar A have finalized a project agreement and tax abatement agreement to locate a massive 72-megawatt solar farm on a 1,100-acre site that encompasses portions of both LaFayette and unincorporated Chambers County. Prior to the approval of the project and abatement agreements, Alabama Power announced in June of this year that an agreement with Walmart to purchase renewable energy had been approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission, opening the door for a large-scale solar generating facility to locate in the area. As part of the long-term contract with Alabama Power, Walmart will purchase a majority of the solar farm’s output, known as renewable energy credits (RECs). Those RECs will be retired on Walmart’s behalf. Because Walmart is not purchasing all of the farm’s output, Alabama Power will be able to market the remaining RECs to other customers who have an interest in renewable energy. Miami-based Origis Energy, a worldwide leader in solar energy development, financing, construction and operations, and parent company of AL Solar A, will construct and operate the 72-megawatt solar farm, while Alabama Power has secured the rights to the energy produced at the facility. Construction on the solar farm is expected to begin later this year, and is scheduled to be completed and operational in late 2017. “This project is the first of its kind in Alabama, and we are proud that LaFayette will be home to one of the largest solar energy generating farms in the Southeast,” Chambers County Development Authority Executive Director Valerie Gray said. “A project of this type is an exciting and unique opportunity that not only provides an immediate positive economic impact to Chambers County but also gives us an added resource as we work to diversify our industrial base and bring more jobs to the citizens of LaFayette.” The direct and indirect economic impact of the project for LaFayette and Chambers County will be significant. Along with a substantial capital investment that will yield an immediate financial inflow to the local school systems, the project will create approximately 200-300 jobs during the construction phase and up to five jobs during the 30-35-year operation lifespan of the solar farm. The project has been welcomed with widespread enthusiasm from both LaFayette and Chambers County officials. Chambers County Commission Chair Joe Blanks called it “an amazing win for Chambers County.” “It’s thrilling that this project has come together and will locate here in LaFayette,” Mayor Barry Moody said. “This is an incredible and distinctive opportunity for our community and just another indication that we are on the move here in LaFayette. We are excited about this partnership with Origis Energy and for the opportunities it will provide to our current and future citizens and businesses.” Related posts: Alabama Power Teams with Walmart for Solar Energy Facility in Chambers County Solar facility to employ up to 300 Large scale solar panel farm may come to Chambers County City agrees to solar farm tax abatements   0 0 0   0   0 previous $27K new tab for inmate housing next CCTC Automotive Program Receives National Accreditation slandon Related Posts aFayette honors veterans November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Wildfires, water restriction result of worst drought November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Dynamite found near school November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Subscribe to The LaFayette Sun First Name Last Name Email Address Submit Facebook Like Box Facebook Copyright 2016, The LaFayette Sun Close News Featured Stories Top Stories Government Police & Courts Senior Living Sports School Obituaries Columns Videos Letters to the Editor Community Announcements Classified View Classified Ads How to Submit News × REPORT THIS [contact-form-7 404 "Not Found"] Share this video

The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, US District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart's argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart's stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. "Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification," Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. "We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying a class," he said. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn't alert US or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Wal-Mart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company's Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, did "not give rise to a reasonable reference" that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court's dismissal.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 22, 2016 at 12:36PM Seven is Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) lucky number. This morning, for the seventh time this year (according to StreetInsider.com), Amazon stock received a new buy rating on Wall Street. That sounds like good news for owners of Amazon stock -- and it is. The stock has gained 1.6% in response to the new upgrade already. But here's some even better news for folks who own the stock: The analyst upgrading Amazon this morning is Argus Research. According to our records on Motley Fool CAPS, Argus Research is one of the best stock pickers on Wall Street. Since 2008, when we first began tracking the analyst's performance, Argus' stock picks have outperformed the S&P 500 by better than 17 percentage points per pick, an outstanding record that places the analyst in the top 10% of investors we track. And now it likes Amazon. Here are three things you need to know about that. Amazon's Fire is on sale, and Argus says so is Amazon stock -- on sale, and also on fire! Image source: Amazon.com. 1. Why Argus likes it As explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Argus likes Amazon for three main reasons: First, it owns "well more than half" of the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market via its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Second, Amazon's online retail business is growing faster than its stock price. And third, Argus believes Amazon.com is a long-term buy -- so long as the first two trends remain true. Argus rates the stock a buy and predicts Amazon.com stock will hit $935 a share within the next year. 2. Amazon is one expensive stock All that being said, Argus does admit that Amazon stock sells for "rich multiples." Up 47% in value over the past 52 weeks, Amazon stock has never -- ever -- cost more than it does today. One single share of Amazon.com stock currently costs more than $802. By contrast, the second-biggest online retailer of general goods, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), carries a per-share price in only the double-digits (about $72), and the third-biggest, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is priced only in the single digits -- $8 and change. 3. Amazon is expensive...but not really Is that too much to pay? Triple-digit valuations on the No. 1 retailer, when the No. 2 sells for double digits and the No. 3 player, just single digits? Before you answer, remember that Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Staples are more than just stocks. They're also businesses. No matter how much a share of any of these companies' stocks costs, to know how expensive the business is, you need to add up all the shares that it has been carved into, multiply them by the stock price, and whatever you get -- the stock's market capitalization -- is how much the whole business costs. Do that, and what you'll find is that Staples has a market capitalization of $5.5 billion, Wal-Mart Stores $223.4 billion, and Amazon.com $381.5 billion. The most important thing: Valuation Viewed from this perspective, you can see that Amazon.com, as a business, does indeed cost more than Wal-Mart -- but only 71% more, not 1,110% more. (It's still a heckuvalot more expensive than Staples, though?) Now the question becomes: Is Amazon worth it? Let's consider. Focusing on the Wal-Mart/Amazon race, Wal-Mart stock currently sells for 10.5 times trailing free cash flow, while Amazon stock has a price-to-FCF ratio of 51.6. On the other hand, analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence see Wal-Mart growing its profits at only about 5% annually over the next five years, versus Amazon growing at 55% annually -- 11 times as fast as Wal-Mart. As a function of price-to-FCF-to-growth, therefore, Wal-Mart has a ratio of 2.0, while Amazon has a ratio of 0.9. (In fact, when you dig into the numbers, these analysts see Amazon's free cash flow roughly doubling in size between 2015 and 2017, between 2016 and 2108, and only then beginning to slow down -- doubling again between 2017 and 2020.) What that tells me is that not only is Amazon.com stock relatively cheaper than Wal-Mart, it also suggests that Amazon.com stock is cheap, period -- even at $802 a share, even at $381.5 billion in market cap, and even at a P/E ratio of 200. Long story short? Argus is right about Amazon selling for slightly terrifying "rich multiples." It's also right that the company is growing more than fast enough to justify those multiples. And Argus is right when it says Amazon.com stock is a buy. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Zahnow  BAY CITY, MI —A Wisconsin sex offender accused of flashing his genitals at two young girls inside a Bangor Township Walmart has taken a plea deal. Joel  A. Zahnow, 41, on Thursday, Sept. 22, appeared before Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill and pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated indecent exposure. The charge is normally a two-year high court misdemeanor, but Zahnow also pleaded as a habitual offender with a third-offense sentencing enhancement. As a result, Zahnow's maximum potential penalty is increased to four years' incarceration. As Zahnow was on probation when his most recent crime occurred, he is also subject to consecutive sentencing, meaning he'd have to serve the remainder of the time associated with his prior offenses before he begins chipping away at his latest term. The prosecution did not agree to dismiss any additional charges, as Zahnow did not face any. In a Cobbs hearing — in which a judge outlines the likely sentence a defendant will face if convicted — Judge Gill agreed to sentence Zahnow within the sentencing guidelines. Those guidelines have yet to be drafted by the Bay County Probation Department. Man on probation for having child porn charged with flashing kids at Walmart Aggravated indecent exposure involves fondling one's genitals, where standard indecent exposure is only displaying genitals, Michigan law states. The latter is a one-year misdemeanor. Zahnow's offense occurred about 4:25 p.m. Thursday, June 30, in the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road. At the arraignment, Bay County Assistant Prosecutor Bernard J. Coppolino said Zahnow followed and spoke with two 7-year-old girls before flashing them. Bay County Undersheriff Troy Cunningham previously said the girls were in the toy aisle while the mother of one of the girls was in an adjacent aisle. The girls told the woman what had occurred, and she then told store security, who were unable to immediately locate the man. Investigating police had an idea Zahnow was the culprit by the following morning, Cunningham previously said. Deputies located and arrested Zahnow later that day. Records indicate Zahnow in October 2007 was sentenced to 10 years of probation in Wisconsin's Ozaukee County after being convicted of two counts of possessing child pornography. The charge is a 25-year felony in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections' website indicates Zahnow must register as a sex offender until Oct. 3, 2032. The site also states Zahnow is compliant in his registration, having last registered his Bay City address on May 2. As a sex offender, Zahnow was already prohibited from having contact with any child besides his own. Judge Gill is to sentence Zahnow at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 31.

The incident came to light after Erika Burch, a customer at Walmart in Cleveland, Texas, saw a man pulling his young daughter alongside his shopping cart by her hair. Buch said that the father had the girl's hair wrapped around the cart handle, as she cried out in pain and begged him to stop. Burch later wrote on her Facebook page, "She was saying, 'Please stop, I promise I won’t do it again, please stop!'" Burch immediately took out her phone to document the man's actions before approaching him and asking him to stop. The man told her to "mind her own business," so Burch called the police. A police officer who was already in the Walmart came running, according to Burch, and called his sergeant, who reportedly told Burch that in order for the police to arrest the man for child abuse, the child needed to be physically injured. "The sergeant in Cleveland, TX said, "He has the right to discipline his children,'" Burch wrote. Burch shared the photos and story of what happened on her Facebook following the incident, and as of this morning, the post has been shared by over 205,000 Facebook users. See the photos she posted, below: Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard told the local CBS affiliate that his department is taking the case seriously and has launched an investigation. Broussard said Child Protective Services is also investigating. The Cleveland Police Department posted this message regarding the incident on their Facebook page: Broussard also said that he appreciates Burch for speaking up when she saw something dangerous unfolding. "Of course, that old saying, 'if you see something, say something.' In this case, I have to applaud those witnesses who attempted to intervene for the safety of the child," he told the news station.

Atkins was convicted of capital murder Thursday, Sept. 22 and faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole.Prescotte Stokes III/pstokes@al.com  A jury in Mobile County has found 22-year-old Saraya Atkins guilty of capital murder, robbery and theft in the 2014 shooting death of Robert Perry, 66. Police say Atkins and another woman, Kymberli Lindsay, 27 robbed and then killed Perry. Perry was shot to death on March 11, 2014. As the jury deliberated on a verdict, D.A. Ashley Rich consoled the nine family members of Perry as they waited for the jury's decision.  Atkins' eight family members sat shoulder to shoulder in the rows across from Perry's. Before the jury gave the verdict, five police officers came into the courtroom and filled the middle rows in case there was an emotional out burst from family members.  After the verdict was read and the judge dismissed the jurors, Atkins put her head down and burst into tears. After she was led out with officers, she could be heard crying loudly in the hallway near the judges' chambers.  The trial will now enter a penalty phase where the jury will decide if Atkins should receive the death penalty or life without parole. The District Attorney's office will now push for the death penalty as their stance has been that Perry's murder was premeditated by Atkins. Atkins attorneys will push back and continue to assert that the robbery was the only part of the incident that was premeditated. If they are able to convince the jury of that in the penalty phase Atkins would receive a life without parole sentence.  The shooting came after Perry had been asked by his stepdaughter Stephanie Finney, 45, to take her to look at a used car she wanted to purchase from a man on Craigslist. Perry, said Rich earlier in the trial, drove his wife's red Toyota Prius to Finney's home on Bayou Jonas Drive to pick her up. Finney had planned on cashing her $1,900 income tax check at the money store in the Wal-Mart in Tillman's Corner and meet the seller of the used car at that same Wal-Mart. Rich told jurors Atkins had been facing some personal troubles of her own that led her and Lindsay to cross paths with Perry and Finney that day. "She didn't have any money and she was going to get the money she needed," said Rich. Rich said Atkins and Lindsay decided to ride to the Bel-Air Mall and find a license plate to steal off another white Chevrolet vehicle that matched her own. Rich said video surveillance at the Dillard's store shows both women unscrewing the license plate off a woman's vehicle and putting it on Atkins car. As soon as Finney left the store, Lindsay followed her to see what vehicle she gets into before getting back in the car with Atkins. Perry and Finney drove to the back side of the Garden Center at Wal-Mart and meet the seller of the used car. Atkins and Lindsay pull into a parking space at a distance and watch. Finney decides not to buy the car after checking it out with Perry and they decide to head home. Atkins and Lindsay realize this and follow the pair, 15 miles away, to Bayou Jonas Drive. Once they get about half way up the street, Atkins speeds up and cuts Perry off forcing him to slam on his brakes and hit the rear of Atkins car in the wet weather. "She gets out the car with that loaded revolver screaming, 'Give me your wallet," said Rich. Perry rolled down the window and tried to give her his wallet and Atkins screams again. "I don't want your wallet, I want her wallet," said Rich to the jurors. Finney hands her wallet to Atkins, who reaches inside the driver side window with the revolver to get the wallet. Perry tries to grab the gun and the wallet falls. He told Finney to run before the first gunshot went off and missed Perry going through the open passenger door as Finney tried to escape. During the struggle for the gun, Perry gave up and tried to slide out the passenger side of the car. The second shot struck Perry in the left arm and pierce his jugular vein and exited his right side. The third gunshot went into the driver seat and into the gas tank. "She opens the car door as he's dying and takes the wallet and flees," said Rich. Rich said Lindsay never got out the car and that Atkins did not realize that Bayou Jonas Road was a dead end street as they sped off. The two women got out of the vehicle and ran into the woods for about two miles before getting caught by Mobile County Sheriff's Office deputies. The $1900 in cash wasn't found until after the two women were booked inside metro jail. "The $1,900 dollars in cash was found in their vaginas and the revolver was found in the floorboard of the Chevy," said Rich. Defense Attorney James Vollmer had maintained the homicide was not planned. "This is not capital murder, it's felony murder," Vollmer said during opening statements. "As difficult as this may be to say, but she intended to rob someone but not to kill someone." He said audio of Atkins statements to police detectives after being arrested clearly shows that. "Once she learned of his death from detectives later that night she was horrified," said Vollmer. Most Read Get email notifications on your comments ...

Home Industry Companies Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery in Mexico Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery in Mexico A U.S. judge is granting class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world's largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: September 22, 2016 8:53 PM In a ruling this week, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart’s argument that the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses.(Reuters) A U.S. judge is granting class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico. In a ruling this week, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart’s argument that the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey ruled that the pension fund showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method is preferable. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public. Wal-Mart said Thursday it’s considering an appeal.

The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart's argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart's stance was based on a certain accounting method. FILE - This Sept. 19, 2013, file photo, shows the sign of a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. In a ruling on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Ark., granted class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world¿s largest retailer over allegations it hid a bribery scheme in Mexico. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. "Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification," Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. "We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying a class," he said. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn't alert U.S. or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Wal-Mart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company's Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, did "not give rise to a reasonable reference" that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court's dismissal. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Peter Holley September 22 Follow @peterjholley A woman who admitted to stealing from a Walmart in St. Petersburg, Fla. told a judge she is seeking a job at the retail giant. The unexpected exchange occurred in a Florida courtroom.     EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY/MICHAEL REYNOLDS Nearly a year and a half has passed since Shaday Bellamy was stopped by Walmart security as she left one of the retail giant’s stores in St. Petersburg, Fla. In the 22-year-old’s shopping cart, police said, store security discovered about $150 worth of “children’s baby items.” A security officer who looked at her receipt was the first to notice a discrepancy. “She had partially scanned some of the items, but there were a number of items she hadn’t paid for,” St. Petersburg Police Department spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez said. “She was charged with shoplifting and retail theft, which is a misdemeanor.” Bellamy was never arrested, but did receive a notice to appear in court, which she failed to do, police said. Shaday Bellamy, 22, appeared before A Pinellas County judge on Saturday. (Photo courtesy of WTSP) Fast forward 17 months to Saturday, when Bellamy found herself standing in front of a judge during Operation Safe Surrender, an annual partnership between police and courts that allows people with outstanding nonviolent misdemeanor warrants to turn themselves in without being arrested, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. Most warrants are the result of traffic violations, missed court dates and code violations, officials said. “We’re trying to make the system work here, so if they show up things are going to go better than if we had to go out and arrest them,” Pinellas County Judge Henry J. “Hank” Andringa told CBS affiliate WTSP “I think it works to their benefit.” After pleading guilty, Bellamy was asked by a judge about her plans, leading to an exchange that left Andringa temporarily speechless, according to video shot by WTSP. “Do you work?” Andringa asked. “I’m looking for [work], I have an interview,” Bellamy replied. “I’m waiting for Walmart to call me back at Pinellas Park. I have an interview with them.” For six seconds, the stupefied judge said nothing while his jaw dropped and his eyes nervously scanned the courtroom like a man caught in the Twilight Zone. Andringa is a veteran judge who “is known for sometimes adding levity” to court proceedings, according to the Clearwater Bar Association. This was not one of those times. “I’m on ‘Candid Camera,’ aren’t I?” Andringa finally replied. “How do you think it’s gonna go when the background shows that you tried to take a cart full of stuff from — well — Walmart?” he continued. “A lot of times, that’d be a disqualifier,” Andringa said. “What do I know? There, I’m over it.” Reached by phone, a Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the theft or Bellamy’s pending job application. Pinellas County Sheriff’s officials said they considered Operation Safe Surrender a success. The court collected $1,113 in fees and fines, and 38 misdemeanor warrants were processed and purged from the system, including Bellamy’s, officials said. No arrests were made during the event.

Photo: Isaac Rousso The Rousso family (left to right) — Lily, Joey, Sara, and Isaac — are excited prior to Tuesday’s opening of their first restaurant, State Fair Treats, and what it means to their future. Starting out at the State Fair of Texas, Rousso once said he wanted to have something for his children to hold on to: a business and a tradition. Isaac Rousso’s cookie fries, which won the 2016 Big Tex Choice Award for Most Creative, will debut in the restaurant on October 24 — after State Fair attendees get the first bite. The restaurant, which opened Tuesday, Sept. 20, is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week. “These last few weeks have been filled with many crazy-amazing 24-hour days and this is really an awesome time in our lives,” said Rousso, who plans to open more locations in the next year and across the country in the future, sharing his menu which will have up to 45 items. It was during the second week of the 2015 State Fair of Texas that he was approached by Wal-Mart executives, wanting to connect and create something new and different. “The State Fair of Texas has given us an incredible foundation and grounding, and it is the platform on which we are elevating to some really great opportunities to keep the flavors of the Fair, and ourselves, going the other 341 days of the year.” Rousso, a Dallas native, is the son of Cuban immigrants, Bertha and Joseph of blessed memory, and the brother of Sarah Rich and Rebecca Wussow. He grew up at Temple Emanu-El and was a member of BBYO’s Brandeis chapter, graduating from The Alexander School and UT Austin. He and his wife Lily, a native of Miami, Florida and the daughter of part-time Dallasites Migali and Samuel Naon, are the parents of Sara and Joey, a baby and a toddler when this journey began. In a 2010 Texas Jewish Post article, Rousso said he wanted to have something for his children to hold on to: a business and a tradition. Seemingly, with his successes, he has accomplished that goal many times over. Always a big dreamer, Isaac holds on to the fact that his family came to the United States from Cuba in 1962 and all of his life his parents taught him about working hard and living the American dream. “When I think back to how we got here, this is really some kind of dream,” he said, thrilled at the opportunity to expand his brand. “More than 2 million people come through during the Fair’s 24-day run. At our first Wal-Mart location alone, which we chose because it really is in our ‘backyard,’ we’ll have the chance to see between one-and-a-half and 2 million people every year.” The State Fair Treats menu’s taste-bud teasers include hash brown bites, breakfast tacos, breakfast biscuits, French toast, nachos, chili fries, fried pickles, macaroni and cheese bites, and desserts like funnel cake fries, cannoli bites, fried Oreos and Twinkies, and the Texas bluebonnet with whipped cream and blueberry puree. Rousso oversees all but welcomes Operations Manager Jacob Hunter and General Manager Jackie Blakely to his team. Cookie fries, crinkle-cut fry-shaped cookies — crispy on the outside and a soft butter-cookie inside with chocolate chips or sprinkles, and chocolate or strawberry sauce in which to “gedunk” the sweet sticks — derived from a recommendation by Lily. That was a good recommendation, it seems, as the entry won the 2016 Big Tex Choice Award for Most Creative. This latest culinary concoction of Rousso’s will debut in the restaurant Oct. 24 — after State Fair attendees get the first bite, during the Fair’s run from Sept. 30 to Oct. 23. In the last nine years, Rousso received Big Tex Choice Award honors for his deep-fried Cuban roll, fried Pop Tart, and his smoky bacon margarita. The business, a family collaborative that began its run at the State Fair of Texas almost a decade ago with their Taste of Cuba booth, has in the years since added the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and most recently the Craft Beer Terrace. It’s tough not to make a Rousso-infused snack-stop no matter where you are. “We’ve made lots of friends through the years and even though, until now, we’ve only had the month of the State Fair to see people, it’s cool that the kids who were tweens when we started are now gone to college,” said Rousso. It’s not lost on him that his own children have really grown up with his business. “It’s going to be great to get to see people, we hope, a lot more often in the restaurant.” Karissa Condoianis, vice president of public relations at the State Fair of Texas, noted that the State Fair Treats concept is wholly Rousso’s and not at all owned by the Fair itself. “We are so happy for Isaac and Lily and the whole family because they embody everything State Fair of Texas. We love seeing hard work pay off and this family works really hard. “They are so humble and kind and this venture is sure to keep the spirit of the Fair always alive.” Condoianis said that Rousso has made a commitment to help support the State Fair of Texas’ Youth Scholarship Program, which, since 1992, has awarded $8.7 million to deserving students. For the Roussos, who are members of both Chabad of Plano/Collin County and Temple Shalom and who have been married for 16 years, this year is going to be a sweet 16, and a tasty year to remember!

Walmart India mulls entry into processed food retailing after FDI rules changed The Financial Express 22-09-2016 FE Bureau © image Walmart India is evaluating an entry into the retailing of processed foods taking advantage of the government’s liberalised policy of allowing 100% foreign capital in the space, Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Walmart India, said on Wednesday.  “We are currently evaluating all the policy guidelines and we do not have an ‘only food model’ anywhere. So, we need to conceptualise, evaluate and come up with a model, which takes time,” Iyer told reporters on the sidelines of the India Retail Forum. “It is not something we will jump into very quickly,” he added. The government had in June announced 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in trading of food products produced and manufactured in India. This is now permitted through retail trading including e-commerce under the approval route. The food processing sector has attracted $5.3 billion via FDI between April 2012 and December 2015. For Walmart India, food retail in the cash-and-carry business accounts for more than 65% of business, Iyer said. He also noted that resellers, particularly mom-and-pop stores, are the most important channel for Walmart. “Our e-commerce (business to business) experience has been good, and while we do not speak about the e-commerce sales, more than 50% of buying is digitally influenced,” he said. The retailer runs 20 stores in the cash-and-carry format in nine states across the country. In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total to 70 as part of an omni-channel strategy. “We continue to focus on Tier II and Tier III cities, and the opportunities here are as good as metro towns,” Iyer said, adding that availability of land is a challenge in metros. He added that the company is focusing on private labels as it fetches better margins. “At present 95% of our products sold are manufactured in India,” he said. Meanwhile, food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal told the The Wall Street Journal that British retailer Tesco had expressed its interest in running a retail food business in India. They have dabbled in selling products wholesale and are ready to enter the retail market through outlets that sell just local fresh produce and processed food, the minister said. “Retailers want to come to India as our markets and opportunities are too good,” she said in an interview. WSJ reported Kaur recently met with retailer and food processor executives in the UK, including those from Tesco, J Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer. Many said they were exploring tie-ups with Indian companies to allow them to navigate complex local regulations to open stores and set up food-processing facilities, Kaur said.

Each quarter, both full and part time associates can earn cash bonuses based on their store's performance. $WMT pic.twitter.com/904xoCH2HL— Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) September 21, 2016 But it doesn’t talk as much about the quarterly payouts to another group: shareholders, in particular its largest shareholders, the Waltons. The Walton family, which together owns 51.35 percent of the world’s largest retail company founded by Sam Walton in 1962, receives a quarterly dividend of $720 million.  That’s 50 cents for each of the family’s 1.44 billion shares. On an annual basis, that's almost $3 billion.  The $720 million for a few Waltons every quarter compares with the most recent quarterly bonus of $201 million for 932,000 hourly workers nationwide. Children of Sam Walton — Alice, Jim and Rob — each own shares directly. The remaining family shares are held by Walton Enterprises, the family’s holding company. In Texas, the employee second-quarter bonus comes to an average of $237 per worker, or a total of $24.5 million paid out to 103,500 Wal-Mart employees in the state. Is this a fair comparison to make? Here’s another one:  $2.7 billion vs $20 billion Last year, Wal-Mart announced a two-year $2.7 billion investment in its employees. That will pay for investments in education, training and higher wages. As part of this program, 1.2 million Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club employees got a raise on the same day earlier this year.  Now the average full-time hourly wage is $13.38 an hour. The average part-time hourly wage will be $10.58 an hour. At the same time, Wal-Mart said it will spend $20 billion to repurchase its own shares in the market over the next two years. That’s more than seven times the increased amount planned for improving store employee training and pay. Wal-Mart has been paying bonuses since the days of founder Sam Walton. And Wal-Mart is doing better. Its employees are meeting new tests for clean, fast and friendly shopping. The company reported a better-than-expected second quarter and raised its outlook for the year. Traffic is up as customers like what they’re seeing. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the company is making the employee bonus pay information public to show a trend in improved operations. The bonus represents another measure that U.S. stores, long criticized for their shopping environment, have improved. Both the number of people receiving bonuses and the total amount distributed are up in the second quarter vs. the same quarter in the last two years.

By: Reuters | Us | Published: September 22, 2016 5:55 AM Wal-Mart Stores Inc must face a class-action lawsuit accusing the world’s largest retailer of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico, a U.S. judge said. (Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc must face a class-action lawsuit accusing the world’s largest retailer of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico, a U.S. judge said. In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas rejected Wal-Mart’s contention that a Michigan pension fund had no standing to lead the case because it had not suffered losses on the retailer’s stock. The decision means shareholders can sue Wal-Mart and former Chief Executive Mike Duke as a group over the alleged cover-up of bribery at Wal-Mart de Mexico. This could lead to a larger payout at lower cost than if individual lawsuits were required. Class certification “would enhance judicial economy and efficiency,” given that many shareholders had small claims, and “concentrating the claims in defendants’ home forum with uniform decisions is desirable,” Hickey wrote. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer believes a class action is “not appropriate,” and may appeal the certification decision. Related Wal-Mart rejects settlement with US over alleged bribery Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery in Mexico Wal-Mart must face US class action over alleged Mexican bribery Ahead of Amazon Prime Day, Wal-Mart tries to move in The market value of Wal-Mart fell by roughly $17 billion over three days in April 2012, after The New York Times published a Pulitzer Prize-winning report saying the retailer paid bribes to Mexican officials for years to speed up store openings. Shareholders said Wal-Mart knew about the scheme as early as 2005, and downplayed it even after learning about the Times’ investigation. Wal-Mart had argued that a widely-accepted accounting method prevented the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System from showing it lost money on Wal-Mart stock. But the judge said the pension fund could show losses under another widely-accepted accounting method, and that Wal-Mart failed to show why its preferred method was better. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012, Hickey said. In July, a federal appeals court upheld Hickey’s April 2015 dismissal of shareholder claims against Duke, his predecessor Lee Scott, and Wal-Mart’ board. A Delaware state judge dismissed similar claims by other shareholders in May. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd represents the Michigan pension fund. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System v. Walmart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162. Please Wait while comments are loading...

According to previous records, Johnny Smith was charged with mischief and burglary in 2008 in Jones County. At the time he was accused of breaking into his ex-girlfriend's garage, killing her dogs and popping her tires. Authorities alleged he decapitated and ripped the other one open with a machete. He stood trial for those charges, but a jury found him not guilty. Smith was also once charged with embezzlement because some equipment came up missing after he was terminated from the south Mississippi narcotics task force. That charge was eventually dropped.

Roston - Sep 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In case you’ve forgotten, Xiaomi has a sleek looking Android TV device in the pipeline called the Mi Box. This set-top-box will compete with the likes of Roku and Amazon as a consumer video streaming device, one that brings fairly high level specs compared to similar products. We’ve got a bunch of pictures and all the details in our hands-on from May, and now we may have a price: $69, at least per someone who spotted the Xiaomi Mi Box in a Walmart. Though the Mi Box was announced earlier this year, it hasn’t yet launched and it’s not entirely clear when it will. Speculation has it that we’ll be seeing it next month, and the price will be — according to the rumor mill — somewhere south of $100. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69. Was this released yet? pic.twitter.com/AsuNZeU5oJ — George Garrett (@garrettdotcom) September 23, 2016 Someone at Walmart didn’t get the memo, though, and put the device out on display with a $69 USD price tag, seemingly confirming its price while hinting that its launch is very close to happening. The Mi Box was spotted by Twitter user George Garrett who sent out the above tweet and photo. If it does launch at this price point, it would be hard to argue the Mi Box is anything less than a pretty great deal (in comparison, you’d have to spend $129.99 to get a Roku box with 4K support). The device offers a quad-core ARM processor and a couple gigs of RAM, 8GB of storage (that can be expanded), support for 4K at 60fps, a mic-equipped remote control for voice control, and support for all the major apps like Netflix, Sling, VUDU, Hulu, and more. The set top box can also be used for modest gaming, with Xiaomi planning to offer a game controller. Check out the timeline below for more info!

Garrott Benjamin Jr. Senior Living Center, holds photos of James Carpenter (left) and Calvin Bowie, two of the center's residents who were killed crossing North Michigan Road after being dropped off at a bus stop. The east side of the street where the men were dropped off lacks sidewalks and streetlights. (Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star, Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star)Buy Photo For the elderly residents at a northwest-side senior living center, a simple walk off campus to Michigan Road has become a deadly exercise. Three residents of the low-income apartment building have been struck and killed on the busy, fast-moving thoroughfare in five years. The latest was 89-year-old Horace Rounds, killed by a hit-and-run driver and left in a ditch Thursday morning, police said. Rounds had left a Walmart Neighborhood Market in the 5500 block of North Michigan Road, south of Kessler Boulevard. Rounds was the third resident of the Bishop T. Garrott Benjamin Jr. Senior Living Center, 4720 N. Michigan Road, since 2011 to be killed in traffic on Michigan Road in the dark. Calvin Bowie, 72, a Sunday school teacher, was killed in 2014 while crossing  the street in his wheelchair. James Carpenter, 65, a volunteer at the Indianapolis Children's Museum, was struck and killed in 2011. IndyStar highlighted their deaths in a story published Thursday as part of its "Left in the Dark" series about the city's pedestrian death toll amid a dearth of streetlights. Like Bowie and Carpenter, Rounds was struck while trying to cross Michigan Road in the dark where there are no streetlights and spotty sidewalks. Indianapolis police said a dog walker found Rounds in a drainage ditch on the west side of Michigan Road. He had apparently tried to cross the street from east to west at 6 a.m. where a sidewalk ended in front of the Walmart. Police said he was hit by a 1997 or 1998 Ford Expedition or a green 1997-1998 Ford F-150, which should have damage to the driver's front side, including a broken headlight. IMPD crash investigator Sgt. Doug Heustis said police were able to determine from a scattering of car parts in the street its make and model. Rounds lived at the senior living center for the past year and often took walks for exercise, said Thomas Benjamin, who manages the apartment building. “He liked to walk early in the morning because it was cooler,” said Benjamin, who described Rounds as a sweet, kind man. An IndyStar investigation found that more than half of the pedestrian deaths in Indianapolis happen at night where the roads don't have streetlights, a much higher rate than other cities. A 35-year moratorium on new streetlight construction has left huge swaths of the city poorly illuminated, even though the population has increased by 180,000 since the ban was put in place. Compounding the danger for pedestrians is that the city did not build sidewalks for 20 years and now would need to spend $750 million to lay them down just along the city's main streets. INDIANAPOLIS STAR Left in the dark: Indy's deadly streets An IndyStar reporter on Friday visited the spot where Rounds was killed, at about the same hour of the morning. The street was extremely dark, almost pitch black except for a solitary, recently installed streetlight at Oles Drive at least 200 feet away from where Rounds was run down. Jim Grey, 49, who has lived near Kessler and 56th Street for 21 years, said it is dangerous to walk in the neighborhood. "I learned very quickly that walking in the area is not wise," he said. "My kids attend Crooked Creek Elementary, which is definitely in walking distance, but they take the bus." Grey said he would would like to see more streetlights on Michigan Road and perhaps a lowering of the 45-mph speed limit. "I was surprised when I moved here from Terre Haute about the lack of streetlights," he said. "We could use some more infrastructure to make it more walkable since there is so much more commercial development here and places to go." Mayor Joe Hogsett announced this summer he would install 100 streetlights across the city, but none of the first 25 are planned for Michigan Road. "We are currently working with (the Department of Public Works)  and Business and Neighborhood Services, as well as IndyGo, to assess the pedestrian needs and identify the range of options that can improve the safety in the immediate area — including addressing the fact that the pedestrian crosswalk and bus stop have not matched up for years," mayoral spokeswoman Taylor Schaffer said in a statement. "It might also be worth noting that residents of the senior living center reached out to (Deputy Mayor) Dr. (David) Hampton yesterday morning about their safety concerns and he, Jeff Bennett, IMPD and a variety of department heads have been sorting through traffic studies and the range of pedestrian accessibility issues ever since." Lance Terry, 68, a resident of the senior center, was among those lamenting the loss of yet another member of the community.  Terry, who walks with the assistance of a cane, said he won’t venture beyond the apartment building’s parking lot. “I don’t walk out there,” he said, nodding toward the rush of traffic on Michigan Road. “It’s too dangerous.” Benjamin said police “are very aware of the risk people take when they travel on foot in this corridor.” “It’s very obvious something needs to be done,” he said. “How many individuals have to lose their lives because we’re being reactive instead of proactive?” The deaths of three men so late in their lives is a tragedy, he said. “To live that long and have it end this way, so tragically with them being hit by cars, it’s a shame really,” he said.

More than you might think Secaucus Walmart 11 percent of all arrests made for the year 2015 were made at the Secaucus Walmart Supercenter at Park Plaza Drive, police say. (Journal file photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on September 23, 2016 at 11:54 AM comments SECAUCUS – On Sept. 5, police were investigating a possible theft in the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter at 400 Park Plaza Drive when they came across a separate incident – a man caught red-handed trying steal from the store, police said. Juan Rodriguez, a 41-year-old male from Bronx, New York, was leaving the store with a backpack full of $561.54 worth of electronic devices – including a pair of speakers and a GPS device – when officers placed him under arrest after he tried fleeing, police said.  The following day, two more men were arrested at the store when they allegedly tried stealing PlayStation controllers. For Secaucus cops, responding to these types of calls at Walmart is to be expected. Since Aug. 3, there have been 11 arrests made at the superstore – 10 for alleged shoplifting and one for an attempted shortchange scheme, cops say. The week of Aug. 18 alone saw four arrests made at Walmart. While data is not yet available for 2016, police say that over 12 percent of all Secaucus Police Department arrests made in 2015 came at Walmart – 121 of the 964 arrests made during the year. Incidents at Walmart (458) accounted for 4 percent of the police department's total number of town-wide service calls in 2015.  And while the superstore, which opened in 2004, is a frequent stop for Secaucus police officers, all of the people arrested there in the past month were not Secaucus residents.  "Walmart is a big place and people come from all over to go there – from New York to other parts of Hudson and Bergen County," said police Capt. Dennis Miller. "(Secaucus) is located centrally and is easily accessible to all these places. The other thing is that this one is open 24 hours a day." "(The Walmart is) really separate from the community, it doesn't really impact the community at all," added Mayor Michael Gonnelli. "It's in Harmon Meadow away from practically everything." The store also generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for Secaucus. The Sam's Club and Walmart – both operated under the same company at 400 Park Plaza Drive – contributed $1.5 million in tax revenue in 2015 for the town, and has thus far contributed nearly $1.2 million to date this year, according to electronic tax records. Nonetheless, Secaucus Police expend a consistent amount of time dealing with reports of theft at the superstore. Town officials say there have been talks of establishing a consistent police presence there, but nothing official has been established. Gonnelli said the town would like to sit down with Walmart officials and negotiate the cost of having an officer permanently positioned inside the store. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," Walmart spokeswoman Betsy Harden said in a statement.  This would be in addition to Walmart's loss prevention staff, as well as a third party security firm that works overnight hours, Harden said.  "They have loss prevention that works there already," Miller said. "We had met with one representative of Walmart to discuss them having a cop there full time -- to be stationed down there as a detail and that officer would handle the call volume from there. But there's nothing to report on that right now."

(Photo: JOHN C. ENSSLIN/Staff photographer)Buy Photo 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TRENTON - Realistic looking toy guns no longer could be sold legally in New Jersey under a bill that has advanced in the state Legislature. The Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee on Thursday voted 4-2 with one abstention to forward the measure, which would require that toy makers include a 1-inch-wide, non-removable orange stripe along the barrel of a replica gun. The bill requires that the toy also be a color other than black, blue, silver or aluminum. NEWS FROM CAMDEN: Suspect charged in 8-year-old's shooting death The bill now advances to a vote in the full Assembly, but so far no version has been introduced in the Senate. Gov. Chris Christie has opposed a series of gun-related bills adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. But Assemblywoman Sheila Oliver, D-Essex, who sponsored the toy gun ban, said her bill deals with a specific problem that is different than other gun control measures. Oliver said she decided to sponsor the bill in response to the November 2014 fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police while holding an air pellet gun. Such guns are required by federal law to have an orange tip. While testifying Thursday, Oliver held up a black plastic replica of an automatic handgun that she said can be bought by children in a local corner store. “I am sorry,” she said. “I take umbrage with that when there is something like this that can be purchased in a confectionary store and a 12-year-old can be dead.” Oliver testified along with Ted Green, council president in East Orange, where officials passed an ordinance banning the sale of such toy guns. Assemblyman David Rible, a retired police officer, opposed the bill, saying it could create a potentially lethal situation if criminals were to paint an orange stripe along the barrel of a real gun and use it to kill a law enforcement officer. “I think we’re setting ourselves up for a larger unintended consequence,” Rible said. Rible, R-Monmouth, said he understood the intentions behind the bill but said it would prove ineffective. Police officers have to make split second decisions when confronted by a gun, he said. Rible cited one study that found 96 percent of officers were unable to distinguish between real and orange-tipped pellet guns in a shoot/don’t shoot scenario. Oliver countered that the problem with toy guns also involves confrontations between children that turn deadly. John C.

Luc Tieman (Photo: Contributed) 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE An autopsy revealed that a former Greenville resident who was reported missing in Maine died of two gunshot wounds to the head, according to a police affidavit. The court document also detailed the police investigation into Valerie Tieman's disappearance and how her husband changed his story multiple times when speaking with detectives. Luc William Tieman, 32, of Fairfield, Maine, was charged with murder in the death of his wife, Valerie Tieman, a 34-year-old woman who grew up in Greenville. Her body was found Tuesday after no one had seen or heard from her in weeks. Valerie Tieman's parents last communicated with their daughter on Aug. 18 through Facebook, according to an affidavit filed by Detective Hugh Landry of the Maine State Police. On Sept. 8, Luc Tieman told Valerie Tieman's parents that she left him and he hadn't seen her for some time, according to the affidavit. "Valerie's parents felt it was unusual for her to go this long without contacting them," the detective wrote in the court document. At this point, Luc Tieman had not told authorities about his wife's disappearance. Her parents reported her missing Sept. 9, and officers with the Fairfield Police Department went to the Tiemans' residence in an effort to find her. The couple shared a home with Luc Tieman's parents, but his mother told officers the couple no longer lived there. Luc Tieman and his mother, in separate discussions with police, said Valerie Tieman wanted to move out. Tieman called law enforcement on Sept. 12 and told the Fairfield Police Department that he last saw his wife at Walmart in Skowhegan, Maine. He told police he left his wife in their red Chevy Silverado and went into the store. When he returned, she was gone, he said. THE GREENVILLE NEWS Husband charged with murder of former Greenville resident Maine State Police joined the investigation Sept. 13. Detective Landry went to the Walmart in Skowhegan and incidentally found Luc Tieman in the Silverado. He had a suspended driver's license and a warrant for his arrest. Landry stopped the vehicle, spoke with Luc Tieman, and he followed the detective to State Police Barracks for an interview. Luc Tieman told police he had not seen his wife since Aug. 30 at the Walmart. He said he thought it would be better to not tell Valerie Tieman's parents that she was missing, according to the affidavit. "I asked Luc if Valerie took her stuff and he responded that she must have expected to come back because she pretty much left everything," Landry wrote in the court document. "Luc explained that when he left the store and found that she was not there he called Valerie and sent her text messages trying to find her and telling her he would take her back." A detective reviewed Walmart surveillance video from Aug. 21-31 and did not see Luc Tieman's truck. Another detective reviewed Valerie Tieman's cellphone records and noted that her last recorded call was Aug. 24 to her husband. The call lasted 13 minutes, 33 seconds. Her phone used a cell phone tower that services the area of 628 Norridgewock Road in Fairfield. Luc Tieman's phone was using a tower in Waterville at the beginning of the call. By the end of the call, it was using the same tower as his wife's phone. His phone then only used that tower until 2:26 p.m. Aug. 25, when his phone again connected to the Waterville area tower. Maine State Police executed a search warrant Tuesday at 628 Norridgewock Road in Fairfield and found Valerie Tieman's body partially buried in a wooded area behind the residence she shared with her husband and his parents. "Luc initially denied any knowledge of the body, but changed his statement and said the body was his wife Valerie," an officer wrote in an affidavit. The autopsy Wednesday revealed she died of gunshot wounds to the head, according to the affidavit. Detectives took Luc Tieman into custody Wednesday morning in Waterville, near a hotel he stayed in Tuesday night, police said. He offered no resistance. Luc Tieman is being held at the Somerset County jail. 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2d3sEuX TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 More Stories Tigers' Wilkins named Nagurski Trophy finalist Nov. 17, 2016, 2:07 p.m. Man dies weeks after drive-by shooting Nov. 17, 2016, 12:06 p.m. Lawrence on his growth this season Nov. 17, 2016, 10:53 a.m. Evacuations planned as health issues rise from 'historic fire' Nov. 17, 2016, 9:15 a.m.

This isn’t about Target vs. Wal-Mart or Suicide Squad’s terrible reviews vs. Suicide Squad’s global box office haul. This post is about an entirely different version of the quality vs. quantity discussion. A friend of mine, James Andrews, who is CEO of Smashd, posed a question on Facebook earlier this year, asking what marketing trends people expect to see in 2017. One of the early comments was about the anticipation of greater focus on quality moving forward. I agree with this sentiment, but also believe that this push toward greater quality will take root in the way startups are measured, too. What I see happening right now in the venture capital business, both with private startups or with public companies that relied on VC dollars to grow, is a growing and perpetual lack of concern for quality if the quantities are right. Meaning: if user growth is rapid and revenue is steadily increasing, investors are routinely showing disregard for whether or not companies are doing the right thing. In the cases of Twitter, Snapchat and Airbnb, those decisions are coming back to hurt them. Related 'Experiences' Startup Besomebody Is Moving to Boston From Austin See, late last month, Snapchat pushed out yet another new filter that led to renewed tweets and Medium posts calling the company racist and offensive. While the unicorn said the filter was inspired by anime (similar to how their April 20th filter that was "inspired by" Bob Marley), many people including Katie Zhu, a product manager for the popular blogging platform Medium, called bullshit. Let me ask you something: is anyone really surprised? No. Twitter, another tech darling of the past decade, has had very well-publicized bouts with discrimination internally. First it was the lack of female representation on its board prior to their appointment of Marjorie Scardino in 2013 in the leadup to their I.P.O. Later came chronicled exits of black employees. A year ago, all any investor could seem to talk about was whether or not Twitter will ever grow quickly again to increase its stock price. In 2016, some began to wonder whether a climate of harassment and vitriol was keeping users away. As if on cue, alt-right Twitterati launched a campaign of harassment against celebrity comedian Leslie Jones, who quit the service very publicly (and temporarily). Twitter is waking up to the quality problem. In August it rolled out plans to introduce a quality filter. Then there’s Airbnb, the hospitality industry disruptor, that is facing the most significant hit to its reputation as a company in what had previously been a largely positive wave of praise on its way to a reported $30 billion valuation. The reason? A number of black users have experienced discrimination by hosts who are less inclined to offer their apartments and homes to people of color. So much for sharing and belonging, right? Airbnb's near-term solution of hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder to help address the problem seems sound, but also less likely to fix the underlying issue at the source (the product itself as Nextdoor realized) than would, say, hiring black engineers and product managers. But perhaps the investors who are about to pour the next $1 billion into the company at a whopping $30 billion valuation don't take the issue as seriously as its CEO. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and US Commerce Sec'y Penny Pritzker at GES 2016 Money isn’t lost if they’re jerks. Money isn’t lost if you’re late to address a major issue. Money is lost if they aren’t growing. Nice guys finish last in Startupland, according to the ongoing and vibrant action of tech industry investors. That is the message that is being sent over and over again to tech startup founders, whether you’re Jack Dorsey hiring a white man to run your diversity and inclusion efforts or you’re Evan Spiegel at Snapchat who, unlike Airbnb’s Brian Chesky, has not called his company’s discriminatory practices (or filters) the most challenging issue facing his company today. How fast are you growing? What’s your recurring revenue run rate? How many monthly users do you have? What is your annual revenue forecast for this fiscal year? Many of the most important metrics in business, the technology industry in particular, are focused on the quantitative attributes of a company. It’s understandable. Successful businesses need to grow their customer bases, their monthly users and their bottom lines. But what about quality?  Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics.  If Uber gets in a fight with a major city’s government officials, exhibits what many of those officials believe to be asshole behavior then leaves the city (as it has in Austin), does that have implications on the quality of the technology or on the quantity of users and revenue potential? Perhaps investors don’t mind this happening in a city of just a million residents like Austin, but what if it happened in Paris or New York? Would that merit investor concern or a valuation adjustment? Or if Airbnb has highly-publicized issues with discrimination against a segment of its customers as it has with black users in America, is that a factor of the marketplace’s quality or quantity? What happens if those discrimination concerns are coming from the gay community or French people or females? Does that give investors confidence in the company focused on belonging? These occurrences and these questions should matter to you if you're a founder or startup investor or even if you work for a tech company. The industry today trains itself - the investors, the media, the employees - to be highly skilled at gauging the potential of a startup on quantitative aspects like user growth and revenue. Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics. Twitter investors who bought in at the company's $45-a-share IPO pop are understandably frustrated with its plummet to less than half that number. Would a better understanding of quality have helped them spot its problems earlier? Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Credit Bloomberg Media Source We may find out as transparency in business grows. Just look at the growing wave of criticism against tech companies and their lack of diversity since Intel, Apple, Amazon and others began publishing their hiring statistics. Hiring political figures like Eric Holder only goes so far. Eventually these companies - startups, even - will actually need to find a repeatable process that helps them consider quality over quantity. This, as it turns out, will help them recruit people of color, provide equal pay and promotion opportunities to women and stop being assholes in general. Of course, the tech industry wants you to believe this is simply a case of a few bad apples. That would be a lie. When these “bad apples” have as much business ownership as a senior executive at Uber or as much product leadership as the people who choose the filters at Snapchat, there is plenty evidence that this offensive behavior goes largely unpunished by investors who fuel the industry. And it all starts by placing as much focus on quality as quantity, and - in some instances - even more focus on quality if the quantity is lacking. Today, everything we’re seeing in the business community, be it ethical manufacturing or diversity in recruiting and leadership, points to a growing role for quality (alongside quantity) on the success of companies. The tech industry may be living in its own bubble of sorts, thanks to the continued success of Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and others, but that bubble will pop if enough users continue to feel like this is perpetually breaking the one rule Google was smart enough to deploy as its motto: don’t be evil. Why does a tech company need to tell the public it won't be evil? Because a successful tech company - Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb - can transform an entire industry, people's lives and their behaviors. So if your company is racist or sexist or has a few bad apples in prominent positions, that behavior may just seep out into the mainstream via an apartment for rent or a Snapchat filter. Quantity is about repeatable processes. Good news in knowing how to measure for it is that you scale more quickly by doing the thing that worked over and over again. Hire another white male engineer. Ignore another complaint from a black user or customer. We’re still growing so who cares, right? Bad news is you lack diversity because your business relies on duplicating and building on the past rather than constantly seeking out what's new. You miss opportunities to build bridges with city officials. You miss signals from underrepresented employees and users. You miss out on future growth with customers you don’t presently have. There's no filter for failure, but if success looks like a continued disregard for people, then I hope this is what they meant when they said "fail fast."

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ?

(NYSE: WMT) closing its Jet.com acquisition, Barclays upgraded the biggest retailer stocks from Equal Weight to an Overweight rating and boosted the price objective from $70 to $87. This implies a growth potential of about 20 percent. The brokerage believes that the company's turnaround is not priced and that the firm could see retailer regaining momentum. The retailer is one of the few companies to report EPS either in line or above estimates. In the last four quarters, its EPS topped between 1.0 percent and 11.4 percent. In the recent past, Wal-Mart struggled to post revenue in line with the expectations. However, the most recent quarter witnessed a beat. The acquisition of Jet.com has further added to investments' sentiments. Related Link: 4 Pieces Of Advice For Wal-Mart Now That Jet.com Acquisition Officially Closed In a research note to clients, analysts led by Karen Short said, "Given that Walmart exhibits all of the traits of a Stable Staple (positive traffic, 2.8 percent dividend yield, 7.5 percent FCF yield, respectable lease-adjusted ROIC, positive traffic), yet is trading at a significant discount, we are assuming coverage with an Overweight rating and an $87 price target (32 percent upside)." The brokerage has a upside target price of $95 while it kept a downside target price of $68 on the company's stock. Barclays places 30 percent probability scenario for the downside risks. On the positive side, analysts listed continued comp and traffic trends, holding firm the stable staple of key metrics like dividend yield, free cash flow and optionality on balance sheet. Similarly, on the flip side, CAPEX increase, lack of alternate format, and reversal of trends or customer feedbacks are listed for the potential drag down of the stock. In Friday's pre-market session, Wal-Mart shares were up 0.42 percent at $72.57. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

I do have a problem with the Walmart hunters who show up and buy a lot of their gear the night they arrive, or look like a refugee fleeing the apocalypse with everything imaginable for convenience hanging off their truck and trailer. I live in a small community in the middle of one of the most popular hunting areas in the state. I see how unprepared and uneducated many of these hunters are when they show up to hunt. Most of them have no idea where the occupied residences are or for that matter how close they should be shooting (150 yards or across roads). On two occasions I have had hunters discharge weapons in the direction of our home, nothing brings back old memories like the rip of a round going past you. Over the years, I have had to help several hunters retrieve their kill because they did not have the necessary means to do the job. I hate to see meat spoil. They don’t have the equipment like a quad or even a backpack to carry out several hundred pounds of meat. Sometimes they do not even know where they are in relationship to the roads. Two years ago, I had a hunter stumble up to our house and ask where he was. I took him back to his kill, it had been down for several hours and not even gutted or skinned. Loaded it into my quad trailer and took it to his pickup. He offered me some meat, no thanks. Also, you have those trigger-happy hunters who do not know the difference between a bull elk and a cow, or shoot first and ID later. In the past few years, I have found three cows that were shot right after a bull hunt. What a waste of meat. Then you have the campsites. We have found multiple campfires not extinguished. Bags of trash and diapers left at campsites. Then there is the human waste not even covered with dirt. Then there is the disrespect for private property. Our community has no access to the national forest. Yet, hunters regularly park in yards and climb over fences to access the national forest. Then there are those guys showing up with a brand new AR-15 or AK with several high capacity clips. Now, I know you can kill an elk or deer with these weapons, but if you can’t hit it with the first, well-placed shot, then 10 quick rounds aren’t getting anything. If I hear one shot, it’s usually a kill, two maybe, but three or more is just a frustrated hunter. I have no problem with hunting, it’s just all the uneducated and inconsiderate hunters.

Eligible associates can earn these bonuses four times a year.   The company explained that this incentive program goes back to Sam Walton who built the business on the idea of sharing profits with associates and treating them as partners.   In February, the company rolled out its Pathways training program for all entry-level workers, providing training, education and opportunities for associates, offering them a clearer career path from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay.

Read today's eNewspaper Business Weis Markets expands its presence in Maryland through two acquisitions Weis is expanding in Maryland Weis Markets is expanding in Maryland by acquiring and converting five former Mars stores and 21 Maryland Food Lion stores. Some customers say they are happy overall with the changes at the Weis store in Essex that was Mars. (Lloyd Fox, Baltimore Sun video) Weis Markets is expanding in Maryland by acquiring and converting five former Mars stores and 21 Maryland Food Lion stores. Some customers say they are happy overall with the changes at the Weis store in Essex that was Mars. (Lloyd Fox, Baltimore Sun video) Lorraine MirabellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Weis Markets is one of several grocers changing the food retailing landscape in the Baltimore area. Just days after Baltimore-based Mars Super Markets went out of business in July, five of its stores reopened as Weis Markets. The new name may be unfamiliar to some area shoppers but likely won't be for long. The Weis brand has proliferated around the state in a matter of weeks. Besides acquiring five stores from Mars, a family-owned fixture in Baltimore since the 1940s, the company acquired 38 Food Lion locations in the Mid-Atlantic and is converting those stores, including locations in Columbia and Elkridge on Friday. The rapid push into the Baltimore area and elsewhere in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia represents one of the Sunbury, Pa.-based grocer's biggest expansions. "It's a big move for us," said Kurt Schertle, chief operating officer for Weis Markets, which had some stores in Maryland but none in Delaware or Virginia. "We had been wanting to expand our footprint in the Baltimore region. [Former Mars stores] seemed like a natural fit. This was the year they were ready to move on, so it just worked out for us." As competition in grocery retailing heats up, Weis is among a handful of grocers eyeing the Baltimore area for expansion or new stores. Wegmans, with stores in Columbia, Hunt Valley, Abingdon and Gambrills, opened a much-anticipated eighth Maryland location a week ago in Owings Mills, when store officials said more than 23,000 people showed up. Lidl, a German discount grocer much like Aldi, which grew rapidly in the Baltimore region, is poised to make its own push soon.

And mass merchants Target and Wal-Mart continue to expand food offerings — Wal-Mart now ranks as the third-largest seller of groceries in the Baltimore-Washington market, according to trade journal Food World.

Weis Markets is expanding in the Mid-Atlantic with the purchase of 38 Food Lion stores, including half a dozen in the Baltimore region, as Food Lion's parent company looks to unload stores to satisfy antitrust regulators as part of its merger with the parent company of Giant Food. Food Lion parent... (Sarah Gantz and Natalie Sherman) Weis officials said they saw an opportunity with both acquisitions to move into prime locations in a strong — if crowded — market, even though the acquired stores are smaller than new supermarkets. In Baltimore County alone, Weis increased its presence from four stores to 11 through the Mars and Food Lion acquisitions. Thanks to the Food Lion conversions, Weis now has four stores in Carroll County, three in Howard, and four in Anne Arundel. The chain had two already in Harford. The final Baltimore area conversion from Food Lion to Weis will be completed by Thursday. Weis acquired the Food Lion supermarkets as Food Lion owner Delhaize Group and Giant Food parent company Koninklijke Ahold sought approval of their July merger from antitrust regulators. The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in Maryland and five other states required the parent companies to sell off 76 stores nationwide to satisfy those concerns, including 26 in Maryland. Weis purchased 21 of the Maryland Food Lions. Mars closed all of its 13 stores this summer, laying off hundreds of employees amid declining sales and intense competition. Mars Chairman and CEO Chris D'Anna blamed declining sales and said the company fell short in efforts to cut costs while trying to preserve jobs and benefits. Analysts said Mars also struggled to keep up with emerging grocery retail trends. Weis, which has built a reputation on price and service, will offer more prepared, fresh and natural products than the previous operators, said Jeremy Diamond, a director of Diamond Marketing Group, a Baltimore-based food retail consulting firm. "Weis is one of the few large supermarket chains that are still family-owned and private," Diamond said. "As the chain expands in Maryland, they're going to use that to their advantage." Weis likely faces heavier competition in areas around the newly acquired former Mars stores, Diamond said. "Most of the Mars stores were built so many years ago, when we didn't have Target or Wal-Mart in this area, and other grocers kind of moved in to the Mars neighborhoods," he said. Food Lion, newer to the region, "did a better job of selecting their locations." Schertle said Weis is well aware of the region's stiff competition. While Mars had "a great history, great locations and great associates," it was "fighting with one hand tied behind its back," going up against competitors such as Giant Food and Safeway, which offer private-label products, loyalty programs, gas rewards programs and greater variety in fresh food departments. Weis plans to bring those services to its newly converted stores along with more than 3,000 private-label Weis products and about 300 new produce items — for example, greater varieties of tomatoes. Meanwhile, it will keep some of Mars most popular items, such as its deli shrimp salad, and is rolling out the former chain's popular sugar cookies in all Weis stores. Already it has opened full-service pharmacies in three former Mars, one in Essex and two in Dundalk. Weis also is adding sushi, which will be prepared by chefs in the stores. "It doesn't take up a lot of space, but it's what consumers want," Schertle said. Shoppers are noticing the changes. At the Essex Weis, a former Mars, the store layout and signage looks the same as under the previous owner, and most workers and managers are former Mars employees. But in-store pharmacists now fill prescriptions, the floral department has been expanded and hundreds of Weis-brand products line the shelves. Alice Mays, 60, a retired screen printer from Essex, had shopped at Mars for nearly two decades. But "Mars was always higher-priced," and she shopped the sales, she said Wednesday during one of her three weekly stops at the Essex Weis. "Mars didn't have your off-brands." Schertle said the company is striving to hold on to loyal Mars shoppers while attracting new customers who may never have shopped Mars or Food Lion. Shopper Kenya Sykes, a 37-year-old mother of two from Essex, said she goes to different supermarkets for different items and shopped at Mars only occasionally. She also saw it as "pricey." "There are so many grocery stores around here," said Skyes, a teacher at a before- and after-school facility who said she has started coming to the Essex Weis because of the private-label brands and offerings such as the sushi bar. "I like Weis," she said. "I was happy they switched." A habit built over 34 years keeps Marlin Van Ells returning to the former Mars that now bears the Weis name. For years, he said, he shopped only at Mars, first on Philadelphia Road, then in Essex, because of "prices, quality and I loved their meats." Now, the retired tractor-trailer driver splits his grocery shopping among several area stores. But he still comes to the newly converted Essex Weis almost every day. "I made a lot of friends with Mars employees," Van Ells said. "I come to see them." lorraine.mirabella@baltsun.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Job Layoffs Unemployment and Layoffs Federal Trade Commission Weis Markets will buy five Mars Super Markets stores Baltimore Police officer found guilty in shooting to be sentenced Friday Preliminary licenses to dispense medical marijuana in Maryland will be announced in December Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 55°

Smith turned to a legal insurance plan that he had taken out for situations just like this. With the help of an attorney, a settlement was negotiated with the district attorney’s office to get the misdemeanor dismissed upon the 16-year-olds’ completion of community service hours. And thanks to the legal plan with Arag, Smith figures he saved more than $2,000 in attorney fees, a lot of time savings, and a reduction in stress. The coverage “saved us from having to pay a lot of money,” said Smith, a police officer in Austin, Texas, “and it saved my son’s reputation. He wants to go to college, and having any kind of a record would have made it difficult.” Companies like Arag, U.S. Legal Services and others have designed legal insurance plans that are offered as part of employer-sponsored benefit plans or sold directly to consumers. Andinsurers are seeing a growing number of parents purchasing the coverage. Parents can purchase the protection for a range of legal matters ranging from traffic violations and apartment leases to more serious problems such as theft and personal injury claims. The cost? Premiums are typically less than $20 a month, plus a deductible of $250 or so. For some parents, legal insurance can provide peace of mind in the event their teenager or college-age child gets into trouble. And let’s face it, even the best kids sometimes do stupid things. Here’s how Arag’s standard policy works: When a policyholder has a legal problem, he or she contacts the company and explains the problem. Once the legal issue is identified, the insurer provides the policyholder with a list of qualified attorneys who practice nearby. The policyholder then picks the attorney and makes the contact. Arag, for example, has a network of about 11,000 attorneys with different specialities. The company generally aims to provide attorneys who practice within a 30-mile radius of the policyholder. Smith is a believer in the protection. The father of six pays about $14 a month, or $168 a year, for his legal plan, which is offered through the police department. While having the policy lessened the impact of the candy theft on Smith’s son, the outcome was far different for his best friend who wasn’t covered through legal insurance. The teen was fined, had to perform twice as much community service work, and still had the misdemeanor on his record that eventually might require the help of an attorney to have it removed when he becomes an adult. Laura Budd, an attorney near Charlotte, N.C., who has been in the Arag network since 2004, has handled multiple cases involving kids who got into trouble. Having immediate access to an attorney, Budd said, “keeps kids out of the (legal) system.” Still, is legal insurance the answer? Certainly the benefits may not be worth the price for some. Do the math, and factor in the deductible. Moreover when reviewing these policies, pay attention to what is covered and what is not. Some policies will broaden the coverage, but at a higher price. And some serious legal problems won’t be covered at all. Like other types of insurance, you’re also paying for some peace of mind just in case your son or daughter gets into a jam. Backing this legal protection up with stern advice to your kids is also key. There needs to be a discussion about responsible behavior, owning a mistake, and the consequences for getting into trouble. No legal insurance plan will cover all those bases for you.

Large-scale grocery retailer Save-on-Foods has been named as the anchor tenant of a planned redevelopment of the former Wal-Mart super centre on Strachan Road. Brentwoods Developments out of Edmonton was issued a development permit this summer for ancillary buildings.--NEWS PHOTO COLLIN GALLANT 00000 cgallant@medicinehatnews.com @CollinGallant A fifth major grocery retailer is preparing to set up shop in Medicine Hat with news that Save-on-Foods will become the main anchor of a redeveloped shopping centre in the south end. The near 13-acre site on Stachan Road has sat empty since 2008 when Wal-Mart built its new super centre further east. That company held the property until Edmonton-based commercial developer Brentwood Developments bought the site, rebranded it as “Strachan Corner” and began marketing a renovated building to potential tenants. Officials with both companies did not return phone calls Thursday seeking comment. Senior Brentwood officials had previously stated they would like to see some work begin before the new year. Save-on-Foods is operated by the Overwaitea Food Group, a division of the Jim Pattison Business Group, which also owns CHAT television and radio in Medicine Hat. The grocery chain, which operates 33 stores in Alberta, was originally centred in British Columbia. Last year, the privately-held company announced plans to open six locations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba by the end of 2017. In Medicine Hat, they join major grocers Safeway-Sobeys-IGA (with four local stores in total), South Country Co-op (two grocery locations), Superstore, Wal-Mart and Costco on the food retail scene. The new Medicine Hat location would total 41,000-square-feet in the planned 100,000-square-foot project, occupying a central bay in the existing building footprint. This summer the city planning department issued a development permit for the site that appeared to only include work on new ancillary buildings in the massive parking lot. At that time, Brentwood officials said the existing structure would be part of a second phase of construction. Updated marketing material from Brentwood also shows that another bay in the main building is set to become a Liqour Depot. Two new pad developments on the southern edge of the site would house lone tenants Tim Hortons and a 7-11 convenience store and gas bar. Two other multi-bay buildings would be built on the east side of the lot, bordering Dunmore Road. Plans include the possibility of two standalone single-tenant buildings filling in gaps. In the main building, one large 21,000 square-foot bay would remain up for lease at the north end. Plans show three smaller bays, totalling 17,000-square-feet, could be created with expansion to the south end of the building. You have 7 free stories left to read this month.

I do have to ask if many of these companies have forgotten with the northern part of the city? There is a void there since the closer of Safeway. It would be nice if the city could promote North Crescent Heights with the same energy they put in the “white elephant” on first street. Les Log in to Reply JimO says: September 23, 2016 at 7:31 PM So I guess we need 6 big grocery stores within a short distance of each other, PLUS 5 TimHortens and a similar number of liquor stores? really?

Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Peggy McGlone September 22 Follow PeggyMcGlone Visitors to the National Museum of African American History and Culture will pass the Robert Frederick Smith Orientation Pavilion on their way to the Walmart Welcome Center. If they go down the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Staircase, they can nosh at the “Sweet Home Café generously supported by Kaiser Permanente,” catch a performance in the Oprah Winfrey Theater or enter the David M. Rubenstein History Galleries. If they decide to go up — using the United Technologies Corp. escalator — they will find the Earl W. and Amanda Stafford Center for African American Media Arts and galleries named for Michael Jordan and Family, Time Warner, and the Rhimes Family Foundation. Welcome to the 21st-century Smithsonian, where the founding donor, James Smithson, gets trumped by corporate giants and captains of industry. The Englishman whose bequest launched the museum complex 170 years ago has his name on a small sidewalk sign outside. But today’s philanthropists, including Gates, Rubenstein and Smith, and 20th-century titans, like Rockefeller and Ford, have their names in brass letters on walls throughout the building. When the museum opens Saturday, 27 spaces — from the grand staircase to the VIP reception suite — and six programs will be named for brands such as Nike, 3M, American Express, GE and Target and less well-known organizations including the Kovler and Stavros Niarchos foundations. In addition, the lobby features a list of all the founding donors. A peek at the Mall’s latest addition View Graphic A peek at the Mall’s latest addition The large number of names reflects the Smithsonian’s need to raise more private funds, said Amir Pasic, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. The new museum cost $540 million, with Congress footing half the bill. “Some of the museums that were built more than 30 or 40 years ago would have gotten more government funding,” Pasic said. “Naming benches, chairs, pieces of lab equipment is increasingly common.” The fact that so many individuals and companies signed on points to the perceived value of the project, he added. “People love the notion that you would have your name associated with the National Mall, connecting yourself to something so lasting and . . . historic.” Partnering with the museum was an easy decision for Prudential, which is sponsoring the Hometown Hub, an interactive element in the “Power of Place” exhibition. The museum approached the insurance company after it gave $1 million in 2009 to fund the construction. This year, Prudential gave $2 million more for a five-year sponsorship of the multimedia hub, which highlights the importance of place and region to African American culture. “What the museum is trying to accomplish is in direct alignment with our values and beliefs,” said Prudential Foundation President Lata Reddy, noting that the company has been an anchor in Newark for 140 years. “We have seen firsthand the power of place, and what opportunities a place can afford people, or not. During challenging times, we’ve been a part of rebuilding, standing shoulder to shoulder with the African American community. We know we have a role to play in society.” Naming opportunities are definitely on the rise at the Smithsonian. When the Renwick Gallery reopened last year after an extensive renovation, it named nine galleries for private donors. At the Cooper Hewitt, the Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, 15 donors are acknowledged in spaces throughout its Carnegie Mansion, which reopened in 2014 after a three-year renovation. In addition to galleries, the staircase, shop, study room, cafe, education center and garden and terrace are linked to Target, Henry Luce, Nancy and Edwin Marks and Peter Krueger. The National Museum of the American Indian had been the newest Smithsonian museum, opening in 2004. The federal government paid two-thirds of its construction costs, and 82 founding donors were listed inside. Donors are also linked to the outdoor fire pit, entry pavilion, theater, reference library, gift shop and “pause areas.” Inside the theater (named for the Christian A. Johnson Endeavor Foundation) there are 135 seats with donor labels. 1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The African American experience, in photos View Photos The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture showcases the arc of the black experience.

Although these deals help the museum raise much-needed funds, the agreements also benefit the companies. Bank of America, which is stalwart supporter of museums, signed on early by giving $2 million and sponsoring the Save Our Treasures program before the museum broke ground. It was one of four corporations to give $2 million to sponsor this weekend’s opening ceremonies. Rena DeSisto, the bank’s global arts and culture executive, said the corporation understands the educational power of all museums and appreciates this museum’s diversity. “I am hopeful it creates a sense of tolerance for diversity, and embracing of diversity instead of fear of it,” DeSisto said. “Museums are places where people are drawn to think, to learn and to reflect. I think they can enhance your world view, open up your mind and your life to different possibilities.” Pasic said associating yourself with a diverse project such as the African American Museum can be a powerful symbol. “People find value if they see themselves — if it’s an ad or a campaign — they feel the institution recognizes them.” entertainment museums Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

(Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate)Buy Photo Story Highlights BuckinBurger will open in mid-October at 1283 Log Pond Drive, in Log Pond Plaza, next to Wal-Mart. Co-owner Adam Mitchell is president of Creno’s Pizza, which operates 18 restaurants in Ohio. 775 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEWARK - BuckinBurger, which operated a food truck in Zanesville during the summer of 2015, has found a year-round home in north Newark, where it opens next month. Billed as a trendy, fast casual burger joint, BuckinBurger will be located at 1283 Log Pond Drive, in Log Pond Plaza, next to Wal-Mart. "We spent six months trying to find a location," co-owner Dan Woodward said. "It's really hard to find available real estate. It's been a nice, long journey. "It'll be nice anchored between Wal-Mart and the new Kroger. And, we're near 21st Street, but not paying the 21st Street price as a small business start-up." Owners Woodward and Andy Wills, both from Zanesville, liked Five Guys burgers and fries restaurant and wanted to try something similar. "So we opened up a food truck to see if it was a good idea or not," Woodward said. On their website, buckinburger.com, they state: "The truck was quite the success, and in the summer of 2016 we found a brick and mortar home to serve up the same fresh, old-fashioned, genuine goodness we’ve become famous for." The ownership group consists of four guys: Woodward, Wills, Eric Mitchell and his father, Adam Mitchell, both of Nashport. Woodward and Wills are Sheridan High School graduates, Eric Mitchell is a product of Licking Valley, and Adam Mitchell graduated from Tri-Valley. Adam Mitchell is president of Creno’s Pizza Co., which has 18 restaurants in Ohio, including seven in Licking County. He established his first Creno's Pizza franchise in 2002 in East Zanesville. When customers leave his restaurant, Woodward said, "I hope they just feel it was the best burgers and fries they can get around the area, made fresh, made to order, grilled up right in front of them, using local ingredients as much as we can." In addition to burgers, fries and hot dogs, the restaurant also will offer a doughnut burger, which Woodward said was popular in Zanesville. The 2,251-square-foot space, previously home to Bake-N-Brew, has been renovated extensively, Woodward said, with an open ceiling to reveal the metal and duct work, a concrete floor, and Amish-made wood tables. The restaurant will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. For more information about employment opportunities, Woodward can be reached at 614-600-9446. kmallett@newarkadvocate.com 740-328-8545 Twitter: @kmallett1958 Buy Photo Ryan Hoyt of Newark Drywall works in the new BuckinBurger location Thursday on Log Pond Drive in Newark.  (Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate) 775 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2dnlQg5 TOP VIDEOS Schroeder records hat trick in Newark Generals rout 1:13 Heath girls tune up vs. East Knox 0:38 Army Pfc.

Between now and then, there are more than 50 new PS4 games up for release. While it is not possible to predict which titles stores will offer Black Friday deals on, it is safe to assume that there will be some PlayStation 4 sales competing for the holiday dollar. New releases are less likely to see discounted prices. However, Indy titles and recently published games with lackluster initial sales may be offered up for Black Friday and Christmas shoppers. For this reason, it makes sense to look at upcoming PS4 games if for nothing else than to have them on the holiday shopping radar. Historically, stores like Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, Target, and even the PlayStation Store have offered Black Friday deals, and this year should be no different. With the release of the PlayStation 4 (slim) and PlayStation Pro, clearance sales on the older PS4 models are almost inevitable. Even popular PS4 games like Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End are likely to go on sale. Bargain hunters who may have missed some slightly older hit titles will have a field day finding them at sale prices. PS4 & PS4 Pro Black Friday 2016 Price Predictions #Playstation4 #PS4 #Sony #videogames #playstation #gamer #games #… pic.twitter.com/vevpmN5nyF — Scarlet Nossna (@scarletps4games) September 12, 2016 Those looking for something new are also going to be searching for possible holiday deals. Even if stores do not discount any of the new releases, it is still a good idea to have some new titles on your list for the gamer in your family, even if it is you. The next couple of months will have something in every genre to fit any mood or taste. While it is impossible to write about them all, each category has a few that are worth mentioning. A full list can be found at the end of the article. Sports The sports genre of video game has a fan base of loyal followers who expect a new game every year. As such, 2016 will see several PS4 games in this category released in the weeks leading up to Black Friday. One popular series in this genre is FIFA soccer. Electronic Arts, producers of the franchise, changed things a bit with this year’s version of the game. According to Goal, FIFA 17 will see the addition of a new story mode called “The Journey.” Players will control a character named Alex Hunter as they guide him to stardom. FIFA 17 out now on EA/Origin Access, four days before launch. https://t.co/fh963ZAQUR pic.twitter.com/NviFqXo9ZD — GameSpot (@gamespot) September 22, 2016 “This a campaign [sic] with a set plot just like EA’s Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles,” states Goal. IGN gave FIFA 17 an 8.4 rating and said, “An absorbing story mode compensates for an occasional lack of match sharpness.” FIFA 17 is due out on September 27. Another exciting PS4 sports game coming out is 100ft Robot Golf. The game is what the title says: golf played with gigantic robots. The courses are set in destructible environments like cities, and as you could imagine, the destruction will be one of the best parts of the game. Did that last shot put your ball right behind a skyscraper? No problem. Crush it. Next up on our #PSVR chop block is #100ftrobotgolf https://t.co/AEDKrInZ6g 43 days left! @100ftrobotgolf pic.twitter.com/QmvaBXAI4S — Frameloss (@Frame_loss) August 31, 2016 IGN states, “Just swing your golf club to smash even the tallest buildings out of the way — or into the way of your robot golfing buddies.” This quirky and fun sports twist is already available for pre-order on the PlayStation Store and will be released October 10. The day after Robot Golf comes out, WWE 2K17 for PlayStation 4 will hit store shelves. This franchise has a long history, and this version is looking to be the best yet. IGN describes the franchise as “the reigning and defending flagship WWE video game franchise champion” and claims the newest version will have “stunning graphics, ultra-authentic gameplay and a massive roster of WWE and NXT’s popular Superstars and Legends.” 'WWE 2K17' News, Roster: #bible #biblestudy #scripture #Christianity #Jesus #ChristianNews https://t.co/g6hHsvxejt pic.twitter.com/ilLDoCHE9o — BibleBreakthroughs (@BibleBrkthrus) September 13, 2016 WWE 2K17 comes out on October 11. Racing An offshoot of the sports genre of video game is racing. From pursuit games like the Need For Speed franchise to simulations such as Gran Turismo, racing is a favorite category for many gamers. PlayStation 4 will see its share of racing games before Black Friday 2016, one being Driveclub VR. Although Driveclub is a new property in the racing genre, it was well received when it came out in October 2014. Now, two years later, Evolution Studios is releasing the latest in the series titled, Driveclub VR. As the name suggests, the game is going to be tailored for the PlayStation VR peripheral. In fact, it is just Driveclub ported to the VR format. Even though Driveclub VR is a quasi-new title, iDigitalTimes reports that it will be selling for only $40 on release. That is $20 cheaper than most new games. Also, those who already own the Driveclub Season Pass will get an additional discount on the title. So maybe it can be called a Black Friday deal even without an official “sale.” Driveclub VR confirmed as PSVR launch title; Season Pass owners get discount on $39.99 price tag: https://t.co/clYLX2Abar pic.twitter.com/Hne2oO7ISo — Scott Craft (@iDTScottC) September 22, 2016 Both Driveclub VR and the PlayStation VR headset will be available on October 13. Another racing title coming in October is WRC 6 FIA World Rally Championship. The WRC series originated on the PS2 back in 2001 and has spawned a dozen games since then. WRC 6 will be lucky 13 for the franchise. BigTen Interactive’s newest rally racer will be more of the same as previous titles in the franchise. However, developers have listened to feedback from players and have made a few changes, according to IGN. “WRC 6 FIA World Rally Championship will include narrower roads, longer special stages, and even a brand new challenging experience with head-to-head Super Special Stages. WRC 6 also features increases graphics and audio perception for players.” These changes are “massive” for the game, which is due out sometime in October. Roleplaying Role-playing games (RPG) are practically a staple in any gamer’s library. The Final Fantasy series went far in making this true. The franchise has seen more sequels and spinoffs that any other RPG that comes to mind (97 to be exact). Just in time for Black Friday 2016, we will be seeing not one, but two Final Fantasy titles hitting the shelf. Final Fantasy XV details Shiva, Lunafreya in Weekly Jump: https://t.co/ySe1HeNzY6 pic.twitter.com/oiKNCboyEj — Nova Crystallis (@Nova_Crystallis) September 22, 2016 According to a website called The Final Fantasy, World of Final Fantasy will be released October 25 for the PS4 and the Vita. The game is typical FF fair but is said to be geared more toward a younger audience. The game’s story revolves around a pair of siblings and incorporates many familiar creatures and characters from previous Final Fantasy titles. For the more mature gamer, Square is also releasing its next proper Final Fantasy sequel a few days after Black Friday. Final Fantasy XV will be coming to PS4 and Xbox One on November 29. Like all FF games, Final Fantasy XV is not a sequel in the literal sense of the word. It will feature all new characters and an entirely unconnected storyline, but will still have some of the standard creatures, like the Chocobo, and gameplay features that make FF games familiar. Star Trek Online is an RPG based on the popular television show Star Trek and it is already available to play for free. It has all the elements that one would expect from a Star Trek game as well as a few familiar faces. It plays much like Elder Scrolls Online or Neverwinter with players picking a class (engineer, science, or tactical officers) and progressing through the ranks. We’re excited to announce our line of Heavy Escort Carriers are warping to console shortly! https://t.co/SmmBZWf0oX pic.twitter.com/aINBr0kCIS — Star Trek Online (@trekonlinegame) September 19, 2016 Even though it is available now and is free to play, it is worth mentioning in a holiday shopping article because in-game currency can be purchased, which could make a perfect gift for players who like the game. Sometimes the stores within free-to-play games hold specials during holidays and other special events. It would not be surprising if the Star Trek Online store has some specials on in-game purchases for Black Friday. Fighting Fighting games are sparse this holiday season, especially ones with confirmed release dates. BlazBlue: Central Fiction, Brawlhalla, and Mother Russia Bleeds are all scheduled for a 2016 release, but the dates on those are still “to be announced.” One PS4 fighter that has been confirmed is Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Beta Begins October 8, Only on #PS4 https://t.co/gEZfLo51y9 #Xenoverse2 @BandaiNamcoUS pic.twitter.com/eizA6GGUkq — PlayStationLifeStyle (@PSLifeStyle) September 16, 2016 The first Dragon Ball Xenoverse was released last year to mixed reviews. The sequel may see a price reduction because of that and because it is coming out on Black Friday, but we will have to wait and see. If you do not want to wait for November 25 to play DBX2, the beta release starts on October 8. More fighting games are due to come out in 2017 including the hotly anticipated titles Tekken 7 and Injustice 2. So fighting fans might have to wait until after Christmas to get their fix. Shooter Shooters are one of the most popular types of video games, and several PS4 games in this genre will be available for Black Friday shopping. Titanfall 2 is one of the more anxiously awaited shooters coming out soon. Electronic Arts is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of Titanfall with its upcoming sequel. TF2 will feature similar gameplay and at least one new titan called the Scorch Titan. As the name implies, players will be able to fry their opponents with fire. Titanfall 2: 6 Minutes of 'Scorch' Titan #gameplay. #gamer #gamergirl https://t.co/xOCMIYIemJ pic.twitter.com/A0IgLplvXy — rebecca Bailey (@BabyRebbecca) September 18, 2016 Titanfall 2 is set for release on October 28. The Call of Duty franchise is also seeing a new iteration, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The game looks to continue in the CoD tradition, only this time Activision is taking it to space. Along with the new setting comes new gameplay mechanics including zero-gravity combat. As a bonus, purchasing the CoD: Infinite Warfare Legacy or Digital Deluxe Edition will score a remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The PlayStation Store has the Legacy Edition listed at $79.99, and the Deluxe Edition at $99.99. Pre-orders for both are being accepted, and the game hits brick-and-mortar stores on November 4 in case you want to put it under the Christmas tree. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and LEGO Dimensions on this week's episode of PS Blogcast: https://t.co/ERKIYtKfov pic.twitter.com/KrA4GSAo9M — PlayStation (@PlayStation) September 22, 2016 Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour, Hitman: Episode 5, and Battlefield 1 are also all due out before Black Friday. Adventure Adventure games are a little slower paced than a lot of other genres but are still just as fun. These types of games usually require more puzzle solving, but can still have action elements involved. They rely heavily on storytelling and are often just as enjoyable to the spectator as to the player. Debatably the hottest property coming out before Christmas in the adventure category is The Last Guardian. The game follows in the footsteps of Shadow of the Colossus and Ico. The preview shown at E3 was gorgeous, and the gameplay elements seem unique while remaining reminiscent of its spiritual predecessors. PS4 Exclusive The Last Guardian Looks Gorgeous in 16 Minutes of Gameplay Footage https://t.co/oANOEwxfmc pic.twitter.com/4Q8TDsNC9b — DualShockers (@DualShockers) September 15, 2016 The game follows the adventure of a young boy and his giant creature/pet. The two of them overcome obstacles like collapsing bridges and precarious ledges by working together to find a way to proceed. The Last Guardian relies on visual storytelling because the main character speaks some strange foreign tongue, but that should not detract from the enjoyment. In fact, both Shadow and Ico had the same language element, and it only added to those games’ charm. The Last Guardian is slated for a December 6 release, so it definitely will not make any Black Friday specials, but it will still be in time for Christmas morning. Although an exact release date has not been pinned down, Telltale Games has the next edition of its Walking Dead franchise coming out in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company’s episodic adventures have done quite well, and the upcoming The Waking Dead: A New Frontier series will probably see similar results. Typically, Telltale adventures are released in “seasons” a few weeks apart. Seasons are ordinarily inexpensive individually, but it is often a better deal to get the Season Pass. Expect The Walking Dead – A New Frontier … https://t.co/yT6DxboqyJ #360 #Gaming #Handheld #News #One #PC pic.twitter.com/SOfQC6T7Qs — Gamespresso (@gamespresso) September 6, 2016 Whether shopping for yourself or a friend or family member, this holiday season seems to be shaping up quite well for PS4 games. While it is too early to know what will be on offer during Black Friday, it is nice to have a list at the ready. Even if none of the new titles go on sale at a discount, there are sure to be other Christmas specials and Black Friday deals that will save you enough money to warrant splurging on some of the upcoming PlayStation 4 games. Check out IGN‘s full list of upcoming games here.

According to Mississippi County Sheriff Keith Moore, Joseph Phillip Latamondeer, 40, of East Prairie, was taken into custody on Thursday afternoon, September 22. Sheriff Moore said Latamondeer was at his dad's home in Mississippi County when he was arrested around 4:30 p.m. The sheriff's department had to make entry and found Latamondeer hiding inside the home. He was taken to the Mississippi County Jail. Sheriff Moore said Sikeston police assisted in the arrest. On Friday, at 1:52 a.m., officers were sent to Missouri Delta Medical Center in Sikeston, Mo. to assist another agency in reference to a domestic assault. Further investigation revealed that the domestic assault began at Walmart in Sikeston. The victim said she was assaulted by her boyfriend of one month, who was identified as Joseph Phillip Latamondeer. On Wednesday, September 14, the victim said it started at Walmart in Sikeston when Latamondeer punched her in the face in the parking lot before going inside for a few items.  Afterwards, they then drove to Hardee's to get some food. While in the drive-thru she said she tried to run away because she was afraid. The victim said she went up to Hardee's and attempted to go inside but the doors were locked. There were two other vehicles in the drive-thru, so she went to the first vehicle and they told her to leave. The second vehicle allowed her to talk and climb in the back seat. As she climbed inside, Latamondeer allegedly drug her out of the vehicle by her hair and arms and threw her into his vehicle. The victim said they then drove out of Sikeston city limits and to County Road 820 in New Madrid County where his truck broke down from overheating. She said she then tried to run again but he caught her. She stated he started kicking her several times in the sides and then threw her back into the truck and drove to Mississippi County to a place called 'Rock Bottoms.' The victim said they then got on an ATV, where Latamondeer started attacking her again. After the assault, he then drove her home. The victim said that this was not the first time he assaulted her, but she could not recall exact dates or times. The officer delivering the probable cause statement said the following about the injuries: "It is clear based on his actions in the past and this new charge that he is going to continue to commit violent acts towards women without any disregard for what he is doing or the amount of pain he inflicts. Based on my 25+ year working in law enforcement this was by far the most bruising I have ever seen on a victim as a result of being assaulted." The probable cause statements indicated the victim had burns on her back and chest that looked to be from a cigarette, according to medical personnel at Missouri Delta Medical Center. The report states she also had bruising on her face, chin and neck, on her left arm, covering the entire arm above the elbow, bruising all over her back, on her buttocks, bruising on her upper left leg and knee covering almost the entire thigh, three large bruises on her right upper thigh and knee, multiple bruises on her chest and stomach area. The victim also had approximately 16 bite marks on her back, chest, arms and legs. She had 8 broken ribs, broken in multiple places. She was in kidney failure as a result of the assault, requiring dialysis, and also has a bruised heart sustained from the domestic assault, according to investigators. The victim's mother says her daughter's friend called her because she could not get inside the victim's home in East Prairie, but could hear her crying. Her mother then went inside to find her daughter crying on the edge of her bed, saying that her whole body hurt. Her mother said she could see the bruising on her face, neck, and arms. The victim recounted the events of the night, saying she was afraid to go to the hospital. The victim's father said he received a phone call from the victim's mother saying their daughter had been hurt. He arrived at the home and learned that Latamondeer had allegedly beaten her, apparently because she told him she planned on leaving the state. Latamondeer has several prior felony convictions. He now faces charges of domestic assault, first degree - serious physical injury, kidnapping, and armed criminal action. Download the KFVS News app: iPhone | Android Copyright 2016 KFVS.

By J. NOEL ESPINOZA The Brownsville Herald Rosa Zapata hopes a new amnesty would give her family the legal status to work and earn a decent living in the United States. Zapata, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition her real name would not be used, is a native of San Luis Potosi, Mexico who now lives in Cameron Park. She qualified to apply for permanent residency when Congress in 1986 granted legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants who had lived in the United States since 1982. Zapata, who came to the country illegally with her husband and three children, couldnt seek legal status then because she didnt have her birth certificate, a requirement for the application process. Zapatas dreams to become a legal resident could come true if the United States grants legal status to undocumented Mexican immigrants currently living in this country. President Bush reportedly is considering such a move. Its great because its difficult to make decent wages as an undocumented immigrant, Zapata said. I couldnt apply before, but now I already have all the papers I need. We need stability in our family. Supporters of a broad-based amnesty said its too early to tell whether Bush is sincere or its just a political ploy to entice Hispanic support. Jose Partierra, a Washington lawyer who specializes in immigration issues, questions the presidents intentions. Its wonderful, but we need to find out the details before we celebrate, Partierra said. There is a lot of Republican opposition to changes to grant a general amnesty. Partierra, however, said this is an opportunity for Bush to show that he, and not more conservative leaders, drives immigration issues in his Republican Party. It would be an embarrassment for the president if immigration proposals he supports were defeated in Congress by his own Republican Party, Partierra said. At the same, Bush talks a nice talk, but I want to see details. If an amnesty is granted, Partierra said it should be broad-based to benefit people from every country, not just Mexico. Nathan Selzer, a spokesman for Proyecto Libertad, agreed. It divides immigrants when they talk just about one group, Selzer said. There should be a general, unconditional, legalization program for all immigrants, not just simply by nationality. Selzer said there is a need to create a mechanism for people to move across the border, not just a bracero program that treats people as machines. But some people feel its bad policy to give undocumented immigrants amnesty. Paul Egan, an official for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said amnesty promotes more illegal immigration. Its not a good policy because it promotes disrespect for the law, Egan said. The last thing we want (to show) newcomers to this country (is) that respect for the law isnt important. But its very important. Its the bedrock of our system of government. Egan said the 1986 amnesty promoted more illegal immigration. He said back then leaders expected fewer than 1 million people to apply, but more than 3 million did. Now estimates range around 3 million, but actually numbers probably are 5 million to 6 million, he said. Roger Brunner, a resident of Villa del Sol in downtown Brownsville, also feels that amnesty for undocumented immigrants is wrong. The American people have enough problems to deal with this, Brunner said. We need to start taking care of the people living here before helping other people. Brunner said he doesnt have any problems with people coming to this country legally. Some observers believe the White House began to ponder the issue of granting Mexican undocumented immigrants amnesty after Bush met with Mexican President Vicente Fox earlier this year in Mexico. Fox, in a visit to Chicago this weekend, again called for a sweeping amnesty program for undocumented Mexicans living in the United States. A White House spokesman confirmed President Bush is considering granting legal status to Mexican nationals living illegally in the United States. Mexicos National Population Council reports the move could benefit up to 3 million Mexican nationals. Bush wants to send a welcoming signal, that people from Mexico, other nations, should feel welcome in the United States, presidential press secretary Ari Fleischer said. Its part of creating an orderly process to what has been a very disorderly process along the border. Art Moreno, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in Harlingen, said there is no way to know how many undocumented immigrants are in the Valley who could benefit from the amnesty. Selzer agreed. We cant begin to speculate, Moreno said. We can definitely say there are hundreds, but thats a question for the State Department to respond. Moreno said about 3.5 million people benefited throughout the United States during the 1986 amnesty. Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Tuesday, July 17, 2001 12:00 am.

But when Howard isn’t concentrating on school, she said she enjoys spending time at her favorite local businesses. “I’m always at Applebee’s – always, all the time,” Howard said. “I do most of my shopping at Wal-Mart because it’s very close. I love the bowling alley because there isn’t one in Warrensburg other than the one on campus, so that’s fun to go to whenever I have spare time…and Tony’s. I always get the pecan pie there, and it’s my favorite thing ever.” Ama Adams, a sophomore studying social work, said she loves to go to Warrensburg’s fast food restaurants. “I love Orange Leaf, and then Steak ‘n Shake of course,” Adams said. “Chick-fil-A or Taco Bell would be next.” From grocery stores to beauty salons, Warrensburg has a wide variety of small businesses and chain stores for students to choose from. With restaurants, gyms and social hot spots within minutes of UCM’s main campus, Howard said she prefers to shop locally instead of driving to larger cities. “Mostly for me it’s gas prices,” Howard said. “I live in Warrensburg, so shopping anywhere in Warrensburg is a lot cheaper than driving down to Kansas City, Lee’s Summit (or) Blue Springs. I would say the farthest that I drive anywhere in Warrensburg is six minutes with traffic, so I just take the back roads and I can get there really fast.” Warrensburg has approximately 19,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The University of Central Missouri has more than 14,000 enrolled students, according to the university’s website. With thousands of students living within the city limits and commuting from surrounding areas, UCM has an impact on the types of businesses that come to Warrensburg and the choices that business owners make in their day-to-day operations. Mark Montgomery, owner of The Zone Tattoo and Body Piercing, said UCM students have a huge impact on his small business. “Every semester I’ve got a new set of kids, so (the student population) definitely affects how our business is run,” Montgomery said. In addition to shopping at local businesses, some UCM students also work for employers in the Johnson County area. As they earn a steady paycheck and gain work experience, those students contribute to the success and prosperity of the businesses they work for. Suzanne Taylor, executive director of the Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce, said college students bring value to the chamber’s member businesses. “The impact is most certainly the accessibility of the student body and the workforce to our local employers, and the opportunity for mentorships and internship programs,” Taylor said. The city of Warrensburg, Warrensburg Main Street and the Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce are invested in the success of local businesses, and they actively support the Love What’s Local campaign on the chamber website and Facebook page. Taylor said students should continue shopping in the city that they call home. “We have a selection of retail businesses as well as small privately owned businesses,” Taylor said. “We’d rather they shop local because we ‘love what’s local.’” Jay Meldrem, general manager for Heroes Restaurant and Pub, said he is also aware of the impact college students have on his business. “When the students come back in town there are more opportunities to make money, but also the staffing and the professors, all of that seems to double the population in a very short period of time,” Meldrem said. “There’s a lot more opportunities that open up when students are in town.” As UCM students spend money and give their time to local businesses, they invest in the economic development of the entire county. Tracy Brantner, executive director of the Johnson County Economic Development Corporation, said she has seen the impact that UCM students have on the local economy. Brantner said when students shop locally, the money they pay in sales tax goes to services that make Johnson County safer and more secure. Warrensburg’s sales tax revenue spikes when students return to school. In 2015, the Missouri Department of Revenue reported an increase of 4.47 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter of the city’s fiscal year. Brantner said as millions of dollars flow into the local economy, student purchases help fund public services. “When we’re all helping to pay for roads, public safety, police department, fire, ambulance…that raises all boats and we’re able to provide better services in a way that impacts us all,” Brantner said. Brantner said when UCM students work for local businesses, they also contribute to the economic stability of the region as a whole. “I think it’s a win-win for both the businesses and the students that are attending UCM because the businesses are looking for quality employees,” Brantner said. “The talent that the students have, coupled with the businesses that are looking for talented employees…I think that strikes a win-win in the community because we do have a lot of businesses that are looking for help, and I think that there are lots of job opportunities out there in a variety of businesses for students.” Warrensburg had 618 registered businesses within city limits by August 2016, according to the Johnson County Economic Development Corporation. With a diverse population of consumers and potential employees, Taylor said small businesses and retail chains will keep coming to Warrensburg. “We have a great quality of life and we have a strong workforce,” Taylor said. “I most certainly think it makes a difference.” Posted by digitalBURG on September 22, 2016.

Published Sep 22nd, 2016 3:30 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas The price-tag Wal-Mart Stores may pay for alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act just went higher than the $858 million the retailer will have spent by the end of fiscal 2017 defending itself during the past five years. U.S. District Judge Kathy Hickey from the Western District of Arkansas recently granted class-action status for investor plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System that claimed the retail giant violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by not properly disclosing the investigation in required federal filings in a timely fashion. This ruling gives the case the ability to continue. Wal-Mart had previously argued for dismissal of the pension fund’s claims citing there was no related financial loss for the investor. “This was a procedural ruling that has nothing to do with the merits of the case. We continue to believe the claims here are not appropriate for class certification. We’re considering our options, including seeking an appeal,” according to a statement provided by Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove. Hickey disagreed citing in the order: ”Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification.” She said the investors did demonstrate loss using an alternative accounting method which is acceptable to the court. Hickey certified the class period from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012, which is the period of time between when Wal-Mart self-reported the alleged violations and the day before the news was made public by The New York Times. FCPA expert Mike Koehler, who spent 10 years as a FCPA lawyer and now teaches law at Southern Illinois University, said Wal-Mart first disclosed its FCPA scrutiny in December 2011, which was long before the April 2012 New York Times article. “Publicly-traded companies, generally speaking, have an obligation to disclose ‘material’ information. Whether Wal-Mart should have disclosed the potential FCPA issues prior to when it did, thus depends on whether the information was ‘material.’ This issue, among others, will be the focus as the cases proceeds,” Koehler told Talk Business & Politics. While many companies might fold up under an $858 million expense since fiscal 2013, Wal-Mart’s balance sheet remains strong with net free cash flow of $10.312 billion reported as of Aug. 18, 2016. Net profits for the consolidated company totaled more than $6.852 billion through the first half of this year. And while any settlement Wal-Mart might have in this lengthly FCPA probe is going to be stout, experts don’t think it will make a big dent in Wal-Mart’s growing profits. With regard to the recent class-action status ruling by Judge Hickey, Koehler said civil litigation in the aftermath of FCPA scrutiny or enforcement is a common occurrence. Koehler said claims like those made recently by the Michigan Pension Fund may only rarely get past the motion to dismiss stage. He cited another legal action against Wal-Mart and individuals officers made by other investors which was recently dismissed by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. He agreed that the ruling this week out of Arkansas was merely a procedural ruling by the court and it doesn’t go to the substance or underlying merit of the plaintiffs’ allegations. Last year, Wal-Mart said the majority of its $126 million FCPA expenses ($121 million) went toward legal expenses for the ongoing investigations and the remaining $5 million was spent on internal compliance protocol. In the year prior, Wal-Mart also spent $121 million of the $173 million on lawyers and legal help involving the probe. So it’s responsible to think the bulk of the $858 million FCPA-related costs are directly linked to legal representation in defense of the violation claims that now span multiple counties. Koehler also has said he expects the conclusion on Wal-Mart’s FCPA probe to wind down sometime next year. Two to four years is the normal time for a typical investigation, according to Koehler. And while the Wal-Mart case is on the outer limits of that, it’s not uncommon for a complex case to last five or six years, he added. Since the FCPA investigation first became public, Wal-Mart execs have vowed to investigate the allegations and deal swiftly with any individual who might be implicated. Koehler credits Wal-Mart with doing lots of things right, namely investing heavily in its own internal compliance program to build a stronger firewall around the business. He said the types of remedial acts are viewed positively when the settlement is negotiated. Should Wal-Mart admit to violations in its future settlement with the Department of Justice, other shareholder litigation could follow.

The massive security breakdown disclosed Thursday poses new headaches for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as she scrambles to close a $4.8 billion sale to Verizon Communication. The breach Thursday dates back to late 2014, raising questions about the checks and balances within Yahoo — a fallen internet star that has been laying off staff to counter a steep drop in revenue during the past eight years. ___ US home sales fell in August as inventories plummet WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans retreated from home-buying in August, as a worsening inventory shortage appears to be hurting sales and pushing prices higher. Housing has been a bright spot amid weak economic growth for much of this year. Sales totals continue to recover from the Great Recession. Buyers increasingly have pristine credit. But the primary weakness in housing has been a lack of properties for sale. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. ___ US claims for jobless aid slide to lowest level since July WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July, more evidence that U.S. workers are enjoying job security. The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, longest such streak since 1970. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits is 2.11 million, down nearly 6 per cent from a year ago. ___ Stocks gain moderately, led by high-dividend sectors NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks posted solid gains on Thursday as investors, comfortable that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low, bought up stocks that pay big dividends. Real estate companies rose as investors looked for income, as did telecom stocks, which also typically pay higher-than-average dividends. Trading followed a pattern that has become familiar in the last several months. After hesitating or worrying that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, investors piled into high-dividend stocks following yet another Fed decision to stand pat on interest rates. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate declines to 3.48 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged lower this week. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.48 per cent from 3.50 per cent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.86 per cent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate eased to 2.76 per cent from 2.77 per cent. ___ AP Moller-Maersk splits its shipping, energy operations COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is splitting its massive container shipping operations and its energy business into separate companies, in a major shakeup that follows years of declining oil prices and freight rates. The Copenhagen-based group said Thursday the transport and logistics division will include its shipping, terminal and container businesses, while the energy division will handle oil drilling and production as well as the tanker business. A.P. Moller-Maersk raised the possibility of separating its oil units from the group through joint ventures, mergers or listings. ___ Hanjin Shipping to get more funds to resolve cargo crisis SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hanjin Shipping is set to receive as much as $100 million in additional funds to resolve the cargo crisis caused by its slide toward bankruptcy. Hanjin’s lead creditor, Korea Development Bank, said Thursday it will offer a credit line of 50 billion won ($45 million) to help the shipper unload cargo stranded offshore. The announcement comes a day after Korean Air Lines’ board approved a 60 billion won ($54 million) loan to the troubled ocean shipping line. Even with the help of the bank, it was not clear if the new funds would be enough to solve the cargo crisis. ___ Wal-Mart to face class-action over alleged bribery in Mexico NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has granted class-action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. The allegations included that Wal-Mart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favours. “Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favour class certification,” U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. ___ Lennar and WCI join to create powerhouse in Florida NEW YORK (AP) — Lennar will spend $643 million to acquire luxury homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., tying up two of the largest home construction companies in Florida as the U.S. real estate market continues to heat up. The deal, for $23.50 per share, marks a 37 per cent premium to WCI’s closing price Wednesday. It will be half in cash and half in Lennar stock. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which must still get the nod from WCI shareholders. ___ Tesla update halts automatic steering if driver inattentive DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Motors says a software update to its Autopilot system will disable automatic steering if drivers don’t keep their hands on the wheel. The update also adds multiple features, including improved radar, better voice commands and an industry-first temperature control system that helps prevent kids and pets from overheating. Tesla started moving the update to Model X SUV and Model S sedan owners Wednesday night over the internet. Critics questioned whether the system, which was released last fall, was ready to be on the road after a driver using Autopilot was killed when his Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer. ___ Turkish central bank cuts rate to boost slowing economy ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank cut a key interest rate for the seventh month in a row as it tries to shore up an economy that has been shaken by a series of bombings and an attempted coup. Voicing what appeared to be increasing worries over the scale of the country’s economic slowdown, the bank cut its overnight marginal funding rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.5 per cent. That means the rate has fallen by 2.5 percentage points since March. The lower rate is intended to help banks borrow more cheaply from day to day, which could help keep the financial system running smoothly at a time of heightened uncertainty. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98.76 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,392.46. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 14.06 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 2,177.18. The Nasdaq composite added 44.34 points, or 0.8 per cent, to a record 5,339.52. U.S. benchmark crude rose 98 cents to close at $46.32 a barrel, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 82 cents to close at $47.65 a barrel. In other energy commodities, heating oil rose 2.5 cents to $1.45 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose less than 1 cent to $1.40 a gallon and natural gas fell 7 cents to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

The massive security breakdown disclosed Thursday poses new headaches for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as she scrambles to close a $4.8 billion sale to Verizon Communication. The breach Thursday dates back to late 2014, raising questions about the checks and balances within Yahoo - a fallen internet star that has been laying off staff to counter a steep drop in revenue during the past eight years. ___ US home sales fell in August as inventories plummet WASHINGTON -- Americans retreated from home-buying in August, as a worsening inventory shortage appears to be hurting sales and pushing prices higher. Housing has been a bright spot amid weak economic growth for much of this year. Sales totals continue to recover from the Great Recession. Buyers increasingly have pristine credit. But the primary weakness in housing has been a lack of properties for sale. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. ___ US claims for jobless aid slide to lowest level since July WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July, more evidence that U.S. workers are enjoying job security. The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, longest such streak since 1970. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits is 2.11 million, down nearly 6 percent from a year ago. ___ Stocks gain moderately, led by high-dividend sectors NEW YORK -- Stocks posted solid gains on Thursday as investors, comfortable that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low, bought up stocks that pay big dividends. Real estate companies rose as investors looked for income, as did telecom stocks, which also typically pay higher-than-average dividends. Trading followed a pattern that has become familiar in the last several months. After hesitating or worrying that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, investors piled into high-dividend stocks following yet another Fed decision to stand pat on interest rates. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate declines to 3.48 percent WASHINGTON -- Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged lower this week. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.48 percent from 3.50 percent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.86 percent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate eased to 2.76 percent from 2.77 percent. ___ AP Moller-Maersk splits its shipping, energy operations COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is splitting its massive container shipping operations and its energy business into separate companies, in a major shakeup that follows years of declining oil prices and freight rates. The Copenhagen-based group said Thursday the transport and logistics division will include its shipping, terminal and container businesses, while the energy division will handle oil drilling and production as well as the tanker business. A.P. Moller-Maersk raised the possibility of separating its oil units from the group through joint ventures, mergers or listings. ___ Hanjin Shipping to get more funds to resolve cargo crisis SEOUL, South Korea -- Hanjin Shipping is set to receive as much as $100 million in additional funds to resolve the cargo crisis caused by its slide toward bankruptcy.

A Tesla lawsuit challenges a Michigan law that ensures automakers can sell their vehicles only through franchised dealerships. (Richard Vogel/AP) September 22 AUTOMOBILE Tesla sues Michigan over dealership law Tesla sued Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and other state officials Thursday, challenging a Michigan law that ensures automakers can sell only through independent, franchised dealerships and not directly to customers. The federal lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the 2014 “anti-Tesla” law is unconstitutional and asks for an injunction to prevent its enforcement. The Michigan Department of State last week denied Tesla’s application for a dealer license to sell to consumers, citing the law, which is backed by big auto companies and their dealerships. It has not decided on Tesla’s bid to register a vehicle repair facility in the state, which is home to the Detroit Big Three carmakers. “The sole purpose for applying (the law) to a non-franchising manufacturer like Tesla is to insulate Michigan’s entrenched automobile dealers and manufacturers from competition,” Tesla said in the lawsuit. “This is not a legitimate government interest under the U.S. Constitution.” In 2014, Snyder and the GOP-controlled legislature amended state law to clarify that car companies can sell only through franchised dealers. Tesla said it was a monopolistic strike at the fledgling company, which has no traditional dealerships. — Associated Press TELECOMMUNICATIONS More safety checks set for Samsung Note 7 Samsung Electronics was ordered to carry out more safety checks of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones before they go back on sale following an unprecedented global recall after defective batteries caused some of the phones to burst into flames. Under a recall plan agreed to by the South Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, Samsung’s battery supplier will have to X-ray-test every lithium-ion battery intended for the Note 7 before the batteries are shipped, and Samsung will carry out a quality test on every battery when it arrives from the supplier. Samsung also agreed to do more for consumers who wish to ditch their Note 7s for another brand. Consumers who missed a Monday deadline to get a refund for the Note 7 smartphone now have until the end of the month to get an iPhone or similar device from the same mobile carrier in exchange for the Note 7. The Galaxy Note 7 phone went on sale in August to glowing reviews but has become Samsung’s biggest crisis in years. With consumers reporting that the high-end phones were overheating and catching fire, Samsung stopped sales Sept. 2 and recalled 2.5 million units, citing a battery manufacturing error. This week, Samsung started shipping new Note 7 phones with safe batteries in the United States, South Korea and other countries, while urging consumers to hand in their phones for replacements. — Associated Press Also in Business ● A federal judge has granted class-action status to Walmart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. A key allegation was that Walmart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Ark., this week dismissed Walmart’s argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Walmart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund showed losses, based on another accounting method. ● Americans retreated from home buying in August, with a worsening inventory shortage appearing to hurt sales and push prices higher. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said. Fewer sellers are coming into the market, with inventory collapsing 10.1 percent from a year ago to 2.04 million homes. Meanwhile, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 3.48 percent this week, down from 3.86 percent a year ago. ● The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July. The Labor Department said jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, the longest such streak since 1970. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

The update also adds multiple features, including improved radar, better voice commands and an industry-first temperature control system that helps prevent kids and pets from overheating. Tesla started moving the update to Model X SUV and Model S sedan owners Wednesday night over the internet. Critics questioned whether the system, which was released last fall, was ready to be on the road after a driver using Autopilot was killed when his Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer. ___ Turkish central bank cuts rate to boost slowing economy ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's central bank cut a key interest rate for the seventh month in a row as it tries to shore up an economy that has been shaken by a series of bombings and an attempted coup. Voicing what appeared to be increasing worries over the scale of the country's economic slowdown, the bank cut its overnight marginal funding rate to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. That means the rate has fallen by 2.5 percentage points since March. The lower rate is intended to help banks borrow more cheaply from day to day, which could help keep the financial system running smoothly at a time of heightened uncertainty. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,392.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 14.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,177.18. The Nasdaq composite added 44.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to a record 5,339.52. U.S. benchmark crude rose 98 cents to close at $46.32 a barrel, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 82 cents to close at $47.65 a barrel. In other energy commodities, heating oil rose 2.5 cents to $1.45 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose less than 1 cent to $1.40 a gallon and natural gas fell 7 cents to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Hansen | lhansen@mlive.com By Logan T. Hansen | lhansen@mlive.com MLive.com Follow on Twitter on September 22, 2016 at 4:51 PM, updated September 22, 2016 at 5:02 PM comments (File photo)  DEARBORN -- Suspicious items left near a Walmart Supercenter on Ford Road prompted police to call in a bomb squad Wednesday afternoon. Around 4:30 p.m., police were alerted of a package or two outside of the shopping center that appeared "menacing and threatening," according to Police Chief Ronald Haddad. The items were a pressure cooker and a piece of luggage. "They looked like it could be a potential bomb," Haddad said. "So our patrol force quickly locked off the area, evacuated people from the area to make them safe. "The FBI, state police, and our bomb team responded within the first hour, determined it was a benign drop-off." Police look to return stolen sports memorabilia after home invasion arrests The person responsible for leaving the items called the Dearborn Police Department on Thursday morning apologizing for the mishap, Haddad said. "The person was honest enough to call this morning and say, 'You know, I feel terrible about this,' and I think that's fair enough."

There’s a lot to purchase, but shopping for the season doesn’t mean you have to spend a scary amount. We’ve put together a guide of everything you should buy (and skip) in October so you can snag the sales and avoid paying full price. Buy: Jeans Historically, October has been one of the best times to buy jeans. The cold-weather staples have been on shelves since back-to-school season and retailers are now starting to discount them. The autumn deals on denim have already begun as October approaches. So far, we’ve spotted buy one, get one 50% off jean promotions at stores like Express and American Eagle Outfitters. Buy your jeans this month to expand your wardrobe without breaking the bank. Skip: Toys Halloween hasn’t even arrived yet, but you may already be thinking about the holiday shopping season — and holiday toy season. Wal-Mart has released its 2016 holiday toy list, and Toys R Us has unveiled its 2016 Hot Toy List. If you want to pay the lowest possible price for this year’s new gizmos and gadgets for your children, wait until December. Retailers usually discount toys close to Christmas. In 2015, Amazon offered sweeping toy discounts in the weeks preceding Dec. 25. So if your son or daughter is OK without having a shiny new Star Wars figurine right now, come December you might be able to give both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Buy: All things outdoor Most people head indoors when the weather cools down, but October is a good time to focus your shopping on the outdoors. We’re talking about camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor living essentials and more. Prices on outdoor products tend to be highest when demand is highest. But with summer becoming a distant memory, now is the time to act if you need new camping supplies. For example, Cabela’s is hosting a 40% off sale on camp furniture. At Lowe’s, Weber Genesis gas grills are now $100 off. Skip: Electronics Buy a tent? Sure. But you won’t want to fill your shopping cart with major electronics this month. We recommend that you hold off on picking up that new laptop, tablet or HDTV for a little while longer. The best time of the year for electronics deals, Black Friday, is just around the corner. You’ve waited this long, so keep up that discipline until the post-Thanksgiving deal blitz arrives on Nov. 25. In 2015, Black Friday was a blowout. Wal-Mart sold a 50-inch TV for $269. Best Buy took up to $125 off the iPad Air 2. Target slashed Beats headphones by over $100. Deals are expected to rival these levels again in 2016, especially for shoppers who get in line early. Buy: Halloween candy In 2015, shoppers who celebrated Halloween planned to spend a total of $2.1 billion dollars on candy alone, according to the National Retail Federation. If you’re one of these spooky celebrants, you’ll likely be looking to buy candy in bulk again this year. It’s difficult to buy Halloween candy in any month other than October. After all, you don’t want your Reese’s and Butterfingers to go bad before the trick-or-treaters arrive. We recommend waiting until the end of October to make your purchase. Retailers will be more eager to unload their stock of Halloween supplies — that means costumes and decorations, too — as the holiday draws near. Also, consider bulk candy retailers like Costco or Oriental Trading Co. to lower your average cost per unit. » MORE: What to buy every month of the year Skip: Cleaning supplies If you need a new vacuum cleaner or other floor care device, don’t act this month. If you can get by with your current model for a while longer, you can expect deep vacuum and cleaning supply sales in late November or early spring. For instance, last Black Friday, we saw big sales on major vacuum brands from stores like Target, Best Buy and Costco. The Dyson V6 stick was up to $150 off, and the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal vacuum was up to $170 off. We expect similar savings this season. Shop: Columbus Day weekend sales This Oct. 10, shoppers can commemorate the day Columbus set sail by sailing straight into a weekend full of deals. Department stores in particular are known to host sales in the days leading up to Columbus Day. Last year, Macy’s offered an extra 20% off select sale items, while J.C. Penney took up to 80% off an assortment of clothing and home goods. If you can, reserve many of your non-Halloween purchases for this weekend. Bonus: National Taco Day From National Selfie Day to National Coffee Day, there’s a quasi-holiday for just about anything. Restaurants particularly like observing food-themed days, as it gives them another opportunity to drum up business. This month, the day to look out for is Oct. 4, National Taco Day. In 2015, we spotted taco-themed discounts and deals at restaurants like El Torito and On the Border in honor of National Taco Day. Expect similar food freebies again this year.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: September 23, 2016 Low Gender-Pay Complaints Are An Admission of Subpar TalentBy John Tamny "Yeah, you're a genius, everyone knows it, a goddamn genius, but that's why you failed as a head coach - that's why you'll never be a head coach ... some genius." Those were the words of head NFL coach Bill Parcells to then assistant, and at the time once-failed (with the Cleveland Browns) head coach, Bill Belechick.  During a game Belechick had suggested a defensive scheme that Parcells rejected, only for Belechick to be proven correct. Parcells' irritated reply revealed a now dated view among some football types about Belechick; that while he was in possession of a brilliant defensive mind, he didn't have the skills to run a team. Parcells' dismissal of Belechick came to mind recently with the release of a video by actress Kristen Bell in which she complained about the alleged "gender pay" gap between men and women. Much ink has subsequently been spilled about how Bell unwittingly exposed a huge profit opportunity for self-interested business owners: if in fact women are underpaid relative to their skills just because they're women, smart owners will snap them up only to reveal through success in the marketplace why women are underpaid.  Of course, that almost misses the point. While it's certainly true that discrimination in a meritocracy is expensive, the latter was proven won long ago. There are so many examples, but in 1970 a racially integrated USC Trojan football team traveled to Birmingham, AL to play the then all-while Alabama Crimson Tide. USC walked all over the Tide, and in doing so, forced a much more rapid integration of SEC football, and sports in general. Those that hire or promote based on gender or race, or who fail to do so based on same, will pay a high price for discriminating. Seemingly the bigger story about Bell's mindless video has to do with the unspoken truth that those who complain about gender-pay discrimination are unwittingly admitting that they don't rate the supposedly equal - or greater - pay that they desire in the first place. In the real world, no truly talented person would seek coerced higher pay; instead, the skilled would reveal in the marketplace just why their pay isn't high enough through performance proving just that. In short, if women really feel they're underpaid relative to their male peers, they should express this truth in the free market. A reply to the above view may well be that talented women lack the opportunities to prove their equal or greater worth. But if that's the reply, it can't be stressed enough yet again that such a retort blaming gender discrimination for supposedly slim compensation opportunities is an explicit admission of subpar talent. Indeed, what's seemingly forgotten by the gender-pay gap crowd is that many of the highest paid males in the U.S. marketplace were similarly long discriminated against before ultimately proving their naysayers wrong. What's forever been proven true in the meritocratic markets is that really good commercial ideas, and really innovative processes, are frequently met with great skepticism - as in discrimination - in the initial stages. More specifically, the talented who ultimately rate enormous pay packages alongside great wealth usually only reach that point after being dismissed and discriminated against by the existing powers that be. Low pay and low treatment is not a gender thing. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com back in 1994 at a time when there existed great skepticism about the commercial worth of the internet. Had the established powers of the business world taken this maverick seriously, it's a near certainty that business behemoths of the Wal-Mart variety would have quickly paid Bezos billions for his innovation; that or they would have feverishly begun copying him right away. In reality, Bezos pursued a retail empire rooted in online sales that was ignored for quite a while. Even though Wal-Mart had much greater resources at its disposal, it didn't use them to vanquish Amazon as a competitor. To this day Wal-Mart is still striving to equal or exceed Bezos on the e-commerce front; it's recent acquisition of Jet.com for $3 billion yet another admission from the big box retail giant that its early dismissal of Bezos (now one of the five richest men in the world) has proven quite costly. Not too long after Amazon entered the marketplace, now bankrupt Blockbuster Video had the opportunity to acquire Reed Hasting's struggling online DVD rental service NetFlix for a tiny fraction of its present worth. Blockbuster's dismissal of NetFlix proved costly too; so costly that Blockbuster no longer exists. And rather than sit back and wait for another competitor to compete away its DVD rental profits, NetFlix proceeded to essentially put its initial source of great profits out of business in favor of movie and television-show streaming. The late Steve Jobs introduced an Apple iPhone at a time when Palm and Blackberry were the undisputed powers in the smartphone market. The very notion of a $500+ device that lacked Blackberry's then advanced keyboard was mocked by smartphone experts, including management at then-powerful Blackberry itself. Jobs died after adding many billions to his net worth, but only after being dismissed by a company - Blackberry - whose products are presently vanishing before our eyes thanks to it ignoring a market evolution that Jobs plainly saw. Back to Belichick, readers might stop for a second and imagine what the outcry would have been had Parcells - or any other male CEO - insulted a woman or minority employee in the same way that he did Belichick. Given the hyper-litigious society in which we live Parcells would have been fired, and the New York Jets would have paid big fines for his discouraging words. What would have been missed is that the commercial present rarely predicts the future. While Parcells viewed Belichick as a career assistant, others (most notably New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft) thankfully didn't. Four Super Bowl victories later, it's increasingly said that Belechick is the greatest NFL coach ever. So rabid are sports fans that other NFL owners (and college ADs) are constantly in search of the next Belichick, or Nick Saban. Rest assured that if an individual possesses the genius of either, gender or color won't prove a barrier to employment forever. What this hopefully reminds us is that whether in sports, or the traditional world of business, the path to higher pay for the super-talented is often paved with discrimination. Almost as a rule. Figure that those who truly rate higher pay than their peers usually only do because they have ideas about how to do things that have so far not been tried, and because they haven't been, they're regularly the source of early-stage ridicule. In commerce, if you have a great idea you almost literally have to force it on people. As evidenced by his unrivaled success in the present, the formerly $25/week assistant in Bill Belichick was once underpaid. So were Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Reed Hastings similarly underpaid. Visionaries are discriminated against more than anyone. Applied to females, rather than decry a supposed gender wage gap rooted in discrimination, they should simply prove it as the discriminated against long have. If not, as in if they intend to produce videos or pursue legislation to air their grievances, they're merely admitting for all to see that their level of talent doesn't rate equal or greater pay to begin with.

The ruling will make it harder for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart to brush aside a Michigan pension fund’s claims that the chain artificially inflated the value of its shares by mishandling the alleged Mexican payoffs. The suit, filed in 2012, accused Wal-Mart of bribing Mexican officials to speed up approval for the opening of new stores. The chain was accused of hiding the bribery scheme for about seven years beginning in 2005. The payoffs were made public in a 2012 New York Times article. The paper reported at the time that Wal-Mart made at least $24 million in “suspect payments” to facilitate construction of Mexican stores. “This was a procedural ruling that has nothing to do with the merits of the case,” Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We continue to believe the claims here are not appropriate for class treatment.” In May, the company persuaded a Delaware judge to throw out claims filed by another set of shareholders accusing directors of botching the handling of the Mexican bribery scandal. Multiple Probes The world’s largest retailer has said in regulatory filings that it spent $439 million since 2012 in connection with investigations into allegations that employees paid bribes in Mexico, China, India and Brazil. Both U.S. and Mexican prosecutors have open investigations into Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, one of the country’s largest private employers with more than 200,000 workers. Lawyers for the Michigan pension fund contend former Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Michael Duke and other board members failed to thoroughly investigate the claims even though they were put on notice in 2005. The retailer began a comprehensive probe only after the Times reported on the allegations in 2012, investors said. Wal-Mart officials are accused of filing misleading disclosures with U.S. regulators about when they learned about the bribery claims and the thoroughness of the retailer’s internal review of its Mexican operations. In her ruling on Sept. 22, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said “judicial economy and the best interests of” shareholders favor allowing the case to proceed as a class action. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 12-cv-05162, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas (Fayetteville). Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

She lives in Dallas, Texas with her family where she enjoys reading, roller derby, and complaining about the heat. View Profile Image: Patrick Chondon/Getty Images Print An open letter to the dad caught dragging his daughter around by her hair Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Dear Walmart Dad, I knew it would only be a matter of time before I ended up looking at the pictures of you dragging your daughter by the hair through a Walmart right here in my home state of Texas. They were all over my news feed, accompanied by one-sentence notes: "Can you believe this?" or "That poor little girl!" punctuated by sad face and mad face and broken heart emojis. I didn't really want to look. But here I am, writing an open letter (something else I never thought I'd do) to a stranger because this is my job, and that involved bringing up Erika Burch's viral post where your daughter's pleading face and your impassive one feature prominently. More: Don't effing ask me 'how much my kid cost' I looked, but I didn't want to. I didn't want to gawk. I know what it's like to be gawked at by people when a parent is punishing you in public. I grew up that way, except there were no Erika Burches when I was your daughter's age. I grew up like your daughter, and it seems I grew up the way you did too (at least based on your "defense" for your actions). You see, when the media came to talk to her, she said that you told her "[You] grew up just fine, do you see any of her hair missing?" So I'm going to do something else I don't love to do and assume something. I'm going to assume that your parents did things like this. You wouldn't be the first person to justify the continuation of it by saying that because you "turned out fine," after a childhood of physical punishment like spankings. And Walmart Dad, I know it's tempting to think it. But dude, when you grow up with parents who think dragging a kid around by their hair is OK, you're really not "just fine." People are fond of saying that kids need more discipline, and maybe that's true. What they don't need is punishment, which is what maybe you got and what your daughter got and what I got. There is a difference, believe it or not. Discipline is an appropriate consequence for an inappropriate behavior. Punishment is an overreaction. It's getting even. It's wrapping your child's hair around a pushcart like you did, because she wandered too far from the cart. Or wrapping packing tape around your kid's head and marching her around town to get her to shut up when adults are talking, like my mother did. Punishment needs shame to be effective. It needs its subject to beg, like your daughter did. Like I did. It needs pain. It needs a witness or a scar. And sometimes, those scars don't show up where you think they do. More: 50 photos you're really going to want to take of your kid I know the birthright that is fury. The inability to understand why your kid can't just do the thing you tell them to do. To act right. I know how it can bubble up and make you much angrier than it ought to. The temptation of thinking that a little public humiliation — and I don't know you, but I know from experience that what a parent gets away with in public sometimes emboldens what they do in private — or private pain might be good for them. If it happened to you, maybe it was good for you. You turned out fine, after all. But that. That right there: That justification is what means we didn't turn out OK. That little voice at the back of our heads that tells us to lash out and breathes oxygen on the little indignant sparks so they flare up into rage. That's not actually normal. It's not healthy. It's a lot of things, but "just fine" ain't one of 'em. I have never done what you've done. Even in my darkest, least fine moments, my anger has never manifested itself in physical punishment enacted on my kid. And I know you've got a lot of people tugging you in every direction. Telling you you're a piece of garbage and jumping to conclusions about what you do to your kids when no one is watching. Then you've got the people defending you. They level their judgment at your little girl instead, who they are sure undoubtedly deserved what she got. On Facebook, there's a woman who called your daughter a "piece of shit," and I cringed with the same shame I did when I first saw these pictures. When I was serving my own little punishments. More: The 10 things every boy needs to hear his parents say about consent I don't want to call you names. I don't even really want to judge you, even though that's extremely difficult. I definitely don't want to relate to you (even though a part of me does), and I'll do a lot for this job but I won't defend you. So I'll just tell you this. You and me are cut from the same cloth. There are good things about us, and there are bad things too. Maybe I'm wrong and your parents never laid a hand on you. So maybe I'm more like your daughter instead. And when it comes to the shame and pain we got as "punishment" from our own parents, we're not just fine. But we can both get there if we try.

John Hatcher With assistance from the general public, Casper Police Fraud Investigators have solved a case that was featured on Crime Stoppers. Casper Police say in late July, an elderly blind female wrote a check at the east side Wal-Mart for $10.33. The check was processed and given back to her, but later it was somehow lost. Three days later, an unknown white female changed the lost check amount to $183.77, for items she had purchased at the east side Wal-Mart. The female suspect was wearing a grey tank top with Mickey Mouse on the front. Detective John Hatcher said the case went cold, because they couldn’t identify the suspect on security cameras, and so it was featured on Crime Stoppers. About an hour or two after the new Crime Stoppers case was published, detectives received calls from the public who were able to identify the suspect, and it turned out to be 40-year old Justice Ellis. When interviewed she admitted to what she did, but didn’t say how she was able to acquire the check. Hatcher says if it wasn’t for the public’s help, who knows how long, or if the case would’ve been solved. “It’s good that when we see a success story from these Crime Stoppers and especially this week, that people in the community want to see people brought to justice, so it’s a great win for Crime Stoppers.” Hatcher adds that a warrant has been issued for Ellis’ arrest. Charges are still pending. Det.

( REUTERS/Jason Miczek) Rioting and civil unrest are becoming a common occurrence in America. The city of Charlotte has been hit by a second night of violence even though authorities are desperately pleading for calm. What sparked the chaos in Charlotte was the shooting of a 43-year-old black man named Keith Lamont Scott. It appears that he was armed when he was shot, and the police officer that shot him was also black, but those facts have done little to ease the fury of the protesters. On Tuesday night, 16 police officers were injured by rioters, including one that was hit in the face by a rock. Hopefully there will be fewer casualties by the time the violence on Wednesday night is over. So far things don't look good though. The following is how USA Today is describing the violence that we have witnessed so far on Wednesday night: A second night of dramatic protests gripped this North Carolina city Wednesday night, one day after a police-involved shooting of an African-American man led to angry demonstrations, smashed windows and trucks set ablaze. Protesters beat against a police van and broke a window of the City Smoke barbecue restaurant and bar downtown. Some yelled "hands up, don't shoot." Police tossed out smoke bombs. Protesters running outside of the Omni Charlotte Hotel said someone had been shot but that could not immediately be confirmed Wednesday night. Later on it was confirmed that someone indeed was shot. In fact, local news is reporting that there was a pool of blood on the ground: At least one person was injured in the confrontation, though it wasn't immediately clear how. "They shot him," one witness told WBTV. "They tried to cover up his blood." Firefighters rushed in to pull the man to a waiting ambulance. Officers on bicycles surrounded a pool of blood on the ground and a few people threw bottles and clods of dirt at police. Of course this follows an extremely tense night of violence and chaos that made headlines all over the globe. Just hours after Keith Lamont Scott was shot, hundreds of very angry protesters descended on downtown Charlotte: Several hundred people blocked streets well after midnight, despite the use of tear gas by police in riot gear. Clouds of tear gas drifted over the crowd, and people coughed and fell back before walking toward police lines again multiple times. They held signs that said "Stop Killing Us" and "Black Lives Matter," and they chanted "No justice, no peace." One sign read: "IT WAS A BOOK." The scene was sometimes chaotic and tense, with water bottles and stones thrown at police lines, but many protesters called for peace and implored their fellow demonstrators not to act violently. In addition to 16 police officers being injured, there were reports that rioters were hurling "rocks, bottles and traffic cones off interstate overpasses." A number of vehicles were hit, and injuries were reported. This kind of mindless violence makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Those drivers had nothing to do with the shooting, but an object thrown at a vehicle from an overpass can literally kill someone. How would killing a totally innocent person bring justice for Keith Lamont Scott? Sadly, this is what happens when riots start. They all too often spin wildly out of control. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=512997128" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=512997128" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement In addition to everything else, one group of protesters decided that it would be a really good idea to loot a Wal-Mart: Protesters headed to the Walmart on N. Tryon in the University area after shutting down Interstate-85 at WT Harris Blvd. early Wednesday morning following the shooting death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. Officers in riot gear blocked the entry to Walmart after it was broken into. Employees could be seen sweeping up shattered glass at the front entrance. One employee told FOX 46 Charlotte some technology was stolen, including, a flat screen television and iPads. Once again, stealing televisions and iPads is not going to do anything to bring justice for Keith Lamont Scott. There are always people that see chaos as an opportunity to take advantage of others, and this is yet another example. We live in a society that is an advanced state of moral decay, and situations like this bring it to the surface. What is truly unfortunate is that it sounds like the police actually followed correct procedure in this case. According to Police Chief Kerr Putney, Keith Lamont Scott was armed and refused to drop his weapon after repeated demands to do so: Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun at an apartment complex on the city's northeast side. "The officers gave loud, clear verbal commands which were also heard by many of the witnesses. They were instructing the subject, once he got out of the vehicle, to drop the weapon ... Mr. Scott exited his vehicle armed with a handgun as the officers continued to yell at him to drop it." Unfortunately, we have gotten to a point where a riot is almost expected every time an African-American male is shot by police in this country. I think that Rush Limbaugh put it very well on his radio show: It's a sad observation, folks. I'm telling you, a sad, sad observation but it's an observation that I don't think I'm alone in making. It seems like rioting is almost expected now when there is a cop shooting. A cop shooting, period. Don't care about the details. It seems like it's now axiomatic that there's going to be rioting or massive public protests or threats of rioting or threats of unrest every time the cops have to draw their weapons. Without a doubt, police brutality in the United States is out of control, and this is something that I have been writing about for a very long time. But rioting, looting and violence are not going to solve anything. We desperately need to learn how to love one another, and we desperately need to come together as a nation to work on finding some solutions. Instead, America is becoming increasingly divided, and anger and frustration are rising to unprecedented levels. And if we are witnessing this much chaos now, while things are still relatively stable, what are things going to look like once economic conditions get really bad? Our society is literally coming apart at the seams, and the chaos and the violence are going to get much worse than this. We wanted to push God out of every aspect of public life, and now we are beginning to see what that looks like. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

(NYSE: WMT)'s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com closed Monday, but the retailer's woes won't go away overnight. Bloomberg Gadfly's Shelly Banjo offered four pieces of advice for Wal-Mart that could help close the gap between its online business and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). 1. Focus On The Customer Amazon ignored its bottom line for years in favor of gaining market share. On the other hand, Wal0-Mart has focused on turning a profit, one of the reasons why it loses to Amazon in online sales. Meanwhile, Jet's entire business model of driving down costs for consumers serves as a hint that "Walmart might continue to pursue profits over pleasing customers." Banjo further suggested that Jet's business model is also similar to those of daily deals and auctions. Moreover, "jumping through hoops" such as receiving a discount for opting out of a warranty or paying by debit card to lower a retailer's cost "shouldn't be a shopper's job." Related Link: How Does Target's New $5 Billion Buyback Plan Stack Up Against Other Retailers? 2. Pounce On Amazon Part of Amazon's popularity is due to its marketplace that connect consumers with smaller merchants. However, behind the scenes, Amazon's relationship with third-party merchants is quite poor in some cases. Wal-Mart should start "luring" sellers away from Amazon and "pounce on existing seller frustration" with Amazon. Jet's business was built on the premise of selling others' brands and could help Wal-Mart in this case. 3. Focus On Neglected Categories Consumers typically don't care for brand names when it comes to home goods and decor. Wal-Mart could focus on these categories considering Amazon relies on third-party sellers to instead of building out the category on its own. 4. Take Advantage Of 'Street Cred' Simply put, Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet gives it "some short-term street cred to mount an aggressive attack on Amazon." As such, Wal-Mart needs to give Jet's CEO Marc Lore the "room and funds" to upgrade Wal-Mart's supply chain. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Opinion Dear Media: Please Stop Calling Violent Rioters ‘Protesters’ by Alex Griswold | 9:58 am, September 22nd, 2016   Watching coverage of the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina last night, I was struck by a common trend in how the most violent acts were being covered. Here are the three most-shared tweets of the night, but notice what they all have in common. BREAKING | Dozens of protesters are breaking into the Walmart on North Tryon Street. @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/2b2lmwqC2g — Mark Barber (@MBarberWSOC9) September 21, 2016 BREAKING: Hornets confirm that the team store at the arena is being looted by protestors. pic.twitter.com/Q2QKfJDXaA — WSOCTV (@wsoctv) September 22, 2016 #WCCB witnessed protesters try to throw still photographer into fire in Uptown #Charlotte. https://t.co/T6i8AH5iGu #CharlotteProtest #news pic.twitter.com/t26WgIlwOh — WCCB, Charlotte’s CW (@WCCBCharlotte) September 22, 2016 Looting a Wal-Mart, destruction of property, attempted murder, all carried out by… “protesters.” There are thousands of protests in America every year, all of which manage to be nonviolent. I’ve been to quite a few of them, including entirely peaceful Black Lives Matter protests. None of them involved throwing people into a fire. Heck, none of them managed to set anything on fire. I suppose you could make a convoluted argument about how the protests were against white supremacy, and capitalism and the media are agents of white supremacy, therefore attacking those institutions are acts of “protest” or whatever. But if even violent attempted murder and destruction of property can be a “protest” so long as the motives are political, I don’t see why the same can’t be said of, say, a terrorist attack. But I’ve never seen a tweet or headline describing Osama Bin Laden as a mere “protester.” What I suspect is going on here is that reporters are attempting to stay neutral. Calling the perpetrators “looters” or “rioters” or “attackers” carries a degree of moral condemnation with it. Normally that’d be fine, but there’s also a substantial percent of the country that sympathizes with the perpetrators, or at least their motives. To appease those who sympathize broadly with the Black Lives Matter movement or similar groups, they choose to call them “protesters” instead. But this is a false neutrality. In an effort to please those of all political stripes, the media ended up misinforming their consumers. The men and women who looted that Wal-Mart and destroyed stores were not “protesters,” and if they had done so in a context divorced from politics, media outlets would have the stones to say so. The irony is that in their quest to cater to those who sympathize with Black Lives Matter, the media ends up doing the movement a disservice. To say that the worst instances of violence and rage were carried out by “protesters” — without qualification — the unmistakable impression is that looters and thieves are emblematic of the Charlotte protests as a whole. I’m sure conservatives are salivating to chalk this up to an instance of “liberal media bias,” but we’ve seen this before with the Bundy Oregon stand-off. There was a tendency there to refer to armed militants who had seized a federal building as mere “protesters.” Again, by that definition, John McClane spent his Christmas Eve clearing out Nakatomi Plaza of “protesters.” The principle remains the same no matter if it’s liberals or conservatives embracing lawlessness: criminals are criminals, and the media has a responsibility to identify them as such. >>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter This is an opinion piece.

John Kline (R-Minn.) to create “composite” multiemployer plans. These would combine features of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to shore up financially troubled multiemployer plans. Like defined-benefit plans, the composite plans would provide beneficiaries with annuities. But as with defined-contribution plans, the annuities’ value would depend on market value and plan funding requirements. Additionally, composite plan trustees would be required to adjust contribution requirements or cut benefits if a plan were not projected to be 120 percent funded within 15 years. Opponents to the composite plans say they don’t provide sufficient protection for retirees. Witnesses at today’s hearing include Randy DeFrehn, executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, and David Certner, legislative policy director for government affairs at AARP. The hearing starts at 9:30 a.m. in room 2175, Rayburn House Office Building. More here. Story Continued Below GOOD MORNING.

SPEAKING OF PENSIONS: The Senate Finance Committee approved, 18-8, legislation to shore up the United Mine Workers’ health and pension plans using funds from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and the U.S. Treasury. All of the committee’s 12 Democrats voted for the bill. They were joined by six Republicans — Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Following the vote, Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said they were confident of a floor vote after the election. The committee also passed unanimously a bipartisan package of pension reforms that included a proposal to allow for so-called open multiple employer plans (different from multiemployer plans, which are created through collective bargaining). The “open MEP” proposal, which the Obama administration supports, allows small employers to pool their retirement assets together in a single 401(k) plan even if they do not have a “common bond”--a requirement under current law. TODAY: ICE UNDER FIRE: The House Judiciary Committee will question U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldaña on the Obama Administration's immigration enforcement policies. “Members of the committee will press Director Saldaña to enforce our immigration laws and keep criminal aliens off of our streets,” Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said. The hearing is at 10 a.m. in 2237 Rayburn, and will be livestreamed here. DOL PAID SICK LEAVE RULE LEAVES OMB: The Labor Department’s paid sick leave rule for federal contractors has left the White House Office of Management and Budget. The final rule implements a 2015 executive order that required federal contractors to provide their workers with at least seven paid sick days per year. A proposed version of the rule allowed employees to use the paid six days for themselves, for a sick family member, or for absences related to sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking. The Labor Department estimates the rule will expand paid sick leave to 828,000 people, including 437,000 who previously had no paid sick leave option. FED SIGNALS RATE HIKE BEFORE END OF YEAR: To no one’s surprise, the Federal Reserve did not hike interest rates Wednesday. But Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that a hike is likely before the end of the year, Jon Hilsenrath and David Harrison write in the Wall Street Journal. At a press conference, Yellen said that “the case for an increase had strengthened,” and noted economic growth was picking up, with household incomes seeing solid growth and more workers rejoining the labor force. But “she is in no hurry to raise rates to cool the economy because inflation remains below the Fed’s 2% target and a growing pool of available labor is preventing wage pressures from building.” More here. FOR OUR FUTURE SUPER PAC EXPANDS: The “For Our Future” Super PAC, engineered by Tom Steyer and top officials at the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Education Association, is ramping up its efforts to get Hillary Clinton and other Democrats elected, Sam Stein writes for the Huffington Post. The PAC has a total budget of $55 million and recently expanded its ground operations to Missouri and North Carolina, in addition to operations in Nevada, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The group has reached 2 million households and plans to knock on 5.3 million doors between now and Election Day. More here. WALMART DOLES OUT WORKER BONUSES: Hourly employees at the nation’s largest private employer will collect bonuses following improved customer satisfaction in Walmart stores between May and July, The Street’s Brian Sozzi reports. Roughly 900,000 eligible workers will receive an extra $200 in their paychecks, which amounts to a $200 million tab for the retailer. At its annual meeting in June, Walmart praised improved performance, according to customer reviews, in store cleanliness, service speed, and friendliness. The announcement of worker bonuses came after a wage hike for hourly Walmart employees. The raise appears to have improved the company’s bottom line. Second quarter figures show an increase in same-store sales of 1.6 percent across the board. Read more from The Street. But UFCW’s Making Change at Walmart campaign said the bonuses will be awarded only to workers who complete a “months-long” training program. CTU STRIKE LOOMS WITH VOTE THIS WEEK: Chicago Teachers Union members are casting votes on whether to strike over a two-year-old contractual dispute. The Chicago Sun-Times’ Lauren FitzPatrick reports that the results of the vote, which will continue through Friday, won’t be immediately available. CTU leaders haven’t released a date for the strike. This is the second time over the past year that union members have voted on whether to strike; in December, 88 percent voted to strike. Meanwhile, “informational picketing” continues in Chicago, with union members handing out leaflets on the contractual dispute to families before and after school. Talks of a strike boiled over last month when Chicago Public Schools released a $5.4 billion budget that assumed the union would approve a contract it previously rejected that increased wages over four years but phased out a 7 percent pension contribution that CPS had been making on the members’ behalf. Read more from the Chicago Sun-Times. REPORT: OBAMA LABOR REGS WILL COST $81 BILLION: A report out today from the Center for Manufacturing Research estimates that the Obama administration’s labor regulations will lead to more than $81 billion in compliance costs over the next decade and result in the loss of 150,000 jobs and 411 million hours of paperwork. The report estimates that the Labor Department’s silica rule will cost $25 billion; the overtime rule will cost $24 billion; the rule to require federal contractors disclose previous labor law violations will cost $3.2 billion; and OSHA’s injury and reporting rule will cost $10 billion. In addition, the report estimates the National Labor Relations Board’s newly broadened joint employer standard and rule to speed up union elections will cost $17.5 billion and that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s proposal to collect data on compensation and diversity will cost $1.9 billion. Amanda Wood, director of employment policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, told Morning Shift that the Obama administration has suggested that the regulations are simple changes to forms, definitions or reporting requirements. “From our standpoint, these figures prove that’s just not true,” she said. Read the report here. REPORT: LITTLE EVIDENCE IMMIGRATION AFFECTS EMPLOYMENT LEVELS: A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine shows there is “little evidence” that immigration affects American workers’ employment levels to any significant extent. The report said immigration was more likely to affect other immigrants, because newer immigration reduces the employment rate of earlier arrivals. The same went for wages -- when measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of American workers was “very small,” the report said. Those most likely to be affected were prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school. The report said that in 2014 the foreign-born portion of the labor force was just over 16 percent, up from 11 percent in 1995. Undocumented immigrants numbered 11.1 million, up from 5.7 million two decades earlier. Legal immigrants numbered about 800,000 per year until 2001, and have averaged just over 1 million annually since then. First-generation immigrants are more costly to governments (mostly at the state and local levels) due the costs of education, but these children end up being among “the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population,” the report said. They contribute more in taxes than their parents, and also more than the rest of the native-born population. The full report is here. NLRB FILES BRIEF ON SUCCESSORSHIP: The National Labor Relations Board filed a brief this week in a case on successorship, i.e., when a new employer must honor the terms of an old employer’s collective bargaining agreement after buying the company or taking control of its workers. Lily Transportation Co. succeeded a company called Pumpernickel Express Inc. as the contract carrier for workers at a Toyota warehouse in Mansfield, Mass., where the employees were unionized. Lily rehired 13 of the Pumpernickel Toyota drivers, but refused to recognize the union. A month later, 19 employees signed statements declaring they did not want union representation anymore. Lily argued that because of the statements, it didn’t need to recognize the union. But the NLRB argued that its “successor bar” doctrine precludes Lily from challenging the union’s majority status for a “reasonable period of time,” or at least six months after the first bargaining session. Even if the company could challenge the union the NLRB argued, the statements it cited from employees were “both legally tainted and factually insufficient to prove actual loss of majority support.” The full brief is here.

The protest period for the Mission City Council vote that rejected the latest plan for the Gateway development has passed. The city council, by a 6-2 vote on Aug. 17, rejected the recommendation of the city’s planning commission that it approve a preliminary site plan for the Gateway project. The latest plan included residential units on top of the Walmart that dominated the east end of the more than 16-acre site. FROM OUR SPONSORS: Adding the residential units was an attempt to address some of the concerns about the Walmart building not fitting into the mixed use designation for the property. City officials said that when the city council rejects a planning commission recommendation, the developer has 30 days to challenge the decision in district court. That did not happen. Ironically, the plan that the city council approved in January of this year when Mayor Steven Schowengerdt broke a 4-4 tie would still be valid. That plan does not have the residential on top of the Walmart. The problem for the developer, though, is that the council is not likely to approve any public financing support for the plan. For the latest version, developer Tom Valenti said he would need $31 million in TIF and CID money combined. Those programs use new property and sales tax to pay part of the development cost.

By Theodore Decker The Columbus Dispatch  •  Thursday September 22, 2016 8:52 AM The BB gun that Columbus police say Tyre King carried on the night he died retails for $49.97 at Wal-Mart. The Umarex 40XP Blowback BB Pistol is kept locked behind glass in the sporting-goods section, along with other BB pistols like the Daisy Powerline 415 and the Crosman Double Down. The gun boasts a “blowback metal slide action,” a velocity of 400 feet per second, and a drop-free 20-BB magazine. Tyre, 13, was a suspect in an armed robbery last week when he ran from police in Olde Towne East and was shot and killed by Officer Bryan Mason. Police say he was shot when he pulled the 40XP from his waistband. In an interview with The Dispatch, 19-year-old Demetrius Braxton admitted that he and Tyre were part of a group that committed the earlier robbery. After Tyre’s death, Columbus police pointed out that the 40XP was almost impossible to distinguish from a real pistol. It’s hard to disagree, even when seeing one up close. The eighth-grader’s death has been cited in the ongoing debate over the feasibility of banning similar replica weapons. A councilman in faraway Baltimore, Maryland, introduced legislation Monday calling for such restrictions in his city. “The easiest way to resolve this is to get the replica guns off the streets,” he said, according to The Baltimore Sun. If only that were true. Such proposals — and there are at least two languishing in committee in the Ohio Legislature right now — are feel-good, faux remedies. It is a misguided notion that real firearms still look like the firearms of 50 or even 10 years ago. They just don’t. These days, real firearms can look incredibly fake. You can buy a Walther 9 mm handgun in purple, a Ruger 9 mm in turquoise and a Bersa Thunder .380 in pink. Guns come in woodland camouflage, desert camouflage and pink camouflage. And in the think-you’ve-seen-it-all category, budget manufacturer Hi-Point Firearms recently released a 9 mm handgun with a limited edition “hundred dollar bills” finish. Al Pacino’s character in “Scarface,” Tony Montana, would have carried one of these. Firearms manufacturers began producing many of today’s stylish guns to cater to women, who are the fastest growing sector in shooting sports, said Linda Walker, a firearms instructor and member of the Buckeye Firearms Association. Even if police never encountered these rainbow-colored guns, it is naive to think that a day-glow sticker or orange plastic tip would help officers make the split-second decisions of life and death under every conceivable condition. In the dark. On the run. Under fire. You name it. It’s just not possible. For years, police have come across real guns that have been altered to appear fake and fake guns altered to appear real. A store clerk may not flinch if a robber brandishes a neon, dollar-store squirt gun, but wrap it in black electrician’s tape and the urge to resist becomes more foolhardy than brave. “If someone points a gun at me, I am immediately forced to make a decision,” Walker said. “It’s not something I get to ponder on for the next two minutes.” At the Wal-Mart, I pondered on the 40XP for much longer than two minutes. But big questions, like those surrounding the death of a 13-year-old boy suspected of armed robbery, aren’t answered at a big box store. When I was kid, BB guns looked like the rifles they carried in the Westerns. But kids don’t watch Westerns anymore. Maybe these exact-replica BB guns, some of which are produced by actual firearms manufacturers, appeal to kids because they look like something a grown-up would use. I surprise myself by thinking of Steve Jobs when he called the iPod Touch “training wheels for the iPhone.” BB guns that look like mom’s .380 or dad’s .45. Handguns in teal and pink for the lady shooter. Or, if you’re all about the Benjamins, a handgun covered with images of scattered $100 bills. My Wal-Mart takeaway is not at all what I expected. It is an observation, not an indictment. When it comes to marketing, the gun industry gives Apple a run for its money. tdecker@dispatch.com @Theodore_Decker Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:25 AM, September 22, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> must face a class-action lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico, a U.S. judge said. In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas rejected Wal-Mart's contention that a Michigan pension fund had no standing to lead the case because it had not suffered losses on the retailer's stock. The decision means shareholders can sue Wal-Mart and former Chief Executive Mike Duke as a group over the alleged cover-up of bribery at Wal-Mart de Mexico. This could lead to a larger payout at lower cost than if individual lawsuits were required. Class certification "would enhance judicial economy and efficiency," given that many shareholders had small claims, and "concentrating the claims in defendants' home forum with uniform decisions is desirable," Hickey wrote. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer believes a class action is "not appropriate," and may appeal the certification decision. The market value of Wal-Mart fell by roughly $17 billion over three days in April 2012, after The New York Times published a Pulitzer Prize-winning report saying the retailer paid bribes to Mexican officials for years to speed up store openings. Shareholders said Wal-Mart knew about the scheme as early as 2005, and downplayed it even after learning about the Times' investigation. Wal-Mart had argued that a widely-accepted accounting method prevented the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System from showing it lost money on Wal-Mart stock. But the judge said the pension fund could show losses under another widely-accepted accounting method, and that Wal-Mart failed to show why its preferred method was better. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012, Hickey said. In July, a federal appeals court upheld Hickey's April 2015 dismissal of shareholder claims against Duke, his predecessor Lee Scott, and Wal-Mart' board. A Delaware state judge dismissed similar claims by other shareholders in May. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd represents the Michigan pension fund. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Walmart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162.

GARRIDO The Brownsville Herald An 18-year veteran U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service inspector Tuesday pleaded guilty to charges he masterminded an immigrant smuggling ring based at Gateway International Bridge. Jose Flores Lopez, 58, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to three counts each of bribery, providing fraudulent documents, transportation of undocumented immigrants and one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants. Lopez is scheduled to appear in October before U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle for sentencing. He is being held without bond in the Cameron County Jail. Juan Jose Rodriguez, a 14-year veteran INS inspector at Gateway and four alleged accomplices still face charges in the investigation, dubbed Operation Marquis Express by FBI and INS investigators. Lopez was arrested May 16 after what authorities said was a four-year investigation. The investigation targeted INS inspectors thought to be providing fraudulent documents to undocumented immigrants, Rosalie Savage, an FBI official, said. Lopez and Rodriguez were arrested in connection with an alleged smuggling ring that had operated in Brownsville for five years, Savage said. According to authorities, the smuggling ring helped hundreds of Mexican and Central American immigrants enter illegally into the United States at the Gateway Bridge. It is believed that the group charged between $300 and $500 for services. We believe Lopez facilitated the smuggling of aliens by accepting bribes and providing fraudulent documents, Savage said. He took advantage of his position as an INS inspector. Lopez appeared June 14 before U.S. Magistrate Felix Recio and was denied bond. Rodriguez was arrested June 11 by FBI agents for allegedly accepting bribes, conspiring to smuggle immigrants into the United States and providing fraudulently obtained documents. In a June 14 hearing, Recio set bond for Rodriguez at $50,000. Rodriguez posted bail and was released. He is to appear before Tagle Aug. 6 for jury selection. Also arrested in connection with the smuggling ring were Juan Jose Ayala, 53, of Brownsville, Candelario Perales-Jaramillo, 48, of Matamoros, Elio Salinas-Pequeo, 33, a permanent resident alien of Brownsville, and Gloria Paulina Alvarez, 39, of Brownsville. They were charged with conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into the United States. All but Perales-Jaramillo were granted bonds by Recio.

TV Superstore: NBC orders nine more episodes by Dan Snierson • @dansnierson Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Trae Patton/NBC) Superstore Posted September 23 2016 — 6:20 PM EDT See also 'Superstore': America Ferrera on ad libbing, Amy and Jonah's future WATCH: America Ferrera, Lauren Ash talk the 'Superstore' Olympics ep Pick-up in aisle 9! NBC has ordered nine additional episodes of Superstore, the network announced on Friday. That brings the total for the current season — the show’s second — to 22 episodes. In its first season, the workplace comedy starring America Ferrera as an employee at a Wal-Mart-like store was NBC’s highest-rated new comedy in several years and averaged 6.6 million viewers per episode in Live+7. Last night’s season 2 premiere notched a 1.5 rating among 18-to-49-year-olds and tallied 5.45 million viewers. Its lead-out, the new Ted Danson-Kristen Bell afterlife comedy The Good Place, was in that same ballpark, with a 1.4 rating and 5.25 million viewers. NBC ran a post-Olympics episode of the seires that earned 11.1 million viewers and a 3.7 in adults 18-49. “We’re very proud of ‘Superstore’ and we were so happy to see fantastic viewing levels with the preview during the Olympics as well as last night’s ratings in its new Thursday anchor time period,” NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke said in a statement. “This is a show our audience loves and, paired with The Good Place, which our audience also loves, we think we have a sensational new comedy block to build this season.” Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories 'Pitch' writers go behind the scenes of rain delay episode Stephen Colbert spoofs Colorado marijuana bars with fake 'Chronic' ad 'Walking Dead': Jeffrey Dean Morgan likes to infuriate Andrew Lincoln Stephen Colbert thinks 'post-truth' is a ripoff of 'truthiness' How Dawn Richard made her best, most visionary album yet Vince Vaughn asks kids what they're thankful for on 'Ellen' Seth Meyers examines Trump's rocky transition Photo Galleries The Evolution of 'Live!'

She’s also not attracting any grass-roots GOP support, since she’s labeled Republicans “enemies.” Fact is, her personal history and other factors “make it difficult for her to appeal to enough voters to lead her opponent by 10 points, let alone 50.” Media critic: Don’t Call Rioters ‘Protesters’ Alex Griswold at Mediaite takes issue with news reports following the Charlotte, NC, police shooting that described violent rioters and looters as “protesters.” Says Griswold: “There are thousands of protests in America every year, all of which manage to be nonviolent . . . None of them involved throwing people into a fire. Heck, none of them managed to set anything on fire.” At work, he suspects, is an attempt by reporters to “stay neutral” and not show any “moral condemnation.” But in trying “to please those of all political stripes, the media ended up misinforming their consumers.” Those “who looted that Walmart and destroyed stores were not ‘protesters,’ and if they had done so in a context divorced from politics, media outlets would have the stones to say so.” Establishment pundit: Please Ignore the Debates Every four years, voters and the news media make the same mistake: thinking debates “are an especially valuable way of helping the voters make that fateful decision.” This riles Elizabeth Drew, who first started covering US politics in 1959. She complains in The Washington Post that “the buildup of the debates” — especially next Monday night’s — “has exploded beyond all reason.” In her view, debates “test qualities that have virtually nothing to do with governing.” Worst of all, “the night usually goes to the deliverer of the best one-liner. It’s what’s most anticipated and most remembered.” She’s also peeved by “the media’s determination to declare a ‘winner’ ” — even though “these aren’t real debates” so “there’s no way to score them.” These debates, she concludes, “make a mockery of our democratic system.” From the right: Obama’s Chemical Nightmare It was one of the rare times President Obama was right — and “he almost certainly wishes he weren’t,” writes Noah Rothman at Commentary. Three years ago this month, Obama “explained to the American people why the United States must use military force to punish Bashar al-Assad for deploying chemical weapons in his nation’s civil war.” Because, he said then, “if we fail to act,” Assad “will see no reason to stop.” Now the Pentagon has disclosed that US troops came under attack by ISIS with chemical weapons possibly stolen from Assad’s stockpile. So that speech was “grimly portentous not because of what [Obama] warned but because of how he disregarded his own advice.” Transit wonk: Amtrak’s Imperiled Success Story Amtrak’s success, Acela, is nearly two decades old, and its trains are being replaced, to the tune of $2.45 billion. But Nicole Gelinas, in the Washington Examiner, says Acela still “isn’t the triumph that it could have been — and it may even turn into defeat.” For one thing, the New York-Boston and New York-DC service isn’t as speedy as originally advertised; for another, the service’s “high price isn’t something to brag about,” even if it does help alleviate airport crowding. But to seriously improve its DC round-trip service requires a new Hudson River tunnel, and no one has the money to pay for it. “So when Acela riders pass through [New Jersey], they should give a thought to how new trains won’t be of much use if there’s no tunnel through which to ride.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under 2016 presidential election ,  amtrak ,  barack obama ,  charlotte ,  chemical weapons ,  debates ,  editorial ,  hillary clinton ,  riots Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Corruption lands at doorstep of governor who vowed cleanup Read Next Corruption lands at doorstep of governor who vowed cleanup Most Popular This Week 1 The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House 2 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 3 Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed 4 Kellyanne Conway tells The Post she feels 'blessed’ over White House gig 5 Insiders say Donald Trump is 'disgusted' by Chris Christie 6 Scenes from the liberal meltdown Share Selection Columnists Rich Lowry Liberals who claim history’s on their side got a cold wake-up call Karol Markowicz Stop blaming Trump for every anti-Semite that comes along John Crudele This list of topics is the quickest way to anger your liberal friends SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Editorials NYC scores big by hanging on to charter-school visionary Eva Moskowitz De Blasio can’t seem to get it right with the homeless Obama’s advice to Trump: Do as I didn’t Today's Cover Browse covers archive Trending Now on NYPost.com 200,451 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 70,938 Clinton gets mixed reaction after going makeup-free for speech 59,572 This list of topics is the quickest way to anger your liberal friends More Stories pagesix 'Kimmy Schmidt' actress reportedly commits suicide in Peru hotel Now On Decider New Netflix Documentary Goes Deep On The Greatest X-Rated Movies Of All-Time nypost Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide?

One of the car break-ins took place at the Leland Walmart.  "The other day they took between 15 and 18 motor vehicle reports that came in over night," explained Lt. Jeremy Humphries with the Leland PD.  Police reports show most of the cars were actually unlocked, while few reports do show forced entry into vehicles.  Cash, credit cards, electronics even ID's were stolen out of cars in residential and retail areas. The Leland Police Department took to Facebook Thursday to remind residents to keep valuables out of plain sight, with the following post: There have been several reports today of items taken from unlocked cars and trucks. Please, don't leave valuables in plain sight and ALWAYS lock your doors. Leaving your vehicles unlocked is an open invitation to thieves to steal. "At least put them out of sight to where they are not readily accessible to someone who would be walking by a vehicle, who would peer inside, see that as an opportunity to grab something quick and leave with it," Humphries stated.

Just after finding out about the Google WiFi and its $129 price, Google Home’s $129 price, and the $69 price of the 4K “Chromecast Ultra,” we now have our first clue of the price of Xiaomi’s previously-announced Mi Box Android TV. According to someone who spotted one of the shelf at Walmart, it will run for $69… The Mi Box features Android 6.0 Marshmallow, a quad-core ARM processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of expandable (via USB) storage, and an HDMI port which can output 4K video at 60FPS. The box will ship with a slim remote that includes a microphone for voice commands (a la Apple TV) and Xiaomi will also be selling a controller for gaming. Just a couple of weeks ago, a report suggested that the box would be coming at some point in October for a price less than $100. This $69 price tag is pretty believable, and a picture like this — with 3 Mi Box units just sitting on a shelf in their original packaging at Walmart — would be pretty difficult to fake. On this box, we learn that the Box comes with $76 in offers and a free HDMI cable. I’m about to head out to my local Walmart and see if I get lucky enough to nab one. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69.

The price? $69. Not bad at all – great, even. Xiaomi has not indicated when it plans to release the device specifically, but if this is any indication, you can probably guess “pretty soon.” So, it may not be a bad idea to call up your local Walmart and see if they made the same mistake – this could be more widespread than we know.
