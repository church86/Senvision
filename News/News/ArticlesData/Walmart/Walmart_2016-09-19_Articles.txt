You go on a quick shoplifting spree to drown your sorrows in bananas and beer. At least, those were the moves by a would-be ladykiller at the Walmart Supercenter, 8915 N. Allen Road in Peoria. “We hear some crazy things,” says Leslee Wright, a corporate spokesperson for the retail giant. “But this is the first we’ve heard of something like this.” That says a lot in terms of Walmart weirdness, documented by website after website, testifying to America’s curious fascination with the place. Consider the 300-pound man who in 2012 stripped in the parking lot of the Exton, Pa., Walmart before waltzing in, putting on a pair of socks and plodding around the store, babbling as other customers scrambled out of his path. After spitting on a security guard, the mountain of nakedness was restrained by cops, who probably wanted Silkwood showers afterward. Then there was the woman in Tulsa, Okla., who in 2011 was caught stealing and cooking ingredients to make meth, though not until after six hours of brewing her batch. Remarkably, she’s just one several people who have tried to turn the aisles of Walmart into their personal meth lab. If this were legal like home-brew kits, Walmart could make a mint.  And there were the two Walmart employees who stole $45,000 from their own workplace in Prescott, Ariz. One blew his half on a Toyota Supra. The other planned to fund her dream of having a sex change into a man, but police arrested them before she could get the operation. We won’t get into the endless accounts of crude and lewd love stories that play out in Walmart’s aisles, only to end in the back of squad cars.Though not for the squeamish, the tales make you wonder: is Walmart itself some sort of twisted aphrodisiac? Perhaps the company should somehow bottle itself — “Eau du Wally World”?— and compete with high-end perfumes. Or sell T-shirts, “Walmart is for Lovers.” I can think of one guy who’d buy one. With that, we turn to back to 10:30 a.m. Sept. 11. While much of Peoria gathered at church, one gent sauntered into Walmart, pockets stuffed with cash, ready to get his groove on. The man — about 30 years old, 5-foot-8, 250 pounds — approached several female employees and “offered to pay them for sex,” according to a Peoria police report. Why did the randy Romeo chose Walmart? Think of all its ads, for years touting “falling prices” and “rollbacks” and “always low prices.” Maybe he figured he could get no better deal elsewhere. Or maybe he has a thing for blue vests. Beats me. So much of this is mind-blowing, especially the part where he actually located a Walmart sales associate. Several, actually. Wow. Aside from the checkout lanes, I don’t think I’ve glimpsed a Walmart employee since 1987. Anyway, the Walmart employees later described the creep’s come-ons to a security officer. He reviewed store video and spotted a man with the same description pushing a cart through the store — alone, of course. Into his cart, he plopped a stack of blanks DVDs (retail value: $49). What did he plan to do with those? I don’t want to know. He also grabbed some bananas ($2 worth) and Guinness beer ($6.88). Is that a thing, together? The internet lists multiple recipes for banana bread made with Guinness. For the Walmart lech, maybe that’s his way to dull the pain of an aching heart or whatever. He pushed the cart of items out of the store, scot-free. His next stop? Perhaps to charm the ladies at Target. Whatever the case, he returned to Walmart about 1:15 p.m. At the deli, he grabbed a “cup of chicken” (value: $2.50), then scooted away again, police said. Walmart security contacted Peoria police, who are investigating, including a possible license-plate number. They’re looking for his vehicle, which is yellow, perhaps his worst crime of all. In the meantime, ladies, if a new guy in a yellow car tells you he loves you, be careful — especially if his breath smells like bananas, beer and/or chicken. PHIL LUCIANO is a Journal Star columnist.

The deal is seen as a way for Walmart to increase their online presence. Jet.com and Walmart will operate as separate brands, while sharing technology and talent across both companies. As part of the deal, the founder of Jet.com will join Walmart’s board as executive vice president of Walmart and president of Walmart eCommerce, overseeing both Walmart.com and Jet.com. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the addition of Jet.com complements Walmart’s goal of finding ways to help customers save money. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Local Antique Store Celebrates 30 Years in Business A Center For Healing Private Wounds Help for Women When They Need It The Basics of Carbon Monoxide Safety New Playground Coming To Traverse City The Power of Grandmothers State News Northern Michigan Personnel Head South to Help Battle Wildfires Signs Along Snowmobile Trails in U.P.

It’s the company that comes to mind when I think about cheap stuff. It’s the company that comes to mind when I think about retirement jobs I would like to have that do not involve a blue vest. It is even, sometimes, the company that comes to mind when I consider that my daily exercise quotient has been met thanks to the 2.5-mile one-way stroll from my car in the northeast corner of the parking lot to the southeast corner of the store where they hide the air filters. So I was pretty impressed when Wal-Mart jumped ahead of other retailers by offering an experimental app that allowed me to scan the bar codes as I placed merchandise in my cart, theoretically completing the self-checkout process along the way so all I had to do at the register was insert a debit card. I was delighted that the Edmond Wal-Mart was a test site. I was not delighted with the Scan & Go app, though, which didn’t always know what those black-and-white lines meant. The workaround took longer than the standard checkout process and Scan & Go went. But three years ago Wal-Mart tested same-day delivery of groceries. Orders were placed online, and for $10 Wal-Mart delivered within a prearranged time slot. That was popular in San Francisco and San Jose, but when the retailer took the idea to Denver in 2014, it discovered shoppers would rather pick up the order at their own convenience rather than sitting at home waiting for the Wal-Mart Man. Wal-Mart To Go finally made it to Edmond, and one busy weekend my wife, Betsey, gave it a try. It worked a lot better than Scan & Go. The only drawback was that everything gets sacked in plastic bags and our typical weekly order requires 673 of them. We really prefer our reusables. Note to Wal-Mart: Pack our stuff in reusable bags and we’ll trade you our empty reusables from last week when we pick up the order. Ordering groceries online and picking them up later makes us feel pretty hip and tech-savvy. A tad disloyal to our former grocer, but we don’t have to drag the kids through the store anymore and that trumps loyalty. The funny thing about Wal-Mart To Go is that it isn’t innovative at all; it’s a page from the past that Nancy Walton, Sam Walton’s mother, would have known well. Before Sept. 6, 1916, grocery stores were not self-serve affairs. A shopping list was drafted and taken to the local grocer, who filled the order for the customer. If you asked for crackers you got whatever brand of crackers your grocer carried. The same was true for coffee and flour and just about everything else on your list; there was no comparing ingredients or buying the cheaper, off-brand corn starch or the high-priced premium brand. Corn starch was just corn starch. But Clarence Saunders changed all that 100 years ago when he opened the first Piggly Wiggly. The innovative new store at 79 Laurel Ave. in Memphis, Tennessee, allowed shoppers to browse aisles stacked with thousands of products, see the prices, and make their own selections. It was a great day for shoppers, even if it was a bad day for career grocery clerks.

"The women that are different in some ways from their "soccer mom" and "security mom" sisters of those earlier election cycles. They are slightly older than soccer moms (in their 40s and 50s) and are juggling another set of problems — how to pay for college for their kids, how to take care of their elderly parents. They are also less upscale. Lacking college degrees, Democratic pollster Celinda Lake calls them "Wal-Mart moms" and "Wal-Mart grandmas" and says they are not so much undecided as conflicted in making their choice this year." The “Wal-Mart mom” is well defined in the above statement. I also know “soccer mom," "tiger mom," and "helicopter mom.” But what is “Security mom”? Google search shows mosaic album of women under the heading of ”Security woman,” but it doesn’t give definitions of the word. Is it associated with earlier Obama-care initiative? Is the word still current? meaning contemporary-english share|improve this question edited Sep 20 at 20:24 Sven Yargs 75.3k14131306 asked Oct 30 '14 at 0:07 Yoichi Oishi♦ 31.4k69261597 1   Why is it always the mothers and never the fathers who get "epitheted"? – Mari-Lou A Oct 30 '14 at 7:15 1   @Mari-LouA Interesting question, I'm sure it's partly because women generally take the lead in dealing with children and their activities, but it also seems a bit dismissive of their motivations. Apparently the Chinese have Wolf Dads BTW, I'm a bit sorry I googled "tiger dad". – Spehro Pefhany Oct 30 '14 at 7:42      @Mari-Lou A. I had the same question and was attempted to add it to this question, though I didn't. – Yoichi Oishi♦ Oct 30 '14 at 8:30      @Medica. Thank you for adding the source of the quote. I was surprised to find it was from Time September 9, 2008 issue. I was also amazed that you were able to locate such an old article. It looks a splended feat. Could you do it by just putting several key words? – Yoichi Oishi♦ Oct 30 '14 at 8:44 2   If you search Bing or Google, etc for a portion of a direct quote, you can usually get a link to the source, which is what I labeled it in my answer. To find the Biden quote, just search for security mom Biden. Third, you can search Google Books for a phrase you are interested in, such as security mom. – pazzo Oct 30 '14 at 13:21 add a comment |  1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 7 down vote accepted A security mom is a mom whose main concern with regard to a political candidate (and by extension, his or her political party) is which one will do the most to protect her children from terrorism. In this case the preceeding paragraph refers to what the writer means by security mom. ...The white female vote was crucial to George W. Bush's victory in 2004, a year that was marked by the post-9/11 political emergence of the so-called security mom — a term, interestingly enough, coined by Joe Biden... Source Another article contains the quote by Biden: In the post September 11 world, however, the soccer mom began to seem an anachronism. Democrat senator Joe Biden blamed his party's defeat in the 2002 midterms on its failure to listen to women. The agenda now was... "not schools, not prescription drugs. It was 'what are you doing to protect my kids against terrorists? Soccer moms are security moms now." As for your two other questions, Is it associated with earlier Healthcare initiative? Is the word still current? Nothing to do with healthcare. Yes, it is still current. Such books as Women and the White House: Gender, Popular Culture, and Presidential Politics, published in 2012, use the term. share|improve this answer edited Oct 30 '14 at 13:24 answered Oct 30 '14 at 0:22 pazzo 1,385321 add a comment |  Your Answer   draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

Erika Burch and her husband, Robert Burch, witnessed the incident Monday afternoon at a Cleveland Walmart. She said her husband turned to her and asked, "Do you see what that guy is doing to that little girl?" Erika Burch said the man was "dragging this little girl by the hair." She said the little girl was saying, "Please stop. I promise I won't do it again. Please stop!" That's when Erika Burch took several photos of the man and the girl. "He dragged that baby around the store," Robert Burch said. Erika Burch said she told the man to let go of the girl's hair, but he told her to mind her own business. Erika Burch said she called police. "Very concerned for the well-being of the child," Cleveland police Chief Darrel Broussard said. Police said they are working with Child Protective Services on the investigation. CPS told KPRC 2 that they are checking to see if there are other children in the home and if the man in the photo has a "pattern of behavior." Erika Burch's Facebook post with the photos has been shared more than 18,000 times with many people expressing their concern for the child. "This is so sad. I feel horrible for that poor baby girl. I hope this gets investigated further," Tracy C. wrote. "No matter what a child does, you never pull them by their hair," Luis Z. wrote. While other people did not agree with how the child is being punished, they say people should not be too quick to judge the situation. "While I do not agree with his methods I'm not judging him either. The child probably needed some discipline and he made his choice," Don T. said. No charges have been filed.

According to an account provided by Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez, shortly after 8 a.m. Friday, a uniformed officer discharged his weapon, striking Ramon L. Martinez, 43, of Newark, in an “extremity.” Martinez was subsequently taken to an area hospital where he was listed in stable condition, according to Suarez. The officer involved was also taken to an area hospital for observation and later released, the prosecutor said. Martinez has been charged with eluding, receiving stolen property and shoplifting. An alleged accomplice, Diego C. Dosreis, 28, also of Newark, has been charged with receiving stolen property. The shooting is being investigated by the prosecutor’s office, “which is standard practice for police-involved shootings,” according to Suarez. No further information, including what type of merchandise had allegedly been taken from the Walmart, was released by the prosecutor. But Kearny Mayor Alberto Santos told The Observer that, according to what he has learned about the incident, a uniformed on-duty Kearny police officer happened to be near the Walmart when a police radio alert about the incident was broadcast. Santos said the officer then responded to the Walmart where he reportedly spotted a vehicle driven by Martinez – reportedly fleeing the crime scene – in the Walmart parking lot. At that point, Santos said, the officer reportedly fired his weapon at the fleeing suspect. According to one police source familiar with the case, the officer fired three times. One bullet hit the suspect’s right arm and two shots pierced his left arm, the source said. Nonetheless, the suspect still managed to drive away from the scene, the source said. At some time a bit later in the day, however, police – reportedly aided by getting a description of the getaway car and the suspect – tracked Martinez to a location in Newark where, according to the mayor, he was attempting to get his vehicle repaired. The suspect didn’t go to a hospital for treatment of his wounds because he feared that the hospital would – as required by law – report his gunshot injuries to the police, Santos said. It was apparently at this time, after officers corralled him, that Martinez was taken to an area hospital. It could not be readily learned how the second suspect is tied to the crime. Both suspects are presumed to be in Hudson County Jail, pending court action. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave pending a completion of the prosecutor’s review of the matter. The officer is reportedly a KPD veteran with prior military service.

Martinez, 43, of Newark, appears in court via videolink. (MICHAELANGELO CONTE JOURNAL PHOTO) Print Email Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal By Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal Follow on Twitter on September 20, 2016 at 7:35 AM, updated September 20, 2016 at 7:36 AM comments The Newark man shot by a police officer Friday in a Walmart parking lot was behind the wheel of a stolen vehicle, police say. Wearing a sling on his left arm, Ramon L. Martinez, 43, of Lexington Avenue, made his first court appearance on the charges today in Central Judicial Processing Court in Jersey City from Hudson County jail in Kearny. He is charged with eluding police by failing to stop his vehicle after receiving a signal from the officer to stop, and placing the officer at risk of death or serious injury, the criminal complaint states. Martinez, who court officials said has 28 prior arrests, is also charged with receiving stolen property — the 2012 Honda he was driving at the time of the incident. The officer fired multiple shots at him in the Walmart parking lot, striking him in the arm through the windshield. He also was charged with shoplifting, the complaint says. Authorities say Martinez had shoplifted at the Walmart and was fleeing the scene when the officer arrived and commanded him to stop. Police say witnesses and video surveillance footage shows he "eluded a uniformed Kearny police officer after receiving multiple commands to stop his vehicle while creating a risk of injury to the officer," the criminal complaint says. Martinez, who had a passenger in the vehicle, fled the parking lot but was arrested hours later in Newark by Kearny police. The passenger, Diego C. Dosreis, 28, also of Newark, was charged with receiving stolen property. The officer was not injured but was evaluated at a local hospital, which is standard procedure, Mayor Al Santos said. The mayor added that the officer had been nearby at the time of the incident and responded immediately. "The suspect is believed to have been a fleeing shoplifter and he threatened the officer with his vehicle," Santos said Friday. "The officer had to respond. He shot at the suspect because he was threatened by the suspect's vehicle as he tried to get away from the police officer trying to apprehend him." The shooting is being reviewed by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, as is the case in all instances when a law enforcement officer discharges his weapon in Hudson County. Martinez's bail was set at $40,000, cash only. Martinez mentioned that his arm hurt but said little else.

Meaning that the Halloween spirit is looming over Walgreens — sometimes even off-season — and dollar stores across America, putting Walmart’s shoddy selection to shame for yet another year in a row. You can almost guarantee that this is how into the Halloween spirit Walmart is every year. Yeah. Just the ONE aisle. [Image by Jo Naylor | Flickr | CC BY 2.0] That’s right! Walmart. Once the envy of the Halloween decorations world; one would have thought that a big-box store such as Walmart would have put more effort into turning several aisles into a riveting Halloween shopping experience, expanding their ghosts and goblins section for the consumer. But sadly, they’re no longer committed to the holiday. Yes, it’s already a “plus” going to the dollar store anyway for just about anything you need, and because of that, the Halloween spirit goes a long way there. And if there is a dollar store closer to you than the nearest Walmart, save yourself a trip and hit it up first and you’ll be overwhelmed by their vast selection and “killer” savings, because you’re guaranteed to find things you never thought existed. And unlike Walmart — while they brag about being the “everything store,” they hardly have anything at all compared to — not just one, but two or more dollars stores. You can hit up Dollar General, Family Dollar, or any other dollar store you’ve probably been too afraid to enter, before the spooky season compels you to do so. A woman walks towards a Dollar General. She won’t be the same when she comes out! [Photo by Charles Krupa/AP Images] And really, in comparison, look at the size of that Walmart aisle. You would think they would go all the way for the season. You’ll be lucky if your Walmart has more than one aisle for spooky stuff. After all, the Halloween shopping life spans is just for a month and a half each year. If you still have doubts about the dollar stores, let The Consumer Queen set you straight. Even she throws a little “love” Walmart’s way. “You’ll still save lots of money over buying at Walmart and Target!” That still leaves CVS and Walgreens, who excel with their selection. Only the frequent shopper would know if they’re all carrying the same stuff, in which case they can stock up on backups and sometimes they’re even cheaper than that uninspired aisle of overpriced Walmart items. Walgreens has Nightmare Before Christmas stuff at the end of the aisle. Can you imagine what you’ll find on the aisle itself? [Image by Mike Mozart | Flickr | CC BY 2.0 ] Look, even Target is acceptable. They have a small section of dollar items when you walk in, which is worth checking out. Shoppers are always guaranteed to find some interesting and various off-kilter buys for the season. But for being such a small store, Walgreens has got the “goods,” and there’s more incentive to shop there because in general, it just feels good. Most Walmarts are sporadically unorganized and at times the buying experience, in general, almost feels like a chore. Similar to putting money in a snack machine at a public place, where you have to cripple your hands just trying to get something in your stomach. The main difference between Walmart and all of the other stores during Halloween, is that Walmart is more about convenience, which they certainly have down to a science, but because of their high-volume attitude, they’re hardly friendly. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjZpmnjwJxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> And yes, Halloween is about chills, spookiness, and scary stuff, but it doesn’t look like they were having much fun when they put up the displays. There’s a disconnect between the fun that’s supposed to haunt an impressive Halloween section, to the stressful experience at the check-out line where there are never enough people to scan purchases, and even less people to help those in the self-check out line. Most everyone going to a Walmart isn’t necessarily looking forward to it. *walking past Walmart's Halloween section* LOOK CHRISTMAS! — Jose Hurtado (@ActorTwin) September 8, 2016 So there you have it. Walmart doesn’t have as much to offer as some of the other mentioned stores, so don’t waste any time and grab up some Halloween goodies before someone else does. What are your thoughts? Do you feel that Halloween just isn’t happening at your local Walmart?

Kohl's to hire at least 69,000 for holiday season work Kohl's plans to hire more than 69,000 workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide. The department store operator said it started hiring in August for the holiday season and expects most jobs to be filled by the middle of November. Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. Wal-Mart completes Jet.com purchase Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world's largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com's “smart technology” that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. Uber to open Michigan research center Ride-hailing giant Uber will open a research center in metropolitan Detroit by year's end to accommodate increased work with automotive industry suppliers and technology companies involved in autonomous vehicle development. Sherif Marakby, Uber's vice president for global vehicle development, announced the investment Monday at a conference being hosted in suburban Detroit by professional engineering association SAE International. Marakby, who joined Uber in April after 25 years at Ford, declined to say where the center will be located or how many people it will employ but did say it would open in a few months. Outside California, San Francisco-based Uber has a large presence in Pittsburgh, where last week it began operating about 20 fully autonomous Ford Fusion hybrids on its most heavily traveled routes in that city. Uber has a partnership with the city's Carnegie Mellon University, which has a well-respected robotics program. — Wire reports More Business Cozy retirement?

The hefty price tag shows how heavily Walmart is willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. While Walmart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands, Walmart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. As part of the deal, which was announced in early August, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and Walmart.com, and will report to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Lore will serve as executive vice president at Walmart and president and CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce business in the U.S. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. As part of the stock portion of the deal, Lore received 3.55 million shares of restricted Walmart common stock to be paid over five years. The exact value depends on Walmart’s share price. But based on Monday’s closing price of $72.09, the shares would have a current worth of nearly $256 million. Jet’s pricing technology is built on an algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart as well as how far the desired products are from the shoppers’ home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. Analysts say that the deal still won’t enable Walmart to catch up to online leader Amazon.com in sales, but will help narrow the gap and should widen the distance between Walmart and other online rivals. For Jet.com, which had been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, being owned by Walmart should accelerate its path to profitability. In a Wal-Mart blog post on Monday, McMillon wrote, “Wal-Mart and Jet.com obsess about saving customers time and money. By joining forces, we’ll be better at doing both, creating seamless shopping from app to site to store.” On McMillon’s Instagram account was an image of Jet’s purple T-shirt with a note saying, “I’ve been waiting a month to put on this shirt.” Tags:  Walmart Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Volkswagen to shed 30,000 jobs, cutting costs after scandal November 18, 2016, 6:53 am Volkswagen announced plans Friday to cut 30,000 jobs in a wide-ranging restructuring of its namesake brand as it tries to recover from a scandal over cars rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests.

(KWQC) – Rock Island City Council accepted the resignation of City Manager Thomas Thomas Monday night. The news comes less than two weeks after Walmart backed out on building a store in the city, and less than a week after he turned in his resignation letter. Thomas says it was odd sitting down for his final council meeting as Rock Island’s city manager Monday night. “Realizing I’ll never see those same faces again, have those conversations again,” Thomas said. The city approved giving Thomas half a year’s salary in severance pay, on top of other benefits. “This, I think, is the best way to go, everybody parts on good terms and good ways,” Rock Island Mayor Dennis Pauley said. This raised concerns with some people in the community during the meeting. “You all continue to throw the tax payers money down the drain, that $77,000 should be a down payment on that $15 plus million,” a Rock Island citizen said during Monday night’s meeting. Some noted how soon the announcement came after Walmart decided not to come to Rock Island. “Mr. Thomas you’ve been here five years, I don’t know how much of this is your responsibility, but I think you’re taking the brunt of the load it only came up when Walmart decided not to come,” another Rock Island citizen said during the meeting. Thomas says after five years with the city, that has nothing to do with his decision to move on. “Being a city manager, that’s part of it, you get credit when things go good and you get the negatives when things go bad that’s part of it,” Thomas said. “I reached a five-year mark and I thought we’d accomplished a good body of work and that’s when I started thinking about different opportunities in that time.” Pauley says he has enjoyed working next to Thomas. “We wish Mr. Thomas nothing but the best in his future endeavors he came here five years ago and I think everything he has done has been in the best interest of the city,” Pauley said. Thomas says he hopes to see the progress in the city of Rock Island continue. “They’re passionate about the city, they’re passionate about their wards, I can be dealing with and alderman on a Sunday morning while I’m at church or a Saturday night because they’re passionate about issues that are going on in this community,” Thomas said. Thomas’ last day as city manager is Tuesday, Sept. 20. He says he is in the process of looking for another job as a city manager somewhere else Pauley says Public Works Director Randy Tweet will serve as the interim city manager until they find a replacement.

Read today's eNewspaper News Maryland State trooper justified in fatally shooting man in Cecil County last year, prosecutors find Tim PrudenteContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Prosecutors cleared a state trooper with shooting to death a man last year outside Walmart A Maryland state trooper was justified in fatally shooting a 30-year-old man last year during a struggle outside a Wal-Mart in Cecil County, prosecutors said. The Cecil County state's attorney's office cleared Trooper Daryl Brackett, 29, in the shooting death of Charles Hall of North East in August 2015. "The state finds no criminal wrongdoing by Trooper Brackett, and we consider this matter closed," Deputy State's Attorney Steven Trostle wrote in a letter dated Nov. 15, 2015. It was obtained Monday by The Baltimore Sun through a Maryland Public Information Act request. State police said they would not comment on the matter, citing a pending lawsuit. The agency did not discuss the nature of the suit. Brackett told investigators he was patrolling the North East Plaza shopping center on Aug. 21, 2015, when he saw Hall and pulled up, according to a synopsis of the interview, also obtained through the Public Information Act request. Cecil Co. State's Attorney taken into custody in Ocean City for alleged disorderly conduct, indecent exposure Jessica Anderson Edward D.

Rollins III, of North East, Cecil County State's Attorney, was taken into custody and then released without charges, Ocean City police said in a statement. Police officers were called about 4 p.m. on Wednesday to the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau Hotel after receiving reports of a nude... (Jessica Anderson) Brackett said he ran Hall's name and found an open warrant, then approached Hall as the man was loading items into his car. Hall "started fumbling in his pockets for his keys and jumped in his car," Brackett told investigators. He said he blocked the car door and tried to pull Hall out. He said Hall was trying to put the car into drive as he was ordering him out. Brackett said he hit the man's arms to break Hall's grip on the steering wheel. Brackett told investigators the two men struggled and the trooper pulled out his gun. He told investigators that Hall grabbed for the weapon and he "felt the car take off at a high rate of speed and felt his legs drag."

(WJZ) Caption Third defendant to appear in court for murder of Arnesha Bowers The third defendant in the murder of 16-year-old Arnesha Bowers is due to appear in court today. (WJZ) The third defendant in the murder of 16-year-old Arnesha Bowers is due to appear in court today. (WJZ) "Trp. Brackett pointed his gun at Hall and just before Hall tried to reach up and grab the gun again, Trp. Brackett fired one shot and then punched out again and fired another shot," investigators wrote in the synopsis. Brackett said he put the car in park. He said he heard Hall's wife yelling from behind, calling him a "murderer" and accusing him of shooting an unarmed man. Brackett told investigators he "waited for backup to arrive before he could focus his attention on medical treatment for Hall because he was in fear and wanted the scene to be secure." Hall died in the parking lot. His wife could not be reached Monday. Brackett, a trooper for nearly four years, retired from the state police in May. "I just wasn't able to go back to work," he told The Baltimore Sun on Monday. "I have death threats come to me and my family. … It's just tough, and you combine everything that's happened to me, it's not like you can sleep at night. It's not like you don't have nightmares." Brackett said he served six years in the Army and was deployed to Iraq in 2011. He said the shooting last year worsened his post-traumatic stress disorder. "There's been a lot of speculation about what I should have done," Brackett said. "I was fighting with him for over a minute, trying to pull him out of the car, and then he launches the car and tries to slam me." Brackett said he had no other option. "If I had a Taser, I would have used it," he said. "It probably would have kept him alive." After a shooting, state police policy requires a trooper to "render aid within his level of training." In a review of the incident, state police Sgt. David Sexton watched security and dashboard camera footage from Brackett's vehicle and wrote that the trooper "does not appear to provide any medical or life saving techniques at the time and it is several minutes before an off duty deputy who is an EMT arrives and assists the troopers." Sexton noted that Brackett can be seen "going back to Hall, who is in distress and incapacitated, and he seems to be talking to him and using his radio." An internal affairs investigation was conducted to determine if Brackett followed police rules and policies. The findings of that investigation are confidential under state law. "There's a hundred-plus people in the parking lot screaming at me," Brackett told The Sun. "By the time it took me to secure everything and clear my weapon and move on to render aid, he had no pulse." Medical examiners found Hall had heroin and cocaine in his system. Trostle, the deputy state's attorney, said Brackett knew of the open warrant against Hall and was therefore justified in attempting to arrest him. Trostle said the finding was based in part on a review of the dashboard camera video, the toxicology report and the fact that Hall's DNA was found on Brackett's gun. "The car lunged forward approximately 6 feet, throwing Trooper Brackett off balance, and creating a clear danger to both Trooper Brackett and citizens walking in the parking lot," Trostle wrote "It is clear that Trooper Brackett reasonably feared for his own safety, and/or the safety of citizens who were in the parking lot." tprudente@baltsun.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Shootings Maryland Public Information Act Cecil County motorcycle crash kills one, injures another Md. state trooper fatally shoots suspect in North East Suspects sought in Elkton fatal shooting Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 48°

So far, they seem to be paying off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 19, 2016 at 6:06PM Image Source: Wal-Mart.   What happened Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) took its latest step to reinvent itself by filing a patent for a self-driving shopping cart last week. The world's largest retailer has patented a technology that will allow customers to summon shopping carts with their phones and use them hands-free. The carts will also guide customers through the store to the items on their shopping list, and return themselves to a station in the parking lot, saving on customer and employee labor. The company also hopes the carts can help save further on labor by assisting with moving and checking inventory and retrieving other merchandise. The robotic shopping cart is just the company's latest innovation -- it's also made steps to get drones approved for delivery and merchandise checking in the warehouse, and rolled out hundreds of kiosks in store parking lots where customers can pick up groceries they've ordered online. Does it matter? Wal-Mart needs to stay at the forefront of technology as it competes with Amazon.com and the rest of retail. While a self-driving shopping cart may not match the convenience of e-commerce, the vast majority of Wal-Mart's sales are going to come from its stores for probably decades no matter how much it invests in e-commerce. That's why it spent billions on higher wages, training, and improving store appearance. It also explains the online grocery pickup program. Its stores are its biggest differentiator over a company like Amazon, so it's crucial that the company make the shopping experience as pleasant as possible. Wal-Mart's recent efforts seem to be paying off. Same-store sales reached their fastest clip in several years in its most recent quarter at 1.6%, and the company also reversed a 2-year slide in e-commerce sales growth thanks in part to the grocery pick-up program.  There's no word yet on when the self-driving cart will come to fruition, but look for similar innovations to come out of the retail giant in the near future.  Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Walmart closes $3.3 billion deal for Jet.com 0 Share: Internet by Ben Fox Rubin September 19, 2016 1:39 PM PDT @benfoxrubin Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy A employee builds dozens of purple Jet boxes for upcoming orders.Photo by Ben Fox Rubin/CNET Walmart's push to take on Amazon took a big step forward Monday. The big-box retailer closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce retailer Jet.com, pulling off one of the biggest e-commerce deals ever and giving Walmart a new set of tools and talent to bulk up online. Still, Walmart now faces the difficult job of making this tie-up pay off by bringing together all its resources to create an Amazon alternative people will want to use. Jet, led by e-commerce veteran Marc Lore and backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, launched its site a little more than a year ago, offering consumer products ranging from laptops to shampoo to furniture. The size of the Jet deal, which was first announced last month, shows how serious Walmart has become in wanting to be a bigger force online, in hopes of goosing its lagging sales growth and stopping Amazon from stealing its customers. (In a nod to Walmart's effort to become more tech-focused, CEO Doug McMillon broke the news of the Jet deal closing on Instagram.) Walmart has been trying for years to become a more significant player in e-commerce, pouring billions of dollars into its warehouse infrastructure and website. But, so far, it's had little to show for it, with its e-commerce sales growth slowing in most recent quarters. Walmart is paying a king's ransom to bring on Lore, the new CEO of Walmart's e-commerce arm in the US. Lore, who led the parent company of Diapers.com before selling it to Amazon for $545 million five years ago, will receive more than 3.5 million Walmart shares in the deal -- worth roughly $250 million as of Monday -- which will vest over five years. MORE ON WALMART AND JET Congrats, Walmart! You just realized e-commerce is a thing Walmart to scoop up Jet.com for $3.3B to better battle Amazon Why Jet.com says it's got a 'smarter way' for you to shop online The deal should help Walmart reach more users online, helping the company access Jet's wealthier customers who may not typically buy on Walmart.com. Jet customers tend to spend more than Walmart and Amazon customers on high-end products, such as athletic shoes and fragrances, according to a study from researcher 1010data. For example, the average Jet customer spends $55.85 on athletic shoes, while the Walmart.com customer spends just $16.42. Also, both Jet and Walmart like to encourage their customers to bulk up their orders, so the two sites will benefit from that common strategy. On the negative side, even together Jet and Walmart make up just a sliver of the US e-commerce market, while Amazon is by far the largest online seller. Additionally, Walmart and Jet now have to figure out how to integrate their teams and technologies, while operating two separate websites: Walmart.com and Jet.com. That means that if Walmart does plan to catch up to Amazon, Jet won't rocket the company there soon.

Martinez, 43, of Lexington Avenue made his first court appearance on the charges today in Central Judicial Processing from Hudson County jail in Kearny. He is charged with eluding police by failing to stop his vehicle after receiving a signal from the officer to stop, and placing the officer at risk of death or serious injury, the criminal complaint states. Martinez, who court officials said has 28 prior arrests, is also charged with receiving stolen property – the 2012 Honda he was driving at the time of the incident. The officer fired multiple shots at him in the Walmart parking lot, striking him in the arm through the windshield. Finally, he is charged with shoplifting, the complaint says. Authorities say Martinez had shoplifted at the Walmart and was fleeing the scene when the officer arrived and commanded him to stop.  Probable cause for the charges is listed as the statements of witnesses and video surveillance footage that shows he "eluded a uniformed Kearny police officer after receiving multiple commands to stop his vehicle while creating a risk of injury to the officer," the complaint says. Martinez, who had a passenger in the vehicle, fled the parking lot but was arrested hours later in Newark by Kearny police. The passenger, Diego C. Dosreis, 28, also of Newark, was charged with receiving stolen property, officials said. The officer was not injured but he was evaluated at a local hospital, which is standard procedure when an officer fires his weapon, Kearny Mayor Al Santos said. He was later released. The mayor added that the officer had been nearby at the time of the incident and responded immediately. "The suspect is believed to have been a fleeing shoplifter and he threatened the officer with his vehicle," Santos said Friday. "The officer had to respond. He shot at the suspect because he was threatened by the suspect's vehicle as he tried to get away from the police officer trying to apprehend him." The shooting is being reviewed by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, as is the case in all instances when a law enforcement officer discharges his weapon in Hudson County. Martinez was informed that his bail has been set at $40,000 cash only when he appeared in Central Judicial Processing court in Jersey City this afternoon via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny. Martinez said little at the hearing but did mention that his arm hurt. Dosreis did no appear in CJP today.  Most Read Active Discussions nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

(Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart’s decision to hone in on its online business crossed a critical threshold Monday when it finalized its $3 billion purchase of e-commerce site Jet.com. Walmart’s president and CEO, Doug McMillon, took to Instagram to announce  the closure of a deal that the retailer hopes will enable it to cultivate and cater to more consumers online. “Together, both Jet.com and Walmart.com will be able to leverage each other’s assets to grow the ways we serve customers,’’ McMillon said in a post on Walmart’s blog Monday. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has been making bold moves to bolster both its online business and super centers, as it fights  to remain dominant amid a rapidly changing retail landscape. It’s filling store aisles with attractive displays of organic and gourmet items to attract shoppers seeking fresh food options.  And with Walmart.com, an online grocery offering, and now Jet.com, which caters to a more affluent shopper, the retailer is widening its e-commerce footprint. Walmart.com and Jet.com will continue to be separate brands, the retailers says. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2deN08T

Deal. Walmart announced on Monday that its monster $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce startup Jet.com is official. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon broke the news with a photo posted to Instagram on Monday. Startup-y! I've been waiting a month to put on this shirt. Today is the day. Happy to officially welcome Jet.com to the Walmart family! A photo posted by Doug McMillon (@dougmcmillon) on Sep 19, 2016 at 1:01pm PDT In a blog post, McMillon explained the deal by saying, “Walmart and Jet.com obsess about saving customers time and money. By joining forces, we’ll be better at doing both, creating seamless shopping from app to site to store.” After the honeymoon ends, the challenges for both sides will be many. For one, Amazon continues to gain market share in the U.S. and doesn’t appear to be losing any steam, while Walmart’s e-commerce growth has decelerated for most of the past year and a half. Jet.com also has to prove that it can develop a loyal customer base over many years, not just one powered by heavy advertising spending. And for Jet CEO Marc Lore, who will also run Walmart.com, there’s the tough task of bridging the gap between the company’s e-commerce efforts based in Silicon Valley and the core brick-and-mortar operation, which still accounts for the vast majority of revenue, in Arkansas. There’s a lot of money riding on both sides overcoming these challenges. recode_divider More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel are (officially) merging Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Recode Daily: Fake Facebook news is a danger to democracy, says Obama Do 'productivity hacks' really help you get stuff done?

ASI features Wal-Mart CFO Fri, 09/16/2016 - 12:00am -- Garrett Howard Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO) Brett Biggs kicked off the American Studies Institute’s Distinguished Lecture Series on Thursday, Sept. 8 in the Benson Auditorium. Biggs, a 1990 graduate from Harding’s College of Business, spoke on capitalism and the free market in America and helped inaugurate the Waldron Center for Entrepreneurship and Family Business on Friday, Sept. 9. “I believe the impact the center will have on the student body will be great,” Biggs said in his speech. “This aspect of business can be an essential part of life for not just business majors, but everyone in all fields.” Biggs’ thoughts on the Mabee building’s new addition tied into the theme of his lecture for the night, which focused on the importance of business and the impact Harding had on his success. Over the past eight years, Wal-Mart has hired 29 Harding students through the company’s accounting and finance development program. “(Harding Students) do amazingly well with our company,” Biggs said. Biggs also stressed the importance of developing relationships both at school and in the work force. “You will advance in your field based on how good you are, but there will be a part of your growth that won’t go any further unless you learn to work well with people,” Biggs said. “You have to learn to be adaptable with people … the world changes so quickly.” Biggs even reflected on his own adaptability while a student at Harding. According to Biggs, during his senior year, he was persuaded to go on a field trip to Wal-Mart for business majors. Although reluctant to go, he went on the trip and met Sam Walton, who offered these words of wisdom: “You keep studying, you keep working hard, and you never know what you’ll end up doing.” Twenty-six years later, Biggs helps lead the company founded by, what he considers, the greatest entrepreneur of our lifetime. “We are the product of a great entrepreneur,” Biggs said. Biggs said he believes the newly opened Waldron center will provide opportunities for the future, where business can grow and evolve on its own. The center’s location at Harding will exponentially help in the growth of business, according to Biggs. “The intersection of faith and business can get challenging, especially in the world we live in today,” Biggs said. “At Wal-Mart, I don’t have to choose between the two; we’re about taking care of people and doing the right thing.” This, according to Biggs, is why Harding and Wal-Mart mesh so well. “These are two great institutions,” Biggs said. “It’s a great set of values that Mr. Sam built this company on, and I think that is a testament to Harding.” 441 reads The Bison Multimedia See interviews, features, and more from the Bison's multimedia team.

Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon announced the closing of the deal, which was pending regulatory approval, in a blog post on the retailer's website. The acquisition will impact Wal-Mart's 2017 fiscal year earnings marginally more than the retailer's initial estimate of a 5 cents per share impact as the transaction closed ahead of time, Wal-Mart said. The deal, which was the largest for an online startup, will give Wal-Mart access to Jet.com's innovative pricing software and will help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to better compete with online rival Amazon.com Inc. "A lot of folks ask me 'Why Jet.com?," McMillon said in a blog post. The answer he said was in the savings both Wal-Mart and Jet can together offer shoppers. Jet, with its ability to lower prices as customers add more items to their shopping carts, will help the world's largest retailer reach more customers such as millennial shoppers. The deal would also strengthen Wal-Mart's existing e-commerce infrastructure, McMillon said. Wal-Mart has built its website into the second largest online retailer by traffic in the U.S. in the past six months, the blog post said. It has also expanded the assortment of products on its website from 7 million to 15 million items and is adding a million more each month. Jet's founder Marc Lore will join Wal-Mart as the President and Chief Executive of Wal-Mart's U.S. ecommerce business and will report to McMillon, the company said in a separate statement. "I'll be spending a lot of time with the team in the coming weeks and months focused on scaling Walmart.com and Jet.com," Lore said. Over a five-year period Lore will receive stock units that involve the issuance of 3.55 million shares of Wal-Mart's common stock valued at 10 cents per share, the statement said. This is a part of the $300 million of Wal-Mart shares that would be paid over time as part of the original transaction. The Jet deal follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart has bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the gap with Amazon.

Customers can expect big discounts on groceries, household appliances, clothes, and furniture. Lidl has caused such an impact with its rock bottom prices in the UK that it has forced the country's biggest supermarkets to dramatically slash prices and even lay off workers to stay competitive. The arrival of the chain into the United States could likely force supermarkets here to follow suit. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Kmart is closing 64 stores and firing thousands across 28... Store bedding in a pillowcase, clean radiators with fabric... Share this article Share In the UK, Lidl has forced it big competitors such as Tesco, ASDA and Sainsbury's to slash their prices in order to remain competitive  Stores including Food Lion, Bi-Lo, Winn Dixie, and dollar stores such as Dollar General and Family Dollar, could be forced to lower their prices as Lidl expands. Walmart's Neighborhood Market could feel the greatest pressure of all, as Lidl stores will be of similar size, highly price competitive, and highly fine tuned to offer a relevant, convenient store experience.   Lidl has already broken ground on a US distribution facility and headquarters in Virginia, which will cost about $200million, and it has staked out four possible store locations in the Richmond, Virginia, area.  The company has also snatched up leases in dozens of cities, according to local-news reports, and it's seeking store managers in areas including Burlington County, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; and Augusta, Georgia.  Walmart's Neighborhood Market and Trader Joes have most to fear with Lidl's arrival Lidl has become a threat to the grocery industry because of its insanely cheap prices and emphasis on fresh food. The stores are small, easy to shop, well located, and emphasize key categories such as fresh produce and prepared foods. The chain manages to keep prices low by limiting inventory to a small selection of private-label items rather than traditional supermarkets which carry several different brands of a single product. There is also much less by way of branding, presentation and customer service with many of the store's products displayed in their shipping cartons to make restocking quick and easy.  Many of Lidl's good are kept in their original packaging which means less workers are needed on the shop floor and allows for quick and easy restocking It means that less workers are needed on the sales floor. Lidl also saves money by requiring customers to bring their own shopping bags and bag their own groceries.  The chain also offers appliances and furniture, and a couple of years ago began to enter the fashion world with a women's clothing collection that saw fuax leather jackets for less than $20.  Since the launch, Lidl has introduced a men's collection, a line of handbags, and a fitness brand. The American stores will offer fresh meat, produce and bakery items, as well as a wide selection of household goods. The company has conducted a good deal of market research in the U.S. and is hiring local talent in the markets it is operating in.  Britain's Tesco pulled out of the United States in 2013 after a costly failure with a new low-price chain called Fresh & Easy.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 4.9k shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

 Walmart's self-driving shopping cart is a new frontier for the Internet of Things BI Intelligence Sep. 19, 2016, 12:13 PM 2,655 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also JD.com is expanding its drone delivery program Alibaba completely smashed its Singles' Day record Omnichannel is pushing Kohl's toward its future This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart has secured a patent for self-driving shopping carts, reports Popular Science. The patent, which was filed in March of this year but only published recently, shows a robot positioned under the cart steering it according to the shopper's direction. The carts would be placed within a network of sensors that send data to a central computer so that Walmart can track inventory and match customer needs with available inventory.  This is a different IoT use case for retailers. Beacons have been one of the top IoT devices retailers use to target offers and collect information on consumer spending habits. The same tracking principles and customer-monitoring capabilities will likely be applied to the self-driving shopping carts. The carts may be a good way to keep Walmart’s retail stores technologically advanced and entertaining as their revenue from e-commerce continues to outpace total revenue. Walmart hopes to use the carts to hedge against employee turnover. The shopping carts could potentially do the jobs of many employees, including picking up and delivering packages in the store, returning abandoned items left by customers in carts, and monitoring inventory. Walmart recently announced it was six to nine months away from using drones to track inventories in its warehouses to replace the jobs of quality-assurance employees. The IoT Revolution is picking up speed and when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT? After months of researching and reporting this exploding trend, John Greenough and Jonathan Camhi of BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, have put together an essential report on the IoT that explains the exciting present and the fascinating future of the Internet of Things.  It covers how the IoT is being implemented today, where the new sources of opportunity will be tomorrow and how 16 separate sectors of the economy will be transformed over the next 20 years. The report gives a thorough outlook on the future of the Internet of Things, including the following big picture insights: IoT devices connected to the Internet will more than triple by 2020, from 10 billion to 34 billion. IoT devices will account for 24 billion, while traditional computing devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.) will comprise 10 billion.  Nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next five years.  Businesses will be the top adopter of IoT solutions because they will use IoT to 1) lower operating costs; 2) increase productivity; and 3) expand to new markets or develop new product offerings.  Governments will be the second-largest adopters, while consumers will be the group least transformed by the IoT.  And when you dig deep into the report, you’ll get the whole story in a clear, no-nonsense presentation: The complex infrastructure of the Internet of Things distilled into a single ecosystem  The most comprehensive breakdown of the benefits and drawbacks of mesh (e.g. ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc.), cellular (e.g. 3G/4G, Sigfox, etc.), and internet (e.g. Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.) networks  The important role analytics systems, including edge analytics, cloud analytics, will play in making the most of IoT investments  The sizable security challenges presented by the IoT and how they can be overcome  The four powerful forces driving IoT innovation, plus the four difficult market barriers to IoT adoption  Complete analysis of the likely future investment in the critical IoT infrastructure:   connectivity, security, data storage, system integration, device hardware, and application development  In-depth analysis of how the IoT ecosystem will change and disrupt 16 different industries  To get your copy of this invaluable guide to the IoT universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Construction, on the right, will turn the Portage Wal-Mart store into a supercenter.Tom Haroldson/Special to MLive  Portage had approved plans for the expansion that includes a gas station in 2014, but the corporation did not begin construction until this summer. Anne Hatfield, a Wal-Mart spokesperson, said the store will expand from 151,000 square feet to 190,000 and will have additional grocery merchandise, a full-service pharmacy with drive-through, tire and lube express, garden center and an eight-pump gas station next to the south entrance. "We want to make sure our stores meet the needs of our customers today," Hatfield said.  "We want to make sure we are evolving to meet their needs." Construction started on the expansion this summer and is expected to be completed by summer 2017. Wal-Mart has been at the Shaver Road site since January 2005. The city initially approved Wal-Mart for a 218,000 square foot supercenter, 150,000 of that for the store and a future 68,000 square foot addition, along with a gas station, but for various reasons the larger store was not built. The company downsized its plans in 2014 and received city approval, but not before assuring neighbors that stormwater concerns would be addressed. The area residents had said they weren't opposed to the expansion itself, but had issues with its stormwater retention system and whether it was part of some flooding issues because it discharges into Portage Creek behind the store. Vicki Georgeau, director of Portage community development, said her department has been working with Wal-Mart the past two years on the modified supercenter plans. "We think it's good news. We've been anticipating this would be happening since it was built. We're pleased to see after several years of deferred construction that they are building the new expansion." The new supercenter is expected to better compete with the popular Meijer's store down the road. One issue not resolved: Wal-Mart has requested a new sign at the expanded store that is twice the size that city sign codes allow. The issue has been tabled until the Zoning Board of Appeals' Oct. 10 meeting. Tom Haroldson covers Portage, Vicksburg and Schoolcraft for MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette. Contact him at haroldso@charter.net.

Target kills curbside pilot because it was never a fit Walmart Pay vs. Apple Pay: Hardware age dictates all Video UPS Puts Consumers in Control Despite various short-lived efforts over the years, most retail shopping carts are impressively low-tech. And they almost always have a wheel out of alignment (or are those just the ones I always seem to get?). But a new patent issued to Walmart paints a futuristic vision, with carts driving themselves from the parking lot right to the customer who called for it. Even if Walmart actually chooses to manufacturer and deploy such carts — many patents never get productized — it will be a baby step toward making carts truly useful in retail. Carts could house navigational systems that could literally steer you toward the exact items on your list. For that matter, they could take "accidental" detours by high-margin items and offer you a coupon — as long as you're right there. For the moment, though, let's look at what Walmart's new patent envisions. For starters, it addresses one of the more time-consuming and least profitable — not to mention least popular among employees — tasks at many retailers: Someone has to go fetch the carts and corral the unwieldy units into a cart collection area. And sometimes this happens during rather unpleasant weather. This means that shoppers can leave their carts anywhere they want in the parking lot and the cart will drive itself to a collection area. And when needed, drive itself back into the store and to the specific aisle where it's been summoned. This little change can allow employees to be focused on more profitable customer-service tasks. And it will also neaten up the parking lot. The patent speaks of messy stores and parking lots where "shopping carts are left abandoned, aisles become messy, inventory is not displayed in the proper locations or is not even placed on the sales floor, shelf prices may not be properly set, and theft is hard to discourage." Not quite clear on how an automated shopping cart fixes products being misplaced or improper shelf prices, but such is life. The magic is performed, according to the patent, via "a plurality of sensors, a plurality of motorized transport units, and a control circuit. The control circuit being configured to: receive a shopping container request from a user interface device associated with the customer, determine at least one available shopping container based on data collected by the plurality of sensors, the at least one available shopping container being empty and not used by another customer, select an available shopping container based at least on a location information of the user interface device, select a motorized transport unit to transport the available shopping container, and provide instructions to the motorized transport unit to bring the available shopping container to the customer." How exactly does the cart locate the shopper? The patent offers a few possible avenues including LEDs "that are mounted in the ceiling at known positions throughout the space and that each encode data in the emitted light that identifies the source of the light and thus the location of the light." The patent specifies one company offering such capabilities. "Generally, such lighting systems are known and commercially available, e.g., the ByteLight system from ByteLight of Boston, Mass. In embodiments using a ByteLight system, a typical display screen of the typical smart phone device can be used as a light sensor or light receiver to receive and process data encoded into the light from the ByteLight light sources." The patent also considered low-energy radio beacons, typically using Bluetooth and audio beacons. The idea of intelligent automated shopping carts is hardly new. Four years ago, Microsoft was involved in a trial with Whole Foods about a cart that would also push marketing messages. That trial, however, suffered from some technical issues. Microsoft put out a field of infrared dots with a laser and mapped distortions to navigate the carts. But above a certain light level, the dots got washed out and couldn't be seen. This happened when the carts were near windows or skylights. There are also issues of the cost of keeping the carts powered and connected to the network. Still, Walmart's effort could be the beginning of some intriguing research. Now if it could only fix that bum wheel. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

PreviousNext Walmart Proposal Draws Curious to Business Park Open Houses By Joe DurwiniBerkshires Correspondent 03:21AM / Monday, September 19, 2016Print | Email The 15-acre Site 9 in the William Stanley Business Park is being considered for a Walmart Supercenter. PITTSFIELD, Mass. — The Walmart store proposed for the William Stanley Business Park has generated a lot of discussion didn't translate into an influx of visitors at the park. But those who did attend the three recent open houses expressed their interest and concerns about the controversial project. "I think everyone came with pretty much that focus in mind," said Pittsfield Economic Development Authority Executive Director Corydon Thurston, who told iBerkshires the three dates — held on Aug. 24, 31, and Sept. 14 — drew a combined crowd of "about a couple dozen." "Everyone that came wanted to see where [the proposed site] was, and how it would be oriented, and things of that nature," Thurston said. He added that along with its primary mission of generating interest in the developable parcels of the park, the tours were also an important part of PEDA's attempt to maintain public transparency. "We want people to feel comfortable, and know that we're not hiding anything," he said. "We're trying to do our best, and showcase the property." These three open houses follow an event in May focused specifically on the Waterstone Development proposal to site a 190,000 Walmart Supercenter on a challenged lot in the small urban business park near Tyler Street. Another public presentation will be held by Waterstone on Monday, Sept. 19, at 6 p.m. at Morningside School. Touring the business park, PEDA Board Chairman Mick Callahan outlined some of the many challenges to that particular piece of property, which includes millions of dollars in re-grading and remediation to be shovel-ready for any new development. On a typical "greensfield," or uncontaminated, site, Callahan noted, the average cost of development may range anywhere from $80,000 to $175,000 per acre. At the uniquely challenged "Teens" site (so dubbed because it once held General Electric buildings numbered in the teens), the cost will be closer to a half-million dollars per acre. Waterstone's current proposal to develop the site will total approximately $30 million to $32 million, an expenditure Callahan called "the largest private investment in Pittsfield in many years." Retail would be essentially limited to this portion of the business park in PEDA's emerging vision. Additional parcels on the East Street side of the park are more suited, he said, to "light industrial, office, and R&D uses," and the more buildable areas on this side of the rail line that segments the property could accommodate as many as a half dozen such companies, depending on their size. On the Kellogg Street side, across the newly opened Woodlawn Avenue Bridge, another small lot already contains a buildable foundation for a medium-size facility, what Callahan called "an affordable opportunity, that has a lot of possibility." "In the scheme of things, we're a very small business park, compared to a lot of what we're competing with," Callahan told iBerkshires. "Our goal is to build the tax base and create jobs." Not only does PEDA believe that Waterstone's Walmart proposal will address both goals, but the North Carolina-based developer has eluded to its interest in working with PEDA on other non-retail projects at the park. "Waterstone is a multi-dimensional developer that is now nationwide. They have industrial, commercial, warehousing, retail, and R&D," said Callahan, adding "we've also talked to them a bit about 'where do we go from here.'" In the meantime, PEDA remains open to all interested parties, and will arrange viewings for anyone who wants to know more. "We're happy to show people the property absolutely any time that we have time. They don't have to wait for an open house," said Thurston.

Walmart, Lowe's, and Whole Foods are banking on this to compete with Amazon Business Insider 9/18/2016 Kate Taylor © Provided by Business Insider lowebot The rise of automation in the fast-food industry has made headlines in recent months, as chains such as Panera and McDonald's have heavily invested in tech that threatens to eventually replace human workers. Robots can make sushi, noodles, burgers, and pancakes.  Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.03 -0.16 -0.23% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 765.39 +8.99 +1.19% Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▼ 30.65 -0.29 -0.94% Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▲ 68.14 +0.19 +0.28% Now, the grocery and retail industry is looking to get in on automation, as well.     Walmart recently patented a system of self-driving shopping carts, with mini robots that can complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees. These motorized units can potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. All this may sound like science fiction, but the automation of retail jobs isn't so far off.  In late August, Lowe's announced that, starting this fall, 11 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area will feature LoweBots, which are multi-lingual, autonomous customer assistance robots. In the grocery industry, self-checkout stands have become standard. And the industry is now looking for more ways to use tech to streamline shopping and minimize the need for human employees. © Provided by Business Insider 365 Whole Foods 365 stores, for example, have iPad kiosks that let customers order food from the on-site kitchen, iPads with digital scanners to provide details about wine, digital scales for weighing foods, and digital price tags. The reliance on tech over employees is intended to both cut costs — allowing for lower prices —and appeal to millennial shoppers. Retailers like Walmart say one of the major advantages of automation is a better customer experience.  "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," Walmart's patent reads. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart patent Walmart's patent notes that robots could help solve some of it's major challenges, like insufficient staffing during peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rates, messy aisles, and theft — all things that can be addressed by utilizing robots. Robots also make good workers — they never need a vacation, never get sick, and arrive at work 100% trained. Customer experience is especially important for brick-and-mortar retailers in 2016, thanks to the growth of ecommerce sites such as Amazon. The online retailer is aiming to take over sectors from clothing to grocery — and companies are scared.  "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience," Walmart's patent notes.   Amazon's lack of physical stores has helped it thrive, as the company can avoid issues like long lines, lack of customer service, and stocking problems that retailer have to deal with. Amazon has arguably lead the charge toward automation. In 2014, the online retailer deployed Kiva robots across its warehouses to automate the retrieving and packaging process. Deutsche Bank says the machines save the company roughly $22 million at each fulfillment center.     At brick-and-mortar locations, automation also has the bonus of appealing to younger customers, a group that retailers are eager to attract. Nearly a third of people 18 to 24 would rather order from the drive-thru at restaurants because "they don't feel like dealing with people" according to a recent study by Frisch's Restaurants, which owns and franchises 120 Big Boy Restaurants. © Provided by Business Insider 365 That's part of the reason that retailers are investing in automation. Whole Food's 365 brand intends to win over millennials.     "There are a lot more options for people these days — whether it's groceries or restaurants or convenience stores — and 365 is our way of evolving," Jeff Turnas, president of 365 by Whole Foods Market, told Business Insider in April. While there are some clear benefits for investing in automation, the rise of the robot may cause problems for workers. A recent study from market research company Forrester predicts that, by 2021, robots will have eliminated 6% of all jobs in the US, reports the Guardian. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart The benefits of a more-fully automated store are getting more and more appealing as labor costs rise,  according to analysts. Walmart told Business Insider that any predictions about how investment in automation would impact workers was premature. However, as companies across the grocery and retail space invest in this technology, it is inevitable that shopping will involve more and more robots. And, as times goes on, that's likely to mean fewer and fewer human employees. Are you a retail worker or shopper that has been affected by automation?

Photo: Bloomberg Last week, automobile maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd announced a wide-ranging strategic partnership with cab-hailing company Ola spanning fleet expansion, vehicle financing, insurance and sales. A few weeks prior, Tata Motors Ltd had announced a similar partnership with Uber. Now, what do these moves mean? Some of the large corporate entities have not only realized but have also admitted that they are vulnerable to disruption. So it’s better to ride with the tiger than resist and be on the sidelines. Announcing the partnership, Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra said, “I have recognized a new reality and Mahindra is poised to play a significant role in the new world. We have two categories of people—those who buy vehicles for objects of desire, while others focus on the shared economy. And we will be a part of both. Being one of the largest automobile groups in the world, we are providing Bhavish (Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal) and his team an offer they cannot refuse.” “An offer they cannot refuse” holds significance as more such compelling offers will come in the life cycle of these tech start-ups. And it means venture capital investors backing such companies—unicorns, in some cases—are probably poised to make huge returns. (A unicorn is a start-up with a valuation from private investors of $1 billion or more.) This phenomenon is happening across the globe and in sectors where companies are buying into the wave of the future. This is the reason Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. This is why Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is buying Jet.com for $3 billion. This is why General Motors Corp. bought Cruise for $1 billion, and also why it invested $500 million in Uber’s rival Lyft. Dave McClure of 500 Startups, the leading Silicon Valley-based early-stage investment firm, has an explanation for this. According to him, “This phenomenon of hedging your public company stock by buying potentially disruptive unicorns for only 5-10% of your market cap may be one of the simplest ways to defuse the start-up threat and keep on trucking... this is the Unicorn Hedge.” Venture capital investors would do well backing those companies defining the wave of the future. Except that the past three to four years have been largely driven by “topi (hat) investing”, where an investor has invested in a company—which is now proving to be ridiculously valued—thinking that another investor will buy it again at a higher valuation, eventually leading to a game of passing the hat where everyone now is waiting for the last fool standing who will be the ultimate owner of that hat. Some investors have labelled this phenomenon “topi investing”. Now, when that last fool is nowhere to be seen, venture capital firms are worried about the house of cards that they themselves built. Unilever-Dollar Shave, GM-Lyft, Wal-Mart-Jet and so on point out that there could be potential acquirers in large companies only. The idea is to build something for disruption and not necessarily look at everything from the lens of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V—such as we are investing in Amazon of India, Zillow of India or Zappos of India, the time for which has come and gone. There have been motivations to build such companies for Nasdaq or NYSE initial public offerings by pumping in huge amounts of money which have attracted investors of all hues. The dot-com bust of 2000 proved that if access to capital becomes too easy and cheap, it is not valued and often contributes to reckless spending and wishful business models that lead to failures. Going forward, there will be huge merit in measuring success primarily driven by standards of tech companies that can go public in India, which are far less forgiving, or can have an Indian base, or are huge brands in this country—as these would likely prove to be disruptors of the incumbents. This is the right time to be investing as the mood is softer—in the right start-ups in disruptive areas. More old-world companies will wake up and smell the coffee and find themselves on the back foot, compensating by paying outsize, sometimes incredulous sums for breakthrough competitors or the new set of unicorns!

Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images On the afternoon of September 19, Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Temple University in Philadelphia. This millennial-centered speech will be her only campaign appearance until the first presidential debate on September 26. Much like every other interaction with young people during her 2016 presidential campaign, it bombed miserably. In the scripted speech, she managed to say the phrase “income inequality” only once. Clinton also managed to avoid addressing the question of third party candidates, who many millennials support over her. Her best selling point as a presidential candidate remains that she isn’t Donald Trump. To further bolster her youth-cred, Clinton spoke about her decision to work for the Children’s Defense Fund instead of a big law firm, but in reality Clinton did not stay there long. According to Kathleen Geier in an essay featured in “False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton”, Clinton left the Children’s Defense Fund less than a year later to work for Rose Law Firm, which boasted wealthy clientele such as Wal-Mart and Monsanto. “Though her campaign biography plays up the pro bono work she performed at Rose, the vast majority of her working hours were dedicated to her corporate clients,” writes Geier. Clinton even had the audacity to call herself an “activist” as first lady, after she served on the board of Wal-Mart for six years prior to Bill Clinton assuming office. The enthusiasm for Clinton’s Temple University speech was lethargic at best, perhaps because like every other time Clinton has spoken directly to millennials, she addresses them as children instead of people who can think for themselves. At the April 2007 convention of New York State Union of Teachers, Clinton revealed what she really thinks of young people. “I believe it is time we get back to teaching discipline, self-control, patience, punctuality,” she said. “The biggest complaint that I hear from employers is that young people who show up for jobs don’t have those habits. They don’t get there on time. They don’t know how to conduct themselves appropriately.” During the Democratic primaries, Clinton responded to millennials supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (more than her and Trump) with a combination of condescension and frustration. At a January presidential forum in Iowa, Clinton fielded a question from a millennial who asked why people his age think she is dishonest. She responded that it’s a symptom of their cluelessness, as they are paying attention to politics for the first time. In February, Clinton was confronted by a young black protester at a $500-a-plate fundraiser over her lack of apology for supporting mass incarceration and using the racist term “super-predator” in the 1990s. She responded by angrily changing the subject, and declined to apologize. While campaigning in Minnesota in March, Clinton responded to a young black woman complaining about the lack of diversity in the Democratic Party with a lazy, dismissive, “Why don’t you go run for something?” During an April Meet the Press interview, Clinton condescendingly told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd that she feels sorry for young people who believe the lies Sanders tells about her. She specifically denied claims made by Greenpeace that she took donations from the fossil fuel industry. However, an investigative report by David Sirota of International Business Times found Clinton accepted millions of dollars in campaign and Clinton Foundation donations from oil companies just a year before she approved the controversial Alberta-Clipper oil pipeline. One of Clinton’s top campaign contributors, Donald Sussman, founder and chairman of the hedge fund Paloma Partners, has invested in several oil companies. Millennials believed the “lies” Sanders told about Clinton because they were true. Millennials don’t trust Clinton because she has repeatedly said one thing, and overtly done another. She claims to support campaign finance reform, yet has courted billionaires and millionaires from both political parties and managed to match Sanders in campaign contributions only through the use of SuperPACs. According to Vice News, through the end of July, Clinton has raised over $200 million from the top one percent of wealthiest Americans. After the Democratic National Convention, Clinton abandoned anything to do with Sanders’ policies, instead focusing on cultivating support from establishment Republicans, and billionaires including Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban. Now that her support has dropped in the polls following an embarrassing FBI report and Clinton Foundation pay-to-play schemes being exposed in emails, Clinton has resorted to pandering to millennials again. Too bad only 31 percent of them express support for her in recent polls, which is just a few points higher than for Trump. More than one third of millennials are expected to vote for either Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. Clinton uses Sanders as a lifeline when she becomes desperate for young voters. The Vermont senator’s recent call for millennials not to vote for a third party received more positive news coverage in the mainstream media than Sanders got throughout his entire presidential campaign. But millennials realize that Sanders’ rhetoric is relatively insincere, and is part of a broader pandering project from the Clinton campaign to gain their support. Clinton’s contemptuous attitude about millennials, and their responding disinterest in her presidency, has provoked annoyance from her supporters in the media. Mother Jones editor in chief Clara Jeffery responded to recent polls with “I never hated millennials more.” Meanwhile Mother Jones writer Kevin Drum, in a poor attempt at damage control, wrote that resentment should instead be directed toward Sanders for his primary digs at Clinton. Somehow, nothing Hillary Clinton and her campaign did to alienate millennials could ever be her fault. There’s got to be some other reason for the widespread dislike American voters have for her candidacy. Observer About Newsletters Advertise Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP

Of the total earnings, woven items brought in $102.18 million and knitwear $34.26 million, according to Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh. Although Bangladeshi goods enjoy duty-free benefit in the Indian market, garment exports to India did not rise much due to the imposition of 12.5 percent countervailing duty on apparel items from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi garment exporters also face provincial taxes and non-tariff barriers in India, which has an apparel market worth nearly $40 billion. Though India in 2011 allowed duty-free benefit to almost all Bangladeshi goods except 25 alcoholic and beverage items, it imposed the countervailing duty on apparel, Bangladesh's main export item, the following year. However, garment exports to India have been showing signs of pickup from last year when many Western clothing retailers started operating in that market. US retail giant Walmart and Swedish retailer H&M opened a good few stores in India in the last few years. Walmart India owns and operates 21 Best Price Modern Wholesale stores in nine states across India and plans to open another 50 by 2020, according to its website. H&M said it would double the number of its stores in India by the yearend from six now. “It is a big advantage for us that the foreign retailers are operating in India. Our garment exports to the Indian market will increase further in near future due to the presence of such retail giants in India,” said MA Jabbar, managing director of DBL Group, a leading garment exporter. Foreign retailers buy a lot of garment items from Bangladesh for Indian customers, especially for the rising middle class, he said. Bangladeshi garment items are popular in India because of low prices and better quality, Jabbar added. “We are performing very well in knitwear export to India because of the varieties of this product,” he said. Similar is the view of Faruque Hassan, vice-president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the garment makers' platform. Garment exports to India have been rising mainly from last year thanks to the Western retail giants operating in India, he said. Many Indian companies that have retail chains in India tied up with the foreign retailers to grab the market, he said. “We are far ahead of India in knitwear. This is an advantage for us,” he said. Hassan said garment makers are also inspired by the stimulus package the government has offered to them for exporting to new destinations like India, Japan and China. Except the US, the EU and Canada, all other markets are considered as new destinations. The government has been paying cash incentives to garment makers, who export to the new destinations, at 3 percent of the export value since 2009. In fiscal 2015-16, Bangladesh exported goods worth $689.82 million to India, which is 30.82 percent higher than the previous year. The amounts were $527.16 million in 2014-15 and $456.63 million in 2013-14.

By Elizabeth Doupnik on September 20, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk It’s tough out there for retailers and fashion apparel brands. Between finicky consumers, fleeting social media trends and a race to dominate online sales, retailers are in a place of transition and reinvention. Last week speakers at the 2016 SAP Retail Forum held in Miami, Fla. addressed these challenges and proposed points of advice for mastering the swelling learning curve of the “Internet of Things” and understanding the complexities of the Millennial consumer. Here, SAP general manager of consumer industries Lori Mitchell-Keller explains how retailers can delight consumers with comprehensive online and in-store experiences, how to reach shoppers of all demographics and how to successfully launch a new customer engagement strategy. WWD: How can retailers approach shoppers from different demographics and still send a consistent message that is true to brand integrity? Lori Mitchell-Keller: The interesting thing within retail is that we have so many generations that we’re trying to cater to: we have the grand generation that’s probably going to be shopping in your store and won’t have as high expectations as some of the younger generations. Certainly the Millennial that we talk about all the time are the biggest shoppers, they will have the most expendable income. Millennials are still shopping [in store] — they’re not just shopping online, they’re not just sharing information via Facebook and Twitter, or Snapchat. They actually are continuing to talk, and they do like the shopping experience. In the last two years we’ve figured out that physical stores are a huge asset à la Amazon opening up pop-up shops. They’re a huge asset in brand affinity and understanding your customer. The advantage about physical stores is that you have the opportunity to share an experience with the customer. This concept of getting to know your customers started more in the luxury area a few years ago and certainly our clients like Burberry are more into the space, but that’s not necessarily what you have to do to have that experience. The other thing we’ve been talking about with experiential retail is all about the service and the culture. The service, the culture, the experience, the getting-to-know-you, none of that can solely be done in the digital world — maybe as we get more into virtual reality — but today what I’m advising retailers is that you have to use simple processes. You have to use digital to make your operations more efficient and make your supply chain more real-time. You need to make your ability to respond to trends or unanticipated demands more real-time; you need to have capabilities to sense that information, and then decide what you want to do about it quickly and then act. So you do need a lot of digital technology, but that does not take the place of engaging with the customer in the store. It’s what she’s doing in the story and marry that [with digital]. At the minimum you need to ensure that the store experience is the brand that you want the consumer to understand. WWD: How can retailers capitalize on both the showroom trend to highlight new product and still offer experiential shopping experiences? L.M.K.: I do feel that there’s been this fear of bricks-and-mortar stores that they’ll become showrooms for the products and [the consumers] don’t actually buy. I think there is some “showrooming” going on, but I think that the best retailers are using that showrooming to their advantage. Take Wal-Mart, for example. They have two interesting apps: one that guarantees if you buy something in store and then you see it online for a cheaper price, you just scan the bar code on your receipt and you get the difference in price the next time you go in store. The other app searches online for [the customer] instead of you searching online for this particular item at a different store versus what’s sold at Wal-Mart and they’ll automatically reduce their price for you. I think there are opportunities for bricks-and-mortar to merge showrooming concepts or activities into actual experiences that the customer is so surprised and delighted by, she’ll buy the item. For items that are only offered online or in store, there’s an opportunity for customer engagement to the extent that they’re helping the consumer: I only have [this product] in store, here is the nearest store, and here’s the level of inventory at that store, so I know if I want to trek 20 miles to buy this product. That is such a rich experience that the consumer is finding that, “Wow this store is really interested in getting me this product.” The whole synergy between bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce is coming full circle. We thought it was a detriment and now it’s an advantage. We thought [the answer] was showrooming and now we can actually change that into an experience if we have the right technology. We’re reaching out to the customers appropriately so we can make that experience such a positive one that the loyalty and the brand desire becomes even higher with the customer, because they like the way they were treated. WWD: What advice would you give to retailers who find themselves behind the curve of consumer engagement? L.M.K.: When I talk to retailers about technology there’s multiple levels of technology to utilize: There’s the differentiation [digital] capabilities that hold your planning solutions for your supply chain — the things that the customer never sees unless you’re out of stock and then the customer sees that the system broke down. Then there’s this whole level of customer experience and engagement that you might want to deploy, but I think that it’s really hard to change your customer experience or engagement if you haven’t changed the processes that support customer engagement. At the end of the day, if you haven’t simplified and streamlined the processes that support that customer engagement, you’re not really going to change the customer engagement. I think the best advice for retailers who are not yet in the fray and are trying to figure out what they’re doing is to have a conversation about what you want the customer engagement process to be. How do you want the customer to experience the brand when they walk into the store? How do you want them to work with you online? Then after you figure out what your goal is, don’t focus on implementing that goal, focus on what are the things that are supporting that goal that need to be streamlined, simplified, or fixed first to reach the goal. Otherwise your customer will get an experience exactly the opposite of what you want. You’ll put the customer engagement goal into place, but it’s not going to be met because your employees haven’t been supported with the right information, the supply chain isn’t set up to respond to unique promotions. For instance, [the retailer] gives a set of customers a coupon so they go in store or online and the store is out of stock. A better process is to set the expectation internally and then figure out what you need to do, pilot that in a few stores and then figure out what’s working and what’s not working. Fix the kinks then begin to roll it out. WWD: Is virtual reality the next phase that retailers need to consider for their stores? What technology is most exciting to you? L.M.K.: I think that augmented reality is definitely on the rise and it is a trend that we will see more of. I think there are other areas in IoT that are interesting: sensors and wearables are making huge growth opportunities in all different industries, not just consumer products. Under Armour is doing it using its app and marrying it with purchases — they’re integrating purchases with lifestyle information and becoming more of a technology company. I think there are things in IoT in general — dash buttons, sensors, wearables — that we’re going to continue to see. I think we’re just beginning to see snippets of augmented reality. There are entrepreneurs building virtual reality malls. They set up where you want the stores in the mall and then [the customer is] in the store and you’re actually browsing [in store], and from the virtual reality device you can order the product directly from the store. I do think that given the pace at which we’re all going and dissatisfaction with a flat digital experience with online retailers that more of this virtual reality capabilities will become much more interesting to us than they are today. I don’t think the older generations are immune to it. I certainly think that the younger generations will pick it up quickly. WWD: As Millennials age and become the main demographic in the workforce, how do you think this will change professional dynamics? L.M.K.: There’s this stereotype that [Millennials] are more entitled. I don’t see that they’re much more demanding. I do see a realization that they can have a bigger effect on how their life is lived from flexible work weeks, smaller work weeks, how they actually go about engaging with an employer. My daughter who belongs to Generation Z is the first demographic that sees females in executive roles making changes; they might be the first generation that sees a female president. Both Millennials and Gen Z see how they can influence the way their lives are lived — [which is] so different than those who are older, who had a set expectation: “I’m going to work and follow the rules.” They’re not as much rule-breakers as they are rule-makers.

But your friend can’t continue on—she’s got a date with her boyfriend. So, you call in the troops, i.e., your closest compadres, via scads of soliciting text messages. “Dinner plans?!!!” Received, read, and replied: “Ah sorry, still at the office,” and “Heading on that date with new guy. Eek, wish me luck!” If you’re wholly committed to a night on the town, all is not lost, despite the unsettling pangs of unease at the prospect of an evening solo. Resist the urge to give in to the comforts of Chinese takeout and HBO Go. No, not even a splurge-y delivery supper via Postmates could stave off this social disposition. So, the question is: fine-dine alone, or not? “I’m all for eating out on my own,” says Vogue.com Associate Market Editor Anny Choi. “I have no shame walking into a restaurant, sitting at a table (never a bar seat), and ordering a full meal for myself with a glass of wine. But I can’t fathom a ticket for one at the cinema.” On the other hand, Vogue.com Market Assistant Elizabeth Taufield admits, “I don’t love the idea of having lunch or dinner out alone.” Taufield even likes to seize the opportunity for a moment by herself before joining up with friends. “Whenever I’m in London, I find myself making a trip to the Claridge’s hotel bar for a drink alone before I head off to meet friends for dinner.” There’s no right or wrong way to reserve a table for one. “You never know who you’ll meet or where you’ll wind up,” says Edward Barsamian, Vogue.com’s Style Editor. “Lest we forget Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation.” Thinking about grabbing a table for one? Here’s where to dine, what to bring, and what to wear. 1 / 5 Expand __SLIDE_TITLE__ __SLIDE_CAPTION__ __SLIDE_CREDIT__ See more photos of: Read Caption email __SLIDE_TITLE__ __SLIDE_CAPTION__ __SLIDE_CREDIT__ Vogue may earn compensation on these sales through affiliate programs.

A St. Mary Parish Sheriff’s deputy said he saw a man at Walmart begging for money. The man had a badge and some handcuffs on his hip. When the deputy approached the individual to investigate further, the man said his name was Steven Morris. At first, he told the officer he was with “the fugitive task force”. When the deputy pointed out that Morris’ badge actually said Forrest County Sheriff’s Office, Morris told the deputy he had lied. He was not a policeman. The deputy said when he called Forest County Sheriff’s Office in Mississippi they told him the badge Morris had matched the description of a badge that had been missing for several years. Twenty-two-year-old Steven Morris was arrested for impersonating a peace officer.     Filed Under: fake police | pretend police Category: Acadiana News | Latest News | Local News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Well, now Lidl (pronounced “Lee-del” in German), another European price-busting chain, has plans for expansion in the United States. Lidl is hiring staff and scouting retail locations along the East Coast. The move is seen as a shot across the bow for domestic retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target. The company’s expansion plans come after it had enormous success moving into the U.K., thanks in part to a no-frills, cost-conscious approach.    “That model really worked and it really undercut some of the marketing messages of some of the mainstream grocers,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst with the market research firm Conlumino.  In time, he feels Lidl could emerge as a viable competitor to Wal-Mart or Target, and even take business away from its German arch rival, Aldi. “The reason I think that is because Lidl’s product proposition is lot more rounded,” he said. “Yes, it sells grocery like Aldi does, but it also sells a lot of non-food as well.” However, here in the U.S. we already have lots of low-cost grocery chains. Think of places like Save-A-Lot, Dollar General, Family Dollar, etc. On top of that, Supermarket News retail editor Jon Springer said European chains like Lidl and Aldi rely on private brands, which many people here don’t recognize. “Their success to a degree depends on the consumers’ willingness to sort of put their trust in the brand,” he said. Springer said Lidl also doesn’t have the economies of scale of a giant like Wal-Mart.  Follow Adam Allington at @@aallington.  Adam Allington Adam Allington is an reporter covering economics and policy in the Washington D.C. bureau.

The modular programs, which offer a credential with a pathway to credit, provide high-quality education from top universities to help learners launch or advance their career, or follow a path to an accelerated Master's degree. The MicroMasters initiative marks the next evolution in edX's mission to expand access to high-quality, career-relevant education at a fraction of the price. MicroMasters programs from 14 universities including MIT and now Columbia University, University of Michigan, Thunderbird School of Global Management, a unit of the Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB) and more, enable learners to begin advanced education in an affordable and flexible manner. Offered in subjects ranging from artificial intelligence to project management and supply chain management, MicroMasters courses are created by esteemed edX university partners, valued by top companies and linked to specific career outcomes. Industry and learner demand drove the development of MicroMasters, a program which was originally conceived by MIT and offered on edX as a pilot MicroMasters in Supply Chain Management – a field experiencing a worldwide talent shortage. While developing the new MicroMasters programs, edX consulted with industry leadership to understand their challenges, both in hiring and developing a smarter, more capable workforce. "The workplace is changing more rapidly today than ever before and employers are in need of highly-developed talent. Meanwhile, college graduates want to advance professionally, but are realizing they do not have the career-relevant skills that the modern workplace demands. EdX recognizes this mismatch between business and education for learners, employees and employers," said Anant Agarwal, CEO of edX and MIT professor. "The MicroMasters initiative provides the next level of innovation in learning to address this skills gap by creating a bridge between higher education and industry to create a skillful, successful 21 [st] -century workforce." Companies are looking for ways to provide their employees with deep, in-demand learning that will help them advance in rapidly growing fields, such as User Experience (UX) design, sustainable energy technology and operations. EdX discovered individuals have the same needs; an edX survey of online learners revealed a demand for a series of rich and rigorous courses informed by today's job market. Learners want flexible, affordable, real-time knowledge and skills that fit their lifestyles and prepare them for a specific in-demand job or career. "WalMart is always looking to hire the most talented associates in the world, and completing online courses like the MITx MicroMasters credential in Supply Chain Management is a powerful way for people to learn the important skills required to be successful," Chris Sultemeier, EVP of Logistics, Walmart U.S. "Everything I'm learning I can apply to a future job," said María Barba, an edX learner currently enrolled in the MITx Supply Chain Management MicroMasters. A MicroMasters certificate is comparable to a significant portion, in most cases a quarter or a half, of a traditional Master's degree, and is a valuable standalone credential that will help learners advance their careers. In addition, it offers a new path to an accelerated graduate degree. Learners who excel in the MicroMasters courses, successfully earning the credential, may then apply to a full Master's program; for those who are accepted – either at the university offering the MicroMasters program or another university that acknowledges the MicroMasters certificate – the digital credential will count as credit toward a portion of the degree, resulting in an accelerated program. Moreover, MicroMasters offers "inverted admissions," where learners can prove their abilities via online courses and universities have more data to inform admissions decisions. "We are proud to have been a pioneer for higher education's next step in engaging learners worldwide. MIT recognizes that not all high-potential Master's candidates can afford to spend a year or more on campus. As part of our mission to attract the best talent, we understand the importance of providing multiple pathways to degree programs," said Sanjay Sarma, Vice President for Open Learning, MIT. "MicroMasters broadens our admissions pool, and also allows learners to demonstrate their abilities through a series of online courses. All who pass earn a credential valued by the marketplace; those who excel may apply and complete their Master's with an additional semester's residence." "As Michigan continues to innovate and expand the conceptions of the public research university we're extremely enthusiastic about the three MicroMasters we are launching and the pathways we'll create for global lifelong learners," said Martha Pollack, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Michigan. Pearson, the world's education company, with over 35,000 employees in more than 70 countries, will also collaborate with edX to support the newly launched MicroMasters programs. Learners around the world will have the opportunity to take MicroMasters courses at local Pearson learning centers, which offer regional, in-person support, access to dedicated cohorts and additional learning resources. This blended learning experience has the potential to help students complete and thrive in online programs in places where online education is less established. EdX co-founding partner Harvard looks forward to offering a MicroMasters program in the future. And, other partner universities are considering launching additional MicroMasters programs over the coming year.

Holiday displays show up at some stores USA TODAY 9/20/2016 Charisse Jones Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

At Macy’s Herald Square, Holiday Lane is open, complete with rows of “The Elf on The Shelf,’’ reindeer cloaked in plaid, and holiday toy-soldier nutcrackers with more than three months remaining until Christmas. Holiday lights and ornaments will start appearing in Walmart stores over the next two weeks, while Sears will start selling wreaths, stockings and other décor in stores by Oct. 2.    “Early October may seem early for some,’’ says Sears spokesman Brian Hanover, adding that the company has chosen a similar start date in previous years, “but we have many members who love getting the jump on the Christmas season and coming in-store to see the latest product trends and this year’s new holiday collectibles.’’ Rolling out holiday décor before the leaves have turned might be surprising to some, but early sales have been popping up for decades, though the National Retail Federation says the practice has gotten more attention in recent years because of the buzz generated by social media.  The NRF says stores are simply giving customers what they want. © USA TODAY It really is starting to look like the holiday season in some stores “Retailers will always react to trends based on the consumer needs and wants,’’ says NRF spokeswoman Ana Serafin Smith. “Therefore, if the consumers are asking for holiday products earlier in the year, you are more than likely to see retailers start having a small assortment by late summer and build up their inventory as we move into the holiday season.’’ If fact, they might all be a little late. Selfridges, a famous, big department store in London, opened its holiday shop Aug. 1. From a business standpoint, retailers want to start cashing in on the crucial holiday season as early as possible. Holiday sales account for roughly 20% of total sales for the industry for the year - and as much as 40% for some individual retailers, according to the NRF. In November and December, 2015, sales totaled $632.8 million. Walmart shoppers can start stocking up on Christmas decorations before the end of this month. “We know many of our customers like to plan their holiday décor shopping early,’’ says Walmart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt. She noted that the company's holiday sales have kicked off in late September for the last several years.   Meanwhile, Macy’s has begun to roll out its holiday merchandise as well. The store in New York City's Herald Square is in the process of being fully set up, but already features pint-sized Santas, Victorian villages, and glittering baubles for the tree. “This is typical timing for us,’’ says Macy’s spokeswoman Holly Thomas. “It takes a while to get all of our stores set with the holiday trim shops, and we aim to have holiday décor merchandise available for our customers when many begin shopping.’’ Holiday hiring is also kicking into gear. a bevy of retailers have now announced they are looking to fill out their ranks. , Mass-merchandiser Target, for instance, plans to hire 70,000 holiday workers for its stores, and 7,500 seasonal workers to help out in its distribution and fulfillment centers. For the first time, Target will also have hiring events at all its stores on Oct. 14 and 15th. On a recent afternoon, Verdier France, 37, who was visiting New York City from France, browsed through Macy's holiday themed section. She found it a bit odd to see Christmas displays before summer had come to an end. “But in New York City, winter is so beautiful,’’ said France who was heading back home on Thursday. Thanks to the store's early holiday start,  "in September, I can see a little bit of it.’’ Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices More From USA TODAY Can Trump undermine abortion rights?

SALES 5 Secrets to Selling to the Fortune 500 Getting a foot in the door with the Walmarts, Apples and General Motors of the world isn't as hard as you might think. By Christina DesMarais Christina DesMarais is an Inc.com contributor who writes about the tech startup community, covering innovative ideas, news, and trends.

Email her at christinadesmarais (at) live (dot) com. @salubriousdish Contributor, Inc.com@salubriousdish WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Selling to huge profitable enterprises is the holy grail of any B2B company. But how do you get the Walmarts, Apples and General Motors of the world to bet on your products or services? Take some advice from a few companies which have done it. Check out these quotes from a handful of startup executives who say selling to the Fortune 500 isn't as hard as you might think, if you handle yourself right. 1. Teach them how to navigate their own purchase system. "When you are solving a problem in a new way, many people in the company you're trying to sell to don't know how to purchase your solution. 'Does IT pay for this?' or 'Does Marketing pay for this?' are two common questions we hear. This confusion can paralyze clients as it creates a huge barrier to overcome before they even try your product. You need to lower the barrier for getting the PO as low as possible. You could charge so little for a trial that they can put it on their corporate card. And if you have insight from prior experience, you can be their coach through the whole process, making sure that they are putting their best foot forward. This gets you the sale, and as important, makes your contact look like a hero." --Kristi Zuhlke, founder and CEO of market research data retrieval company KnowledgeHound. 2. Know your prospect's "burning platform." "[It's] that all-consuming issue that drives a company's business decisions. For example, we offer a virtual reality technology platform for retailers and consumer brands, whose burning platform usually includes moving faster as they compete with smaller, more nimble competitors. As such, when we talk about what we do, our focus is on how VR can speed up their store concept development, research, planning and activation processes. If the burning platform was to be innovative, we would talk about all of the creative ways our technology can eliminate bad ideas and focus on good ideas, [but] faster. Besides creating a sense of urgency, speaking to a Fortune 500 company in the context of their burning platform tells them that you know their business and are well-suited to help." --Brooks Augustine, chief customer officer of InContext Solutions, a provider of virtual reality solutions for retail. 3. Listen instead of selling. "We spend a lot of time making sure we find the right hiring managers to talk to, so when we do reach out we're doing so in a very natural way. And then, when we have our first meeting, we don't sell anything--we listen and learn. The insight we gain from listening--and the alignment it brings us with our prospects--is a big part of the success of our hiring-automation platform's focus on hourly workers and the on-demand workforce." --Keith Ryu, founder of recruiting software company OnboardIQ. 4. Don't be intimidated, they're people just like you. "No matter the size of the company you're talking to, you're ultimately connecting with a single person, who, like most people, probably likes things such as proof of success, kindness, a little sense of humor and not working with jerks. And second, from the very start focus on how you can be meaningfully helpful to a prospect. Listen to them, put yourself in their shoes, and offer them resources that will help them do their jobs better. If you are human--and again, not the self-serving-jerk kind--and show real value--not the fake kind--the sales will follow." --Craig Root, director of enterprise sales for Jellyvision, a communication platform which helps employees make benefits decisions. 5. Don't worry about Fortune 500 companies copying your idea for themselves. "All companies, no matter their size, have serious constraints on internal resources, in particular when it comes to technology and development. The fact is, it is often less costly for them to purchase your goods, services or in some cases, acquire your entire company, than it is to allocate a team and develop a new product from scratch. Once you have demonstrated to a Fortune 500 company that your product can be a true differentiator for them, it is essential that you convey the message that you will be giving them a valuable head start. And throw in your ability to continually innovate and pivot your development resources on a dime for good measure. No large company has claim to that benefit." --Heidi Brown, founder and COO of Options Away, a travel technology company.

With a number of its top buyers like Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. terminating their contracts with the company, and its aftermath wiping away 30% of its market capitalization, troubled Welspun India Ltd was already in the doghouse. Now comes news of two class action lawsuits against it on grounds that the Indian manufacturer fraudulently labelled its bedsheets and towels as premium Egyptian cotton. The woes of Welspun India don’t seem to be coming to an end any time soon. Market analysts are divided on the potential impact of these setbacks on the company’s business. Some have even suggested the initial reaction may be overdone. But regardless of whether other buyers follow suit and slash their dealings with it, there is no way around the massive trust deficit Welspun finds itself saddled with. What has taken a beating is the company’s “reputation capital”, described in a study by Jivas Chakravarthy of Chapman University, Ed deHaan of Stanford University and Shivaram Rajgopal of Emory University, as a genuine, if intangible, financial asset that is embedded in a company’s market value. So is it all over for Welspun? Maybe not. There is good reason why the company rose to the top of its game in the first place. Several reasons, in fact. ALSO READ | Wal-Mart stops selling cotton sheets made by Welspun Take a look at these testimonials before 22 August. The company was among the top three home textile manufacturers in the world, the largest home textile company in Asia and the leading home textile exporter to the US for four years in a row (2012-15). It is a vendor to 14 of top 30 global retailers and these include marquee names such as Bed Bath and Beyond Inc., Target, Macy’s Inc., Wal-Mart and JC Penney Co. Inc. For its exertions, the company was ranked No.1 for the last two years by US Home Textiles Today magazine in Top 15 Home Supplier Giants to USA. In 2015, it won the award for “highest direct to store delivery share” from Ikea AB, as well as the Green manufacturing excellence award from Frost & Sullivan. But along with that, for over two years starting 2014, it was also allegedly cheating its prime customers. Of course, after the revelations of fraud by employees at Wells Fargo and Co., cheating customers appears to be a global phenomenon and companies seem to treat being caught out as par for the course. Last November, a major investigation was launched into seven of Italy’s best-known olive oil companies for allegedly defrauding consumers by passing off inferior quality virgin olive oil as extra-virgin oil. And Big Auto and Big Pharma have been setting new standards in malfeasance. But common as it is, what distinguishes survivors of corporate busts is how they react to such situations. And that’s where Welspun has a choice. It can abandon itself to the buffetings of its actions while emulating a Ranbaxy or a Kingfisher in looking for a quick exit for the promoters. Or it can take the blow on its chin and resolve to come back wiser from its mistakes and stronger for its ordeal. Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson’s swift response in 1982 to the scandal that erupted following the death of seven people after consuming its best-selling painkiller Tylenol, which had been deliberately contaminated with cyanide, is considered the gold standard in addressing a corporate crisis of this nature.

Vitally it did not come out screaming its innocence and denying what happened. In a conference call with investors, it took the blame without any obfuscation with Rajesh Mandawewala, its managing director, stating: “There has been, let’s say, a failure on our part, so without any ambiguity the fault is on our side.” Welspun also appointed audit firm EY to review its processes. Of course, it is a long haul back. In the textile business the supply chain typically lasts from six to eight months. And with the festival season in the West coming up, no large retailer will take a chance on Welspun any time soon. In a sense, it gives the company the time to go back to its basics and fix the errors that crept into its systems. In the 1987 movie Wall Street, Hal Holbrook has a memorable dialogue: “Man looks in the abyss, there’s nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.” Welspun today is staring deep into the abyss. Can it find itself?

The station was manually shut down Sept. 5 due to issues with a valve in the system that provides water to the reactor for steam generation.

By December of this year 64 stores across the country will shut their doors for good. That includes Kmart stores in Manistee, Sault Ste. Marie, and Alpena. "I was like no way I was disappointed I guess," said Dawn Link. Kmart announcing that come December employees in 64 stores across the country will be out of a job. That includes in Manistee. "There's really not another Kmart in the area I'm guessing now the closest one is probably Muskegon so I will have to shop at Meijer or Walmart or Ludington something like that," said Dawn. Some local shoppers are upset. Now they will have to find another store that lets them do layaway. "I love Kmart we do a lot of layaway at Kmart because like Walmart doesn't do layaway except at Christmas time and I don't think Meijer does at all," she said. Local businesses around Kmart are also concerned what the closure could mean for them. "I was shocked when I first heard about it was kind of scared because we are next door and I was worried it might have a bigger impact on us or we might have to close because they are closing," said Mackenzie Martin. Fiesta Salons says even though they could lose some of their walk-ins at first, in the long run, they think business will be just fine. "People do go in there to shop and I think that it will impact our walk-ins people go in there see us and then come in," she said. And even though the employees of Kmart say they can't comment, the local community still feels for their loss. "I know how hard it is to get out there and find a job and find something that you like and I feel sorry for everybody in Kmart that has to find another job," Mackenzie said.

Published Sep 19th, 2016 7:04 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores has completed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com following the expiration of the waiting period under federal regulations, with the Jet.com CEO reporting directly to Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. McMillon made the announcement Monday (Sept. 19) via an Instagram post and more details were provided on the terms of Jet CEO and founder Marc Lore in a late Monday filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. McMillon noted in his blog post that the deal builds on Wal-Mart’s strong e-commerce foundation and is intended to help accelerate growth and deliver a seamless shopping experience for customers. Walmart.com and Jet.com will operate as separate brands, while leveraging technology and talent across both entities. “We’re thrilled to welcome the Jet.com team to the Walmart family and excited to expand the ways we serve our current customers and reach new customers online,” McMillon said. “Jet brings a unique approach and technology that puts customers in control of their experience, helping them find additional ways to save.” Lore now joins Walmart’s leadership team, serving as executive vice president at Walmart and president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce in the U.S. He will lead Walmart.com and Jet.com, reporting to McMillon. “I can’t wait to jump in and get started,” Lore said. “I’ll be spending a lot of time with the team in the coming weeks and months focused on scaling Walmart.com and Jet.com, building on our solid foundations. Together we will be stronger and move even faster to reimagine the future of shopping.” Marc Lore, Jet.com CEO Lore will receive slightly more than 3.554 million shares of restricted Wal-Mart shares as a portion of the $300 million in equity payments noted in the deal. Wal-Mart signed Lore to a 5-year employment contract, during which time the restricted stock will vest. Lore’s salary was not disclosed in the filing but the stock payment is tied to the fact that Lore must remain employed all five years. The stock will slowly vest over the next five-year period. If Lore is terminated or leaves on his own before then the shares will be voided. Also in the filing, Wal-Mart expects the Jet.com acquisition will dilute earnings by 5 cents per share this fiscal year as a result of operating losses and one-time transaction costs, assuming the transaction closes near the beginning of Wal-Mart’s fiscal fourth quarter. The retailer said if the deal closes earlier there could be some marginal dilution above its previous earnings estimates for fiscal 2017. Retail experts have said retaining Lore and his management team is a major positive for Wal-Mart but keeping him engaged for the full five years could be a challenge given that Lore is an entrepreneur and innovator that has often gone his own way. Some have said working for a retailer with a large bureaucracy may be tough for Lore who is seen more as a maverick than a company executive who will now working largely at the pleasure of the Walton family and the board.

She said the man's 21-year-old wife kicked in her door, destroyed kitchen and bathroom items and took all the food out of the refrigerator. She left before police arrived. The woman's husband reportedly was yelling profanities and would not calm down. He was issued a summons for disorderly conduct. Mansfield Senior High School, 124 N. Linden Road — A 15-year-old boy was issued a summons for juvenile cigarette or other tobacco products violation on Monday morning. Police reported seeing him smoking near the school. 300 block of Hammond Ave., Mansfield — A 30-year-old man reported Monday morning the theft of a new weed-eater from the front porch. Walmart, 2485 Possum Run Road, Mansfield — A police officer who saw a 25-year-old woman standing in the south vestibule, crying, around 12:30 a.m. Monday, asked if she was okay and heard her admit that she had stolen from the store because she wanted to go to jail. The woman told the officer she was a drug addict and needed to go to jail to "get clean." Police reports said she had DVDs and rings worth a total of about $80 in her purse. The police officer was at Walmart because of a call late Sunday night from a woman who said a 35-year-old man took her debit card and used it at Walmart to buy items at the store. The police report said the man bought items for about $12 and got $40 in cash back. Videotape showed the suspect purchasing a box of syringes from the pharmacy counter using the card. Police were unable to locate the suspect after he reportedly was kicked out of Harmony House about a week before. 200 block of Rae Ave., Mansfield — A 20-year-old man told police shortly before 2 a.m. Monday that he was walking with a friend when two unidentified suspects, both wearing all black and about his own age, approached him on the bike trail. The man, who had visible injuries to his face, said one man struck him in the head with a silver handgun and the other struck him in the head with a 2-by-4, demanding money and a cellphone, which he did not have on him. City firefighters took the man to OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital, where he was not immediately able to give a statement to officers because of his medical condition. The News Journal does not identify people charged with misdemeanor offenses in the Emergency Calls. This is a fairness issue related to the large number of incidents that we cannot report in the wide geographic area being covered. Offenders are identified through subsequent court listings. 93 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2cz6ktt TOP VIDEOS 'Script' Ohio 0:45 OSU cornerback Marshon Lattimore 0:27 Saturday is "payday" for Buckeyes 0:33 OSU offensive coordinator Ed Warinner 0:33 What changed for OSU? 0:20 Lexington at Clyde football 3:11 Lexington wins 0:14 Sleep-Out for the Homeless fundraiser 1:24 Big catch for Buckeyes 0:31 Every week's a dogfight 0:21 Is Samuel being used right? 0:20 Defending his offense 1:10 Halloween parade 0:42 Road to Wrestling: The Tryout 3:35 MANCI Cattle Auction 2:52 Road to Wrestling: Day 40 0:47 Mansfield police mentoring kids at Friendly House 2:25 Make A Difference Day Food Drive 2:49 Butler Apple Festival 2:12 Lillith recovering from being shot 1:52 OSU's Raekwon McMillan 0:38 OSU's Parris Campbell 0:19 Ohio State DB Marshon Lattimore 0:17 Big Guns 20: William vs. Odom 0:53 Big Guns 20: White vs. Johnson 0:30 Big Guns 20: Cody Stevens vs. John De Jesus Highlights 2:59 Road to Wrestling: Day 27 3:25 So much depth at OSU 0:19 Buckeyes act like underdogs 0:23 OSU: competition at WR 0:31 Final Horn Week 6 6:49 Lt.

Published Sep 19th, 2016 4:55 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas K-Mart store closures in Springdale, Jonesboro and 58 other sites across the country are not a surprise to retail analysts, consumers and employees who have seen the once iconic retail brand fade thanks to the rise of Wal-Mart, Target and other retailers. About two dozen, curious bargain-hunting shoppers roamed the thinly stocked aisles at the Springdale Big K Discount Center on Monday (Sept. 19). Store officials said the last of day of business for the two Arkansas locations will be Dec. 11 and clearance sales begin Sept. 22. Howard Riefs, corporate spokesman for K-Mart, told Talk Business & Politics that making the difficult, said it was a tough but necessary decision to close the stores at 2010 S. Caraway Road in Jonesboro and 3142 W. Sunset Ave. in Springdale. “It’s important for you to know that until then, the stores will remain open for customers until mid-December. … We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and are accelerating the closing of unprofitable stores as we have previously announced,” he said. Earlier this summer the retailer closed 74 K-Mart stores and roughly 60 Sears locations. This round of closures involves 64 stores across 28 states, including Arkansas. Riefs declined to say how many workers in the two Arkansas stores would be displaced. He said displaced workers such as salaried managers will be eligible for severance and have the opportunity to apply for open positions at Sears stores in their area. He said most of the workers are part-time, hourly and do not qualify for severance packages. Riefs said K-Mart Shop Your Way Members will continue to be able to shop online for merchandise after the store closures are completed. The retailer hopes to retain a portion of the sales associated with the closing stores. “We are always disappointed to see a business close its doors and displace workers, but these decisions like this are not made locally. The strong economy here today is a positive for those displaced workers who have a high chance to land another job quickly and that is my sincere hope,” said Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse. Shoppers in the Springdale store on Monday said they weren’t surprised to see the store close because many people forget the store is there because there is so little marketing and the location while on a main thoroughfare does not face the street and is partially hidden by a Bank of America branch which does face the street. Talk Business & Politics price checked items at the K-Mart store and found prices for household cleaner, dog food, shampoo and other consumables were at least 10% higher than at nearby Walmart and Dollar General stores. The store did offer two “Blue Light Specials” during a 40-minute period around noon on Monday. A few customers lined up to purchase dog treats and pet items priced at $5 during the special were marked down to $1. The same was done for some clearance household cleaning items as well. There were six registers at the front of the Springdale store and just one checker open at mid-day on Monday. Standing in line, J.W. Turner said he lives in the neighborhood and heard the store was closing but it came as no surprise to him. “It’s convenient for us, but there really aren’t any bargains here and the service is spotty,” he said. A sign in the K-Mart store in Springdale addresses the layaway policy for the closing store. Store officials in the Jonesboro store declined comment on the pending closure except to say the doors will close for good once the clearance sale is complete. ‘LACK OF ATTENTION’ TO BRAND “K-Mart has struggled to find a brand identity but one could argue that it hasn’t tried that hard to do so, “ said Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail. “Considering the proactive and aggressive moves that its competitors are making, K-Mart can’t sit idly by and hope for the best, yet that seems to be the approach up to this point.” Spieckerman said since hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert took over Sears and K-Mart, Walmart, Target and dollar retailers have really upped their games – yet K-Mart still sits as an undifferentiated big box. To be fair, she said the number of store closings K-Mart announced represents a small percentage, but there are no indications the remaining stores will gain strength. K-Mart began the year with 870 stores and soon will be under 800 for the U.S. market. Ten years ago, KMart had 1,416 stores. Sears, its parent company, has suffered a similar downsizing with about 730 stores operating from the 2,427 a decade ago. “It was clear when Lampert took over Sears and K-Mart that he wasn’t a traditional ‘merchant prince’ and initially, that looked to be a good things. In fact, many of the early innovations that he introduced, including click-and-collect, making Sears’ private brands available to other retailers and operating a stand-alone innovation lab, were quite forward-thinking at the time and have since been adopted by other retailers. At the end of the day, though, the lack of attention to brand identity and differentiated store environments and shopping experience have been hard to overcome,” Spieckerman said. FINANCIAL TAILSPIN Just last week Moody’s analysts speculated that Sears and K-mart don’t have enough money – or access to money – to stay in business. In a note published Sept. 14, Moody’s’ downgraded Sears’ liquidity rating, noting the “retailer is bleeding cash” and will have to continue to rely on outside funding or the sale of assets, such as real estate, to sustain operations. “We recognize the risks associated with relying on these sources and continued shareholder support to finance its negative operating cash flow which is estimated by Moody’s to be approximately $1.5 billion this year,” the analysts wrote. “The ratings …reflect our view on the uncertainty of the viability of the Kmart franchise in particular given its meaningful market share erosion.” Sears reported in August its cash had fallen to $276 million from $1.8 billion a year ago. The reason cited for the drastic cash burn is plunging sales at K-Mart and Sears. The company reported net sales of $5.7 billion in the second quarter, a decline of 8.8% from a year ago. Same-store sales were down 3.3% at K-Mart and 7% lower at Sears. Since K-Mart merged with Sears in 2005, the discount retailer has seen its sales drop by $27 billion. Moody’s said K-Mart’s parent Sears has debts of $3.5 billion and an unfunded pension and post-retirement obligation of $2.1 billion, placng the company in need of cash if it’s to fund 2016 and 2017 minimum pension contributions. Neil Stern, partner at retail consultant at McMillanDoolittle, recently said it looks as if the retailer’s days are numbered. He was quoted by Fortune recently on the demise of K-Mart and Sears. “It’s incredibly hard to run a retail company when every quarter you get less sales and less customers coming through the door,” Stern said. “You can only cut costs for so long and sell assets.” COMPETITIVE LOSS “Sam Walton taught us to be on guard because everyone is competition. For too long K-Mart management has been asleep at the wheel,” said Peggy Knight retail consultant at Vendor Masters and former executive for Walmart and Sam’s Club. “During my tenure at Walmart and Sam’s Club we viewed K-Mart as a competitor but as the years rolled on it became clear that K-Mart management was too focused on profits and losses and not nearly as focused on customer service and taking care of their employees,” Knight told Talk Business & Politics. A short time after Knight left Walmart she was recruited by K-Mart but said she was not interested in working for a company with so little focus on its people. Knight said it’s been about 10 years since she was in a K-Mart store. She said the brand lapsed from the consciousness of most consumers and the retailer hasn’t done anything to stop it. “When I went to work for Walmart in 1983, K-Mart was the No. 1 retailer in the U.S., but without a team of leaders working around a common goals that reign was doomed to fail for K-Mart. At Walmart we were not allowed to make excuses for the weather or the election,” Knight recalled. Knight also predicts K-Mart’s days are numbered because she thinks they gave up years ago when the retailer couldn’t execute and properly market something like the Blue Light Special for which it had once been known. “When I heard they were bringing this back, I thought maybe the retailer realizes the importance of retailtainment and I expected to see them market the return to basics. But they do no marketing of their brand to speak of and consumers today don’t know who they are, or they have largely forgotten,” Knight said.

Business Highlights Business by The Associated Press Posted Sep 19, 2016 3:48 pm MST Last Updated Sep 19, 2016 at 4:40 pm MST ___ With economic outlook hazy, Fed likely to leave rates alone WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve has repeatedly signalled that it’s edging closer to resuming interest rate hikes — it just doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. When the Fed ends its latest policy meeting Wednesday, it’s expected to leave the short-term rate it controls at the low level where it’s been for 10 months. In the view of most economists, the Fed wants more time to assess the health of the U.S. economy, the risks from overseas and the prospect that low inflation will soon reach the central bank’s 2 per cent target rate. Many think the next rate increase will come in December. ___ Banks focus more on new accounts — and the fees they bring NEW YORK (AP) — When Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, it won’t be just his bank under fire, it’ll be the entire industry. Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers’ money without telling them and more to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don’t face the same allegations of fraud, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. ___ US stocks can’t hang onto gains, finish lower NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. ___ With some gas stations dry, pipeline works to send more fuel ATLANTA (AP) — Gas prices spiked and drivers found “out of service” bags covering pumps as the gas shortage in the South rolled into the work week, raising fears that the scattered disruptions could become more widespread. The shortage is blamed on a pipeline rupture and leak of at least 252,000 gallons of gas in Alabama. The pipeline company has two main lines and said Monday that it is shipping “significant volumes” on the second of the two lines to mitigate the impact of the interruption on the other line. ___ Samsung says it has found no battery problem in China SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Monday that its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found no battery problem, reducing concerns that its smartphone crisis had expanded. The tech giant said it was not able to investigate a second reported fire because it could not obtain that phone. The two accounts of Galaxy Note 7 fires were widely reported by Chinese and South Korean media, raising alarms because company had already said a recall wasn’t necessary in China because the phones sold there did not have the manufacturing error that caused fires elsewhere. ___ Carnival Corp. launching 3 TV shows about vacations, travel NEW YORK (AP) — Carnival Corp. is launching three TV programs about travel, vacations and cruising that will air on ABC, NBC and The CW networks beginning Oct. 1. Each show will have its own real-life narrative exploring seaside destinations, in-port adventures or the vacation experiences of real travellers. Carnival Corp. owns more than 100 ships across 10 different cruise line brands, including Holland America, Princess, Fathom and Cunard in addition to Carnival Cruise Line. The shows will feature ships from all of Carnival Corp.’s cruise brands over the course of various episodes. ___ Australia’s busiest container port leased for $7.3 billion SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian-led consortium has won a 50-year lease on the country’s busiest container port for 9.7 billion Australian dollars ($7.3 billion), officials announced Monday. The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. The lease is the latest in a series of port privatizations in Australia in recent years. ___ Wal-Mart completes purchase of Jet.com NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world’s largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients’ families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl’s to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl’s plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide. The departments store operator said it started hiring in August for the holiday season and expects most jobs to be filled by the middle of November. Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,235.03. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4 cents, or 2.8 per cent, to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas retreated 1 cent to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers' money without telling them and more to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don't face the same allegations of fraud, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. ___ US stocks can't hang onto gains, finish lower NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. ___ With some gas stations dry, pipeline works to send more fuel ATLANTA (AP) — Gas prices spiked and drivers found "out of service" bags covering pumps as the gas shortage in the South rolled into the work week, raising fears that the scattered disruptions could become more widespread. The shortage is blamed on a pipeline rupture and leak of at least 252,000 gallons of gas in Alabama. The pipeline company has two main lines and said Monday that it is shipping "significant volumes" on the second of the two lines to mitigate the impact of the interruption on the other line. ___ Samsung says it has found no battery problem in China SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Monday that its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found no battery problem, reducing concerns that its smartphone crisis had expanded. The tech giant said it was not able to investigate a second reported fire because it could not obtain that phone. The two accounts of Galaxy Note 7 fires were widely reported by Chinese and South Korean media, raising alarms because company had already said a recall wasn't necessary in China because the phones sold there did not have the manufacturing error that caused fires elsewhere. ___ Carnival Corp. launching 3 TV shows about vacations, travel NEW YORK (AP) — Carnival Corp. is launching three TV programs about travel, vacations and cruising that will air on ABC, NBC and The CW networks beginning Oct. 1. Each show will have its own real-life narrative exploring seaside destinations, in-port adventures or the vacation experiences of real travelers. Carnival Corp. owns more than 100 ships across 10 different cruise line brands, including Holland America, Princess, Fathom and Cunard in addition to Carnival Cruise Line.

The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia's sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. The lease is the latest in a series of port privatizations in Australia in recent years. ___ Wal-Mart completes purchase of Jet.com NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world's largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart technology" that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients' families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics' Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl's to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl's plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide.

Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03.

When the Fed ends its latest policy meeting Wednesday, it’s expected to leave the short-term rate it controls at the low level where it’s been for 10 months. In the view of most economists, the Fed wants more time to assess the health of the U.S. economy, the risks from overseas and the prospect that low inflation will soon reach the central bank’s 2 per cent target rate. Many think the next rate increase will come in December. ___ Banks focus more on new accounts — and the fees they bring NEW YORK (AP) — When Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, it won’t be just his bank under fire, it’ll be the entire industry. Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers’ money without telling them and more to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don’t face the same allegations of fraud, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. ___ US stocks can’t hang onto gains, finish lower NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. ___ With some gas stations dry, pipeline works to send more fuel ATLANTA (AP) — Gas prices spiked and drivers found “out of service” bags covering pumps as the gas shortage in the South rolled into the work week, raising fears that the scattered disruptions could become more widespread. The shortage is blamed on a pipeline rupture and leak of at least 252,000 gallons of gas in Alabama. The pipeline company has two main lines and said Monday that it is shipping “significant volumes” on the second of the two lines to mitigate the impact of the interruption on the other line. ___ Samsung says it has found no battery problem in China SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Monday that its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found no battery problem, reducing concerns that its smartphone crisis had expanded. The tech giant said it was not able to investigate a second reported fire because it could not obtain that phone. The two accounts of Galaxy Note 7 fires were widely reported by Chinese and South Korean media, raising alarms because company had already said a recall wasn’t necessary in China because the phones sold there did not have the manufacturing error that caused fires elsewhere. ___ Carnival Corp. launching 3 TV shows about vacations, travel NEW YORK (AP) — Carnival Corp. is launching three TV programs about travel, vacations and cruising that will air on ABC, NBC and The CW networks beginning Oct. 1. Each show will have its own real-life narrative exploring seaside destinations, in-port adventures or the vacation experiences of real travellers. Carnival Corp. owns more than 100 ships across 10 different cruise line brands, including Holland America, Princess, Fathom and Cunard in addition to Carnival Cruise Line. The shows will feature ships from all of Carnival Corp.’s cruise brands over the course of various episodes. ___ Australia’s busiest container port leased for $7.3 billion SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian-led consortium has won a 50-year lease on the country’s busiest container port for 9.7 billion Australian dollars ($7.3 billion), officials announced Monday. The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. The lease is the latest in a series of port privatizations in Australia in recent years. ___ Wal-Mart completes purchase of Jet.com NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world’s largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients’ families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl’s to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl’s plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide. The departments store operator said it started hiring in August for the holiday season and expects most jobs to be filled by the middle of November. Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,235.03. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4 cents, or 2.8 per cent, to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas retreated 1 cent to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

It creates moments that people will remember forever. For example, Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon at WrestleMania 10 is considered one of the best matches in WWE history. It was for the Intercontinental championship the same night Bret Hart fought Yokozuna for the WWE title. That night was memorable for many reasons, but professional wrestling is about more than one night. Remember CM Punk’s WWE championship victory over John Cena at Money in the Bank 2011 in Chicago, Illinois? That was a moment that arguably created the legacy Punk cemented that evening in Chicago against the Face that Runs the Place. Another great moment was Dolph Ziggler’s Money in the Bank briefcase cash-in after WrestleMania 29 in New York. He was a huge fan favorite, and it culminated in one of the best babyface pops in WWE history. [Image by WWE.com] Another thing pro wrestling is good for lies in the controversies that often arise from the squared circle and the many superstars. Whether it is nude pictures, controversial statements or hatred towards one another, it seems that wrestling always finds itself in the headlines for a negative reason. Buff Bagwell is the latest example of that. He’s a former wrestling star turned entertainment star who was in the wrestling industry for a long time. So, his opinion is quite valid compared to others in the Internet Wrestling Community. Bagwell decided to direct comments towards CM Punk, who isn’t the most well-liked anymore, and he got brutally beaten in his UFC debut against Mickey Gall at UFC 203. Bagwell used that popularity towards Punk’s name to criticize him and Samoa Joe on the Pancakes and Powerslams podcast. “Here’s how I look at it. If I was a promoter like Vince McMahon or Ted Turner, if I was trying to make money in the wrestling industry, I would judge it by having a person walk through Walmart,” he said. “If CM Punk walked through Walmart even as popular as he is, he’s not going to get noticed as much as Hulk Hogan walking through Walmart The reason why I say Walmart, is that’s our fan base.” “To the world of wrestling fans, who’s going to be Sting’s tag team partner? The options are Lex Luger, Marcus Bagwell, and Samoa Joe. I mean, who in the heck is Samoa Joe? And Luger wasn’t fit enough, so I fit the part perfectly,” Bagwell said. The problem that WWE fans can’t handle is that Bagwell is absolutely right. It’s mostly due to professional wrestling not being nearly as marketable as it once was. There’s a reason why John Cena, Hulk Hogan, and the Rock are three of the most over men of all-time. They are also big in the mainstream media. Hogan is a pop culture icon. The Rock is the highest paid actor in all of Hollywood, earning $64.5 million for his film roles in 2015. [Image by WWE.com] Cena is doing a television show a week it seems. Stone Cold Steve Austin is also in that conversation and has done multiple movies. He’s considered the most over man in wrestling history. Wrestling isn’t quite as popular with the declining ratings and low buy rates for PPV’s. Everything is changing, which Bagwell indirectly alluded to. CM Punk really doesn’t miss pro wrestling, and why should he? Ratings are terrible and with the return of Monday Night Football, it’s only going to get worse. For Punk, his quest to return to the UFC will take a long time, and it will only enhance his popularity to pass the Walmart test. His coach said multiple MMA promotions would love Punk to be in his or her promotion. Perhaps if he passes the Walmart test, he would return to the UFC and become a household name.

Elise Bryant was convicted of felony child abuse in a Mississippi court, but managed to negotiate a plea deal with prosecutors. In the terms of the agreement, the state recommended a sentence of 10 years for the 26-year-old, with an eight-year suspension and two years served under house arrest. She will also be closely watched for three years and has been instructed to pay a fine of $1,000 to a children’s fund and $1,500 to the court. On the night of August 21, 2014, police officers had responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex in Gulfport, Mississippi, where the little boy lived with the biological father and stepmother, Elise Bryant. Neighbors were the ones who called the police around 10:30 a.m. to report the assault on the child. When police officers arrived on the scene, they found Bryant, who was 24-years-old at the time, kneeling over the one-year-old child and punching him repeatedly in the face. Police said the boy’s legs were bound together and that he had a swollen head and bruised arms. His stepmother was arrested and he was taken to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries. Assistant District Attorney Crosby Parker, who described the incident as a “very troubling case,” revealed that the plea deal was worked out in agreement between the defense and the prosecution, but ultimately approved by the presiding judge, Roger Clark. Baltimore police officer enters an Alford Plea – What is an Alford Plea? http://t.co/ip2hWTrMF9 pic.twitter.com/ol4Gnx2r00 — Jeffrey S. Crockett (@Crockett_Law) October 13, 2015 Prosecutors had allowed Elsie Bryant to file a so-called “Alford plea,” which allows defendants to plead guilty and at the same time still maintain that they are innocent. This means that Bryant did not confess to her crimes, but rather admitted that the state prosecution had enough evidence to convict her. Elsie Bryant’s defense attorney had pushed forward a theory that the child got his injuries from an accident and not at the hands of his stepmother. Parker said even though the prosecution’s case was not strengthened because of a lack of witnesses and medical evidence to show how the child got his injuries, all fingers still pointed to Elise Bryant as the one responsible. “The defense had retained an expert to put forth testimony that the boy’s injuries were consistent with an accident. However, the state expected to put forth evidence that the child had Wal-Mart bags tied around his ankles and a mark on the head and lip when officers arrived.” The Assistant District Attorney went on further to make his point. “The tying of the legs was obviously very disturbing, but what makes the case a felony is the mark to the head and actual injuries. Fortunately, the child was released that day with a diagnosis on the head and a superficial lip laceration.” This is not the first time that a parent would be using the Alford plea to strike a deal with prosecutors. Stephanie Ramirez was sentenced to 20 years in prison despite triggering the plea for first-degree child abuse which caused the death of her 21-month-old daughter. Her husband had beaten the girl badly, fracturing her ribs and cracking her skull. Prosecutors say Williams returned from work and refused to seek medical assistance for her daughter because her husband said it would get Child Protective Services involved. The child died of internal injuries. Doctor said the young girl’s life could have been saved if emergency surgery had been carried out quickly to repair her damaged organs. Paul Thomas, father of a five-year-old boy also triggered the Alford plea and was sentenced to 15 months in prison for felony child abuse and neglect. He was looking at a maximum sentence of 10 years for leaving his children alone at home as he went out with his girlfriend. The boy was declared missing and found in a septic tank four days later. Alexis Raiford, in her own case, was held accountable for the death of her three-year-old son, Zyon Thompson. Prosecutors say that the woman did not kill her son, but did nothing to stop her husband and another man from beating him up frequently. Prosecutors say the boy was denied medical treatment and fell seriously ill before he later died. A child abuse expert revealed that if he had been taken to a hospital, he would have survived. Doctors say he was covered from “head to toe” in bruises and despite claims by his mother that he got injured playing, said his injuries were “not consistent with the day-to-day activities of a 3-year-old.” [Featured Image by Dennis Stern/Shutterstock] Now Watch This: Burglars Break Into Home While Owners Asleep On Couch Now Read This: Maryland Teen Beaten Up During Donald Trump Student Protest Share 1 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Tito Ojo-Medubi Tags: child abuse, child death, crime against children Comments LATEST HEADLINES Angelina Jolie’s Secret Life Exposed!

I now would like you to help me get a framed article by Paul Harvey to every police person nationwide — starting in Pottsville. Recently, I heard Paul Harvey’s now-famous radio broadcast of “What Are Policeman Made Of.” It brought tears to my eyes, and I immediately thought every policeman should have a free copy to help boost morale in these troubling times. You can hear it by going to Paul Harvey on Google. Staples and Wal-Mart helped me with the Glenn Miller concert and trips to Washington for the WWII veterans, and I asked them for help again. They agreed, and Staples is supplying the certificates and the printing and Wal-Mart is giving me a discount on the frames. My hope is to have a picture of a chief or other representative receiving the framed certificates for their officers from Staples and Wal-Mart managers who helped supply the materials needed. I could use this photo to help the corporations decide to supply the help nationally so I would not need a fundraising group in every state. Please call me at 570-573-0242 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. if you are interested in receiving a certificate for yourself or department. Hopefully, this letter will help me reach some of the smaller police departments in your coverage area that are not responding to my calls. George E.

Erika Burch, who took the photos, said she was shopping when she noticed the girl crying and begging the man to let go of her hair. "She was saying 'please stop, I promise I won't do it again please stop!'" Burch said in a Facebook post. "I took my phone out snapped pictures and then told him to let the little girl's hair go!" RELATED: Texas mother accused of putting child in oven Burch said the man told her to mind her own business, but she had no intention of backing down. She confronted the man several times, eventually screaming at him to let go of the child, and then called police.   "I have three little girls of my own," Burch said Tuesday. "I'll be damned if I'll ever let anybody pull them by the hair of their heads."  RELATED: CPS twice stepped in to help children allegedly killed by mom After leaving the store, Burch said she remained concerned about the child's well-being. She decided to post the photos she'd taken to Facebook, and soon the images had been shared by thousands of people.

"I'm just trying to stand up for a little girl who has no voice," Burch said. "I've done everything now that I know I can do." Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard said police received a call about the incident at about 4:45 p.m. on Monday. The man, whom Broussard did not identify, told police that his three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her.  Broussard said police investigators are concerned about the incident, noting that "there are proper ways of doing discipline" and that when parents cross the line to abuse it can have a lasting impact on a child's well-being.  CPS spokeswoman Tejal Patel said the investigation is in the early stages and that in cases like this, investigators will work with police to see whether there is a pattern of inappropriate discipline and determine whether the agency can provide services to assist the family in question.  Breaking News SAPD: Handgun licensee shoots man who was firing gun into air Driver dies after pole splits car in half in Texas Son of TX congressman found after strange disappearance The Latest Duncan retirement ticket prices near all-time high Authorities raid TX ‘concentration camp’ horse ranch Emergency room wait times at hospitals around S.A.

Erika Burch Erika Burch wrote that she and her husband were shopping at the store in Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston, on Monday. She said the man had wrapped the girl's hair around the handle of a shopping cart and was pulling her through the store. The girl was saying: "Please stop! I promise I won't do it again," Burch wrote. After taking several pictures, Burch confronted the man, who told her to mind her own business, she said. An officer in the store approached and said he needed to wait for his sergeant, Burch wrote. But she said the sergeant told her that the man had "the right to discipline his children."  Burch said she posted the pictures on Facebook in hopes that other people would press authorities to look into the incident. "Nobody stands up for anyone, not even children!" she wrote. "Now this baby had to go home with this monster thinking that nobody cared about her." The Cleveland Police Department posted on Facebook on Tuesday that it had received a number of calls about the incident and was investigating along with Child Protective Services. Cleveland police Chief Darrel Broussard told KPRC-TV that authorities were "very concerned for the well-being of the child." So far, no charges have been filed.

They swept both events in 2003 and earned another victory in 2010. Johnson leads the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in average finishing position at New Hampshire with 10.190. NEW HAMPSHIRE DRIVER RATING: According to NASCAR’s loop data statistics, Johnson has the fourth-best driver rating at New Hampshire with a score of 100.8 during the past 10 years at the track. The driver rating is a formula that combines wins, top-15 finishes, average running position while on the lead lap, average speed under green, fastest lap, most laps led and lead-lap finishes. The maximum a driver can earn in each race is 150 points. The driver rating number is used pre-race as a prediction tool and post-race as a performance evaluator. IMPENDING MILESTONES: Johnson only needs one more top-10 finish to become the 13th driver in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series to post 325 or more top-10 finishes. He currently has 324 top-10s.

The 23-year-old, who is filling in for Earnhardt while he continues to recover from a concussion, also led six laps near the end of the race starting with Lap 243, making for a career total of nine laps led in Cup competition. Bowman earned the No. 88 team its first top-10 result since Earnhardt’s second-place finish at Pocono Raceway in June. BOWMAN AT NHMS: Bowman will be back in action in the No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS this weekend at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, where he first subbed for Earnhardt in July. In his first race with the No. 88 team at NHMS in July, the young driver was running solidly in the top 10 before a cut tire relegated him to a 26th-place finish. He’ll return to New Hampshire for his sixth Cup start at the 1.058-mile track, looking to earn his second top-10 finish in just his fourth race in the No. 88 Chevrolet SS. He also has two NASCAR XFINITY Series starts at the “Magic Mile,” earning top-10 finishes both times. SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES: As part of the “Many Sides of Dale” campaign, Nationwide gave small-business owners a chance to have their business featured on the TV panel of the No. 88 Nationwide Chevrolet SS during this weekend’s race in New Hampshire. Bubba-N-Frank’s Smokehouse BBQ of Carrolton, Virginia, will be featured on the car as the contest winner and the owners will also be treated to a VIP race weekend experience, courtesy of Nationwide. As the No. 1 small business insurer in the country, Nationwide remains the carrier of choice for more than 500,000 small-business clients — including Earnhardt. EARNHARDT IN ENTREPRENEUR: Earnhardt, whose small businesses are protected by Nationwide, was featured on Entrepreneur.com this past week. In the article, he gives leadership advice to other entrepreneurs and small business owners, focusing on the importance of having strong relationships with the people who work both with and for him. The article can be viewed here.

Hendrick Motorsports HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE: At New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Hendrick Motorsports has nine wins, seven pole positions, 42 top-five finishes and 72 top-10s. Kahne most recently visited Victory Lane for the organization at the track in 2012. ORGANIZATION STATS: To date, Hendrick Motorsports has totals of 242 victories, 209 pole positions, 1,002 top-five finishes and 1,677 top-10 finishes in Sprint Cup competition. Its teams have led 65,698 laps since 1984. QUOTABLE / “New Hampshire is a tough track and track position is very important because getting around traffic can be very difficult. We have three top 10s in a row and my team has been a doing a great job of bringing fast cars to the track.” – Kasey Kahne on racing at New Hampshire “It’s just so hard to pass at New Hampshire – that’s the first thing that comes to my mind. It’s a tough place. It’s very easy to get frustrated when you catch somebody and it’s just so hard to get around them. At that racetrack, it’s a very fine line of being too low on the racetrack or being too high. The paving seams are very thick and wide and can upset your corner a lot. I think keeping that stuff in mind is the biggest thing that I think of when it comes to Loudon and the challenges you face. Things can go wrong there just as fast as they can anywhere else but I do think the frustration level sometimes can raise easier there than it can other places. But if you have your car driving like you want it to and you’re taking the correct approach throughout the day, then it shouldn’t be any different than the other tracks.” -Chase Elliott on racing at New Hampshire “No words can describe the disappointment I have for what happened in Chicago with the pit road speeding penalty. All you can do is let it soak in and come back next week and be at 100 percent again and get ready to take this Lowe’s car to Victory Lane. We had a lot of speed at New Hampshire last time out and we know what we need to do when we get there.” – Jimmie Johnson on looking ahead to New Hampshire “Everyone on this No. 88 team has been working very hard and our communication has been great. I’ve been able to run up front every race and that shows how good Hendrick Motorsports is and how good we can be. Getting our first top-10 at Chicago last weekend was really good. I’m more confident than I’ve ever been going back to Loudon. We had a really fast race car last time, so I think we have a good opportunity this weekend.” – Alex Bowman on his Chicago finish and racing at New Hampshire ** The opinions expressed on this site are not necessarily those of the publisher.

Ken Gart, tasked with shepherding Gov. John Hickenlooper’s $100 million “Pedal Colorado” biking plan, said Tuesday that he had corralled “business and community leaders” to create a new professional bike racing series based in Denver and Richmond, Va., where the 2015 UCI Road World Championships were held. Four-day races are planned in both states next summer, running from hubs in Richmond and Denver. Gart said the series will feature national musical acts, a festival, athlete interaction, mass-participation events and “spoke events,” like a long-stage in the mountains or a one-day hill climb spinning off from the main event. “We have assembled a group of community-minded investors as well as a strong leadership team whose sole mission is to broaden the enthusiasm for cycling,” Gart, who is chairman of the new RPM Events Group, said in a statement. “This new bike series will provide communities with sustainable, engaging cycling events for participants and fans to enjoy.” Related Articles August 18, 2016 USA Pro Challenge replacement in the works for 2017 August 2, 2016 USA Pro Challenge dies with departure of race chief Shawn Hunter February 12, 2016 USA Pro Challenge won’t race in 2016 September 30, 2015 USA Pro Challenge owners give up the race, opens door for new ownership model RPM Events Group is backed by these investors: the Gart family, Liberty Global, David Koff, a partner at InterMedia Partners investment fund and former executive at Liberty Media, and Denver philanthropist Ben Walton, a grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Tim Miller, who led Virginia’s 2010 bid to land the 2015 Road World Championships, will serve as chief operating officer for the group. Professional cycling has a long history of failing in the United States. Most recently, the popular USA Pro Challenge folded after struggling to land deep-pocketed sponsors to support the seven-day traverse across Colorado that lured as many as 1 million spectators every August from 2010 to 2015. Similar multi-stage tours featuring the biggest names in professional cycling in Georgia and Missouri have foundered in the last decade. Only the Amgen Tour of California, owned by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, and the Larry H. Miller Tour of Utah have persisted. The cost of moving an entire city of athletes, organizers and support teams across Colorado every night for six nights proved expensive and the USA Pro Challenge bled cash. RPM Events Group hopes that enlisting public participation in the racing and anchoring annual events out of Denver and Richmond will keep costs down, forging a sustainable model that could revive pro racing in the U.S. “We are shifting our thinking away from week-long stage races to a hub and series concept to contain costs, open up new revenue streams and create exciting and engaging community events,” said RPM Events Group CEO Koff, in a statement. “While the format is different, we are deeply indebted to and respectful of the previous efforts in Colorado and Virginia and hope to build on their success.” The USA Pro Challenge pumped more than $100 million into the Colorado economy as a quarter-million out-of-state spectators chased the race across the mountains, stopping overnight in towns like Steamboat Springs, Aspen, Vail, Breckenridge and Crested Butte. The 2015 world championships in Richmond generated $170 million statewide, drawing an estimated 645,000 spectators and spreading the event to 142 million television viewers in September 2015. “Cycling is a deep part of our health-conscious tradition in Colorado, as well as a significant driver of our economic growth and tourism industry. We are excited that professional racing will continue in our state,” Hickenlooper said in a statement. “The fact that this new endeavor is being led by a group of well-established, savvy investors who are passionate about their communities and the sport, gives us an enormous amount of confidence and pride.” Details are thin as the RPM Events Group petitions both USA Cycling and the UCI for sanctioning and a spot on the international race calendar. Medalist Sports, which operated the USA Pro Challenge, has been tapped to manage the event, which organizers hope to place around the same August timeframe as the Pro Challenge. The locations of the Denver festival and possible day-events in the mountains were not disclosed. More details — like the dates, locations, registration for the citizens ride and the festival plans — will be released when USA Cycling and UCI approve and schedule the race. Helen H.

Texas Workers Comp System Questioned After Oklahoma Ruling - Eagle Pass Business Journal Home About News Sports Videos Photo Galleries EPBJ Awards Contact Texas Workers Comp System Questioned After Oklahoma Ruling by Nicole Cobler, The Texas Tribune Sept. 20, 2016 In the wake of an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision striking down part of that state’s workers’ compensation law, Texas is now the only state that lets private companies opt out of a state-run system and draw up their own plans to compensate injured workers. Before the ruling, Oklahoma had been the only other state offering an “opt out” provision. That leaves some Texas attorneys and labor unions questioning whether the state’s nonsubscriber option for businesses will survive, but a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance said changes are unlikely because there are “significant differences” between the Oklahoma and Texas law. Still, Richard Levy, secretary-treasurer of the Teas AFL-CIO, called the Oklahoma ruling “significant” for Texas and said the group is considering if a similar argument could be used to strike down the Texas opt-out provision. “I would imagine that a lot of people in this area are looking at their Texas Constitutions right now,” Levy said. “Certainly, we expect this to be an issue in the upcoming legislative session.” Major companies like Wal-Mart, Lowe’s and Costco have opted out of the Texas system with the help of attorney Bill Minick, president of the Dallas-based consulting firm PartnerSource. He helped launch the campaign to change the way companies take care of injured workers by establishing their own plans for covering medical costs. The private plans have been criticized for offering lower benefits and giving the companies inordinate control over health care decisions. In 2014, 80 percent of Texas’ 7.7 million private employees were covered by the state’s workers’ compensation insurance, according to the most updated numbers from the Texas Department of Insurance. That left more than 1.4 million Texans covered in non-subscriber alternatives plans and 470,000 employees, or five percent, without any form of workers’ compensation coverage. “I would imagine that a lot of people in this area are looking at their Texas Constitutions right now.”— Richard Levy, Texas AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Minick said he isn’t worried about the Oklahoma ruling affecting Texas because Oklahoma’s constitution is vastly different and the court’s decision revolved around a “special law” provision unique to Oklahoma. “The Texas Constitution does not prohibit business competition the way that the Oklahoma Constitution appears to,” he said. “To my knowledge, that statute and the manner in which the Oklahoma Supreme Court applies it is entirely unique to Oklahoma.” PartnerSource does not have plans to push Texas lawmakers for new legislation in the upcoming session, but Minick said the group is continuously improving injury benefit programs in the state. “The Texas nonsubscriber option has now been going strong for 27 years and successfully resolved over 1 million injury claims,” Minick said. “So there’s a lot of data that demonstrates better outcomes for injured workers, as well as cost savings for employers.” Minick doesn’t think other states will shy away from trying to implement opt-out programs. “We do believe that other state interests and alternatives will increase,” he said. “Most everybody wants to see injured workers receive better benefits, improve return to work, reduce claim disputes and reduce insurance premiums.” Read related coverage from the Tribune: State regulators have told an injured truck driver what he already knew — that his insurance company failed to properly document his debilitating back injury — but the finding won’t help Juan Boston pay his medical expenses. On any given day across Texas, truck drivers might crash their vehicles, construction workers tumble from scaffolding or refinery workers inhale nauseating fumes. Many of those injuries will go unreported — as if they never happened. But what is written down about workplace injuries is more than just scorekeeping.

The 13-year-old Mud Creek Trail, which stretches 2.3 miles west from Old Missouri Road to Scull Creek Trail, will receive lights as part of a $500,000 award from the state’s Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). As one of the first trails constructed in the city, Mud Creek Trail includes many trailside business destinations, including a Core Brewing Pub, Academy Sports, and the 24-hour Walmart Supercenter on Mall Avenue. Mihalevich said the inclusion of trail lighting will provide a safe and accessible way for employees and customers to access those business from the trail during all hours. Mud Creek Trail also serves a large residential population who use the trail regularly. A recent count showed an average of 365 trail users per day during March and April 2016 with a peak of over 2,000 users on April 1, according to a staff memo. Additionally, two major apartment buildings – Uptown Apartments and Watermark at Steele Crossing – are under construction adjacent to Mud Creek Trail that will add an estimated 615 units or 1,200 new residents to the area. The TAP program provides funding projects defined as “transportation alternatives” for bicyclists, pedestrians, and other non-motorized forms of transportation. The reimbursement-type program provides for an 80 percent federal share and a 20 percent local match as part of the federal Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). The grant money will also fund the installation of lights along a one-mile section of Scull Creek Trail – which doubles as the Razorback Greenway – from the Fulbright Expressway tunnel north to the Fayetteville-Johnson city limit. The project includes a total of 181 LED lights which will match existing fixtures on the city’s trail system. Matt Mihalevich, the city’s trails coordinator, said some TAP funds are set aside for the state’s Recreational Trails Program (RTP) that allows for a variety of uses, including maintenance and restoration of existing trails. According to Mihalevich, the plan is to use a $56,000 award to replace about 670 feet of deteriorating asphalt just north of West Maple Street on the Frisco Trail section of the Razorback Greenway. The trail replacement will include full depth excavation to solid ground with select fill to provide a stable foundation for the new 12-foot wide concrete surface. Mihalevich said the city’s 20 percent match is $139,000 and has been budgeted through the trail development fund. Both projects are expected to be completed by summer 2017.   Discussion Fayetteville Flyer has specific guidelines for commenting.

Three years later, Chick-N-Bap has become one of the most popular destinations for students to get food on campus. Sung Kim graduated from BU in 2014 with a degree in business administration. Kim said he got the idea after a night out in Downtown Binghamton left him and a few friends craving something similar to the chicken-over-rice dishes they often enjoyed at home in New York City. The next day, Kim went out and bought all the ingredients for what would become his chicken-over-rice dishes, spending his free time for over a week experimenting with multiple recipes before attaining the taste he wanted. “I went out and got the ingredients from Wal-Mart,” Kim said. “I was broke, this was all of my savings and thank God I got it down. I started taste-testing with my housemates and they kept telling me they would definitely buy the food.” Realizing he had a potential success on his hands, Kim put together a business proposal and approached BU President Harvey Stenger after he gave a presentation in one of Kim’s School of Management classes. Stenger said he liked the pitch and emailed Kim back the next day. Stenger then put Kim in contact with Sodexo, who agreed to let him sell his chicken over rice in Hinman Nite Owl. “How we began was almost like a trial, just a way for the school to support the students,” Kim said. “A way to get the students involved with business and food.” The first weekend Chick-N-Bap was open, Kim said Sodexo only expected him to sell 30 dishes. It was open Friday and Saturday night, and had to shut down service around midnight each day after he ran out of ingredients due to high demand. By the end of the weekend, Kim had sold 600 dishes. After his initial success, Kim was allowed to keep his location in Hinman Nite Owl for the next two semesters, steadily increasing sales. By spring 2015, he and Sodexo moved the operation to the Marketplace for Thursday, Friday and Saturday each week to help supplement the struggling Wholly Habaneros. Once located in the Marketplace, Kim’s business continued to thrive, at its peak selling over 1,800 dishes each weekend. With this growth, Sodexo had to reevaluate their agreement with Kim, as their original agreement left them with many of the operating costs while Kim was pulling in large profits. Jim Ruoff, the Sodexo resident district manager for BU dining services, was part of the group that helped arrange Chick-N-Bap’s change in location as well as reconfigure their agreement. They reached a deal similar to that of other vendors like Tully’s and Moghul, in which Kim covers overhead costs, staffs Chick-N-Bap with BU students and pays Sodexo a percentage of the profits he makes. “Sung was too successful,” Ruoff wrote in an email. “A relationship that was based on a handshake, transparency and mutual respect became too big and it needed to be formalized into a contract with more concrete terms for both parties.” Chick-N-Bap now operates six days a week in the Marketplace. Sung currently lives in Binghamton full time and is working out a distinct business model for Chick-N-Bap so it can be managed even when he is not around. For students such as Sam Anderson, a sophomore majoring in art, Chick-N-Bap has become a staple at BU. “I think the food’s good, the best in the Marketplace,” Anderson said. “I eat here, like, once a day.” Trending #NotMyPresident protest draws hundreds SA vice president for academic affairs resigns BU to begin offering public health program Letter to the editor: Adam Wilkes resignation Locally taught, locally grown RECENT NEWS News Panel examines ways to turn passion for politics into civic engagement News Student Congress 11/17: Interim vice president for academic affairs elected News Binghamton University to add new parking lot for start of fall 2017 semester News Students march in solidarity against North Dakota Access Pipeline News BU vice president of research to lead SUNY Polytechnic as interim president Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Bryant was charged Monday, Sept. 19, 2016 with capital murder in the death of 24-year-old Jacqueline Vandagriff. Her body was found in a park Wednesday after firefighters extinguished a fire. Police say Bryant and Vandagriff were seen together in a Denton bar the night before her body was found. (Grapevine Police Department via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........DALLAS — A man charged in the death of a North Texas college student whose body was found dismembered and burned in a park was the subject of a protective order following complaints of stalking and harassment by a former girlfriend, records show. Charles Dean Bryant, 30, is being held on $1 million bond on a charge of capital murder in the death of 24-year-old Jacqueline Vandagriff. He was released from jail on a stalking charge just days before meeting Vandagriff at a bar Sept. 13. Her body was found the next morning after firefighters extinguished a fire in a Grapevine park. According to an arrest warrant, Vandagriff is seen on a security video meeting Bryant at the bar in Denton, where she attended Texas Woman’s University. They are later seen going to another bar, then leaving together at about 9:45 p.m. Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling has said that it’s not known if the two knew each other before meeting at the bar. Advertisement Continue reading Cell phone data indicate that early on the morning of Sept. 14, Vandagriff’s phone was in the vicinity of Bryant’s home in Haslet, about 25 miles southwest of Denton, according to the arrest warrant. Video evidence showed Bryant buying a shovel at 4:41 a.m. at a Wal-Mart, and there was evidence at his home that someone had tried to dig a hole in the ground. Officials responding to a fire about 6:30 a.m. found Vandagriff’s body in a plastic kiddie pool in a park in Grapevine, located about 20 miles from Haslet. The arrest warrant says a witness saw a man standing over the fire before leaving. Jail records show Bryant was arrested Sept. 7 by University of North Texas police on a stalking charge and posted bond at the Denton County jail on Sept. 9. He was also arrested by UNT police Sept. 6 and released the same day on bond for criminal trespass. According to Denton County court records, the stalking and criminal trespass arrests came after Bryant continued to contact his former girlfriend, despite her desire that he not after she ended their dating relationship Aug. 23. Upon Bryant’s stalking arrest, a judge issued the emergency protective order. Court records show that on Saturday — three days after Vandagriff’s body was found — his ex-girlfriend told police she’d received emails from Bryant saying he missed her and wanted to talk to her. Police on Sunday arrested him, and he was later charged with capital murder. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney. Texas Woman’s University said Vandagriff was a nutrition student there. Eberling said Bryant had worked at the Urban Cowboy Saloon in Fort Worth. The gay dance club said on its Facebook page that he was fired on Sunday for not showing up for his shift. According to the arrest warrant, officials executing a search warrant at Bryant’s home found Vandagriff’s purse in the trash. The document also said the search found a kiddie pool in the backyard that looked similar to the one found with Vandagriff’s burning body in it, and saw a patch of dead grass where it appeared a similar pool had been. Bryant’s roommate told police that there had recently been two kiddie pools in the backyard. Vandagriff’s cause of death has not yet been released. ___ Associated Press writer David Warren contributed to this report.

By Jyarland Daniels Leave a comment When I first heard there had been a shooting of yet another unarmed Black man, this time in Tulsa, Oklahoma I did something that I normally don’t do: I watched the video being shared in my Facebook newsfeed. Nothing prepared me for what I saw; a stranded motorist, walking slowly away from an officer and toward his car, with his hands up was in an instant hit with a taser and then fatally shot. His body fell to the ground where he was left unattended, receiving no immediate medical attention. His blood spilled to the ground while police arranged to divert traffic and a voice in a helicopter above, only able to see the fallen man’s blackness, proclaimed this father of four, “…looks like a bad dude” and “might be on something.” All of the feelings associated with the many other shootings flooded my consciousness – anger, incredulousness, sadness, and fear. My feelings related to the shooting of unarmed motorist Terence Crutcher were able to be contained because of the distance; this was in Tulsa and I am in Detroit. No, I’m not proud to admit that this not being in my backyard brought me some measure of comfort, but in these times being Black and being the mother of a Black teenage son – you cope any way you can. But the murder of yet another citizen at the hands of police in Tulsa hit uncomfortably close to home when I noticed what you had to say about it, Mr. Jerant. You took to Facebook and responded to the news report by saying: “Do you mean the unarmed man who didn’t listen to police…. Again. The one who continued to resist by walking away from the police…. Again. The one who continued to walk away with his hands up, and proceeded to disobey more orders all the way back to his vehicle. Then put his hands down continued to disobey orders and then reached into the open widow of car? That unarmed man? That one that simply didn’t listen…. Again. Get ready for the liberal media frenzy of BS. Then the audio will come out, then everyone will say he didn’t listen, then after a false narrative for 3 months by BLM and “rioting peaceful protests” everyone will say ohhh I guess he was wrong, and the police were right? Then after a real investigation the truth comes out? Simple story never changes. Listen to police who have guns pointed at you and don’t get shot. It isn’t hard. Here we go again. “Hands up” until they aren’t anymore. The media will cut video then, just wait until mainstream plays the clip. CNN we are ready for your half story !!! They will ignore everything else. Clicks and ads it’s always about money not the truth. watch and see.” An inexplicable fatigue, one that emanates from a tired soul, was instantly added to my emotions of anger, sadness, incredulousness, and fear. I asked myself, “How could an owner of a restaurant that so many of my friends and I support, here at HOME, in a city that is 83% Black, say such a thing after seeing a lifeless body lying in the street – shot by police AFTER having been tasered?” I am tired. I am tired of feeling helpless. I am tired of trying to figure why you and so many others don’t see what I see. I am tired of Black dollars mattering and not Black lives. I am tired of hearing a different justification provided after every murder of a Black man or woman; justifications that merely add to the list of things Black people cannot do without being killed or having their lives placed in grave danger. We cannot ask why we are being pulled over (Sandra Bland). We cannot be a therapist caring for an autistic patient (Charles Kinsley). We cannot go to the house of a stranger and knock on the door and ask for help (Renisha McBride). We cannot play in the park (Tamir Rice). We cannot reach for our ID after a traffic stop (Philando Castile). We cannot shop in Walmart (John Crawford). This, Marko is the price of Blackness. From a place of privilege (gender, race, and financial) you admonished Black men and women to, “Listen to police who have guns pointed at you and don’t get shot. It isn’t hard.” However you fail to remember all of the instances where that did happen and with the same deadly outcome. I do not. I remember. Looking at my Black son won’t let me forget. But, in addition to remembering the numerous instances where “our skin was our sin”, I also remember Kelsey Wood, the 25-year old white woman who, after being pulled over for driving erratically, danced for police while they shouted for her to put her hands up. She lives. I remember Jacob Hastings, the white man who fled from police and upon finally being apprehended, kicked the back window out of the police cruiser. He was tasered – but he lives. I remember when police when to serve an arrest warrant on Jonathan Order they were met with threatening comments, and immediately after the suspect opened the door he stabbed an officer 5 times before retreating back into his apartment. Police then negotiated with him for 30 minutes and summarily took him into custody. And finally, I remember Brock Ray Bunge. Just last week outside of Los Angeles, Mr. Bunge went on a crime spree. He had attempted to kill one person and robbed two others – now he was a bad dude. Armed, too. But after a 6-hour standoff, police deployed a robot to take his gun from him; a robot was used to kill Micah Johnson a few weeks ago in Dallas. Oh, how I remember. The memories of Black folks in this country are long and even when we try to forget a new event forces us to recall. However, Marko, I also remember times seeing a person make a mistake and learning from it. I even remember the satisfaction I have felt when a white person who didn’t “get” why a Black person felt or thought a certain way, arrive at a place of genuine compassion and understanding. I would very much like to remember you in this way. However, that is up to you. It would appear that given our difference of opinion in this situation that we don’t have anything in common. But, I found something. You graduated from The University of Detroit Jesuit High School. In fact, you are an alumnus of whom the school is very proud. My son is currently a student at U of D. And while I may not know you, I know what you were exposed to and I know that at some point in your education you were taught to be a “Man for Others” who is loving, religious, intellectually competent, open to growth, and committed to doing justice. That is something I hope you remember. I have a confession: I called for a boycott of your establishment on my Facebook page when I first learned of what you said. In a moment of being tired, I erred; I forgot something. I forgot that in my work as a Racial Equity consultant, I must be committed to finding ways to bridge, where possible. While I can’t force anyone to walk across a bridge of racial understanding, I can offer to walk with them – should they choose to accept the invitation. I am open to the possibility this may be a teachable moment for you, me, the young men at U of D, and the community as a whole. We need that in this community and this nation. In writing this I am sure that I will receive criticism from some in my community who would wish for a much more harshly worded letter. I’m willing to endure that; I learned long ago that doing this work of racial equity wins no popularity contests. But what I also know is if we are to ever become a more fair and equitable community and society we are going to have to talk to one another and not at one another. So, Marko, let’s talk. Let’s talk about implicit bias. Let’s talk about racial history (in Detroit and the US). Let’s talk about systemic racism. We can even talk about the Lions. But, by all means – let’s talk over dinner and drinks (wine, please). Oh…Your treat.

Charles Dean Bryant, 30, has been charged with capital murder in the death of 24-year-old Jacqueline Vandagriff. Her body was found in a park Sept. 14 after firefighters extinguished a fire.

News Analysis 10 0 0 September 20, 2016 Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump: Who Is The More Successful Businessperson? Scott Hough There is a mathematical problem involved with comparing the growth of the personal assets of presidential nominees Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and others facing such scrutiny. The formula used to calculate the percentage gain of the value of an asset is ((present value – past value)/past value) x 100. For those who started their business or investing careers with essentially nothing, as Hillary Clinton did, the percentage gain formula involves dividing by zero, which results in an absurd answer: infinite, or undefined, percentage returns. For those who started their business and investing careers with significant assets, as Donald Trump did, calculating the yearly growth of their value is quite straightforward. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] A conservative estimate of the amount Donald Trump received from his father, Fred Trump, in 1974, is $40 million, as reported by PolitiFact. Using the Money Chimp compound interest calculator, it can be determined that if Donald Trump had a net worth of about $40 million in 1974 and has a net worth of $4.5 billion today, as reported by Forbes, the value of his net worth has increased at an average rate of about 12.2 percent, compounded annually, barely beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s (^GSPC) average annual 10 percent return, similar to the retirement accounts of average Americans, as reported by Investopedia. The Inquisitr previously reported that if Donald Trump had invested the reported $40 million he received from his father in the 1970s with Warren Buffett’s Bershire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A, BRK-B) his net worth would be over $200 billion today, more than 20 times his reported $4.5 billion net worth, and more than Warren Buffett himself, whose net worth is estimated at $65.2 billion by Forbes. The growth of Donald Trump’s net worth has not kept pace with anywhere near the growth of Warren Buffett’s, regarded by many as the most successful investor of all-time. Warren Buffett is also a Hillary Clinton supporter. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Not unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has served on several corporate boards, including TCBY, Lafarge, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). The Wall Street Journal has reported that a total of at least 60 companies involved with State Department lobbying made $21 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. The Journal commented that the Democratic nominee’s “web of connections” to corporate interests emerged as “an issue” for Clinton “as income disparity and other populist themes” gained the interest of voters. There is little doubt among observers that Hillary Clinton is an American capitalist, and a successful one at that. When Bill Clinton lost the 1980 Arkansas governor’s race, Hillary’s role in holding the Clintons together was lauded, as reported by the New York Times. The newspaper reported that Hillary was worried about “caring for her aging parents” with the election loss. Hillary Clinton’s father, Hugh Rodham, died in 1993 after working as a curtain manufacturer and installer. Reports of any inheritance left for Clinton are elusive. Combined with the fact that the former secretary of state was reported worrying about caring for her parents in the early 1980s suggests that any inheritance Hillary Clinton did receive from her family may have been modest. Hillary Clinton’s net worth is estimated at between $31.3 million and $45 million. So great is her success as a businessperson that using mathematical formulas to quantify it returns absurd answers, similar to the story of all successes who began with nothing. In plain language, how many Americans know of women with net worths in the tens of million of dollars who received almost nothing from their family? And how many of those have created foundations that raised $325 million for charitable causes in 2014 alone and then distributed 88 percent of that amount to programs, as reported by CharityWatch.org? [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] In comparison to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump’s foundation has come under close scrutiny for the timing of a contribution made to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s political campaign, a $20,000 purchase of a painting of Donald Trump himself, and the arrangement the Republican nominee had with a Florida police association that involved the candidate making charitable contributions using other people’s money, while at the same time he was thought to be charging the organization steep rent on facilities, as reported by the Inquisitr. While many judge the business prowess of political candidates based on the growth of their net worth, a category in which Hillary Clinton appears to trounce Donald Trump, others, such as Bill Gates, estimated by Forbes to have a net worth of $81 billion, feel that once businesspeople have reached a certain level of success, charitable giving also becomes a factor, as evidenced by his Giving Pledge program. Hillary Clinton not only appears to have bettered Donald Trump in growing her own personal wealth, the millions of dollars that has been directed to charitable causes as a result of her work, though her net worth is nowhere near that of Bill Gates and fellow Giving Pledge-taker Warren Buffett, appears to indicate that she has bettered Trump with her charitable giving as well. Together, Bill and Hillary Clinton are reported to have personally contributed $22.5 million to the Clinton Foundation since 2001.

She is shown in the photo with her husband, Luc Tieman, taken in July in front on the truck she reportedly disappeared from. By Dawn Gagnon, BDN Staff Posted Sept. 20, 2016, at 2:15 p.m. Last modified Sept. 20, 2016, at 8:10 p.m. FAIRFIELD, Maine — State police and wardens have found what is believed to be a woman’s body on property owned by the in-laws of a Fairfield woman who has been missing since Aug. 30. Investigators declined to identify the body, but it was found on property at 628 Norridgewock Road, where the missing woman, 34-year-old Valerie Tieman lived with her husband, Luc Tieman, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland said late Tuesday afternoon. The couple was living with Luc Tieman’s parents, who own the property, when Valerie Tieman disappeared, McCausland said. Police began searching late Tuesday morning in a wooded area surrounding the house, according to McCausland. He would not say what led police to search the property, but he said the body was found 200 to 300 yards into the woods. Story continues below advertisement. McCausland said the body was being taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Augusta for an autopsy and that the results are expected to be available Wednesday. Valerie Tieman was last seen Aug. 30 at Wal-Mart in Skowhegan, McCausland said earlier this month. She was reported missing on Sept. 9 to Fairfield police by her parents, who live out of state, he said. State police joined the investigation on Sept. 13. Luc Tieman previously told police that he had gone into Wal-Mart on Aug. 30 and that his wife was missing from the truck when he returned a short time later. No one has been charged or arrested in connection with the death, McCausland said, adding that investigators are awaiting the autopsy results. The Tieman family continues to cooperate with police, he said.   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Sheriff breaks up party after report of underage drinking, 18 charged Next story:UMaine-Farmington dedicates court to longtime coach » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Hollis woman shot five times by man trying to save her It’s unclear whether Trump could abolish the North Woods monument Maine man charged after allegedly threatening to kill Obama, Pingree Man charged with manslaughter in Bath parking lot shooting to plead to lesser charge Official: Pending inmate release prompts security precautions at MDI school With few wins to celebrate in Maine’s addiction fight, here’s one worth acknowledging Friday, Nov. 18, 2016: Accept election results, fix health care, Trump’s hateful rhetoric Trump won the presidency, but can he unite a divided nation?

A police officer spotted the 2002 Silverado at the south Walmart store around 10 p.m. The officer arrested 18-year-old Logan Johnson, who was working on the truck at the time. Logan Johnson-photo from Olmsted County Sheriff’s Office Johnson is also suspected of shoplifting some items from the Walmart store that were found in the truck. The Silverado was one of two pickup trucks that were stolen from Oronoco Auto Parts early Saturday. The same officer who arrested Johnson was also involved in the recovery of a stolen motorcycle a few hours later.   The officer spotted a man near the motorcycle that was parked behind the Wyndham Garden Hotel along South Broadway around 3 a.m. Matthew Hines- photo from Olmsted County Sheriff’s Office The officer ran a check of the motorcycle license plate and discovered it had been reported stolen from Mower County. The officer also found about 65 grams of methamphetamine in a bag on the motorcycle. Arrested was 33-year-old Matthew Hines, who has a Wabasha address.

(NASDAQ: HAS) and Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT), the holiday shopping season is the most critical time of the year. Although the holiday shopping rush is still a couple of months away, UBS analyst Arpine Kocharyan is reporting some positive preliminary channel checks. “After a solid H1, retailers are cautiously optimistic on toy sales heading into [the] all-important holiday season, with summer months having seen a typical slowdown in sales, according to trade,” Kocharyan explains. Related Link: Hasbro Vs. Mattel: Which Has The Edge At Walmart Stores This Holiday Season? For Mattel, Kocharyan notes the Barbie brand seems well-positioned ahead of Q4. UBS also reports a strong global roll-out of DC Super Hero Girls. Hot Wheels, Fisher-price and MEGA have also generated strong numbers so far this year ahead of the holiday season. Kocharyan even says that American Girl’s partnership with Toys “R” Us could be a future source of incremental revenue growth for Mattel. The company will look to reset its struggling Monster High brand with a new 2017 lineup. For Hasbro, Kocharyan believes the Star Wars Rogue One product line is better than last year’s Star Wars lineup. Elena of Avalor sales are reportedly “on fire,” while both Play-Doh and NERF summer sales were strong as well. My Little Pony and My Littlest Pet Shop sales have disappointed, but Kocharyan notes that a new My Little Pony movie in 2017 should help turn things around next year. So far in 2016, both Hasbro and Mattel have seen share prices rise more than 15 percent.

Back to site Oil and Gas States Native Americans This Isn’t the First Time Cowboys Have Tried to Plunder 640 Million Acres of Public Land In Utah and the Dakotas, history repeats itself as Native Americans fight to protect their lives—and ours. By Chip Ward September 20, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print A group from the Saginaw Chippewa Reservation in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, gather with hundreds of protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. (Reuters / Andrew Cullen) Cowboys and Indians are at it again. Ad Policy Americans who don’t live in the West may think that the historic clash of Native Americans and pioneering settlers is long past because the Indians were, after all, defeated and now drive cars, watch television, and shop at Walmart. Not so. That classic American narrative is back big time, only the Indians are now the good guys and the cowboys—well, their rightwing representatives, anyway—are on the warpath, trying to grab 640 million acres of public lands that they can plunder as if it were yesteryear. Meanwhile, in the Dakotas, America’s Manifest Destiny, that historic push across the Great Plains to the Pacific (murdering and pillaging along the way), seems to be making a return trip to Sioux country in a form that could have planetary consequences. This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. Energy Transfer Partners is now building the Dakota Access Pipeline, a $3.7 billion oil slick of a project. It’s slated to go from the Bakken gas and oil fracking fields in northern North Dakota across 1,100 miles of the rest of the Dakotas and Iowa to a pipeline hub in Illinois. From there, the oil will head for refineries on the Gulf Coast and ultimately, as the emissions from fossil fuels, into the atmosphere to help create future summers so hot no one will forget them. Keep in mind that, according to global warming’s terrible new math, there’s enough carbon in those Bakken fields to roast the planet—if, that is, the Sioux and tribes allied with them don’t stop the pipeline. This time, in other words, if the cavalry does ride to the rescue, the heroes on horseback will be speaking Lakota. Last Stand at Standing Rock If built as planned, the Dakota Access Pipeline will snake through the headwaters of the Missouri River, a life-giving source of fresh water for millions of people who live downstream, including Native Americans. It’s supposed to pass under that river just a few miles from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles North and South Dakota. Protestors point out that, eventually, the pipeline is likely to leak into that vital watershed and the contamination could prove catastrophic. The Army Corps of Engineers, which green-lighted the project’s design, and Energy Transfer Partners have continued to insist that there is no such risk—even though, suspiciously enough, they decided to change the pipeline’s route to avoid the water supply of North Dakota’s capital, Bismark. As ever, tribal leaders point out, they were ignored rather than consulted in the planning stages, even though the project was to pass directly through their lands.

Now Trump Wants to Make Him Commerce Secretary. 4 What I Got Wrong About Hillary Clinton—and What Other Feminists Get Wrong About Her Now 5 3 Million of Hillary’s Biggest Supporters Found Each Other in a Secret Facebook Group When the Keystone XL Pipeline, slated to bring especially carbon-heavy tar sands from Alberta, Canada, to the US Gulf Coast, was killed thanks to years of fierce environmental protests, the stakes were raised for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Keystone was a disaster for the energy industry. In its wake, opponents claim, the new project was fast-tracked without the usual environmental reviews so that construction could be completed before a Keystone-style opposition formed. Fast as they were, it turns out that they weren’t fast enough. Keep in mind that such a project wasn’t exactly a first for the native peoples of the region. In the wake of their defeat and confinement to reservations in the nineteenth century, they lived through a profound transformation of their landscape. Settlers let cattle loose on meadows cleared of wolves, cougars, and bears. The rude stamp of progress followed: fences, roads, dams, mines, sawmills, railroads, power lines, towns, condos, resorts, and in the twenty-first century, vistas increasingly pockmarked with fracking’s drill rigs and service roads. In the Dakota prairies, hundreds of species of grass and flowers were replaced by monocultures of soy and corn, while millions of cattle were substituted for herds of free-roaming bison. As recently as the 1950s and 1960s, the neighboring Sioux and Cheyenne lost 200,000 more acres of valuable reservation farmland to dams built without their permission. Entire villages had to relocate. The Dakota Access Pipeline is just the latest of these assaults and yet, in every way, it’s potentially more disastrous. As Lakota Chairman David Archambault puts it, “To poison water is to poison the substance of life.” Slaughter, internment, and neglect were bad enough, say tribal leaders, but threatening the people’s life-giving water was the last straw. As a result, thousands of Native Americans drawn from 280 tribes across the country and even around the world are now camping out at the construction site where the Dakota Access Pipeline nears the tip of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Almost two million signatures have been gathered on a petition opposing the pipeline; dozens of environmental groups have signed on to the resistance; and tribes nationwide have expressed their solidarity. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe On September 3, the private security guards hired by Energy Transfer Partners used pepper spray and dogs on those trying to block the pipeline. This eruption of violence halted work until U.S. District Judge James Boasberg could rule on the tribe’s request for an injunction to block construction while its case was heard in court. On September 9, while conceding that “the United States’ relationship with Indians has been contentious and tragic,” he denied that request. Then, in a move described even by the Sioux as stunning, the Obama administration suddenly stepped between the protesters and the pipeline construction crews. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, and even the Army Corps of Engineers called for a halt to the process until the permitting procedure could be reviewed. Although putting an oil pipeline under a major river should have triggered an environmental review, the Corps chose not to do one. Now, it will take a second look. The administration also committed itself to finding better ways to include Native Americans in future land-use decisions. Where this goes next is anyone’s guess. The construction halt could, of course, be lifted if the protesters were to disperse under a false sense of victory. The Sioux now plan to litigate vigorously against the pipeline. One prediction, however, is easy enough. The unity and purpose experienced by the people in that encampment will resonate powerfully for years to come. A movement has been born along the banks of the Missouri River. Native Americans have played the crucial role in this campaign to “keep it in the ground,” just as they were leaders in the successful struggle to block the Keystone XL Pipeline, the proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline that would have carried dirty crude across Canada to the Pacific, and the building of a massive coal export port on Canada’s Pacific coast. As Native American leader Winona LaDuke puts it, “For people with nothing else but land and a river, I would not bet against them.” This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the cowboys have been engaged in a not-so-old-fashioned range war over who can best manage 640 million acres of public lands now owned collectively by the American people. Backed by the Koch brothers and their American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, legislators across the American West, where most of the public lands are located, are calling on the federal government to cede control and management of them to counties and states. This would include some of our most beloved national parks. In Utah, where I live, the Republican-dominated legislature has put forward the Public Lands Initiative (PLI). It’s the latest round in a 30-year-feud pitting conservationists and businesses tied to tourism and recreation against ranchers and miners. At stake: whether to give the last publicly controlled wild places in the state formal wilderness status and federal protection or (though this isn’t often directly said) let private interests exploit the hell out of them. Every few years the Utah legislature’s “cowboy caucus” has pushed just such a “wilderness bill” filled with poison pills and potentially devastating loopholes that the local conservation community can’t abide. Billed this time as a potential grand bargain to settle who controls public lands and how they can be used, the PLI has proven no different. It was, in fact, generated by local fears that President Obama might use his wide-ranging powers under the Antiquities Act to create a new national monument in the state as he left the Oval Office. This was exactly what Bill Clinton did in 1996, establishing the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument on 1.9 million acres of land in southern Utah’s spectacular canyon country, already the home of five national parks. That 1906 act, passed while Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House, gives the president wide-ranging authority to create national monuments from public lands in order to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. Since activities like drilling for oil and gas, mining, timber cutting, and grazing are barred or tightly restricted on such protected lands, Western politicians tend to regard them as a tool wielded by conservationists to suppress economic development. Grave Robbing for Fun and Profit Sure enough, the nightmare of the cowboys is being realized. A coalition of five tribes, all either presently in Utah or claiming ancestral lands there, is now pushing a bold proposal for just such a national monument—a park co-managed by the five tribes and the National Park Service (which in itself would be a significant first for the Native American community). It would include 1.9 million acres of the ancestral grounds of the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain, and Ute Indian tribes and would be known as the Bears Ears after the area’s most famous landmark, twin buttes that are said to resemble a bear’s ears. Interior Secretary Sally Jewel recently toured the proposed monument and was amazed by what she saw, including spectacular cliff-house ruins, as well as paintings and rock carvings depicting clan signs, shamanic visions, and ghostly herds of bighorn sheep and elk. Bears Ears would possess more than 100,000 archaeological sites, including many of the oldest and most spectacular ruins in the United States. Members of the coalition of tribes regard them and the ground littered with their ancestors’ artifacts and bones as sacred. A grassroots group, Utah Dine Bikeyah, did extensive groundwork collecting data and interviews to create cultural maps of the region. The extraordinary archaeological and historical record they built effectively made their case that the ancestors of the coalition tribes have relied on that landscape for hunting, gathering, and ceremonial activities for centuries. The Utah conservation community, which had mapped out its own plans for such a monument, stepped aside for the tribal proposal. Protecting the Bears Ears is considered an urgent matter. A mere handful of rangers currently patrol thousands of square miles of rugged canyons where the looting of archaeological sites for fun and profit is a rural tradition. In remote outposts like Blanding, Utah, Indian grave robbing was considered an acceptable family pastime until agents from the FBI infiltrated the black market for artifacts and busted a prominent local family. Ute leader Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk expresses a motivating concern of the tribal leaders. “Without swift action,” she says, “we fear that the archaeological and cultural riches of the Bears Ears will suffer shameful, disgraceful dissolution and obliteration.” Her fear is well founded. In recent years, for instance, rural county commissioners have led illegal all-terrain-vehicle rallies on a route through Recapture Canyon that Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rangers shut to motorized traffic because it crosses several key archaeological sites. State and county politicians were not content to challenge the BLM’s closure of that canyon in court. Instead, they openly promoted such rides to defy the feds. The last of these protests in 2014 did, in fact, significantly damage unprotected archeological sites. The indigenous community saw it as a shocking show of disrespect, like driving directly over cemetery graves. The well-armed vigilantes who rode through Recapture Canyon were led by Ryan Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy and the famous hothead of the Bundy clan. You may remember the colorful Bundy boys. After all, they became the stars of the “cowboy rebellion” against federal regulation on public lands. In 2014, BLM rangers were dispatched to Nevada to remove Cliven Bundy’s cows from lands on which they had been grazing illegally for 20 years. The feds claimed that he owed the taxpayers a million bucks in unpaid grazing fees. He, on the other hand, insisted that such public lands belonged to the ranchers whose grandparents first grazed them. The rangers sent to enforce the law were met by hundreds of armed cowboys, many of whom took up sniper positions around them. Faced with such overwhelming firepower and the prospect of bloodshed, they withdrew and a range war was on. The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight That retreat in Nevada undoubtedly emboldened the Bundy clan and their militia allies to seize Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in January 2016. Well-armed, they occupied the visitor center at that bird refuge, leaning on every cowboy cliché in the book. They dressed the part with chaps, boots, buckles, and Stetson hats, carried American flags, and regularly posed with their horses for news photographers. In the end, despite the Marlboro Man look and the Clint Eastwood demeanor, the Bundyites came across as the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. The “constitutional revolution” they wanted to spark by seizing Malheur fizzled amid a festival of cognitive dissonance and irony: men carrying assault rifles and threatening to use them proclaimed themselves “peaceful protesters” and, while declaring it off limits, attempted to “return” land to the American people—land that they already owned. Federal agents eventually arrested all of the principal players in both the earlier Nevada standoff and the Malheur fiasco, except for one killed at a roadblock when he charged armed rangers and reached for his gun. Trials began on September 7 and are slated to last for months. Given the open hostility of state and local politicians to the protection of sacred sites, as well as their willingness to break the law and offer tacit support for vigilantes like the Bundys, tribal leaders decided to take their concerns about protecting their ancestral grounds to the top. A delegation traveled to Washington and met with President Obama, while a media campaign was begun to persuade others to endorse the plan. A broader coalition of tribes and the conservation community rallied to the idea, especially because it was the first time that Native American tribes had proposed such a monument. The vision of a park to honor sacred indigenous lands, shaped and directed by Native Americans themselves, caught the public imagination. The New York Times and The Washington Post have both written editorials urging the president to create such a park and Utah polls show a solid majority of citizens in favor of it. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Peace Pipes, Not Oil Pipes The genocidal policies that accompanied settlement across North America crested in Sioux country at the close of the nineteenth century. The survivors of the vanquished indigenous nations there were interned on reservations. Their children were taken from them and sent to boarding schools where their hair was cut, and their language and ceremonies banished. This was—and was meant to be—a form of cultural genocide. In the Bears Ears and Sioux country today, however, the culture of Native Americans endures. The descendants of those warriors who died defending their homeland and of those children taken from their families and their native cultures have proven remarkably resilient. They are once again defending their world and, as it happens, ours too, because even if you don’t share the Missouri River watershed, you live on a planet that is being rapidly transformed by the sort of toxic cargo that will fill a future Dakota Access Pipeline. In the Hollywood Westerns of my youth, Indians were often one-dimensional villains who committed atrocities on good white folks trying to bring civilization to the frontier. As with so many notions I inherited in my youth, reality has turned out to be another story. Certainly, before the onslaught of colonialism, the way indigenous people across the planet viewed what we now call our environment has come to seem like sanity itself. The land, as the Sioux and other tribal peoples saw it, was a living being saturated with spirits that humans should both acknowledge and respect. The Indians whom the cowboys and bluecoats fought didn’t share European concepts of cash, property, profit, progress, and, most importantly, technology. Once upon a time, we had the guns and they had the bows and arrows, so we rolled over them. But here’s the wondrous thing: a story that seemed to have ended long ago turns out to be anything but over. Times have changed, and in the process the previous cast of characters has, it seems, swapped roles. An economy hooked on carbon is threatening life on Earth. The waters of seas and oceans are warming fast; the weather is becoming unpredictable and harsh. Perhaps it’s time to finally listen to and learn from people who lived here sustainably for thousands of years. Respecting Sioux sovereignty and protecting the sacred sites of tribes in their own co-managed national monument could write the next chapter in our American story, the one in which the Indians finally get to be heroes and heroines fighting to protect our way of life as well as their own. 0 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Chip Ward Chip Ward is a former grassroots organizer/activist who has led several successful campaigns to hold polluters accountable.

Photo: Casey B. Gibson | www.cbgphoto.com Cycling fans in Colorado and Virginia could see pro racing return to their respective states in 2017 in the form of two four-day stage races that are owned and operated by the same company. The company, called RPM Events Group LLC, says it has organized eight private investors to fund the entire project. The ownership group includes Colorado’s Gart family, international cable TV and broadband company Liberty Global, Denver businessman David Koff, and Ben Walton, a grandchild of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. Koff, who is also the CEO for RPM Events Group, pegged the total budget for the project in the mid seven figures. “The people we’ve brought in are patient with their money and want to treat [the races] like a community asset and a sustainable business,” Koff said. “This is for the benefit of the communities.” The group did not provide the name of their new races. Earlier this year, a draft of the 2017 UCI America Tour listed the name “Tour of Colorado” running from August 14-20. The ownership structure represents an important stepping stone for the races. All major bicycle races in the U.S. lose money, and require ownership to cover costs. Colorado’s USA Pro Challenge recently ceased operations after an unsuccessful hunt for a new ownership group to replace its former owners, Rick and Rich Schaden. Tim Miller, the company’s Chief Operating Officer, said the project’s overall budget will be between that of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge, which cost approximately $10 million each year to organize, and the Tour of Utah, which race chairman Steve Miller recently pegged in the $3.5 million range. The investor group is being led by Colorado’s Gart family, which owned and operated a chain of successful sporting goods stores. Ken Gart, the chairman of the RPM Events Group LLC, said the company’s goal is to build an “innovative new model” that will help the two events survive cycling’s infamously rocky business climate. The USA Pro Cycling Challenge, which was owned by the Colorado-based Schaden family, lost more than $20 million over its five editions. The list of dead American UCI stage races includes the Tour de Georgia, Tour of Missouri, and Coors Classic. “We want to make sure this race is going to be around,” Gart said. “We’re trying to take the foundation from the USA Pro Challenge and [2015 Richmond UCI World Championships] and come up with a new approach.” The group’s model revolves around a hub-and-spoke format, wherein one city in each state hosts the start/finish line for the majority of the stages. In theory, that model cuts down on soaring costs for road closures and transporting equipment and personnel. The group declined to divulge which cities in Colorado and Virginia will be the hubs for the respective stage races. According to Miller, who organized the 2015 UCI world championships in Richmond, Virginia, both races will feature cycling festivals, mass-participant cycling events, live music and a party atmosphere. The goal is to hold multiple stages in the late afternoon or evening, to attract bigger crowds. Like other races, however, the two events will look to sponsorship as a way to generate revenue. Miller said the group has submitted its plans to the UCI, and is now awaiting confirmation from the sport’s governing body. He declined to give firm dates for the proposed race, other than to say the two races will be held “fairly close to one another.” Koff, who joins the group after a successful career in the cable TV business, said the company hopes to reach a fan demographic outside of just hardcore cycling fans. “We are trying to create races that have a broader entertainment experience,” Koff said.

Azia Branson abranson@star-telegram.com 1 of 5 i By Ryan Osborne rosborne@star-telegram.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story GRAPEVINE The Texas Woman’s University student found dead last week in a Grapevine park met the man accused of killing her at a Denton bar and later was at his far north Fort Worth home before she was dismembered and the body parts burned in a blue wading pool, according to an arrest warrant affidavit released Tuesday morning. Jacqueline Vandagriff, 24, was found dead by firefighters in Acorn Woods Park near Lake Grapevine about 6 a.m. Sept. 14. The burned body was in a kiddie pool and firefighters learned that an “accelerant” had been used to start the fire, according to the affidavit. Charles Dean Bryant, 30, remains in jail on a capital murder charge, with bail set at $1 million. Police have said that Bryant’s home is in Haslet, but tax records show his address on Sand Hills Drive is within the Fort Worth city limits. Investigators learned that Vandagriff and Bryant were together on the night of Sept. 13 at the Fry Street Public House in Denton after walking to the bar from her apartment, according to the affidavit. She and Bryant were seen together on security video there, and also at Shots and Crafts, another nearby bar. They were seen leaving Shots and Crafts about 9:45 p.m., the affidavit said. Cell phone data traced Vandagriff to the area near Bryant’s home about 1:30 a.m. Sept. 14 , the affidavit said. At 4:41 a.m., Bryant was seen purchasing a shovel at a nearby Wal-Mart on Avondale Haslet Road. In Bryant’s back yard, detectives later found “evidence that someone started to dig a hole in the ground,” according to the affidavit. They also found a “round patch of grass where it appears a kiddie pool would have recently been.” Detectives interviewed Bryant’s roommate and ex-girlfriend, and both said Bryant had a kiddie pool similar to the one in which Vandagriff was found. Detectives also found Vandagriff’s purse in the trash at Bryant’s home, according to the affidavit. The affidavit did not say how Vandagriff’s body ended up in the Grapevine park about 22 miles away. A 911 caller reported seeing a man standing over the fire and then leaving in a light-color SUV. The fire was set just off a narrow dirt path leading toward Lake Grapevine. On Tuesday, the burned area could be easily accessed from the park, which sits in a remote area between Oak Grove Loop South and the southwest edge of the lake. From the road, a metal cross and flowers could be seen about 30 yards away near a picnic table. A charred patch of brush was just beyond the small memorial, about 10 yards down the trail. Stalking complaint Bryant was in legal trouble before he became a suspect in Vandagriff’s death. The affidavit said Bryant’s ex-girlfriend has a protective order against him stemming from a stalking and harassment complaint. In a separate matter, University of North Texas spokeswoman Margarita Venegas confirmed that on Aug. 24 a female student filed a complaint against him with UNT police, who issued a no-trespass order against Bryant. He was accused of violating the order, and was arrested and charged with criminal trespassing Sept. 6. He was released the same day. The next day, UNT police learned he had continued to try to contact the student and issued an arrest warrant for stalking. He was arrested Sept. 7 and that same day campus police obtained an emergency protective order from Denton County for the female student. He was released from jail Sept. 9, records show, and accused of violating the emergency order on Saturday, three days after Vandagriff was killed. Grapevine police originally took Bryant into custody on Sunday on the warrant for violating the protective order, according to the affidavit. “As far as we know, there is no connection to the Grapevine murder,” Venegas said. “Bryant is not affiliated in any way with UNT, never been a student or employee.” Social media comments Investigators are still looking into whether Bryant and Vandagriff met through social media. Someone used her Twitter account Friday — after her body had been found — to tweet “Never knew I could feel like this.” Eberling said police are aware of the tweet. Never knew I could feel like this&mdash; boring blonde (@nochillblonde) September 16, 2016 “We’re looking at any type of social media she had any connection to, to find out if she had communicated with this person before,” Eberling said. “It takes time to recover that kind of information.” Bryant posted odd status updates on his Facebook page before and after the body was found: Teach you tricks that will blow your mindPosted by Charles Dean Bryant on&nbsp;Tuesday, September 13, 2016 Full moon.. lets see what trouble I can get intoPosted by Charles Dean Bryant on&nbsp;Thursday, September 15, 2016 Cory Mayabb, who lives down the street from Bryant’s residence in the 14000 block of Sand Hills Drive, said Bryant shared the house with a man and the man’s girlfriend. Mayabb said he had spoken to the other man once, but he didn’t know Bryant. The Urban Cowboy Saloon in Fort Worth, where Bryant worked, was closed Tuesday. Bryant’s arrest was acknowledged on its Facebook page. The bar fired Bryant after he didn’t show up for work Sunday, according to the post. “We are grieving with our community and offer our deepest condolences for the Vandagriff family and friends,” the post said.

Grate, 40, has been charged with two counts of murder in Ashland County and reportedly confessed to a Marion County killing as well. (Photo: Submitted) 121 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE MANSFIELD - If Shawn Grate is telling the truth, he's killed five women and kidnapped a sixth in three North Central Ohio counties. Here's what we know about the six victims as questions linger about the potential there are more victims of the career criminal who has served time in prison for burglary and is being held in the Ashland County Jail on $1 million bond. On Sept. 22, an Ashland County grand jury returned a 23-count indictment, including two charges of aggravated murder. The prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty if Grate is convicted. Unidentified kidnapping victim: At 6:47 a.m. Sept. 13, a woman who said she had been abducted by Grate called 911 in Ashland. After she was rescued by Ashland police, Grate was apprehended. Two bodies were found in the Covert Court vacant house where the kidnapping victim was held. Her name has not been released because authorities said she was a victim of a sexual assault. Grate has been charged in her kidnapping. Stacey Stanley was reported missing on Sept. 8.  (Photo: Submitted) Stacey Stanley – Stanley, 40, of Greenwich, was identified Sept. 14 as one of the bodies discovered in Ashland. She last was seen Sept. 8 at a BP station on East Main Street, just three blocks from the Covert Court house, trying to get a flat tire fixed. Grate has been charged with her murder. Elizabeth Griffith, 29, had not been seen since Aug. 16. This picture was taken on Thanksgiving at Eastgate Bible Church.  (Photo: Submitted) Elizabeth Griffith – Griffith, 29, of Ashland, was identified Sept. 16 as the second body found in the Ashland house. Griffith last was seen Aug. 16 in the area of the Ashland Walmart. Grate has been charged with murder in her death. Officially unidentified woman – While being questioned by Ashland police after his arrest, Grate said he had disposed of another body in Madison Township. That afternoon, Richland County Sheriff's Office investigators discovered the body of a third woman in a wooded area behind a burned-out house at 1027 Park Ave. East. The house had burned June 20 under suspicious circumstances. While authorities await DNA results to make a positive identification, evidence appears to point to Candice Cunningham, a girlfriend and companion of Grate, who has not been seen since June. She has not officially been reported missing.  (Photo: Whitmire, Lou A.) Rebekah Leicy – Mansfield Police Chief Ken Coontz confirmed Sunday his department had reopened the investigation into the 2015 death of Leicy, a Mansfield woman whose body was found March 16, 2015, in a wooded area in Ashland County, south of U.S. 30 near Mifflin. She last had been seen Jan. 22, 2015. Her death initially was ruled to be a drug overdose by the coroner because the autopsy showed no signs of traumatic injuries. After detectives interviewed Grate on Monday, search warrants were executed on a vacant downtown Mansfield building Monday evening. Jane Doe – Marion County Sheriff Tim Bailey said Monday that Grate had confessed to killing a woman near Marion sometime between 2003 and 2005. Grate said he did not remember the date or the woman’s name. Grate picked her up after recognizing her as the person who had sold magazine subscriptions to his mother, but had not delivered. Bailey said the details Grate provided matched those of a March 2007 case in which the skeletal remains of a woman were discovered at a dumping site on Victory Road near Marion. After nine years, Bailey said they still are working to identify the woman. While some investigators have wondered if Grate killed more people, there are no publicly known cases beyond these five homicides and investigators in Ross County have discounted any connection between Grate and missing women cases there.

(© Noah Berger / Reuters) Workers prepare outgoing shipments at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, ahead of the Christmas rush, in Tracy, Calif., Nov. 30, 2014. (© Noah Berger / Reuters) Amazon is now eating all the department stores, too Add to ... Shelly Banjo Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, Sep. 20, 2016 11:52AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Sep. 20, 2016 11:52AM EDT Comments AA Amazon is already the biggest clothing seller online. It might soon overtake most of its brick-and-mortar rivals in fashion sales, as well. There were no runway models on any Amazon catwalk at last week’s New York Fashion Week. But the e-commerce giant still loomed large in the minds of retail executives watching it elbow its way into the fashion industry. For the past decade, fashion brands had viewed Amazon as the enemy. Brands swore off selling goods on Amazon, bemoaning its cluttered website and the risk of counterfeit goods. Many reluctantly started their own websites, but continued to rely on department stores for the bulk of their sales. So Amazon started making its own private-label clothes. It bought Zappos in 2009, turbo-charging shoe sales. And it focused on selling the basics, such as t-shirts, leggings, and jeans -- things people felt comfortable buying online and replenishing regularly. As shoppers got more confident buying clothes on Amazon, that eroded the steady consumer spending on basic goods department stores once enjoyed. Amazon increased the number of apparel and accessory products on its website by 87 percent last year from the year before, as its apparel sales hit $16.3-billion, according to trade publication Internet Retailer. That’s more than the combined online sales of its five largest online clothing competitors -- Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Gap, and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands. Amazon’s apparel sales still pale in comparison to the $24-billion in U.S. clothing sales at Walmart, America’s largest apparel seller. But it’s not too far from Macy’s $21-billion in annual apparel sales and TJX Cos. $17-billion. It’s already surpassed the Gap, Kohl’s, Target, J.C. Penney, and Nordstrom in 2015 apparel sales. Amazon - and its marketplace sellers - also figured out a clever way to ding department-store profit margins: Take a popular product - say, a purse or jacket - that’s only available in limited stock (maybe five or ten items) from Amazon sellers. List it a vastly discounted price. Retailers whose websites automatically match Amazon’s prices, or those that have price-match guarantees, end up losing out on profits. And department stores are feeling the pain. Collective sales at the six largest U.S. department stores fell $660-million in the second quarter from a year before. A lot of those sales went to Amazon, whose clothing sales rose $1.1-billion in the quarter from a year earlier, estimates Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger. A fifth of U.S. consumers now “frequently” buy clothes on Amazon, according to a Morgan Stanley survey in April. That rises to 35 per cent for Amazon Prime members. The most interesting thing the survey found, however, was that the top reason consumers gave for shopping on Amazon was “ease and convenience,” followed by “Prime free 2-day shipping.” In other words, the sexiest part of Amazon’s fashion push was not the clothes on its site but its logistics. Still, nearly 60 per cent of consumers said they would buy more clothing on Amazon if it sold a wider selection of well-known, fashionable clothing brands, according to the Morgan Stanley survey. To court brands, Amazon is kissing the fashion industry’s ring: It has sponsored Men’s Fashion Week in New York and India Fashion week. Soon, Tokyo Fashion Week will be renamed Amazon Fashion Week Tokyo. It has a live fashion web show and sponsors a web series on the Council of Fashion Designers of America/Vogue Fashion Fund, backed by fashion arbiters Anna Wintour and Diane von Furstenberg. Earlier this month, it stepped up counterfeit controls on marketplace sellers. The fashion flattery helps prop up brands’ perception of Amazon. Already, brands such as Kate Spade, French Connection, 7 for All Mankind, and Vince prominently display their goods on the e-commerce giant’s website. But the biggest game-changer for Amazon is still unfolding. With sales waning at department stores - where many brands get the bulk of their revenue - Amazon has more leverage than ever before to accelerate its moves into apparel. Talk about fast fashion.

There have been 10 robberies in Oshkosh since March, which includes strong-armed robberies, Oshkosh Police Spokesman Joe Nichols said. Seven of the incidents occurred over the summer months. However, that doesn't necessarily mean there's been an increase in robberies, as the amount of them in 2016 are about the same as years past. More have occurred on the east and north sides of town, and one on the west side near Wal-Mart in July, he said. RELATED: Court sets $1M bond in attempted murder case RELATED: Police investigate third robbery in two weeks "We do see an increase during the summer months," Nichols said. "More people are out and about, mostly individuals who are walking, usually after bar time." Individuals are targets for robberies, he said, especially if they're drunk. The term "strong-armed robbery" includes those robberies in which someone could have only been threatened or maybe pushed. One does not have to show a weapon for it to be defined as strong-armed, so there may not always be a weapon involved, he said. Police are unsure if any of the recent robberies are connected, but Nichols said citizens should not be concerned for their safety as they've been random attacks. With a few tips, Oshkosh residents can avoid becoming a victim of such a crime. Some of those Nichols suggested are to not walk alone at night, and stay in groups or get a ride home if you've had too much to drink. University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh students have the option of calling the university's Safewalk program, where Community Service Officers will accompany them to their destination. If you feel uneasy or threatened, call a friend or call police. RELATED: Two strong-arm robbery suspects charged And, if you become a victim of a robbery, give the suspect what they want and be the best witness you can be, he said. "In some of these instances, you might have someone try to fight and protect themselves, and that's valid," Nichols said. "But we tell people if someone's demanding money and displaying a weapon, give them the money and let them go." Nichols said to get a good description of a suspect, start with their facial features and take note of things that stand out. For example, in Saturday's attempted robbery, the victim noticed a suspect had red spots on their face. Try to remember facial hair, piercings, skin color. Then look from the face down to the feet, such as what color and kind of clothes they're wearing. If there's a weapon involved, take note of which hand it's in — that will usually be a sign of if the person is left- or right-handed. While police are increasing checks in the areas where there have been more robberies, citizens are the eyes and ears where officers can't be. If you see something, smell something or hear something suspicious — say something, Nichols said. Reach Noell Dickmann at 920-426-6658 or ndickmann@thenorthwestern.com.

Robert Eberling answers questions about the death of Texas Woman’s University student Jacqueline Vandagriff during a news conference Monday afternoon outside the Grapevine Police Department. By Jenna Duncan Jenna Duncan Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer jduncan@dentonrc.com Published: 19 September 2016 10:59 AM Related Jacqueline Vandagriff Charles Dean Bryant Suspect in killing of TWU student reportedly stalked ex-girlfriend at UNT Update: 9:45 a.m. Jacqueline Vandagriff, a TWU student, met her alleged murderer at Fry Street Public House the night before she was found dead near Grapevine Lake, according to an arrest affidavit released Tuesday morning. Charles Dean Bryant, 30, of Haslet, went with Vandagriff, 24, to another bar, Shots and Crafts, on West Hickory Street before the two were seen on security footage leaving together. The affidavit details the early hours Wednesday morning when her body was found, such as Bryant purchasing a shovel at 4:41 a.m. at a Wal-Mart in Haslet.  A witness saw a white man standing over the fire at Acorn Woods Park before leaving the scene in a light-colored sports utility vehicle. Vandagriff’s body was dismembered and placed in a blue plastic pool with an accelerant to set the fire, according to the document. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified Vandagriff by her fingerprints. When authorities searched Bryant’s home, there was a plastic pool blue in the backyard identical to the one found at the crime scene, and his roommate confirmed there used to be two of the pools in the backyard. The backyard looked like someone started to dig a hole in the ground, and Vandagriff’s purse was still in the trash at the home, according to the affidavit.  Bryant Arrest Warrant *** GRAPEVINE — A Texas Woman’s University student was identified as a murder victim Monday, five days after her body was found partially dismembered and burned near Grapevine Lake. Charles Dean Bryant, 30, of Haslet, is in Grapevine police custody on a $1 million bail bond. He is charged with capital murder in connection with the death of Jacqueline Vandagriff, a 24-year-old nutrition major from Frisco. An arrest affidavit detailing the events related to her murder was not released Monday by Grapevine police or Grapevine Municipal Court. In a briefing with media Monday, Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling said he was confident Bryant was the right suspect and acted alone. “He has certainly given us quite a few details, but we’ve also uncovered a lot of evidence from the search of his house, the tracking of the victim’s cellphone that led us to the suspect’s house, or in close proximity to the suspect’s house, so we’re gathering a lot of physical evidence, circumstantial evidence, and he’s given us, provided us, with information as well,” Eberling said. The two were seen at a bar Tuesday night in Denton, though Eberling could not identify which bar or where in Denton it was located. It was close to her apartment near TWU’s campus, he said. Tuesday, Sept. 13, on Twitter, an account that appears to belong to Vandagriff stated she gave up on the common dating application Tinder and was “glad” she decided to walk to a bar. It’s unclear if Bryant and Vandagriff knew each other or had ever talked before meeting at the bar, Eberling said. Police knew where she commonly went, and staff helped connect police with people who were familiar with Vandagriff, and there was surveillance camera footage of them leaving together at about 11 p.m. Tuesday. From there, her cellphone pinged towers in Denton, then Argyle and then Haslet, near Bryant’s home. “When we learned that the suspect lived in that house, it could be a potential crime scene,” Eberling said. “We enlisted the help of the FBI evidence and recovery team and they responded Sunday night and processed the house for us. As far as details of the evidence they gathered, we’re still investigating.” Bryant was arrested by Grapevine police at 2:30 p.m. Sunday near his Haslet home. That same day, he was fired from his job at Urban Cowboy Saloon in Fort Worth, according to the business’s Facebook page. “We, The Urban Cowboy Saloon, would like to acknowledge the disturbing news that has broke today and assure our customers that Charles Dean Bryant was terminated as of Sunday, September 18th, for not showing up to his scheduled shift,” the post reads. “Monday afternoon we learned why he didn’t show. “We are grieving with our community and offer our deepest condolences for the Vandagriff family and friends. We are cooperative with authorities and will fully support law enforcement in their investigation.” It is unclear how exactly Vandagriff died. Carol Lawson of the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office said officials anticipate the autopsy will not be completed and released for about 60 days. Bryant had been arrested in Grapevine on a marijuana possession charge in 2013 and a forgery charge in 2010, Eberling said, Additionally, Bryant was arrested twice in Denton this month, according to Denton County records. University of North Texas police arrested him Sept. 6 on a stalking charge, and he was booked into Denton County Jail. He was released the same day on $500 bail. The following day, he was arrested and booked into the same jail on another stalking charge. He posted $5,000 bail on Sept. 9. Additionally, a woman filed a protective order against Bryant on Thursday — the day after Vandagriff’s body was found. Bryant’s arraignment on the capital murder charge has not yet been scheduled, Eberling said. Bryant was not affiliated with TWU in any way, said Amanda Simpson, a spokeswoman for the university. Monica Mendez-Grant, vice president for student life, told the TWU community of Vandagriff’s murder Monday. “The death of a student affects the entire TWU community, and I know that all of us send our deepest sympathy to Jacqueline’s family and friends,” Mendez-Grant said in the email. “Jacqueline exemplified the spirit of learning and service that is the hallmark of our TWU community. She lived her life with a desire to serve others through her interest in nutrition.” In addition to attending TWU, Vandagriff also worked at Sambuca 360 in Plano. BJ Randall, a general manager, would not say how long she had worked at the restaurant and said he had no information about her death. “The entire Sambuca family was saddened to learn of the tragic death of our co-worker, Jackie Vandagriff,” he said in an email. “We have been cooperative with authorities in their investigation, but have no information regarding the circumstances surrounding her death. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, and out of respect for them, we have no further comment.” A call to the Vandagriff home in Frisco was not returned Monday. Her uncle, Randy Vandagriff, released the following statement to NBC 5: “We would like to thank the Grapevine Police Department, FBI and all law enforcement agencies assisting in the investigation for their extraordinary efforts. We would also like to thank our friends, family and the friends of our daughter Jackie for all their support in this difficult time.”   Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Fake gun, real crime: Police notice uptick in replicas Associated Press 2:47 p.m. MST September 19, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades. WIBBITZ FILE - In this Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016, file photo, Columbus, Ohio, Police Chief Kim Jacobs displays a photo of the type of BB gun police say Tyre King pulled from his waistband before he was shot and killed by a police officer. (Photo: Andrew Welsh-Huggins/Associated Press) Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing — it's one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they're cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. "If I can't go get a real gun, it's easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn't going to know it's not real," said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals' use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they've noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 — up 38 percent from a year earlier. FILE - In this Nov. 26, 2014, file photo, a fake handgun resembling a Colt 1911 pistol, taken from Tamir Rice after he was fatally shot by Cleveland police, is displayed after a news conference in Cleveland.  (Photo: Mark Duncan/Associated Press) In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen's hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven't had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. "There's no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun," he said. "That's not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it's a firearm or not." A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week's fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked "practically identical" to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy's friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre's family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy's involvement in an armed robbery would be "out of character" and the police version of events "might not be true."

In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force — deadly or otherwise — on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. "It's horrible, it's horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it's not real," said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. "It's human nature to defend yourself in the face of that," he said. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness. 31 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2dePxjp TOP VIDEOS Twitter expected to field offers to buy social media network this week 1:32 Black police group unhappy with political endorsements 0:32 Emu loose on I-10 in Arizona 0:12 First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades 1:23 Halloween 2016 By The Numbers 0:50 Octopus hunts one of the world's most venomous fish 0:35 Kent Somers, Bob McManaman discuss news from Cardinals camp on Friday 2:12 You Can Sleep In Dracula's Coffin Thanks To Airbnb 1:09 Five things that matter to Millennials in the election 1:52 Half-zebra, half-donkey is 100% adorable 0:27 Punchlines: Disenchanted yet? 4:54 Mexico City cartoon exhibit depicts Donald Trump as a Nazi 2:04 Former Jets player killed in crash 0:37 Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech as incredibly effective 1:15 4 dead when truck plunged off San Diego bridge into crowd below 0:43 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway 1:56 Several women say Trump inappropriately touched them 0:50 Energy-saving tips 1:45 Sustainable building at ASU 2:10 Sedona house destroyed 1:36 Dad's heartfelt Facebook post inspires flood of support from strangers 0:54 Teen Marine surprises his mom after six months away 0:37 Accused school shooter charged with murder, attempted murder 4:29 A Phoenix resident is suing a Pappadeaux restaurant 0:49 Pottermore will tell you what your Patronus is 0:41 5 most memorable Ryder Cup moments 1:11 Trump campaign touts donation windfall after the debate 1:08 This beer is supposed to taste like a burger 1:02 The Republic editorial board's 2016 presidential endorsement 1:07 Pepe the Frog declared a hate symbol by Anti-Defamation League 0:30 More Stories Robb: Pension reform is now impossible in Arizona Nov. 18, 2016, 6:03 a.m. 15 songs you need to hear right now Nov. 18, 2016, 6:14 a.m. Benson: Meet Trump's secretary of State Nov. 18, 2016, 6:34 a.m.

A report showing a steep drop in new residential construction may ease concerns about the possibility a near-term interact rate hike by the Fed. U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday, as interest rate concerns amid the release of a strong housing market reading squeezed the early momentum witnessed by the markets. The averages opened higher and saw a short spike but declined steadily following the release of the housing data. After grazing the unchanged line in late afternoon trading, the indexes moved roughly sideways before pulling back into negative territory going into the close. The Dow Industrials ended down 3.63 points or 0.02 percent at 18,120, the S&P 500 Index closed 0.04 points lower at 2,139 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,235, down 9.54 points or 0.18 percent. The breadth among the Dow components was even, with 15 stocks receding, while the remaining 15 stocks ended higher. Wal-Mart (WMT), Apple (AAPL), Verizon (VZ), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) were among the biggest decliners of the session. Among the sectors, steel and utility stocks gained ground, while most of the other major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves. On the economic front, the National Association of Home Builders reported that homebuilder confidence improved notably in September. The housing market index rose to 65 from a downwardly revised reading of 59 for August. The present sales condition index rose 6 points to 7, representing a nearly 1-year high, the index measuring prospective buyer traffic was up 4 points to 48 and the sales expectations index gained 5 points to 71. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are sliding $0.53 to $42.77 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $0.27 at $43.30 a barrel. The most actively traded November futures are down $0.56 at $43.30 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,317.20, down $0.60 from the previous session's close of $1,317.80. On Monday, gold rose $8.90. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 101.84 yen compared to the 101.93 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1180 compared to yesterday's $1.1175. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, as risk aversion once again reared its head ahead of two major global central bank decisions. Crude oil was also lower in Asian session. The Chinese, Hong Kong, Indian, Indonesian and Japanese markets closed lower, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Japanese market ended lower as the yen stabilized at the upper 101-yen level against the dollar. The Nikkei 225 Index opened lower but managed to snap its losses and move into positive territory by late morning trading. After hovering in the green until late afternoon trading, the index pulled back and ended down 27.14 points or 0.16 percent at 16,492. Food, textile, pharma, retail, brokerage, insurance, real estate and most export stocks came under selling pressure. On the other hand, housing, chemical, banking, utility and paper stocks advanced. Mining stocks ended mixed Australia's All Ordinaries Index opened higher but quickly reversed and fell below the flat line. After being in the red for the better part of the session, the index recovered going into the close to end up 3.60 points or 0.07 percent at 5,397. Most sectors advanced, led by IT, material and utility stocks. However, energy and telecom stocks pulled back sharply. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 19.59 points or 0.08 percent before ending at 23,531, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3,023, down 3.05 points or 0.10 percent. The minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's September monetary policy meeting hinted at stability in interest rates, as historically low rates help the economy shrug off weakness in investment in resources. Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that house prices in Australia rose 2 percent sequentially in the second quarter following a 0.2 percent drop in the first quarter. Economists expected a sharper 3 percent increase. Annually, house prices rose a less than expected 3 percent. Europe European stocks are higher for the second straight session. After opening on a lackluster note, the major averages in Europe have managed to grind higher and are currently seeing notable strength. In major corporate news, U.K. home improvement retailer Kingfisher reported higher adjusted pre-tax profits, as sales grew. However, the company cautioned of softness in France in the near term. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced that Emma Walmsley, currently the CEO of the company's Consumer Healthcare division, was appointed CEO Designate and will succeed Andrew Witty when he retires on March 31, 2017. On the economic front, data released by the German Federal Statistical Office showed that producer prices in German fell 1.6 percent year-over-year in August, slower than the 2 percent drop in July. Wholesale prices have been on the wane since August 2013. Excluding energy prices, producer prices were down 0.3 percent. U.S. Economic Reports The two-day FOMC meeting gets underway later today, although the decision is not expected until Wednesday. New residential construction in the U.S. pulled back by much more than expected in the month of August, the Commerce Department revealed in a report on Tuesday. The report said housing starts tumbled by 5.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.142 million in August from the revised July estimate of 1.212 million. Economists had expected housing starts to drop by 1.7 percent to a rate of 1.190 million from the 1.211 million that had been reported for the previous month. The Commerce Department also said building permits, an indicator of future housing demand, dipped by 0.4 percent to a rate of 1.139 million in August from a revised 1.144 million in July. The decrease surprised economists, who had expected building permits to climb by 1.3 percent to a rate of 1.167 million in August from the 1.152 million originally reported for the previous month. ?Stocks in Focus Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) reported third quarter earnings and revenues that rose more than expected amid a notable increase in home deliveries. Forward Air (FWRD) lowered its third quarter revenue growth guidance range to -2% to 2% from 1-5% and reduced its adjusted income per share guidance to 48-52 cents per share from 61-65 cents per share. The predicament was blamed on lower freight volumes. Reacting to the schedule 13D filed by Alden Golden Capital, Pier 1 Imports (PIR) said it would continue to engage with its shareholders and evaluate opportunities to increase long-term shareholder value. Steel Dynamics (STLD) pre-announced that it expects third quarter earnings per share of 63-67 cents per share, up from 25 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said it would benefit from meaningful metal spread expansion and a higher rate of growth in realized steel product pricing than in the additional costs for higher prices ferrous scrap utilized.

According to local news reports and employees who spoke to Business Insider, Sears Holding, the owners of Kmart and Sears, announced the closures to their employees on Friday. The soon-to-be closed stores will begin their liquidation sales this weekend and shut their doors for good in December. [Image by Tim Boyle/Getty Images] Sears Holding stated that closing down these stores was the only way that they can “accelerate its transformation and return to its profitability”. In a statement released by Edward S. Lampert, the chairman and CEO of Sears Holdings, he states that the decision to close down these stores was a “difficult, but necessary step”, as they look to look to strengthen their company by taking “aggressive actions” in an effort to fund their transformation and restore its profitability. In April of this year, 78 stores – 10 Sears stores and 68 Kmart locations – were closed as part of its efforts to help stop the bleeding. This accounts for five percent of its entire store base, which totals 1,700 stores. The once prominent company, which became popular because of its Blue Light Specials, has been experiencing a gradual decline over the last two decades. It’s profitability and sales were at their peak in 1992, but have since been dropping due in large part to competition from Target, Walmart, and online shopping. It closed 110 stores in 1994 and unlike its two biggest competitors (Target and Walmart), it was not able to invest in computer technology which could have helped managed its supply chain. Furthermore, the company maintained a high dividend, meaning it did not have enough money to invest in the improvement of its stores. Its failure to create and maintain a coherent and consistent brand image has also contributed to the corporation’s struggles. [Image by Frank Franklin II/AP Images] According to Moody’s analysts, Kmart and Sears do not have enough money to keep themselves in business for much longer and that their shutdown is imminent. In a note published by Moody’s last Wednesday, the analysts downgraded Sear’s liquidity rating, saying that the company is practically bleeding cash at this point and will have to continuously rely on outside funding or the sale of certain assets, such as real estate, in order to maintain operations. This recent announcement of Kmart closing stores has now left it with only 870 locations, which is down from 1,300 in 2012. Sears Holdings has been struggling for quite a while now due to weakening sales and their inability to keep up with stores that sell home appliances, such as Home Depot, and the ever growing trend of internet shopping in websites such as Amazon.com and eBay. In 2011, Sears Holdings had a total of 4,000 stores, but they have been selling assets for years in a somewhat desperate attempt to raise cash. Sears has also been drifting away from its focus of operating a store network and has instead chosen to turn it into a member-focused business. Loyal shoppers are given incentives to buy from their stores, but unfortunately for Sears, this move hasn’t really done much to help them gain any traction from their shoppers. Last year, the company had a fourth-quarter net loss of $159 million, and it has only gotten worse as it reported a fourth quarter net loss of $580 million for 2016. Sears has refused to comment on the exact number of employees that will be affected by these closures, but it said that a vast majority of them are part-time workers. In a bit of good news, eligible associates will be provided with severance and given a chance to apply for any available positions at area Sears or Kmart stores. A complete list of the closing stores can be seen here.

RELATED Texas Suing Injured State Workers to Avoid Paying Medical Bills The Most Dangerous Government Jobs and Why They're Riskier Than the Private Sector What Does Racism Have to Do With Workers' Comp? Before the ruling, Oklahoma had been the only other state offering an “opt out” provision. That leaves some Texas attorneys and labor unions questioning whether the state’s nonsubscriber option for businesses will survive, but a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance said changes are unlikely because there are "significant differences" between the Oklahoma and Texas law. Still, Richard Levy, secretary-treasurer of the Teas AFL-CIO, called the Oklahoma ruling “significant” for Texas and said the group is considering if a similar argument could be used to strike down the Texas opt-out provision. “I would imagine that a lot of people in this area are looking at their Texas Constitutions right now,” Levy said. “Certainly, we expect this to be an issue in the upcoming legislative session.” Major companies like Wal-Mart, Lowe’s and Costco have opted out of the Texas system with the help of attorney Bill Minick, president of the Dallas-based consulting firm PartnerSource. He helped launch the campaign to change the way companies take care of injured workers by establishing their own plans for covering medical costs. The private plans have been criticized for offering lower benefits and giving the companies inordinate control over health care decisions. In 2014, 80 percent of Texas’ 7.7 million private employees were covered by the state's workers’ compensation insurance, according to the most updated numbers from the Texas Department of Insurance. That left more than 1.4 million Texans covered in non-subscriber alternatives plans and 470,000 employees, or five percent, without any form of workers' compensation coverage. “I would imagine that a lot of people in this area are looking at their Texas Constitutions right now.” — Richard Levy, Texas AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Minick said he isn’t worried about the Oklahoma ruling affecting Texas because Oklahoma’s constitution is vastly different and the court’s decision revolved around a “special law” provision unique to Oklahoma. “The Texas Constitution does not prohibit business competition the way that the Oklahoma Constitution appears to,” he said. “To my knowledge, that statute and the manner in which the Oklahoma Supreme Court applies it is entirely unique to Oklahoma.” PartnerSource does not have plans to push Texas lawmakers for new legislation in the upcoming session, but Minick said the group is continuously improving injury benefit programs in the state. “The Texas nonsubscriber option has now been going strong for 27 years and successfully resolved over 1 million injury claims,” Minick said. “So there’s a lot of data that demonstrates better outcomes for injured workers, as well as cost savings for employers.” Minick doesn’t think other states will shy away from trying to implement opt-out programs. “We do believe that other state interests and alternatives will increase,” he said. “Most everybody wants to see injured workers receive better benefits, improve return to work, reduce claim disputes and reduce insurance premiums.” The Texas Tribune  |  The Texas Tribune       0 comments Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

HOME MUSIC FASHION ENTERTAINMENT SPORT TITBITS INTERNATIONAL TEENAGE Inhuman hours and illegalities: summer work and travel A worker's tales from summer '16 Fredrika Gordon | Tuesday, September 20, 2016 | Tweet Each year thousands of our tertiary students venture to the United States on the summer work and travel programme. The programme’s main purpose is to facilitate cultural exchange, however, as the Jamaican dollar is undoubtedly weak against the US dollar, most students go for the money. The profits from the programme typically go towards tuition, boarding and new gadgets. Indeed, without the existence of this programme many students would not be able to fund their tertiary education. Thus, it is truly alarming and disheartening that these same students are muddying the very waters they hope to drink. Last year many were disappointed when five of our students were arrested after using their employment at Walmart as an opportunity to steal from the store. Unfortunately, these incidents are far from rare. In July of this year, two male students were fired (and subsequently deported) as they had been stealing guests' smartphones from the theme park where they worked. Some of the guests were relentless in tracking their phones and led the police right to the dorm these gentlemen shared. Another student was apprehended as he had been saving credit card information hotel given to him by guests over the phone to book their rooms, and subsequently using the information to make his own personal purchases online. Jamaicans themselves are hardly safe from the crimes of their fellow students. Many students believed they could make large purchases using other person’s credit/debit cards. This summer saw one student being brazen enough to pay her entire school fee with her roommate's earnings after gaining access to the young lady's debit card. Another female student ended up being detained by the police in Wisconsin, after she had purchased a Samsung S7 Edge with her co-worker's debit card, until her parents in Jamaica were able to wire money to the victim. Several of the sponsoring agencies in the US have become weary of the issues that seem affiliated with bringing our students overseas. The sponsors are responsible for the students when they are abroad and thus drawn into basically all issues surrounding the students. Employers too are losing interest in hiring Jamaican students, despite acknowledging that they possess an admirable work ethic. When the primary employers provide the job offer form which enables the students to enter the US, they are expecting a certain kind of loyalty. However, the Jamaican students are loyal to the money, not an employer. Once many of the students find a second job, their performance at their primary job declines due to either fatigue or lack of interest. In the students’ defense, the programme itself can become little more than modern day indentureship. Many of the students endure some horrible realities during the summer, but few ever really discuss them in Jamaica as once you were in “foreign”, this equates to prosperity and progress. Several of our students are faced with new, and scary instances of racism. In Jamaica we may have class prejudice, but racial prejudice is a new experience for many first-timers. One may easily understand why a student said she “just felt like returning home” after a customer told her child not to purchase a ticket from the “black ticket seller”. Another culture shock stems from the fact that the jobs our students end up doing abroad are low-end jobs that most Americans have no interest in. Often the work environment becomes stressful as suddenly Jamaican students who study things such as law and accounting find themselves reduced to only black minimum wage earners in a country where they expect to be treated equal. Some students face inequality in instances where their supervisors are not Americans. Many European supervisors in theme/water parks (the most popular employers) were once students on the cultural exchange programme who decided not to return home (mostly Bulgarians and Romanians). Often these supervisors give preferential treatment to the students from their countries by way of extra hours and favorable work positions whilst the Jamaicans suffer. Complaints to sponsors typically fall on deaf ears. Most Jamaican students report that they receive better treatment at their second jobs (usually a store or fast food restaurant) but stay with their primary job either because it is attached to their housing or because their second job is unwilling to go through the process of assisting them with documentation to return the following year. As the students are interested in earning, many work long hours that are almost unheard of in our society - standing for thirteen hours with only one-hour break is hardly a part of our culture. However, when the students are ready to collect their earnings, some of their hours are magically missing, resulting in less pay as they are paid hourly. A student of the University of the West Indies reported that after he had been on training for almost three weeks at a New Jersey restaurant, the owner claimed he “had no knowledge of him working there” and threatened to call the police when he inquired about his paycheck. Not all the students humbly deal with these realities. Some female students eagerly seek out older Caucasian men (fewer male students seek women) to supplement their paychecks, while some males focus on other illegal ventures.           The work and travel programme provides unprecedented opportunities for learning and financing of tertiary education. However, many workers returned this summer having suffered, while some may have caused country to suffer. For all the good the programme may do, it is not the bed of roses many of us picture 'foreign' to be, and some Jamaican students may cause it to be even worse for future workers.

In Westerville, a man apparently still on a quest to “catch ‘em all” is accused of stealing every pack of Pokemon trading cards from the Wal-Mart on East Schrock Road, Reporter Alissa Widman Neese tells us. The theft occurred just before 6 p.m. Wednesday. A total of 210 packs, valued at nearly $880, went missing, as well as a webcam valued at $80, according to a Westerville police report. The thief was described as a young white man wearing a black shirt, red hat and blue jeans — suspiciously, the same clothes worn by Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum, the main character from the popular ’90s television show. Car surfing Neese, always on the lookout for the out-of-the-ordinary, brought us this gem, too: When a man saw a teen riding on the hood of a moving vehicle, he did the right thing and called Gahanna police. Officers went to the scene only to learn that the city had helped organize the stunt. Apparently, the teens were filming part of a video to promote safe driving habits. This is Safe Driving Awareness month in Ohio, and yesterday was Distracted Driving Awareness Day in Gahanna. City officials have teamed up with the Ohio Department of Transportation and Gahanna Lincoln High School for the educational event. Jekyll and Hyde Judges call them “Jekyll and Hyde” defendants. They’re people who, to their families and community, would never break the law. Michael C. Otis is one. A corrections officer with the state Department of Youth Services for 10 years, he was a role model to incarcerated youths. He’s a loving father of two and a homeowner, attorney Larry W. Thomas told U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley on Friday. But in the garage of Otis’ four-bedroom house on the Northeast Side, FBI agents and Columbus police found 8 pounds of marijuana, including 2 pounds of “cush,” or high-grade weed, in May 2015. Always the curious sort, Marbley asked how the 42-year-old Thomas reconciles “his work with youths, trying to get them to do the right thing during the day, and at night engage in a nefarious deed?” There was no answer. The U.S. attorney’s office was seeking 30 years in prison. Prosecutors dropped charges relating to the marijuana and to two guns found in the house in exchange for Otis pleading guilty last October. Otis apologized for his behavior. He lost his job and now he’s a manager for Cheryl’s Cookies. Marbley decided to give Otis a break. He sentenced him to 12 months and a day in prison. The extra day entitles him to time off for good behavior. klecker@dispatch.com @kellylecker Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Babb says she got her job because she went in for the interview and the owner found out she was taking a Careers in Retail Leadership Training class. Buy Now PAT SUTPHIN, TIMES-NEWS Manager Kelli Babb poses for a portrait in her office Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, at Twin Falls 93 RV Park in Filer. TWIN FALLS — Following two years of treatment for breast cancer, Kelli Babb had a difficult time getting back to work. She bounced from temp job to temp job for a couple of years and was required to take a training with Easter Seals-Goodwill Northern Rocky Mountain while she was on welfare. When she heard about a new Careers in Retail training program, she decided to sign up, impressing a future employer during a job interview at Twin Falls 93 RV Park in Filer. “She was really impressed, and thought that would make me a great fit,” Babb said. Easter Seals-Goodwill extended its Careers in Retail Training program to individuals with the goal of helping people in entry-level jobs move up into better paying, mid-management positions. “This is for people that are entry level, just not making enough or unemployed,” said Jan Duff, job developer for Careers in Retail. “The whole purpose is to get them more money.” The free program has been offered since last year in Twin Falls and Boise through a grant from the Walmart Foundation, Duff said. Previously offered through employers, it’s been open to individuals for just a couple of months. Babb took the six-day course at the end of August and already feels it’s helped her in her job as office manager for the RV park. The business has plans to expand next year, with Babb overseeing other people in the office. “Before this class, I didn’t think I really had leadership abilities,” she said. “I’m an introvert. Leading people and being assertive and firm — I didn’t think I had it in me.” Now, she feels differently. The class instruction covers topics such as communication and interpersonal skills, teamwork, professionalism and human resources. “Just getting people to believe in themselves is probably the greatest lesson they earn in there,” Careers in Retail Instructor Nanette Fisher said. So far, about 200 business employees and 40 individuals have received the training. Many have found out about the program through Easter Seals-Goodwill or word-of-mouth, Duff said. “They’re looking for skills that they can take back to work with them,” Fisher said. Nicole Humphrey was volunteering for the organization when Duff suggested it as an option. She wasn’t employed at the time because of health problems. “I was hoping to learn more about professionalism in the workplace and how to dissolve workplace conflict,” Humphrey said. Following the class, Duff tracks where the students are at and helps them craft resumes. She also recommended Humphrey for a job at C3/CustomerContactChannels as a customer service representative. The business has sent many of its employees through the training. “They trust the program,” said Humphrey, who took the job, with the prospect of extra incentives, more hours and possible promotion after six months. Duff has analyzed the success of the Careers in Retail training with employees already working in a company who moved up into mid-management positions. On average, their wages increased by $7.40 an hour after taking the class and receiving certification, she said. Classes take place twice a month for individuals.

Pradeep Nair Comment   ·   print   ·   T  T   T+  ·   T- Tweet K.R. Sridhar Way back in 1994, NASA scientist K.R. Sridhar began work on creating a technology that would sustain life on Mars. However, the Mars mission didn't take off. But Dr. Sridhar didn’t let the work go to waste. In 2001, he began tweaking the technology to create electricity in an easy and non-polluting manner. At the core is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell that converts fuel into electricity through a clean electrochemical process, said Dr. Sridhar, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bloom Energy. Today, his company produces clean power for over 100 of the Fortune 500 companies that belong to sectors like FMCG, IT, telecom, retailing and e-commerce. Unlike the conventional method that involves conversion of different types of energy resulting in huge transmission loss, this method uses direct energy conversion. Fuel goes on one side, air on the other side, and without fire or combustion, through an electrochemical process they react, and electrical energy is released. The fuel cell system can use any type of fuel, including biogas that can be produced from waste. One Bloom Energy Server provides 250 kilowatts of power round-the-clock. The size of one unit is that of a shipping container and can power a large megastore or office complex. If the requirement is 10 times of this, 10 such units are installed. Some of the companies that are using this technology are Apple, Google, Walmart, AT&T, eBay, Staples, and Coca-Cola, as well as non-profit organisations and universities. In India, the technology has been deployed at one installation, for which the natural gas is being supplied by GAIL, with which Bloom Energy has signed an MoU recently. Distributed electricity Dr. Sridhar was in Bengaluru recently, and he spoke to The Hindu about the technology and how it would benefit India. He began by drawing a parallel with the revolution brought in by computers and mobile phones. “It started with huge mainframe computers. When distributed computing came, it first became accessible, and then with volume and scale, it became affordable. Another example is telephony. When cellphones came, only the celebrities had it at first. It wasn’t affordable. Later prices dropped with better technology. What this teaches us is that if you want accessibility, affordability and ubiquitousness, then it better be distributed and not centralized,” he said. Dr. Sridhar said the current methodology of power generation fails in two ways: one, it is polluting and two, it is not affordable. To solve this problem, Bloom Energy solution is pegged to the principle of distributed electricity. “We have created a disruptive platform where we produce electricity of digital quality and 24x7 reliability. We take the most benign of the fossil fuels, natural gas, and convert that in the most efficient way with zero pollutants.” He said the Bloom solution needs neither huge power grids nor water; and occupies far less land compared to alternatives like solar power. Turning liability into assets Dr. Sridhar said considering the mounting demand for electricity, India can shift from the existing infrastructure that is capital intensive, inflexible and requires long planning horizons to Bloom Energy Servers that are highly flexible, modular, upgradeable and rapidly deployable. Being early days, right now it makes better sense to deploy this technology for large complexes that use huge amounts of electricity and power backups. “Our vision is, in future, we will have the cheapest way to produce power,” said Dr. Sridhar. “In the future of 10 billion planet, there will be huge amounts of human, animal and plant waste which will be one of our biggest liabilities. Or, it can be converted into an asset, by locally converting small amounts of it, to electricity,” he said.

Westmoreland County's veterans court program is underutilized and ineffective, according to officials who monitor criminal cases involving former members of the military. Created in 2012 as a diversionary program to allow veterans to avoid convictions of minor crimes, the special court has overseen just a few cases and has had no new enrollees since the presiding judge left office at the start of the year. “It's still available, but people are not aware of it,” Court Administrator Amy DeMatt said.. Veterans court was dormant until January 2015, when a Donora man who was injured while serving in Afghanistan was charged with stealing a microwave from Wal-Mart in Rostraver. After several court sessions before Judge David Regoli and mandated counseling, the charge was dismissed. Officials said Monday they were unaware of anyone else who had been enrolled in the program. Critics said the program is not designed to function as a true veterans court, similar to what's in Allegheny, Fayette and 15 other Pennsylvania counties. Those programs allow veterans charged with felonies, drug and alcohol offenses and other crimes to have their cases dismissed at the common pleas level; the Westmoreland court only allows participation of veterans charged with minor summary and nonviolent misdemeanor offenses. “What we need is a full-fledged veterans court that takes all cases. The way it is set up now, it's only for low-level crimes. It's nothing I can use. I can have those cases diverted without a veterans court,” said Keather Likins, a justice outreach specialist with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Aspinwall. Because the program is available for veterans who face minimal charges, most can use existing diversionary programs, pay fines for summary citations or receive probation without using the special court, said Public Defender Wayne McGrew. McGrew said lawyers in his office have been unsuccessful in attempts to get clients enrolled in veterans court. “The limitations of the program were too stringent for us to have viable candidates,” McGrew said. “Most veterans have alcohol or drug issues, and the program does not allow people facing DUIs or drug offenses to participate.” There are about 35,000 veterans who live in Westmoreland County, according to Matt Zamosky, director of the county's office for veterans affairs. Zamosky said the county's special court has been used inconsistently and sparingly. “There are good people who get into trouble because of what they went through in the military. I think the program we have could be outstanding if we were consistent with how we use it,” he said. Likins said a true veterans court would enable former military members to have more serious cases — including those that could carry jail sentences — diverted from the courts as a means to avoid incarceration. “I have a list of about 12 guys (awaiting trial) in Westmoreland County Prison who are veterans and probably only about two are eligible for veterans court,” Likins said. The guidelines for veterans court were drafted by a previous court administrator and approved by Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck. Peck said he supports the concept, but conceded the program has never been a priority and that it remained dormant until Regoli was appointed to the bench in mid 2014. “We would review the facts of a case, and if we confirm someone is eligible, (we) would certainly consider (transferring a case to veterans court),” Peck said. The use of the court waned after Regoli, who actively sought to oversee the program, failed to win election to a full term last year and left office in January, Peck said. DeMatt said Judge Christopher Feliciani assumed oversight of the court, but officials could not verify how many, if any, cases remained on the docket. Feliciani was unavailable for comment Monday. “You have to let it be known, and you basically have to advertise it,” said Regoli, who now works as a lawyer in the county solicitor's office. “They don't have a problem enrolling people in the Allegheny County program.” Allegheny County had 32 veterans go through its program last year, and since it was created in 2009 has had more than 180 former military members enroll, officials said. DeMatt said statistics were not available to determine how the veterans court program was used in Westmoreland County. She said a change to the program is not being considered. For veterans advocates such as Likins, expansion of the court is needed. “Right now, I don't have any recourse for them,” Likins said. Rich Cholodofsky is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

By Brian Scott Brian Scott Denton Record-Chronicle NBC5 Published: 19 September 2016 10:57 PM Related Eperjesi Photo: Courtesy photo LEWISVILLE — In his 89 years of life, Andy Eperjesi has seen a lot of things and worn a lot of hats. The Kentucky native worked the coal mines, spent years at Texas Instruments, worked jobs at Wal-Mart and Enterprise, and in his spare time, spent 25 years volunteering to preach to inmates at the Denton County Jail. All of those jobs, like for many in his generation, came after serving his country in the U.S. Army at the tail end of World War II. “In the boat battalion, they trained us how to land in surf, take people off of boats and land them on the shore,” Eperjesi said. The proudest moments of his long life are clear, though looking at the walls of his home of 50 years in Lewisville: his family. Married for 62 years, Andy and his wife had more than a half-dozen children who have now raised grandchildren of their own and now bring him great-grandchildren to visit. It’s just Eperjesi at the house these days, though. His wife passed away in 2010, and in recent years his health and age have caught up with him, leaving that family house in rough shape. The paint was peeling, rust had formed and his wife’s beloved gardens had become overgrown and lost most of their signature beauty. That’s something Keri Sutherland couldn’t stand to see. “One of the things he said to me in the initial interview was, ‘I just want to see them [the gardens at home] how my wife would have liked them,’” said Sutherland. So Sutherland, a manager at Habitat for Humanity of Denton County, took on Eperjesi for the organization’s new “Brush with Kindness” program. Along with the organization’s usual mission of building homes for those in need, Brush with Kindness also brings in volunteers and raises funds to help fix up the homes and yards of of area residents like Eperjesi who just can’t manage on their own anymore. Volunteers from Thrivent Financial, Frontier Communications and Flower Mound United Methodist Church spent the weekend at Eperjesi’s house repainting, repairing the deck and siding, leveling out the 89-year-old’s yard, and maybe most importantly fixing up his wife’s gardens and beginning to replant the beauty that had once grown there. “This is wonderful,” said Eperjesi’s daughter, Karen Culpepper. “These people have worked so hard, they’re so dedicated.” After years of working for others, Eperjesi finally got the chance to sit back while others worked for him, smiling as his home transformed thanks to the kindness of strangers. Denton County Habitat already has future Brush with Kindness events scheduled, as well as a full list of home builds as members pursue their goal to build 50 homes in the next five years.

PICTURE/PETER DE GRAAF I would like to comment on the article in last Thursday's Age regarding the district council's decision to add a turning lane into both The Warehouse main carpark and their loading goods area on North Park Drive. First, as the regulatory authority, FNDC can make decisions as they see fit. However, with that responsibility they should ensure the outcome is in the best interest of a viable commercial environment, the community, and obviously road safety. We doubt the council purposely favoured The Warehouse Group with its decision, but due to the way they considered the application that is certainly the outcome. Operating a local business against large corporates is always challenging. In the United States small rural towns similar to Kaitaia have lost their business diversity, and are now completely reliant on their Warehouse equivalent - Walmart. It's not in Kaitaia's best interests, or the council's, to see this scenario repeated here. At Folders we have worked incredibly hard to build a store that competes with the best of the big guys. Our prices are always competitive (if not the best), and with the largest appliance, computer and bed showroom north of Whangarei, we have the biggest range of products for you to choose from. Continued below. Related Content Stars align for healthy hikoi Battle commemorated Football: Kaitaia 1st XI rules the waves What we don't have are millions of dollars to spend on advertising, so we rely on our loyal customers letting others know that Folders is always worth the visit and a road that delivers optimum driver convenience. I do not take issue with the turning lane into The Warehouse main carpark, even though I do not believe the current traffic movements justify a 'personal lane,' and it gives them a level of perceived and undeserved importance. What I do have an issue with is the decision to extend their 'personal' lane to their goods entrance , resulting in an extended and unnecessary no parking zone. Folders have more goods traffic movements than they do. Surely an unencumbered road must be preferential for the community, the commercial development, and the developer, who is working hard to attract further business to Kaitaia. In my opinion the council did not consider all the issues when making the decision, and allowed a large corporate retailer to dominate traffic movement for their own competitive benefit. While I understand FNDC defending its position, I sincerely hope that future decisions are made taking a much broader perspective involving a level of consultation. While I suspect it will never happen, it would be great if FNDC removed the goods entrance lane design and reduced the no parking zone in front of the vacant lots and opposite Folders.

You don’t hold someone’s feet to the fire by electing them to the most powerful office on planet Earth. I’m pointing this out because it seems like every Hillary Clinton supporter I talk to these days ends up regurgitating that party line at some point. “Yeah, I know she’s not the best when it comes to progressive values, but if we elect her we can all band together and hold her feet to the fire, forcing her to make good on the progressive agenda she’s been campaigning on.” Defeat the fascist @realDonaldTrump and hold #CrookedHillary's feet to the fire all at once! https://t.co/zaOTx6TfM1 pic.twitter.com/m6W9bOkLtU — BernieOrBump (@BernieOrBump) August 2, 2016 Remember when mindlessly regurgitating party lines was something we used to make fun of Republicans for? Sean Hannity would say something like “We need to stay the course in Iraq, not cut and run” or whatever, and within hours all your Republican acquaintances would be peppering political conversations with the phrases “stay the course” and “cut and run.” Remember how weird that was? How a key phrase could fly from Karl Rove’s mouth in some backroom think tank on Monday, be immediately passed along by conservative radio hosts and the talking heads on Fox News, and be a staple part of water cooler conversations by Tuesday morning? Well, in case you haven’t noticed, Democrats are the masters of that schtick now. They must have been paying attention. And “hold Hillary’s feet to the fire” is one of those key phrases being passed around through liberal discussion circles like head lice through a kindergarten. It’s a really brilliant phrase; if anyone reading this knows whose neoliberal brainchild it is, please pass along my compliments to the chef. It’s so violent, so falsely empowering, so insidiously manipulative in the way it gets liberals to feel as though they’re participating in some sort of grand conspiratorial rebellion together whilst handing all their power to the ruling corporatist elites, who are then free to go about expanding and bolstering the politics of corruption, war, income inequality, wage slavery, and a global expansionism of Wal-Mart economics. Climate leaders don't frack! #UpToUs to hold dems & @HillaryClinton's feet to the firehttps://t.co/zrHGpXIA6u pic.twitter.com/BGzQ8JsNXI — LET GO AND LOVE DOC (@LETGOANDLOVEdoc) August 5, 2016 And, most importantly, it works. People are buying it. While virtually nobody is enthusiastic about the idea of electing the anointed queen of the Clinton dynasty, they can at least feel somewhat dignified by the prospect of leveraging her into some semblance of a movement to the left. Except that isn’t how leverage works, is it? Any businessmen or politician worth their salt knows that you can’t negotiate worth spit from a position of weakness. If they’ve got all the power, they’ve got all the leverage, and there’s no reason for them to do anything other than what they feel like doing. You don’t force someone to honor your wishes by handing them all the power and then nicely asking them to please honor your wishes. You force them by forcing them. How do you force them? You keep your power. You make them need you more than you need them. You help make sure that they will never win another election until they stop rigging primaries and offering horrible candidates. The elites of the Democratic party want us to believe that we’re already negotiating from a point of weakness by playing their Trump card, saccharinely reminding us at every opportunity that we need to vote for their anointed queen because if we don’t, the big, scary orange man will light America on fire. But they’re bluffing. The Clintons play golf with Trump; Bill and Donald even had a lengthy phone conversation before Trump announced his candidacy. The Democrats have decades of experience dealing with narcissistic billionaire Republicans, and they know how to work with them. What they don’t know how to work with is this new progressive awakening that’s been confounding their neoliberal agenda for the last year and a half. They’re not afraid of Trump, they’re afraid of us. Should we hold "HIllary Clinton's feet to the fire" on #humanrights if she becomes POTUS? https://t.co/bOzXxyyYx0 pic.twitter.com/qWoXtvpnss — AWARE (@Alliance4Wrkrs) August 24, 2016 So we call their bluff. We make the Democrats watch all their votes bleed out to third parties so they’ll never, ever spit on us like that again. If we do that, you can guarantee that they will be forced to give us a real primary election in 2020, with a real candidate who will make real changes. And if we don’t do this, the opposite is guaranteed to happen. Voting for Hillary Clinton is a great way to help guarantee more rigged primaries and more forcefully-installed warmongering neoliberal cronies in the future, which will, in turn, make it possible for the Republicans to move even further to the right. That means more war, more predatory trade agreements, more Wall Street cronyism, more tax breaks for the ruling class, more exploitation of the poor, and an overall movement to the right for American politics in the long term. Don’t let them trick you into trying to negotiate from a place of weakness, my progressive brothers and sisters. Stand your ground, call their bluff, and force them to do the right thing.
