REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo By Los Angeles Times Apr 12, 2017 at 3:44 pm | Print View Dissenters were quick to react when ModCloth, an online seller of trendy women’s clothes and accessories, was acquired by retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last month. “You have disappointed us all,” one reader commented under a blog post by ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger announcing the sale — the notion being that ModCloth would lose its cache as part of a discount mass merchant. “I’m done shopping with you,” wrote another. But Gregg Koger noted that Wal-Mart would give ModCloth “the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow.” ModCloth is one example of how Wal-Mart belatedly but aggressively is expanding its e-commerce business to keep pace with the seismic shift in consumer shopping from bricks-and-mortar stores to the internet. With nearly half-a-trillion dollars in annual sales and 4,700 U.S. stores, Wal-Mart has been buying online retailers, slashing shipping rates and rolling out new ways for in-store customers to do more of their shopping at Walmart.com and its other websites. While traditional U.S. in-store retailing is growing less than two percent a year — forcing many retailers to close stores — e-commerce is growing 16 percent annually, researcher EMarketer Inc. reports. E-commerce sales this year will hit $462 billion and soar to $789 billion by 2021, the company estimates. Wal-Mart’s effort to tap that online growth often is portrayed as a direct attack on Amazon.com Inc., the online-retailing behemoth. Wal-Mart prefers to frame its strategy as capturing more of the e-commerce market by blending its in-store, online and mobile-app offerings so that customers easily can move from one to the other to make purchases. If it snatches business from Amazon in the process, all the better. One of Wal-Mart’s key acquisitions was Jet.com Inc., which also sells a variety of consumer products and groceries. Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com last year and then named Jet.com Chairman Marc Lore to head its entire U.S. e-commerce operation. “It was a radical signal to everyone that the biggest retailer in the world was willing to put $3.3 billion into the (online) market,” said Adrien Nussenbaum, CEO of Mirakl, a developer of software products for retailers and other businesses. Under Lore and Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart has taken several other steps to bolster its e-commerce sales, including: • Acquiring Shoebuy.com, an online footwear retailer, and Moosejaw.com, an online seller of outdoor apparel and gear. Those retailers and ModCloth continue operating as separate websites. • Launching free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more at Walmart.com, Jet.com and many of its other sites. • Boosting the stock on its virtual shelves. At the start of 2016, Walmart.com had eight million items for sale. Today it has more than 35 million items. • Launching a program that allows in-store customers to go online or check their phone app to see a list of items they have bought, then reorder those items online. • Rolling out a groceries program whereby customers order items online and then have the groceries loaded into their vehicle at a Wal-Mart store. • Forming a division called Store No. 8 that’s intended to hatch new online retail approaches and businesses. Wal-Mart said in October that it was going to slow the pace of new store openings this year, in good part to shift investments to its e-commerce business. “We’re being pretty active,” Lore said during a recent tech gathering, called Code Commerce, in Las Vegas. “We’re behind. We need to catch up. There are some big things we have in the works,” said Lore, who spent two years with Amazon after it bought his previous online venture, the parent of Diapers.com and other sites. Wal-Mart is the second-largest online mass merchandiser behind Amazon, but it’s a distant second. Amazon’s product sales totaled $94.7 billion last year while Wal-Mart’s tallied $14.4 billion, according to EMarketer. Amazon, with $136 billion in total sales last year, has other assets and services as well, namely a variety of video, entertainment and other services available through its Prime membership. Prime also provides free shipping on Amazon purchases, and analysts estimate about 65 million Amazon customers subscribe to Prime for $99 a year. (Amazon doesn’t disclose the number except to say it has “tens of millions” of subscribers.) Stephen Beck, founder of the management consulting firm Cg42, said Prime gives Amazon customers more incentive to shop at the site. Prime customers spend an average $270 a year above what they were spending at Amazon before subscribing, he said. The Bentonville, Ark., company, which also owns the Sam’s Club chain, posted total sales of $482 billion in its fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Like what you're reading?

According to new data from the NPD Group's Checkout Tracking Service, the largest percentage of Americans spent money at Walmart, McDonald's, and Target last year. A family shops at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Springdale, Arkansas. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Some 95 percent of U.S. consumers shopped at one of Walmart's 4,700 stores or on its website in 2016, according to NPD. It was followed by McDonald's at 89 percent and Target at 84 percent. That means more than 5 in 6 U.S. shoppers made a purchase at those chains. Among retailers, Dollar Tree recorded the biggest gains from 2015. It opened nearly 600 stores under that name last year. Chick-fil-A, which is also in expansion mode, was the biggest gainer among restaurants. Despite accounting for more than half of the growth in online spending last year, Amazon barely squeaked into the top 20. Some 42 percent of consumers spent money on Amazon, according to NPD. Amazon tends to attract a higher-income shopper than Walmart, though the expansion of its subscription Prime program to a broader swath of the population has lowered its shoppers' average income. Walmart's place at the top of the list shouldn't come as much of a surprise, given its U.S. division rang up an industry-leading $307.8 billion in revenue last year. NPD's data, collected in collaboration with Slice Intelligence, was pulled from the receipts of more than 4 million shoppers.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Grocery stores could be making headway in their ongoing battle for food market share against Walmart and Costco in Canada, according to a new industry report. Although the two retail giants registered growth in Canada through most of 2016, their rate of growth in food sales slowed considerably from prior years, according to Kevin Grier Market Analysis and Consulting. Grier notes general merchants in Canada, mostly Walmart and Costco, saw year-over-year gains in food sales of about one per cent more than the food stores did in the third quarter of last year compared with the third quarter of 2015. But “that one per cent differential compares to a 9 per cent differential in favour of the general merchandise channel over the five years from 2011 to 2015,” Grier notes, citing StatsCan data, and “each quarterly loss in share is worth billions of dollars.” Related What's ahead for Whole Foods Market Inc now that activist Jana Partners is involved? From mouldy strawberries to poorly trained employees: Amazon still stumped by 'treacherous' $800-billion grocery market Food stores’ share of food sales appears to have stabilized at 79 per cent of the market. That compares with an 84 per cent share just five years ago, Grier said. “If the grocers could have kept their share at 84 per cent, which it was in 2015, their food sales would have been about a billion dollars more each quarter.” The loss in grocery retailers’ share of food to the general merchandise channel has been slow and steady. “You have still got erosion, but the rate of deterioration seems to be slowing. It’s still very good for Costco and Walmart, but on the other side we are seeing more competitive pricing, fundamentally, from grocery.” The news comes as Canada’s veteran grocery companies have tried to step up their food game in order to compete with Walmart and Costco, both known for cavernous stores and value pricing of food and other merchandise. Loblaw has been upgrading its stores and adding fine breads and cheeses while expanding its in-store home meal replacement offerings, as has grocer Metro Inc., whose purchase of the Quebec-based specialty baker Première Moisson introduced premium baked goods and charcuterie to its stores. Industry analysts have also noted much more intense pricing battles over the last year among the grocers in Western Canada, where consumers have been hit by the oil industry downturn, making the food business more competitive. Last month, Costco reported that same-store sales in Canada outpaced growth in all of the warehouse retailer’s other divisions in the warehouse retailer’s second quarter, rising eight per cent, compared with growth of three per cent in the U.S. At Walmart Canada, same-store sales rose 0.2 per cent in the quarter ended Jan. 31. The competition is not expected to let up any time soon. Analysts note the primary square footage growth in the grocery market this year 2017 will be at Costco Canada, which is opening open seven stores this year. Meanwhile, the general merchandise channel has been growing at a fearsome clip. Costco’s share of grocery food sales in 2016 was estimated at 10 per cent and Walmart’s at 7 per cent, according to CIBC, up from 7 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, in 2010. Food sales have been critical to Costco Canada’s success, and will continue to be as the company starts competing in earnest with industrial food, restaurant and office suppliers. The company opened its first business centre in Canada last month in order to better target owners of small businesses like restaurants and corner stores. “At one time, we served (business customers) better than we serve them now,” Brien told the Financial Post in a recent interview, adding the warehouse retailer had increasingly incorporated products that cater to families rather than businesses as its business model evolved in Canada.

The professor is Gilbert Kalonde, reports Bozeman CBS affiliate KBZK. Kalonde’s troubles began back in April 2015 when he purchased the license, according to court documents. He provided an employee at the Walmart in Bozeman with an identification card specifying his occupation as “Faculty/Professional” at Montana State, he says. The Walmart employee then typed “CLEAN TOILETS” in the space on Kalonde’s fishing license application for his occupation. The Walmart employee did not give Kalonde an opportunity to review the application, court documents say. When Kalonde renewed his fishing license in 2016, the lawsuit says, he told a Walmart employee that he is a Montana State professor. No one asked him to review his information or told him about the error on his license. Then, in February 2016, Kalonde’s teaching assistant happened to be looking at Kalonde’s fishing license and noticed that it said his job is “CLEAN TOILETS.” Kalonde was shocked and shamed, the lawsuit says. He claims he suffered emotional distress because, in his native country of Zambia, “the people that do this work are the lowest social class, and are shunned and avoided by society.” He immediately returned to the Bozeman Walmart and demanded a new, corrected fishing license and a written apology. He received the new license, according to the lawsuit, but not the written apology. The Montana branch of the American Civil Liberties Union is representing Kalonde in his lawsuit. The lawsuit claims a single count of libel. Kalonde teaches undergraduate courses in workforce education and development at Montana State University. He has a Ph.D. from Southern Illinois University Carbondale. He also has over two decades of experience teaching in high schools, and in human resources management. Walmart’s corporate office offered a limited statement about the lawsuit. “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing,” Walmart media relations director Ragan Dickens told KBZK-TV. “We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” Follow Eric on Twitter. Like Eric on Facebook.

(AP) – A Montana State University professor is suing Wal-Mart for libel after he says an employee at the Bozeman store listed his occupation on a fishing license as a “toilet cleaner.” Gilbert Kalonde, assistant professor of technology education at MSU, filed the suit this past week in Gallatin County District Court. Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages. Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens told The Associated Press: “To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing. We’ve not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Wal-Mart employee identification of his employment at MSU. But the Wal-Mart employee entered “clean toilets” into the state database as Kalonde’s occupation. The suit contends Wal-Mart exposed Kalonde to “hatred, contempt, ridicule” through the incident.

It’s a time for employers to let their employees spend time with their friends and family. Easter’s a holiday, meaning most people aren’t interested in shopping. However, Walmart will still be open on Sunday April 16 despite the Christian holiday. Most stores will be open from 6 a.m. to midnight. However, their 24 hour stores will have their usual hours. So if you need to go out and grab some things on Easter, Walmart’s a great place to go. They’ll have whatever you need at a very affordable price. Forgot to make the ham? Go to your local store, they’ll have one. They’ll also have a lot of necessities, including toiletries, cleaning supplies and candy for the kids (and adults). The national chain also offers a ton of videos and electronics. It’s sort of an Easter tradition to watch specials based on the holiday. Walmart will have most of them in stock. You can order them online as well, ensuring you can pick them up at the store. This saves you time, giving you more time to spend with your family. Must Read: Each State's Sports Mount Rushmore They also have baskets and other decorations. Most stores will have their regular hours on Good Friday and the day before Easter as well. Their locations will also have things like clothes, jewelry, toys and just about anything you can think of that you might need. Walmart remains one of the most convenient stores in the world because they’re almost always open. They offer very cheap prices for decent quality products. Whatever you need for the holidays, Walmart’s a great place to go. They always manage to have just what you need at just the right price.

On Easter Sunday, businesses and restaurants tend to let their employees spend time with their friends and family. Easter’s a holiday, meaning most people aren’t interested in shopping or eating out, with few exceptions. This includes a lot of stores, except for those offering Easter specials. McDonald’s and most other fast food places will be open on Sunday. Sam’s Club will not be open on Easter. However, their parent store Walmart will be open. So while you won’t be able to buy anything in bulk for Easter, Walmart should have you covered for anything you need. This comes as bad news to some people. Around the holidays, you always seem to forget to cook or bring something. Luckily, Walmart will be open, so if you need something last-minute, go there instead. However, they likely won’t have anything in bulk. Sam’s Club is one of the largest wholesale chains in North America. They tend to treat their employees rather well. Their stores aren’t open as much as other stores, especially not on holidays. But if you go there during business hours, you can usually find some excellent deals. If you need just about anything in bulk, whether it’s food, groceries or diapers, they have you covered. Must Read: Each State's Sports Mount Rushmore Unlike Walmart, they’re very easy to navigate and the lines are usually much shorter. While they’re not open for Easter, they’re definitely worth checking out. The bulk wholesale outlet will have normal business hours throughout the weekend, including Good Friday. So make sure you have everything you need for the holiday and hit them up if you don’t. Their stores will resume their normal business hours on Monday April 17, the day after Easter.

The move is a direct challenge to Amazon. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Print Email Tribune News Service By Tribune News Service The Oregonian on April 16, 2017 at 5:00 AM comments When you're the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in a world filled with more and more cyber-buyers, how do you defend your territory? By leveraging what could be your biggest liability — your stores. In the week ahead, that's how Wal-Mart will respond to its quick-growing competitor Amazon. What had been a destructive price battle has turned into an all-out war for the hearts and wallets of consumers. The two retail behemoths represent the clash of shopping cultures — pursuing aisles versus surfing websites — and the business models built to support them. Amazon's approach involves stuffing inventory into strategically placed warehouses to avoid the cost of actual stores and using its volume to drive deals with shippers to get merchandise the last mile to consumers' doors. Wal-Mart making belated but aggressive online push Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is saddled with the infrastructure of a different age of retailing — a network of thousands of stores, their miles of aisles and more than 100,000 products in each location. Wal-Mart is discovering, though, that the network might actually be more of an asset than an issue. Beginning this week, Wal-Mart will offer deep price discounts on 10,000 items shoppers are able to buy online and pick up in stores. It's using its size to undercut Amazon on price and hoping to use its well-spread stores as a means of reaching customers. Wal-Mart will expand the offering to 1 million items by June. If successful, who knows: Wal-Mart stores may eventually be equal parts warehouse and retail experience. Whatever happens, Wal-Mart shareholders can only hope the moves result in an Amazon-like stock performance. Amazon shares have gained four times more value than Wal-Mart shares over the past year. Wal-Mart still sells more than $1 billion worth of stuff per day. That's about four times as much revenue as Amazon. But all of Amazon's sales are online, while only $14 billion worth of Wal-Mart's are. But as more buying moves online, Wal-Mart has been searching for strategies to entice its price-sensitive buyers to think of it — not Amazon — as the place to find deals in cyberspace. -- Tribune News Service Video of the Day Nominate your company for a Top Workplaces award Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

An 18-year-old employee was assaulted by two customers who yelled obscenities at her before pulling her to the ground by her ponytail, in what could be described as "an extremely Walmarty attack." This news comes as little surprise to anyone who has patronized the Steelyard location and experienced the magic firsthand. But for the sake of the uninitiated who might not understand what all the fuss is about, I'd like to help. I thought it might be illustrative to recount all the in-store PA announcements I heard during a recent visit. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! If anyone is associated with the large, bearded, heavily tattooed man who is passed out drunk on top of the cantaloupes in the produce section, please come and collect him. And bring his pants. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! If you're having trouble locating a particular item, your best bet is to comb through the pile of merchandise heaped on the floor near where the item was supposed to be. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! Both the men's and women's restrooms are currently out of order for reasons that are too disturbing to announce publicly. If you have to use the bathroom, please cross the parking lot and use the ones at Chipotle, but don't tell them we sent you. Thank you. Illustration by Ted Crow, The Plain Dealer  Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! The automotive department is currently closed due to a persistent tire fire that was started by a disgruntled employee two weeks ago. We apologize for the inconvenience. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! Just a reminder that if any of you are health inspectors, legally you have to inform us that you are here. We know our rights. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! We would like to apologize to all those who were offended by the movie that was simulcast to all of the TVs in the electronics department all day. "Human Centipede 2" is not a Walmart-sanctioned selection. Illustration by Ted Crow, The Plain Dealer  Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! The illegal marijuana grow house that was operating out of our lawn & garden department has been discovered and dismantled by the police department. We apologize for the inconvenience. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! For those of you who clearly missed the earlier announcement, we are asking that customers in need of a restroom GO TO A NEIGHBORING STORE! The toilets in our home and bath section are for DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY! Also, will a member of the cleaning staff please report to the home and bath section? Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! We regret to report that all of our motorized scooter carts were taken by a teen street gang last night. They were last seen heading north toward the highway. We apologize for the inconvenience. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! We are asking that customers PLEASE refrain from cooking shoplifted hot dogs over the tire fire in the automotive department. There are just too many things wrong with this. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! The small pack of feral dogs that was until recently occupying the pet food department has apparently migrated to the breakfast meat section in the grocery area. So if you really need bacon, proceed with caution as they are very aggressive and territorial. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! Yet another of our customer service desk employees has been committed to a local mental health facility to be treated for PTSD. For the time being, we have replaced him with a mannequin wearing a blue polo shirt that you are all welcome to yell expletives at. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! We have so many random lost children who were separated from their negligent parents up at the front of the store right now that I'm not even going to try to say all their names. Everybody just come up here and get your damn kids. Attention Steelyard Walmart shoppers! Daryl from sporting goods accidentally left the hunting knife display case unlocked when he went outside for a smoke, and the results were predictable. Buck knife fights are now raging all over the store. And as you can hear by that pounding on my door, the manager's office is about to be breached by looters. This will likely be my last broadcast. I have many regrets. Also, we have 8-packs of Brawny paper towels on sale right now for just $10.99. So stock up, because summer barbecue season is closer than you think.

Prices rise again slightly despite the influx of new inventory. The reseller prices for the NES Classic exploded on the news that Nintendo is stopping production.

How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Nintendo announced that more Nintendo Switch consoles are on the way. A recent report out of Japan tries explains why Nintendo struggles to produce enough Switch consoles to satisfy the demand. Find a Switch on Amazon Prime Now The quickest way to find and buy a Nintendo Switch is through Amazon Prime Now. If you live in an Amazon Prime Now area, watching availability each day is the way to go. To use Amazon Prime Now, you need a Prime membership (free 30-day trial available).

These offers are a scam. Nobody is selling a Switch under the list price of $299.99. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch Amazon scam for details. How to Buy the Nintendo Switch Online The experience of shoppers trying to grab a Nintendo Switch online is harder than scoring a doorbuster deal on Black Friday. The high demand brings in scalpers and their shopping bots. As soon as a store puts a Switch on sale online, these bots swoop in and automatically purchase the console. Regular consumers have a very hard time to beat bots and shopping scripts. The first task is to find out when a store has the Switch in stock online. To track online inventory and get alerts, shoppers can use zoolert and NowInStock and iStockNow. Below is the list of shops that offer the Nintendo Switch online in case they have inventory. Amazon Walmart Best Buy  GameStop  Target  ToysRUs Other stores have also listed the Switch including: Dell NewEgg Fry's BHPPhotoVideo Jet.com  Shopko Kohls and Nintendo's own store. Another route to buy a Nintendo Switch leads abroad. Buying a Switch on Amazon in Spain has worked in the past. Some people also used Amazon in Japan to order a Switch. The additional shipping costs and custom fees add up, but the final cost is still lower than buying on the reseller market. The Switch is though also as hard to find in Europe and Japan.   Ordering abroad has some disadvantages. In case the console is damaged, returning it is more hassle. The packed power adapter is not compatible. You have to get either the official US Switch power adapter or a USB power adapter. How to find the Nintendo Switch in Stores Finding a Nintendo Switch in stores requires some time. The available tracking tools are not that accurate. You need to watch the inventory of your local stores over time to learn to spot when a store just got new Switch inventory. Best is to combine the tracking data from iStockNow and BrickSeek. Some stores like Walmart and Target also show if a product is in stock at a select local store online on their sites. If all three report stock than the chances are very high that the Switch is indeed in stock. Now you just need to be first in the door. The iStockNow live map provides the details where the Switch is in stock. Through filters, you can setup notifications for your local stores. BrickSeek offers inventory checkers for Walmart and other stores. Walmart Stores Enter your zip code and select the Walmart store near you on this walmart.com page.  The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822. To check if a Walmart store near you has the Switch in stock you can also use this BrickSeek page. To check for the more rare Switch with neon Joy-con visit this link. The iStockNow live map provides the details where the Switch is in stock for Walmart stores.  Target Stores  While there are three methods to check for Switch inventory, it is more difficult for Target. BrickSeek does not work for checking for Switch stock at Target stores for some reason. Searching with DCPI 207-29-1001 results in: "Sorry, this item is not available to search at this time." Target shows store inventory also online on target.com for the Nintendo Switch. The Target DPCI for the Nintendo Switch console with neon blue and neon red Joy-Con is 207-29-1001. The DPCI for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 207-29-1000. The search for the Switch at Target on BrickSeek is not returning results yet. Target.com also shows the stock levels of the Alternatively shoppers can use iStockNow to find Target stores with Switch in stock.  Nintendo Flagship Store in New York The Nintendo flagship store has published a schedule of upcoming Switch sales. The next series of Switch sales begin on Easter Monday, April 17 at 10am. The store will sell the Switch each day next week. On Tuesday the sale begins at 3pm, Wednesday at 10am, Thursday at 3pm and on Friday at 10am.  Best Buy You can use iStockNow to find Best Buy stores with Switch in stock.  GameStop The iStockNow service also works for GameStop store locations. A pro tip for iStockNow is to look for inventory changes of your local stores you track. Only if there is a fresh change, the likelihood that the information is correct is high. Another tip is to compare iStockNow and BrickSeek results. The new Nintendo Switch launched on March 3 and as expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. Nintendo announced to have sold over 900,000 Switch consoles in March. The Switch is the fastest selling console in Nintendo's history. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

Source: Shutterstock The newly-announced Wal-Mart layoffs 2017 will have the retail company cutting hundreds of jobs. These jobs being cut in the layoffs will reportedly take place in the retailer’s international, tech and Sam’s Club divisions. Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s spokesman, told CNBC that the job cuts are an expansion of its previous Wal-Mart layoffs 2017 from earlier this year. The tech company is looking to cut jobs and invest in its e-commerce platform to better compete with online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). “We will continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and effectively, true to our cost-conscious heritage,” Walmart told Fox Business Network. “In order to achieve this, from time to time you’ll see the company eliminate positions in an effort to stay lean and fast.” Wal-Mart layoffs 2017 continue to add to the large number of jobs cuts that the company has been announcing since early last year. The company has cut about 18,000 jobs since then. However, Hargrove said many of these employees were shifted to new positions within the company. Hargrove also says that the company is planning to hire an additional 10,000 employees. These employees will be hired by the company to operate new stores that it is planning to open. This news comes despite plans from the retailer to slow down its openings of additional physical locations, CNBC notes. WMT stock was largely unaffected by the Wal-Mart layoffs 2017 new as of Wednesday morning.

As we left the store, I looked over the parking lot in hopes of catching the nice woman to say thanks. I did not see her; I hope she will read this and accept my thank you. I was so impressed with her generosity when I got home I decided to pay her act of kindness forward, so I made an online donation to Chattanooga Food Bank. My wife said, "there are still some really nice people in this world." Amen. Robert A. Reno Ooltewah Property taxes threaten owners I live in North Chattanooga, and my property appraisal from the last eight years went from $82,300 to $182,700. I can understand raising my property tax, but why by more than 117 percent in eight years? I went to appeal the assessment, but they said the estimate stands. If I wanted to appeal further I could, but I would have had to jump through hoops and hire a lawyer to understand the form. In my opinion, the property assessor doesn't give a darn about older homeowners and their fixed incomes. He told me my home was a tear-down house and my lot was worth more than the house. It's not about the money. I'm more concerned about my neighbors and if they will be able to keep paying these ridiculous amounts for property tax and keep their houses. I know a lady who had to move and another lady who had to turn everything over to her son because she couldn't afford the property tax. Shame on you, property assessors! Katie Donohoe Hickory Valley Road needs 'redo' This letter is to add support to the writers who recently have complained about the terrible condition of Hickory Valley Road between Shallowford Road and Lee Highway. Attempts to patch it have only made it worse and more dangerous as drivers move from side to side trying to find a level surface on which to drive. Hopefully, a complete redo is in the budget. William "Bill" Courter Eastgate doesn't lack for energy A rant in last Sunday's paper suggested the county move two of its aging schools into the "underused" Eastgate Town Center. Actually, Eastgate is a pretty busy place these days. There is already one public school, as well as the active city Senior Center. The state has a number of offices there. Businesses range from Office Depot to a Tuesday Morning to an international food market. Quite a few people enjoy walking in the mall, which has a beautiful waterfall fountain. And the updated Eastgate food court has several locally owned cafes with fresh-made food and ethnic specialties. It's a fun place to stop by during the week. Allen Chesney Morris Mini Minor was no minor to us A recent letter to the editor writer asks if anyone remembers the Morris Mini Minor. The Morris Minor was our first car when my husband was stationed in Germany as a first lieutenant. The Morris Mini Minor was an adorable, aqua-colored convertible. We have so many wonderful memories driving around Germany in that little car. We especially remember driving through the Alps in Bavaria with the top down and enjoying the scenery of the snow-capped mountains and the beautiful area around that region. We reluctantly sold the car to another fortunate soldier when we came back to the states Patti Gross Elder Mountain State leading way on teacher prep In response to Kendi Rainwater's recent story, "Tennessee urges school districts to be involved in teacher prep, releases report": As the Times Free Press reported, Tennessee is establishing itself as a national leader in teacher preparation by taking steps to improve the quality of the programs preparing the next generation of teachers — and it is an anomaly. NCTQ research has found too many teacher prep programs nationwide do an inadequate job of tasks such as providing sufficient opportunities for aspiring teachers to practice teaching with feedback, choosing cooperating teachers for student teaching, raising admission standards and teaching elementary content. We hope this project extends to the actual content offered by these programs, as too many ignore scientific research on how to teach reading and math. Since there's little evidence showing professional development has much effect on teachers' instruction, it's better to ensure future teachers learn what they need before they take charge of their own classroom. We are pleased to see Tennessee building partnerships between districts and education schools to prepare more effective teachers and using data to guide improvement — and hope the rest of the country is paying close attention. Kate Walsh, President, National Council on Teacher Quality Mr. Mayor, tear down those statues What fake news? Suggesting that a proposed removal of a statue, along with re-naming Lee Circle in New Orleans, is a distortion of history is more than a bumbling slight-of-hand, it is a ridiculous conflation. Full disclosure; I'm a northerner now happily living in the South. To be clear, I am an American veteran proud of our heritage but also acutely aware that our history is far from blemish-free. The Civil War or as they like to language it here, the War of Northern Aggression, was not a noble moment. Insisting it was raises ignorance to the level of virtue. Notwithstanding the sacrifice and gallantry that existed, at its core the rebellion was a blatant, self-serving attempt to preserve and continue the economic engine of slavery, the most heinous of human indignities. No, we cannot change history, but by erecting statues celebrating and venerating that misguided effort flies in the face that we truly understand our past or have learned anything from it. Denny Pistoll Rising Fawn, Ga. Newark route less stressful My family's vacation of choice is a trip to New York City. We have tried everything to get there quickly, efficiently and at minimum cost. We have driven to and taken flights from Atlanta and Nashville. We even have taken Amtrak from Atlanta to Penn Station. Planes, trains and automobiles — we have done it all. This spring break, we decided to give the new Chattanooga-to-Newark route a try because I could not fight the traffic and lines of the Atlanta airport anymore. This route is easy and the best option for Chattanoogans. We left around 6:15 a.m. and arrived in Newark by 8:30. We jumped on the New Jersey rail for about $12 a person and pulled into the heart of Manhattan less than one hour after arriving. The flight was great, and the entire trip was much less stressful. The route is a little more expensive than a direct flight from Atlanta, but if you figure your parking or other transportation expenses and your sanity, then it's the perfect choice. I hope other local travelers will choose this route for visiting NYC. It's continuing proof Chattanooga is a great place to live. Meg White One missile strike! But all the rest? I had coffee with a close conservative friend the other day. He was jubilant, virtually on a roll, praising ad infinitum our president for the recent missile strike on Syria. He went on and on almost in one breath: Syria, ISIS, North Korea, Iran. Then my friend asked me what I thought was the biggest threat to America. "The Electoral College," I said. He just stared at me. Mike C.

Gilbert Kalonde, assistant professor of technology education at MSU, filed the suit this past week in Gallatin County District Court. Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages. According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Walmart employee identification of his employment at MSU.  But the employee entered 'clean toilets' into the state database as Kalonde's occupation. When it came time for Kalonde to renew his fishing license at Walmart he said he told the employee that he worked for MSU, but 'clean toilets' was left as Kalonde's occupation on his license.

Share this article Share The license stated his job was a 'toilet cleaner' but the error wasn't noticed until he showed it to colleagues at the university where he worked more than a year after renewing at Wal-Mart Kalonde has since had his license corrected but has not yet received a written apology It wasn't until a lunch break at the university when he showed his teaching assistant his license that he became aware of the error. The assistant jokingly asked Kalonde's  if he had changed jobs. Kalonde says he was 'very shocked and embarrassed' by the incident.  'In Kalonde's home country of Zambia, the people that do this work are the lowest social class, and are shunned and avoided by society,' the suit said Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens told The Associated Press: 'To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing.  'We've not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.' The suit contends Wal-Mart exposed Kalonde to 'hatred, contempt, ridicule' through the incident. Two days after getting his license renewed, Kalonde returned to Walmart and asked for it to be corrected along with a written apology, although one was never provided.

Amazon got permission to do so via e-commerce and has applied to the government to invest $500 million in a wholly owned venture to sell food items online. Now US based retail giant, Walmart, is planning to open 50 brick and mortar stores, half of them in UP and Uttarakhand. Walmart already has 21 stores under the umbrella of Best Price Stores — a wholesale chain. It had bought 50 percent share in the Bharati enterprise in the Cash and Carry venture after the joint venture ended in 2013 (100 percent FDI in Cash and Carry ventures which sell in bulk to members only, which was allowed from 2003). The government’s condition to open up the food retail sector in brick and mortar stores has been that sourcing of all products should be from India. However, this has not bothered Walmart because, according to its CEO, it does not carry many imported items due to high custom duties. In the past, the BJP government had opposed the opening up of the multi-brand retail while the UPA government was trying to push ahead with it and had allowed up to 51 percent FDI in 2011. There were political reasons for this opposition. Small traders in corner shops and mom and pop stores constitute important voters for the BJP. There are around 50 million such traders while the food retail business is worth $70 billion. Naturally, getting a slice of this lucrative market is the dream of multinational giant retailers like Walmart and Tesco. But the government, though it has opened up multi-brand retail in food items, has not yet allowed other items to be sold in such stores.  One option is to allow food retailers to generate 20 to 25 percent of their sales from non-food items like kitchen use products or basic household requirements like toothpaste. Walmart is pushing for this because the margins in food retail are very thin. Whether the government will allow 100 percent FDI in multi-brand retail in the future is a much awaited policy move and if it does, it will be welcomed by Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Those for it would say that it would create jobs, bring efficiency in storage and inventory management, encourage food processing and bring food from farmer to fork without the chain of middlemen. Lastly, the biggest advantage would be the inflow of a huge amount of FDI that India needs. If Walmart stores do open only food retail shops, they will offer competition to the domestic retail giants like Reliance Fresh, Big Bazaar, Spencer’s, etc. The consumer may benefit if this may bring about competitive pricing and cleaner and properly labelled food items with nutritional information. Walmart may also bring professionalism in management and control of inventories. It may sign contracts with farmers to sell directly to the stores and this would give a better deal to farmers. It would eliminate a long chain of middlemen, but let us not forget that Walmart is also a middleman because it too is an intermediary between the farmers and consumers. While it is true that global supermarkets may purchase directly from farmers and would send produce to their stores in air-conditioned trucks thereby reducing wastage of fruits and vegetables, excessive amount of refrigeration and the extensive use of Styrofoam/plastics for packaging are bad for the environment and will add to our solid waste problem. The consumers may however benefit from food products that have been sorted out, washed and sliced or chopped which will help the average working woman, short of time to cook a meal. But these things are already being done in many up-market Indian supermarkets in big cities. Hence, Walmart has nothing new to offer except perhaps a cleaner ambience. Many have argued that there will be additional jobs in these global supermarkets, especially for women at the cash counters. Others are likely to find jobs in moving, labelling and sorting out goods. But Walmart’s track record is of creating less jobs and using more automation/technology. They will also employ educated smart young people and not the average unskilled job seeker. They may go for capital intensive processing and not employ more labour for their backend operations. On the whole, they will retain an air of exclusivity which may be welcomed by the upper middle classes. Their exclusiveness would mean that the Kirana stores and corner shops may still be around for those wanting to buy one or two items with petty cash and not a cart full of goods with a credit card. Kishore Biyani, the biggest retailer in India, has been thinking ahead and is planning 10,000 stores over four years that will be a hybrid between Kirana stores, e-commerce and large supermarkets. According to him, he will offer unbeatable prices and bank on the loyalty of customers. This will make the global giants’ task more difficult as they are counting on uniform tastes and culture across India. Yet, it must be remembered that global supermarkets have deep pockets and are able to offer big discounts and have staying power that would eliminate others, big and small. They can suffer losses for a number of years in order to capture the market later. For global retail giants, it would be ideal if they are allowed to sell other items also, like in China.  Walmart is very popular in China because one can buy clothing, footwear, groceries, household items, wines and spirits — almost everything under one roof.  But China has nothing much to fear because most goods are Made in China. In India, with people still having great fascination for imported items sourced from other countries, things could be very different. For complete opening up of the multi-brand retail sector, the same condition of selling “Made in India” products may apply and if the global companies agree, there would be a big opportunity for Indian products to be sold in such giant retail outfits and this could give a boost to the languishing manufacturing industry. It is heartening to note that Indian multi-brand retail business is flourishing and will give the global retailers a tough competition and the consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries. ← US Navy Bans Vaping On Ships, Subs, Aircraft Iran: More Than 1,600 File To Run For President → Observer Research Foundation ORF was established on 5 September 1990 as a private, not for profit, ’think tank’ to influence public policy formulation.

Are high PE stocks duds? Do they generally fall out of favour quickly and should investors avoid them just because of stratospheric multiples. Conventional wisdom would suggest yes. But a closer look at the history of high PE stocks shows investors have nothing to fear just because a stock is trading at high multiples. Shares of good companies have always traded expensive but still managed to make money for their investors in the long run. Several investors are comparing D-Mart with Wal-Mart, given D-Mart's similar business model and management DNA. But what many forget is that Wal-mart shares were very expensive in the early 1980s. In 1983, for instance, it traded at a PE of 45 times high for a retail stock. But what is important from the investor perspective is that it gave 20% compounded returns for the two decades. Titan, India's largest listed jewellery company, started off with extremely high multiples in the first decade of the 21st century. Average multiples in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 57, 51 and 53 times respectively. In 2007, the stock traded at 80 times. But look at the returns and you will be stunned. Since 2007, the stock has returned 700% or 23.2% annually . Another example is Nestle India.In 2010, Nestle's shares traded at an average PE of 45. In the next five years, the stock more than doubled giving an annual return of 17%. Avenue Supermarts stellar rally its high valuations has made many believe that the stock has reached its peak and may not generate good returns for investors from this level. But if one has to disregard the near-term volatility and take a longer-term bet, the stock can make good money for its investors despite appearing expensive. PE multiples sometimes can sometimes be misleading. Eicher Motors, despite trading at more than 50 PE in 2013, has generated 33% annual returns in the last four years, outperforming other two wheeler companies, such as Hero Honda and Bajaj Auto. Both the marquee firms traded at below 20 times that year. Maruti Suzuki is another example. In 2015, its average PE multiple was 33 and that of Tata Motors was 9. From that period till now, Maruti has gained 50%, while Tata Motors investors are still in the red. The common thing amongst all these expensively traded companies that generated wealth for investors is high earnings visibility for the next several years. In case of Avenue Supermarts, earnings growth rate for the past years has been 55%. Even if the company delivers a 35% compounded growth for the next three years, it will trade at 35 times FY20 estimated earnings. A multiple of 50-55 would mean that the stock can give a return of 50% from here in the next three years and an optimistic 70 times multiple would mean the stock can double from here. 5 stocks on which tech charts have buy signals of 11 Next Prev Play Slideshow 5 stocks that look favourably poised for buying calls 16 Apr, 2017Text: Milan Vaishnav, CMT The domestic equity market is heading for a rather uneventful week, with global geopolitical tensions hanging over its head.

The suit contends Wal-Mart exposed the plaintiff to "hatred, contempt, ridicule" through the incident. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (Jeff Chiu) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on April 16, 2017 at 5:50 PM comments BOZEMAN, Mont. -- A Montana State University professor is suing Wal-Mart for libel after he says an employee at the Bozeman store listed his occupation on a fishing license as a "toilet cleaner." Gilbert Kalonde, assistant professor of technology education, filed the suit this past week in Gallatin County District Court. Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages. Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens told The Associated Press: "To our knowledge an administrative process to resolve this with Dr. Kalonde is ongoing. We've not been served with the lawsuit, but we take the claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court." According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Wal-Mart employee identification of his employment at MSU. But the Wal-Mart employee entered "clean toilets" into the state database as Kalonde's occupation. The suit contends Wal-Mart exposed Kalonde to "hatred, contempt, ridicule" through the incident.

According to the U.S. Marshals Office, Christolis Bankhead, 24, was arrested just before 4 p.m. after he was observed outside the Walmart store, 919 Highway 1 West. He was taken into custody without incident and is awaiting extradition back to Mississippi. Authorities said Bankhead was wanted by the Clinton Police Department in Mississippi for an alleged carjacking on April 2. Bankhead is accused of holding a Mississippi college student at gunpoint in a campus parking garage. He was identified via security camera footage and the public’s assistance, according to the marshals. By the time a warrant for his arrest was obtained on April 4, police learned Bankhead had fled the state. Mississippi authorities contacted the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force to help track him down. On April 6, officers with the Moline Police Department in Illinois reported finding a white 2015 Kia Optima, the vehicle Bankhead allegedly took in Mississippi. Bankhead was not found with the vehicle, authorities said. On Wednesday, marshals with the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force learned Bankhead was staying near the University of Iowa campus. The Gulf Coast task force contacted their counterparts with both the southern and northern Iowa fugitive task forces. Those marshals, along with Iowa City police officers, searched the area and eventually located Bankhead. l Comments: (319) 398-8238; lee.hermiston@thegazette.com Like what you're reading?

(GuruFocus) Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) announced on Wednesday a new strategy it believes will win over customers from rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN): pay consumers to visit stores. Sort of. According to a CNBC report, Wal-Mart will give customers a discount for ordering an item online and having it shipped to a store. By the summer months, more than 1 million items will be available at a discounted price under the assumption the consumer would shop around for other items once they are already in a store. While this sounds like an attractive proposition for consumers, Gadfly's Shelly Banjo isn't convinced. She believes that Wal-Mart's plan doesn't align with how consumers think these days. Specifically, Amazon has "trained shoppers to be so lazy," and it is just unclear if consumers want to head out their front door and visit Wal-Mart to save a buck or two. Granted, Amazon is more often than not a price leader; the fact remains the platform is desirable because of the ease of ordering, shipping, and delivery options. Wal-Mart Is Out Of Touch Banjo continued that Wal-Mart's plan is, in essence, a textbook business plan that was likely communicated to a bunch of "yes-men" in a Power Point presentation. Granted, many of Wal-Mart's shoppers, especially low-income ones, will love the idea of saving money. However, if Wal-Mart wants to take a bite of Amazon's pie, it needs to better target wealthier shoppers. While there is little downside to Wal-Mart's new discount program, there is some upside by getting a better understanding of what consumers want. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart's new plan doesn't necessarily make life easier for shoppers if they have to run out to a store. Wal-Mart needs to "worry more about making things easier for people," and if it doesn't, then any advantage it is building online "will have a short shelf life."

By Dennis Seid Daily Journal SALTILLO – Kenneth Estes never thought his career would turn out the way it did. As a paint contractor, renovating and remodeling homes were jobs he was part of. But now his work centers around it. As a testament to his work, Estes was named the “Builder of the Year” for 2016 by the Home Builders Association of Mississippi. While appreciative, Estes downplays the significance of the award. “Names get submitted from local associations and then voted on by the board of the of the state Home Builders Association, so I guess somebody liked me,” he said with a laugh. But he’s gotten high marks over the years with his business, Estes Building and Remodeling, which he founded in May 1994 along with his wife, Norma Jean. He’s been deeply involved in the building industry, having served as president of Home Builders & Remodelers Association of Northeast Mississippi in 2006, 2007 and again since 2013. But it wasn’t the path he originally took when he started his business. “It was all God,” he said. “My wife had been working at Wal-Mart and quit, and I told her we don’t need the money and she could stay at home. But she didn’t like staying at home.” A neighbor asked them if they would hang some wallpaper for them, but they really didn’t want to. “Well, the neighbor told my wife how much money we could have made in this amount of time, and she said, ‘that’s more than I would have made in a week at Wal-Mart,’ so we started painting and hanging wallpaper in 1994 and it’s just grown from there.” Estes got his residential license in 2002 and his commercial license in 2011, and his work has taken him beyond his primary market of Northeast Mississippi. He’s also worked on condominiums in Destin, Florida, and along the Gulf Coast, working on projects large and small. He said he never thought his business would grow the way it has. “I was getting fully set up as a paint contractor, but I had some people who were retiring that pushed their wallpaper work to me, and then people were recommending me for painting,” he said. “It seemed like every job I got to, people were wondering if I knew somebody who could do this, or somebody who could work on this project. “I’ve always said I’d tackle anything, and God’s always blessed me to be able to pick things up and do it. We started out just painting and wallpapering, and now we do everything from residential to commercial remodels and addition.” Adam Robison | Buy at photos.djournal.com Kenneth Estes, right, talks with Jeff Foster, one of his employees, as they work out a plan for a deck under construction on a house they are remodeling. Estes did do some custom-home building in the past, but decided to leave that work to others in 2008 in the midst of the Great Recession. The housing industry took a big hit, and that kind of work all but dried up for a time. But remodeling work picked up as consumers still sought to update their homes while spending less money. Estes was in the right place at the right time. “A lot of people don’t like to remodel and prefer the new construction side, but I like this kind of work,” he said. “You can take something that somebody’s tired of and you can renovate it and make it new and turn it into what the homeowners wants. You can them a whole new aspect of their existing home.” A lake house in Saltillo Estes was working on last week is a prime example of his work. The flooring, cabinets and countertops are new, and a new deck in the back with a picturesque view of the lake is under construction. “This is a home we just about took to the ground and rebuilt,” Estes said. The housing market as a whole is on an upswing, and Estes says there’s more work available than there are contractors available. “Remodeling and new construction both are on the rise,” he said. “If you’re not busy now and you’re in construction, something’s not right. Everybody I talk to is behind. They’re months out on catching up.” From his perspective, Estes said the boom years of the early to mid-2000s haven’t quite returned, “but we’re right at it, as far as the remodeling side. “People I’ve talked to said things are really picking up. There are just a few issues with getting things to appraise out. But we also have a labor shortage. Whether its employees or sub-contractor, we don’t have as many sub-contractors and trades like we used to. And then the ones we do have, if you’re any good, you’re booked up.” The numbers dwindled during the recession as laborers sought other work to do, and they haven’t returned the levels before the economic downturn. As head of the state association, Estes said there are some areas in the state that have returned to their pre-recession construction levels. “There are hot pockets all across the state – Southaven, Oxford, Starkville, the Jackson area are all going strong,” he said. Estes has three projects underway currently with several more in the works and waiting in the wings. There’s work to be had, and he encourages entry into the construction industry. “Just do it the right way,” he said. “If you want to be contractor, set it up legally, get your contractor’s license and carry your insurance. If you’re a sub-contractor, take your tests, get your licenses where they apply and set up a legitimate business.” Membership privileges The Home Builders Association of Mississippi has some 1,800 members, while the Home Builders & Remodelers Association of Northeast Mississippi has more than 100 members. “Locally, we’re up from 82 members in 2013 to 102 or 103 now,” Estes said. “We’re not where we need to be though. There are still a lot of people in the construction industry who have never been a member, but need to be.” The benefits of membership include the chance to network with other industry players. But more importantly, Estes, said, the state and local associations serve as watchdogs of the construction industry. “You join a local association and it’s like having three memberships in one,” he said. “You also get automatic entry in to the state association as well as the National Association of Home Builders.” The associations also work to make life easier for contractors, Estes said. For example, NAHB has worked to reduce the number of burdensome regulations placed on the industry, some of which are too expensive for smaller businesses to adhere to, Estes said. “We got two OSHA laws postponed, one of which involved record-keeping that was required even down to a one-person operation,” he said. The other rule, postponed for 90 days was a rule reducing the amount of silicate particles in a work place. “Now on a construction site, you pretty much can’t sweep a floor without violating the rule,” he said. In addition, Estes said, “Twenty-five percent of the cost of a new home is tied to government over-regulation. That transfers down to remodels and additions. “Regulations are needed… we just don’t need somebody holding us down.” Estes also said it’s important for consumers to make sure they hire licensed contractors who will guarantee their work. “As a licensed contractor, we’re constantly bidding for the same work with people who don’t have a license and don’t have insurance, so they can charge less,” he said. “I can’t tell you how many times we’ve had to go behind and unlicensed contractor and redo the work, which ends up costing the homeowner even more.” dennis.seid@journalinc.com Twitter: @dennisseid Click here to leave a comment!

Plachko PORT CARBON — A Middleport man charged by Saint Clair police stemming from a theft at Wal-Mart on Terry Rich Boulevard last year had charges against him held for court during a preliminary hearing before Magisterial District Judge David A. Plachko. Shawn M. Tobin, 31, of 83 Washington St., was arrested by Saint Clair police Patrolman Brad Blanner and charged with one misdemeanor count each of retail theft and receiving stolen property. Plachko determined the commonwealth proved a prima facie case and ordered both charges against Tobin held for Schuylkill County Court. Blanner charged Tobin with an incident that occurred between 6:02 and 6:24 p.m. Dec. 26. The officer charged Tobin with entering the store, taking an empty bag from a register and then placing two items inside. Blanner said Tobin then went to the customer service area and completed a fraudulent return, getting a gift card in the amount of $36.19 for the items he did not purchase. Other court cases included: Lauren E. Hughes, 30, of 111 W. Spruce St., Mahanoy City — held for court: retail theft. Zachary R. Moses, 21, of 14 Princess Drive, Zion Grove — held for court: DUI-controlled substance, careless driving, no rear lights and driving a vehicle without a valid inspection. Claude Mcabee Kauffman, 53, of 33 N. Nicholas St., Saint Clair — held for court: DUI and DUI-controlled substance. Archie D. Ciccanti, 36, of 417 Market Square, Apt. D17, Pottsville — dismissed: simple assault and harassment. Robert A. Vandaley, 33, of 723 W. Norwegian St., Pottsville — dismissed: simple assault and harassment. Thomas J. Sullivan, 43, of 319 S. Nicholas St., Saint Clair — waived for court: simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, careless driving and reckless driving. Christina E. Hale FRACKVILLE — A Pottsville man charged with fleeing Pottsville police and then crashing in Frackville on March 21 appeared for a preliminary hearing before Magisterial District Judge Christina E. Hale. Joshua J. Hickey, 23, of 410 E. Market St., Apt. 1, was arrested by Frackville police Patrolman Christopher Hand and charged with aggravated assault, fleeing or attempting to elude police, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, reckless driving, careless driving, driving at an unsafe speed, duties at a stop sign, driving the wrong way, turning movements and required signals, driving without a license, driving on a sidewalk, criminal mischief and institutional vandalism. Prosecutors withdrew the aggravated assault and institutional vandalism charges and Hickey waived the remaining offenses to Schuylkill County Court. Hand said that Hickey fled from Pottsville police who issued an alert. The man’s vehicle was then seen in Frackville and Hand said he tried to conduct a traffic stop but the driver, identified as Hickey, fled at a high rate of speed, committing numerous traffic violations. A short time later, Hickey was taken into custody after he went off the road and fled down and embankment, resisted being placed under arrest but was eventually taken into custody.

Seiler, 51, of 1678 Buckaroo Drive, Auburn — withdrawn: theft by deception. Dana A. Seiler, 42, of 1678 Buckaroo Drive, Auburn — withdrawn: theft by deception.

Now they want fast. As shoppers turn to the convenience of cyberstores, they crave shipping that can keep up with their demands. “For consumers, it’s one of the top things they’re looking for, and it’s a decision maker between buying at one site versus another,” says Aaron Cheris, a partner in the San Francisco office of Bain and Co., a management consulting firm. Free shipping is expected, says Luke Knowles, founder of Free Shipping Day, a one-day, annual online-shopping event in December. On Dec. 16, 2016, more than 1,000 retailers offered free shipping and delivery by Christmas Eve. Retailers have answered the call for free and swift delivery in different ways. Under Amazon’s subscription model, members pay a fee to get free shipping. Wal-Mart and Best Buy provide free and fast shipping if you meet their conditions. Should you still pay for a subscription? It depends. Before you decide, consider how often you order and what you’ll get beyond shipping. Here’s what you should think about.

Wal-Mart announced free two-day shipping on eligible orders of $35 and above on more than 2 million items in categories from food to electronics while eliminating its membership program in early 2017. Best Buy offers free two-day shipping on thousands of items for orders of $35 and up. Apple boasts free two-day shipping on most in-stock products. “The first battle was (over) free,” says Cheris, of Bain and Co. Now, consumers have their eyes set on two-day delivery. “One of the problems with the old, ‘I’ll get it to you in three to five days’ is, well, which is it? Is it three? Is it four? Is it five? The nice thing about two is it’s not only faster, but it’s more specific.” FEATURES Even if free two-day shipping becomes standard, don’t dismiss subscriptions. Consumers should consider other features, Cheris says. For instance, a membership at shopping service ShopRunner unlocks free two-day shipping on eligible items at hundreds of participating retailers. After a 30-day free trial, the fee is $79 a year or $8.95 a month. Amazon Prime is perhaps the best known of all programs. After a 30-day free trial, members pay $99 a year or $10.99 a month to get free two-day shipping on more than 50 million items, plus free same-day and two-hour delivery on household goods, groceries and other items in select cities. Shoppers also get extras such as video and music streaming. “The reason people join is for the free, fast shipping, but the reason they stay is because a lot of them get attached to other stuff, whether it’s Prime Now or Prime Pantry or Prime Instant Video,” Cheris says. See if you can share your membership and split the price. At Amazon, two adults can form an Amazon Household to share select benefits of Prime, like free shipping and photo storage. A membership to online marketplace Google Express can be shared with one person in your household at no additional cost. After a three-month free trial, the program costs $95 a year or $10 a month for free same-day delivery on eligible orders. PRICE When shopping without a membership, ensure that a retailer with free shipping isn’t charging more for its products than what you would save on shipping. For example, a pair of Nike running shoes recently sold for $48.75 at J.C. Penney with $8.95 shipping, for a total of $57.70 before tax. The same item came with free shipping at Zappos for $65. FREQUENCY It’s a matter of what you buy, too, says Mabel McLean, a director of client strategy at L2, a New York-based company that tracks the online performance of brands. If you make frequent online purchases of items such as paper towels and cleaning supplies, shipping charges can add up, so investing in a subscription may be better. “It depends on how frequently you shop the category,” McLean says. “I think paying seven bucks for shipping when you’re buying clothing and maybe only order online five times a year, that’s a little bit more palatable than higher-frequency categories.” MAKE A CHOICE Before you buy a subscription, weigh the cost to ensure that the fee is offset by the benefits. In any case, you now have a breadth of options. “Shoppers are winning here,” says Knowles, the Free Shipping Day founder.

The new discount will debut on April 19 Apr 12, 2017, 12:10 pm EDT  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer Get AMZN alerts: Submit     Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) is going to start offering a Walmart Pickup Discount to customers ordering online. Source: Shutterstock Customers that chose to order products from the retailer online and pick them up at a physical store will get a Walmart Pickup Discount. This option will go into effect on April 19 for about 10,000 items. The items available for the discount will be ones only available through online orders. Walmart says that it is planning to expand the Walmart Pickup Discount to more than 1 million of its most popular items by the end of June. WMT is able to discount the items because it saves on shipping by not sending the products directly to customers. The Walmart Pickup Discount was announced by Marc Lore, the President and CEO of its U.S. eCommerce division, in a blog post. The new option for customers are the company’s latest efforts to pull shoppers away from rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Lore has listed out some of the items that will be available for the Walmart Pickup Discount and how much customers will save on them. Here are the items from that list. Britax B-SAFE 35 Infant Car Seat, Slate Strie – The original price is $148.05, but customers will save $7.40 by picking it up. LEGO City Great Vehicles Ferry, 60119 – $23.99 is the original price and customers will get a discount of $2.55 with the new option. Coleman 150 qt Heritage XP Marine Cooler – Customers will shave $4.46 of the original price of $111.49 when picking this up at a store. VIZIO SmartCast M-Series 70″ Class 4K Ultra HDTV (M70-D3) – The original price of $1,698 be reduced by $50 when picking up the item.

Bradford, who is starting his 13th year on both the Bald Knob City Council and the Fire Department, received the honor Feb. 2. Chuck Bradford is a busy man. He is an assistant manager at the Walmart Supercenter in Searcy, an alderman for the Bald Knob City Council and a volunteer firefighter for the Bald Knob Fire Department. But on top of all that, Bradford, 56, has a big heart, and he proved that by helping honor a 5-year-old boy who has cancer make his wish of being a firefighter come true. And for all that, Bradford was honored as the Bald Knob Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year at a banquet Feb. 2 at the Bald Knob High School cafeteria. “It just dumbfounded me,” Bradford said of receiving the honor. “It caught me off guard. I wasn’t expecting it. When they said it, it just kinda got me. It was a great honor.” A statement was read announcing the recipient of the award. During the reading, Bradford figured it out that he was the recipient, especially when the statement talked about when he moved to Bald Knob and when he started working for the Fire Department. And the kicker was when he helped organize a day for Gage Stephens, a cancer patient from Lonoke. “This person found out about Gage while he was at work one day,” the statement said. “All this little boy dreamed of was being a firefighter. Well, this person got with Chief [Danny] Holobaugh and told him about Gage and said he would like to do something for him, so they did. “His passion is to make kids happy. There are more stories to tell about this person — how he has helped people who needed help with either food, gas, helping to fix their broken cars, rides to work — but we don’t have time for all of them.” Another thing that gave it away for Bradford was that two of his children, Justin Bradford and Amanda Eubanks, attended the banquet. “On this particular night, my youngest son and daughter showed up [in Bald Knob],” Bradford said. “I thought that was weird. I said, ‘What are you doing here?’” Bradford said his children told him that they, along with him and his wife, Anita, would go to a restaurant between Bald Knob and Batesville. Bradford said they usually don’t go out on Thursdays. Also, when the announcement was being made at the banquet, Bradford knew it was about him when it said, “they have four children between them.” “This is what got me,” he said. “I just threw my hands in my face.” Bradford said he’s not looking for recognition when he does things for other people. However, the event to honor Gage Stephens was definitely a big one. “I wouldn’t do anything for that reason,” he said, referring to being honored by the chamber. “I got recognized for it, and I really appreciate it.” Bradford said a woman he works with, Donna Middleton, heard about Gage’s situation. He was diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia at a young age. “She was telling me about Gage even before this time,” Bradford said, referring to his illness. “She said that he likes fireman stuff. She was telling me how Make-A-Wish was doing some stuff for him, and they did.” Bradford was told that Gage wanted some things to decorate his room, so he donated his first fire light that he had in his truck when he became a Bald Knob firefighter 12 years ago. It was on a shelf in his shop. “I said, ‘I’ll bring that to him,’” Bradford said. “It just went on. Then probably two or three months later, Donna said she’d like to take Gage to a fire department and show him around. I said to take him to Lonoke. Most fire departments would be tickled for a kid to come in and be able to show him stuff, especially one who wants to be a firefighter.” Bradford said he was told that Gage was taken to the Lonoke Fire Department, but not much was done there. “It kind of shocked me, especially about a kid,” he said. “I thought about it. I got home that night and called Danny [Holobaugh], and the rest is history.” Gage was given a day at the Bald Knob Fire Department on Nov. 12. Bradford said Holobaugh told him to do what he needed to do to make it happen for Gage. “Outside of family, that was just the biggest thing — a blessing to see his little eyes light up,” Bradford said. During the event, Gage was picked up in a firetruck and taken to the Fire Department. He got his own fire boots, a helmet with his name on it and a real fire badge. And it didn’t stop there with Bradford and Gage. Gage said he wanted a motorized firetruck for Christmas. Bradford said he and the other firefighters got together to order one for Gage. Because of the item being out of stock so many different places, they gave him the truck in January. Gage’s grandmother Ann Whitsett was appreciative of what Bradford and the Bald Knob Fire Department did for her family. “They were awesome,” she said. “They made his dream come true. He got to ride on the firetruck. He just had a ball. He looked at everything. They got him a firetruck for Christmas that he rides all the time. They were awesome people.” Whitsett said Gage has gone through numerous treatments, including chemotherapy, bone-marrow transplants and radiation. Wednesday, he had surgery to straighten one of eyes that was crooked because of the treatments. “He’s in remission,” she said. “He’s going good. He had eye surgery yesterday, and he’s up going today.” Bradford said he originally got on the Fire Department in 2005, a month after he got on the City Council. “I wanted to get on the Fire Department and get involved in the community,” he said. “I’ve been there ever since.” Bradford is currently the department’s training instructor and Firewise coordinator. During his time away from work, Bradford works on projects in the community. “I started pushing for a new animal shelter when I got on the City Council,” he said. “We have outside kennels. This weekend (referring to April 8-9), we were building metal awnings over the outside kennels.” Bradford believes in community spirit. “I really try to get involved,” he said. “Sometimes, it eats up a lot of your time, but if you’re going to be in something, I feel like if you’re going do it, do it.” Bradford is originally from Paragould. He started working at Walmart as an hourly associate in 1987. He got into management and left Paragould in 1987. He’s lived several places over the years and started working at the Searcy store in 1998. “I met my wife, Anita, in 1999, and we got married in 2000,” Bradford said. “She lived in Bald Knob, and I moved here.” Bradford said he worked at a Walmart in Little Rock for several years while commuting before coming back to work in Searcy in the past few years. “I like where I live,” he said.

This time, the retail giant is looking east at New York-based Bonobos, a menswear e-tailer founded in 2007 by Andy Dunn and Brian Spaly. The higher-end fashion retailer also sells men’s fashion through Nordstrom in addition to its own website. Dunn is the CEO and Spaly left Bonobos to start Trunk Club which he sold to Nordstroms in 2014. Walmart U.S. e-commerce CEO Marc Lore recently said the retailer is behind and his job is to catch up, which will likely happen with more acquisitions. In his seven month tenure at the retail giant, Lore has spearheaded three other acquisitions in special product categories and he’s restructured the Walmart.com and Jet.com businesses to take advantage of category expertise from Moosejaw, ShoeBuy, Modcloth and Hayneedle, which was part of the Jet.com deal. Recode reports the two parties have already settled on a price, which they believe will surpass the $70 million paid for ShoeBuy. Bonobos has reported annual revenue around $125 million. While Bonobos is primarily an online business, the retailer has opened nearly three dozen brick-and-mortar showrooms where customers can get properly fitted and place orders which are then delivered to them at home. These “guideshops” are located in larger urban cities such as Atlanta, Austin, Bethesda, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis, Nashville, Newport Beach, New York City, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, Scottsdale and Washington D.C. The website said future locations are planned in Los Angeles, Denver and Lexington, Kentucky. Wal-Mart has not responded to the reports, but Lore has told the media the retailer was actively looking to make more deals. The retailer will no doubt report on the deal once due diligence is finalized. Talk Business & Politics will follow up on this story as more details are known.

The Mobile Disc to Digital service works pretty much like Walmart/Vudu’s existing Disc-to-Digital conversion, except that instead of inserting a disc into a PC for verification you simply use your phone’s camera to scan the barcode from disc packaging. A few things have to be enabled in the Vudu app settings to the feature to work. For one, “Location” must be turned on. This might have something to do with regional information on the discs. In addition, the camera must be enabled, there needs to be billing set up, and a UV (UltraViolet) account must be connected. Not all movies are able to be converted. We tried a bunch of older Blu-ray Discs and DVDs that were pre-UltraViolet/iTunes to see what titles could be converted. Titles that were eligible for a $2 conversion include Avatar, An American in Paris, Michael Jackson: This is It, Syriana, There Will be Blood, Mongol, and Das Boot. Titles that costs $5 for the conversion included Elf and The Road Warrior. The titles that were not eligible from our bunch included the Star Wars Trilogy, the Riddick Trilogy, Gangs of New York, Zero Dark Thirty, and Dune among others. What’s also nice about the new app feature is that if you already own the UltraViolet title the app will let you know. However, it doesn’t know if you may already own a digital copy through iTunes, Google Play, Amazon or other services. The Vudu app is free to download from iTunes and Google Play.

Associated Press BOZEMAN, Mont. — A Montana State University professor is suing Wal-Mart for libel after he says an employee at the Bozeman store listed his occupation on a fishing license as a “toilet cleaner.” Gilbert Kalonde, assistant professor of technology education at MSU, filed the suit this past week in Gallatin County District Court. Kalonde is seeking unspecified damages. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported that Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, Kalonde bought a state fishing license in April 2015, showing the Wal-Mart employee identification of his employment at MSU. But the Wal-Mart employee entered “clean toilets” into the state database as Kalonde’s occupation. The suit contends Wal-Mart exposed Kalonde to “hatred, contempt, ridicule” through the incident.   Most Read Rick Steves donates apartment complex to YWCA LYNNWOOD — With acts of charity, as with his globetrotting, Rick Steves… Apr 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Transportation budget includes funds for several county projects OLYMPIA — Negotiations on a new state transportation budget could bring an… Apr 15th, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield Man charged in home invasion robbery in south Everett EVERETT — Two intruders kicked in the locked bedroom and bathroom doors… Apr 15th, 2017 by Diana Hefley The ‘mother of all bombs’ has a Boeing-built big brother By Scott Canon, The Kansas City Star KNOB NOSTER, Mo. — The… Apr 15th, 2017 Two known gang members charged in drive-by shooting EVERETT — Two known gang members are believed to be connected to… Apr 15th, 2017 by Diana Hefley © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

The two employees of Lightworks Fiber & Consulting of Hotchkiss were subcontracting with Outback Power Company of Montana, the main contractor on the Elevate Fiber project being installed in the North Fork Valley. Solar Energy International, a nonprofit headquartered in Paonia, has invested in training locals in solar installation as part of its Solarize North Fork project. The project has helped install 42 new solar projects in the area, creating jobs for local contractors and investing almost $1 million since 2015. SEI also offers vocational training in Paonia schools and has trained 56 students since 2015 in solar technology, according to Mary Marshall of SEI. QUICKREAD MINING A NEW FUTURE The coal industry has been on the decline for years, with two of the three mines in the North Fork Valley closing or idling in the last year, and that’s creating challenges and new opportunities. In this two-day series, The Daily Sentinel is examining both those hanging their hopes on a black gold turnaround — or at least the handful of high-paying mining jobs for as long as they’ll last — and those working to diversify the economy and build new industries in Delta County. SUNDAY: Among troubles, workers cling to lone remaining mine TODAY: Change is happening, even if old-timers, newcomers disagree about it By Erin McIntyre Sunday, April 16, 2017 PAONIA — On the corner of Paonia Town Park sits a memorial to coal miners who lost their lives harvesting hard black gold from the rugged mountains. When the community dedicated the North Fork Miners Memorial in 1983, 62 names were added to the plaque, and they budgeted one-quarter of the memorial for future casualties. It would be nearly a decade before two more names were added to the plaque, and four more after that. For now, the remainder of the monument remains blank, in macabre anticipation of the next name destined to join. Though working in the mines has become exponentially safer since a 43-year-old Finnish miner named Joonas Batki died in 1906 in a rockfall accident and became the first name on the memorial, there are also fewer opportunities these days to be added to this list. A town that once bet on coal for its economy is now faced with the reality that only one mine remains operating, and a fraction of the workers have been called back to earn wages and support their families. The mining that built this community and gave it a sense of identity and purpose looks on its way out to many. There are now more government workers than miners in Delta County. The communities are in transition, coping with the fallout from the loss of jobs and tax income to support schools and other public services. Diversification is the mantra for the North Fork now, in a place where most people realize the mines are not coming back, even as they mourn the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the past three years. It’s possible that in the not-too-distant future, the only miner left in Paonia will be the memorial’s bronze statue standing sentinel over this community, staring toward the mountains, wearing his headlamp and wielding his pickax. QUAINT PLACES QUIETLY CHANGING The towns of the North Fork Valley, named for the tributary of the Gunnison River running through it, exude a quaint, pastoral quality that makes visitors feel like they’re worlds away from everywhere else, not just less than an hour from Delta, the big town with Walmart and more than one grocery store. Some of that characteristic has been retained on purpose by locals, and some of it is a byproduct of the economic situation. The median income for a Delta County household is roughly $42,000, and agriculture is still a mainstay, though the top dollars come from cattle and field crops, not the niche organic farms or orchards the area is famous for. But things here are changing, and the people who have lived here a long time can feel it and see it. Some are big things — like dwindling classroom enrollment for schools. Others are little signs — like a Pilates studio on the main street of Hotchkiss, a conservative farming town known for its annual sheepdog trials. It’s not the same as when the bust happened in the mid-1980s, when the largest mine in the area shut down, housing prices tanked and foreclosures soared. This time is different. Though school enrollment has decreased by 200 students in Paonia and Hotchkiss in the past decade, others are moving into the area and buying property. The number of real-estate transactions has soared 268 percent in the past five years in Paonia, while the median sales price has increased more than 12 percent. In Hotchkiss, the number of sales has fallen by half since 2012, but the median prices have jumped more than 20 percent. Thomas Wills, a resident of Hotchkiss since 1990, sees an opportunity for the communities to plan ahead, to be proactive and decide what they want to be. He’s seen a lot of changes here since he bought his house for $17,000 and locals accused him of driving the prices up at the time. He’s been the publisher of the North Fork Merchant Herald since 1996 and owns Wills Gallery and Used Books. He currently serves on the Hotchkiss Board of Trustees, helped found the Hotchkiss planning committee and is co-leader of the town’s downtown improvement committee. Delta County is currently writing a new master plan, its first since 1992, and the transitional period is ripe for asking what everyone wants the communities to look like in the future. “We do need to be reinvigorated,” Wills said. “But we have all kinds of problems, and the main problem is we don’t have enough retail.” He sees a need for more mom-and-pop shops and retail stores that have been lost over time through attrition, in a town that used to be known for its many antique stores. In the near future, he sees an influx of people moving from more expensive, crowded cities who want to get out of the rat race. He predicts more high-dollar homes, small ranchettes for affluent horse owners and the like, smattered across the mesas with organic farms. “That’s what people want, a version of Hobbiton,” he said, referring to the mythical town in “Lord of the Rings.” “We will see more affluent people moving in. I don’t really like that future, but things are going that way.” He sees signs of it even in rural, agricultural Hotchkiss, in the occasional BMW and Maserati parked in the town, which now has five gyms, including yoga and Pilates studios. “That’s the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “People are paying for that.” While no large-scale manufacturers have been attracted to the area, some international companies have relocated there — including Shade Scapes, which moved to Hotchkiss in 2015, into an old mercantile store next to the library. The company produces commercial umbrellas and other furnishings for outdoor spaces and distributes worldwide. Paonia has recently attracted companies like Optibike, a high-performance electric bike company that sells models costing as much as $12,000.   LAID-OFF MINERS ‘DOING WHAT THEY CAN’ It’s not that coal isn’t still a part of the economy here, but its role has significantly diminished. The Oxbow mine closed, the Bowie mine is idle with a skeleton crew, and the West Elk Mine had significant layoffs in June and took back just a fraction of its workers six months later. The remaining miners in the valley are surviving on half a mine compared to three mines open in 2013. A select few have returned to work in the West Elk Mine. Scott Morley is one of those miners, and he considers himself lucky to be back, though he feels awful for the guys who don’t have the same chance. Morley, a coal miner for 38 years, knows more than 80 others who have been laid off and didn’t get called back. He survived the layoff last June by getting a lower-paying construction job with Telluride Gravel, which meant a two-and-a-half hour commute each way. The week of Thanksgiving, he found out they were calling people back to the mine. Morley had just finished a 17-hour shift in Basalt, working in freezing conditions in a trench with water up to his waist, when his son-in-law, a fellow miner, called to tell him they were taking applications. Morley was hired back to be a fire boss, a position charged with inspecting areas before miners enter them, checking for gas or unsafe overhead surfaces as well as other dangers. It’s a job he takes seriously, one he decided to learn how to do after he lost 27 friends while working at the Wilberg Mine in 1984, in the worst mine fire in Utah’s history. Morley and his family moved here for work eight years after that happened. Now, he’s close to retirement and grateful for the overtime, averaging 55 hours of work, including swing shifts and graveyards. He’s a bishop in the Mormon church, and he knows six other men in his ward who were laid off with him six months ago. Morley was the only one of them called back to work. Though part of his position in the church is to counsel other members, it makes it hard for him to broach the subject with them because he’s troubled about their livelihoods, but thankful he has a good-paying job for at least a little while longer. “Their unemployment is running out, times are getting tough and they’re taking jobs that normally they wouldn’t take,” Morley said. “It’s kind of the last straw and they’re doing what they can to keep going.” Some have gone to work installing high-speed fiber internet or solar power. Others have gone back to farming, or taken one of the few retail jobs available. Others have embarked on new ventures as hunting outfitters. The Morleys have also kept themselves going by operating A Simpler Time Bed & Breakfast in their family home, now that their kids are grown and they don’t need the bedrooms anymore. Mostly, he just hopes they can keep going long enough to be able to afford to retire, because he doesn’t want to start over again. He never intended to spend his career underground, and thinks back to that one winter 38 years ago, when he took a mining job to avoid the harsh winter as a masonry contractor. He never meant for it to last a lifetime. One of the last conversations Morley had with his 101-year-old mother before she died five years ago was about mining. “She said, ‘When are you going to get a real job?’” he recalled. “This is it. This is all my résumé says now.”   REPLACING COAL AS A LIFELINE While some like Morley are just trying to hang on for a few more years to reach retirement, others are looking for ways to bring in jobs to boost the economy and help the community and those who didn’t leave for other mining jobs. Securing Delta County’s future means pursuing a variety of opportunities that don’t involve a finite resource subject to the whims of the marketplace and environmental regulations. They’re hoping to replace the lifelines that the seams of anthracite coal provided to the community. Delta County Administrator Robbie LeValley doesn’t see the diversification of the economy as a question of choosing other opportunities over mining or ranching. While she acknowledges that the mainstays have traditionally been agriculture and energy, she sees those transforming, not declining, into markets including alternative energy, such as the training provided through Solar Energy International, an international nonprofit headquartered in Paonia, and value-added agricultural products, like Big B’s cider and juices in Hotchkiss. The county is still experiencing financial losses from the decline of the mines, and those revenues have not shown signs of rebounding. LeValley considers the financial situation the “new normal.” Flat sales-tax revenues, property tax declines from the closure of the Bowie Mine and losses from other mine-related revenues are still being felt. In the last three years the county has lost more than $775,000 in federal mineral lease revenue and severance tax dollars, according to LeValley. For the first time, the county is trying to decide how to monetize its recreational appeal. LeValley said the county received funds from Great Outdoors Colorado for a recreation master plan in February, which it has never pursued before. The county is hoping to piggyback on other recreation destinations within a day’s drive, including mountain bike trails in Fruita and the river park in Montrose, and concentrate on marketing the rivers in the county for recreation. LeValley sees the installation of fiber internet as a boon for the area. It’s being installed across Delta and Montrose counties by a subsidiary of Delta-Montrose Electric Association, Elevate Fiber, which has already gone live and provided gigabit service in many parts of Paonia as well as Orchard City. “When we started looking at how do we diversify the economy, broadband was the number one thing Delta County and all the municipalities looked at,” she said. The goal is to use fiber to serve the existing businesses in the community and attract those that are being priced out of the Front Range, as well as location-neutral workers. Since Elevate launched in June, it has connected more than 500 paying customers and 6,000 have registered for service, according to DMEA spokeswoman Becky Mashburn. Workers have installed service in accordance with demand, and after neighborhoods mapped out by the cooperative have a sufficient number of committed customers, the network in that area becomes available. Bringing fiber to rural areas is echoing the story of how DMEA formed back in the 1930s, when urban power companies didn’t want to incur the costs of building lines to sparsely populated areas with few paying customers and the grid wasn’t available to them. “It’s really history repeating itself again,” said Mashburn. “I really think that at the end of the day it’s just about the fact that we’re tired of waiting.” Solar energy has also experienced a boom recently in the North Fork Valley. Solar Energy International’s program offering training opportunities for displaced workers as well as its program called Solarize Delta County Farms has installed 42 new solar projects in the area since 2015 and has helped create jobs, according to Mary Marshall of SEI. The C-PACE program, a state initiative that allows small businesses including farms to spread their financing for energy-efficient projects over a 20-year period to realize immediate savings on their energy bills, was also adopted by Delta County earlier this year.   STUDENT DECLINE AN INDICATOR OF CHANGE Fiber is one of the bright spots for valley residents, no matter how they feel about how things have changed. Ron Rowell cites the investment as a smart idea to help bring small businesses and individuals to the area. Like many longtime residents, he has diversified to make it possible for him to make a living in the North Fork Valley, where he grew up. It’s a place that has always had its ups and downs. These days, many residents are jacks-of-all-trades, like Rowell. He has experience as the fire chief, the mayor, a school-bus driver and a small-business owner, and he also does snow removal on the side to make ends meet. “We struggle, there’s no doubt about it,” he said. Rowell and his wife, Deb, owned Paonia Cleaners & Laundry for 37 years until they sold it recently. His business has been kept alive with wool blankets and down comforters, Sunday-best suits for churchgoers and rugs that can’t be washed at home. He knows others have had to leave the area, through his school bus routes over the past 31 years. He had 60 kids riding the bus at one time, and now only has 15, though his route length has doubled. Schools are one of the primary tax-funded services struggling with the exodus of the mines, forcing leaders to seek creative solutions to keep buildings open. At Paonia and Hotchkiss schools, attendance has declined by about 200 students in the past 10 years, 15 percent of the former population, according to Assistant Superintendent Kurt Clay, who grew up on a farm in Hotchkiss. Most of those students came from mining families. Officials have discussed closing either Paonia or Hotchkiss high schools and combining the populations to save money. However, “for next year, that’s just a rumor,” Clay said, noting that the schools have different identities and the district values keeping them open because they are “the lifeline of our communities in many ways.” Paonia and Hotchkiss are also well-known sports rivals and traditionally send teams to state competitions every year. “Before we would ever combine schools, we would want to exhaust all our options first,” he said. Next year, budget forecasts for the district estimate that Delta County schools will receive 77 percent of their money from per-pupil funding from the state. “We are at the mercy of the state,” Clay said. “It’s not a great position at all.” In an attempt to keep the doors open at schools in both communities and keep opportunities for students, the district plans on consolidating some classes and offering combined schedules for certain classes next year. For example, students at Paonia High School might travel to Hotchkiss High School for certain high-level science classes or electives, or vice-versa, though the details are still being worked out. Clay said the district is reluctant to pursue more local funding through a mill levy override, because the community’s economy is depressed. But they’re seeking other forms of funding, including a BEST grant to revitalize aging buildings.   FUNDS FUEL DEBATES  ABOUT THE FUTURE As the North Fork transitions, old-timers and newcomers are butting heads over how — or if — tax money should be spent to revitalize the economy. Rowell has been an involved and outspoken resident, opposed to recreational marijuana and other controversial measures promoted as economic development. The latest of those is an effort to turn the old Paonia Middle School, most recently used for miner training, into affordable housing and a work center for artists through a program called Space to Create, the first state-driven initiative for artists’ affordable housing in the country. Though town trustees originally moved to earmark $35,000 for the project, locals protested the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize the initiative and the board decided to table the measure. Elaine Brett, the lead organizer of Space to Create and a member of the North Fork Creative Coalition, sees a lot of potential in transforming a vacant building into a source of revenue for new businesses. She said Space to Create wouldn’t just be for traditional artists — culinary arts and distilleries could also qualify under its broad definition and help add value to local agricultural products. Brett has lived in the valley for 12 years and moved there from the Washington, D.C., area to retire after falling in love with the area on vacation in 2003. She became involved in the arts and nonprofit communities, using her background in organizational management. In 2010, she participated in a project with the local chamber of commerce in anticipation of the reduction in the energy industry’s contribution to the economy. “We knew the clock was ticking on the coal mines,” she said. “It wasn’t a death wish on the coal mines by any means, it was just imminent.” At that time, the group developed Vision 2020, which identified areas to concentrate on for a balanced, diverse economy including the arts. Brett sees Space to Create as an opportunity to move forward with promoting the arts as an economic support for the valley, like the Blue Sage Center for the Arts in Paonia and the Creamery Arts Center in Hotchkiss. For Rowell, he sees government being involved in subsidized housing for artists as the latest thing brought here by outsiders to make their new home more like where they came from. Rowell said he felt subsidizing artist housing was not a smart move, especially since the tax base in Paonia doesn’t directly benefit financially from several nonprofits that have stationed themselves downtown in what he considers prime retail locations. “You cannot have a viable tax base in a community if the majority of your downtown is nonprofits,” he said. “They receive services, fire protection, roads, all that, but they’re not paying into it.” Though he grew up here in the North Fork Valley, at 67 years old, Rowell feels like an outsider here. This place has transitioned to be somewhere he doesn’t feel like he belongs, a place where he feels outnumbered. “We just don’t hardly fit in here anymore,” he said, noting that he and his wife will likely leave the area for retirement. As Morley described, the town has always been known for being “a hippie town full of coal miners,” a melting pot where friction exists and people don’t always agree. Sometimes there are conflicts, like five years ago when the owner of Oxbow Mining Co., a billionaire named Bill Koch, entered his tank in the Fourth of July parade and a sign-wielding hairdresser stepped in front of the tank and halted the parade with a solo confrontation. The area has become a hotbed of protests against fracking for natural gas, and the efforts to strengthen the arts and nonprofit communities haven’t been without controversy. Despite his worries about the valley and its future, and the fact that he believes the mines may only be open another decade at most, Morley is optimistic about the survival of the communities. But he admits there is conflict about what this valley should transform into, though everyone is hopeful it will recover somehow. “Everybody’s idea of better is different,” he said.

Courtesy: WDAM HATTIESBURG, MS (WDAM) - Demario Davis spends his falls making crushing tackles for the NFL’s Cleveland Browns. On Good Friday, Davis took a break from football to share his story of faith with Southeast Mississippi's Fellowship of Christian Athletes at USM’s Payne Center. "I was excited,” Davis said. “Anytime I get the opportunity to speak about God and who He is and Christ and my relationship with Him, it's a tremendous blessing and honor for me. I've known about FCA and what they've done in different parts of the country but I've never seen to the magnitude what they're doing here. Really to just come here and be a part of it has really just blessed my soul." Born in Collins, Davis played football at Brandon High School before earning a scholarship to play at Arkansas State University. As a freshman at ASU, Davis was arrested for stealing groceries at a Walmart. He recalls looking to his mother the moment he was sentenced to three days in jail. "And I looked at her and that's the first time in my life that she looked at me and it was a look like, ‘There's nothing I can do son,’” said Davis to the FCA crowd. “And there was only about 20 feet between us but it felt like a gap that was so wide cause there's nothing I can do for you. You finna go back there and I can't help you." "God brought me to Him and I want to go and bring others to Him. And the best way for me to do that is just share what happened in my life and speak from experience. And that's what allows me to testimony so openly." Davis' relationship with God only strengthened his football career. He enters his fifth season in the NFL and second with the Browns. In 2017, Davis will team up with linebacker Jamie Collins, a former Golden Eagle and fellow Mississippi native. "I'm hype man, I'm excited,” Davis said. “The league is in trouble to allow two Mississippi guys at linebacker to get on the same team. Davis said he’s proud to represent Mississippi, his family and God as he continues his NFL career. “You come up having a very good sense of family and tradition,” Davis said. “[Mississippi]’s not as busy as a lot places so you learn to care about the people that are around you...You learn I think the truer qualities of life and understand what's really important when you grow up [in Mississippi]."

By Annie Gasparro Published: Apr 16, 2017 5:48 p.m. ET Share By AnnieGasparro Whole Foods Market Inc. wants to cut prices without sacrificing the local products that define its healthy image. Investors are pushing the organic food pioneer to boost profit by operating more like a big-box grocer. Some smaller suppliers and industry consultants say the shift to a more centralized distribution structure and other changes risk compromising Whole Foods' ability to keep stocked with the latest foodie trends and hot local brands. "Shifting to national buyers can certainly deliver cost savings to Whole Foods, but at what price to the soul of the banner?" said Jim Cusson of brand consultancy Theory House. Many of the changes are being spearheaded by Don Clark, a former Target Corp. executive hired in November 2015 to run Whole Foods' grocery operations. The data analytics, centralized purchasing and strict shelf management he brought from Target could save money that Whole Foods can use to lower its relatively high prices, addressing a key customer complaint. But matching its competitors on price could also mean limiting how often it updates the products Whole Foods stocks. Whole Foods has long divided its 462 stores into 11 regions, each with distinct product offerings like local maple syrup and gourmet pickles. A quarter of Whole Foods shoppers that visited the chain in the past month did so for items they couldn't find elsewhere, according to a survey by Kantar Retail. For those who also shopped at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., only 3% said exclusive brands were a top draw. The shift comes as Whole Foods looks for a way out its longest stretch of same-store sales declines since going public in 1992. Whole Foods is under pressure from Jana Partners LLC, which last week said that along with allies it had amassed an 8.8% stake in Whole Foods. The firm is pushing for faster operational changes. Major grocery stores like Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. have seen annual sales increases of more than 10% in recent years for natural and organic foods, eating into Whole Foods' core business. Stealing that business from Whole Foods and other specialty stores has been a rare bright spot for big grocery chains battling more competition and falling food prices, which has sparked a price war that has eaten into profits. Whole Foods co-founder and Chief Executive John Mackey said his chain remains a specialty store even as it adopts more conventional techniques. "Our culture is still very unique," Mr. Mackey recently told The Wall Street Journal. "What Whole Foods needs to do is to take the best ideas of the traditional supermarket industry and integrate them into our company." He said his new strategy strikes a balance between the remaining autonomy of regional executives and an easier process for national brands to pitch their products just once at Whole Foods' Austin, Texas, headquarters. That streamlining will lead to lower prices, he said. "We think there are tremendous savings we can have that we can pass on to our customers with lower prices," he said. But smaller brands and people who work with them say they have less incentive to put up with a more impersonal Whole Foods. "It's not a great launching pad for brands anymore, and there are plenty of other options," said brand consultant Jeff Grogg. Aaron Glassman, owner of SOL Natural Foods, said that as a small company, the changes are making it harder to get on shelves at Whole Foods. "They have condensed the purchasing powers into less people. It makes it more challenging," he said. A.C. Gallo, Whole Foods' president and chief operating officer, said small suppliers will still have access to the brand's national store network, and that the approach will allow executives to better monitor how well local products are performing. And some big brands say Whole Foods' regionalized approach made it tough to negotiate a nationwide strategy for their brands. "It's always been difficult for everyone to commit the resources and big ideas to Whole Foods when it took a region-by-region" approach, said John Foraker, chief executive of Annie's Homegrown, a large Whole Foods supplier of macaroni and cheese and snacks like crackers. Rick Cunnington, a 63-year-old retiree in a suburb of Tucson, Ariz., said he is glad Whole Foods plans to focus on price over the diversity of its offerings. Though he has shopped at Whole Foods for years, he said, he buys many items like cheese and vegetables at Trader Joe's where they are cheaper. "I'll keep an open mind, especially if there are coupons involved," Mr. Cunnington said about Whole Foods's efforts to appeal to more shoppers. "My wife and I are value shoppers."

A week earlier, Payless said it was closing 400 stores, and before that it was J.C. Penney announcing it was closing 138 location. Just look at some of the iconic retailers closing stores. Sears is shutting down about 10 percent of its Sears and Kmart locations, or 150 stores. Even the very first Kmart, which opened in 1962 in Garden City, Michigan, is closing After closing dozens of stores last year, Macy’s plans to close 68 more of its locations, including a store in downtown Minneapolis that opened in 1902. For some retailers, it’s a total liquidation – they won’t be back. Others hope that store closings will help improve profits, but experts have long said you can’t cut yourself to prosperity. In the world of thin margins, Wal-Mart and Amazon, retailers have to be at the top of their game 24/7/365. There’s little room for error. Yes, there probably are too many retail stores in the U.S., at least on the large-scale chain side of the ledger. Things were a lot simpler “back in the day” when there weren’t as many options. Some memories stick. Like getting shoes at Thom McAn when I was a kid. Then maybe a trip to Gibson’s, Howard’s or TG&Y. Maybe all three if we couldn’t find what we were looking for. J.C. Penney with it’s marble and granite was a step above, but the ultimate fun place to shop was the multi-story Valley Department Store in downtown Vicksburg. There was an entire floor for just toys! I even remember a Woolworth’s store with its eatery before it closed. The Battlefield Mall was home to Shainberg’s, McRae’s, Sears, another TG&Y and K&B Drugs. In the 80’s, Aladdin’s Castle was full of video games where my allowance was invested quite often. Then came the opening of the Pemberton Square Mall in 1986, and within a decade, the old Battlefield Mall was no more. Thirty-years later, Pemberton is now mostly a ghost-town. A vibrant mall isn’t always easy to find these days, but having something like The Mall at Barnes Crossing in Tupelo continue to do well is reassuring. A repaved road and parking lot around the mall would make life even better (hint, hint). For now, some of the closings haven’t affected The Mall at Barnes Crossing. J.C. Penney and Payless locations aren’t on the chopping block. Neither is Sears, at least not yet. And the good news is, MBC is getting a HomeGoods and H&M later this year. Maybe we do have too many stores, though. According to Business Insider, the U.S.has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia, the next two countries with the most retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar Credit Ratings report from October. And good times don’t always last. But good retailers do. Many smaller locally owned shops have learned to adapt by offering unique items and superior customer service. The retail landscape is far different from what it used to be. It’s survival of the fittest. But I’ll always prefer walking in and touching and seeing what I want to buy, not clicking on a photo on my screen. Old-fashioned? Probably. But infinitely more fulfilling. dennis.seid@journalinc.com Twitter: @dennisseid Click here to leave a comment!

Gary Lee Fellenbaum and Jillian Tait were charged Nov. 6, 2014, with murder in the death of Scott, who was Tait’s son. Submitted Photo – Chester County District Attorney’s Office By Michael Rellahan, Daily Local News Posted: 04/16/17, 7:28 PM EDT | Updated: 3 hrs ago # Comments This photo combo of undated images provided by the Chester County District Attorney’s Office shows Gary Lee Fellenbaum, left, and Jillian Tait, who were charged Nov. 6, 2014, with murder in the death of Tait’s 3-year-old son, Scott “Scotty” McMillan. Submitted Photo – Chester County District Attorney’s Office WEST CHESTER >> Gary Lee Fellenbaum is scheduled to appear in a Common Pleas courtroom Monday to begin pre-trial proceedings in the capital murder case against him for the murder of 3-year-old Scott “Scotty” McMillan, the youngest child of the woman he had been living with in a West Caln trailer home. But although the courtroom, the judge in the case, and the attorneys both on his behalf and the prosecution’s remain the same as previous appearances, the landscape of the case against him has changed significantly. Last week, the mother of the young victim in the case agreed to assist with the prosecution and testify against Fellenbaum, who authorities contend was the main perpetrator of the physical abuse that McMillan and his older brother suffered in October and November 2014. Scott McMillan died of blunt force trauma after being subjected to regular beatings and, the prosecution contends, torture. Prior to that, Fellenbaum’s attorney had been hoping to have the two tried together. Advertisement Jillian Tait, who met Fellenbaum while they both worked at the Wal-Mart in Sadsbury and moved in with him shortly thereafter, was allowed to plead guilty to third-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, along with related charges, in exchange for her cooperation. The lead prosecutor in the case, First Assistant District Attorney Michael Noone, told Judge William P. Mahon that his office had decided to drop the first-degree murder charges against her, and the intention of seeking the death penalty, because her testimony against Fellenbaum was necessary. “This defendant will be a critical witness in the trial of Gary Fellenbaum,” and the prosecution’s attempt to win a death-penalty conviction against him, Noone told the judge. “Essentially, your honor, the defendant will act as a living adult witness to what happened in that trailer.” More than that, Fellenbaum’s ex-wife, Amber Fellenbaum, has also agreed to testify against him. Amber Fellenbaum, who was not charged with the boy’s murder, nevertheless saw the alleged abuse that both Fellenbaum and Tait inflicted on him, and is expected to bolster the prosecution’s case. Amber Fellenbaum pleaded guilty to two counts of endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person, one count of each for both Scott McMillan and his older brother, who was 6 at the time. She faces a total maximum penalty of 18 years in state prison. All three have been held in Chester County Prison since their arrests in November 2014. The hearings that begin Monday before Mahon will include more than two dozen pre-trial motions filed by both the prosecution and Fellenbaum’s attorney, George S. Yacoubian Jr. of Radnor. Among them are a motion to have the trial moved from Chester County because of pre-trial publicity, and to keep the jurors chosen for the capital case from seeing photographs of the victim. Yacoubian contends that his client’s constitutional right to a fair trial had been hopelessly compromised by the pre-trial publicity the case had received in newspaper articles, television broadcasts, and internet posting. “The self-evident conclusion is that this county has been so saturated with the facts underlying this case that it is impossible for defendant to receive a fair trial before a jury of impartial persons who learn of the case only through the evidence properly admitted during trial,” Yacoubian wrote in his request for a change of venue. The trial is scheduled to begin in September. Mahon had reportedly expressed concern privately about the jury selection process in the cases of both Fellenbaum and Tait, who at that point could have been tried together. Not only is the trial one in which the prosecution is seeking the death penalty, which would require extensive questioning of each panelist to see whether they could impose a death sentence, but it also has been the subject of much discussion in the media, both locally and nationally. In addition, the allegations themselves that have been made against Fellenbaum could make it extraordinarily difficult to impanel a jury made up of people who declare they could judge the case fairly on the facts alone and not on sympathy for the victims. The murder shocked members of the Chester County community for its savage nature, and drew heartbreaking headlines around the world with its accompanying photograph of the red-headed tyke Scotty. At the time, Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan called the case “an American horror story.” When the boy was brought to the emergency room at Brandywine Hospital in Caln, he had “bruises on top of bruises,” Hogan said at a press conference announcing the charges. “Our emergency room nurses see a lot of things. But when they saw his body, they wept.” Mahon is reportedly considering calling in dozens more prospective jurors from the county than the 124 he had summoned in the last death penalty case over which he presided, that of Coatesville chainsaw killer Laquanta Chapman. He has also noted that extra alternate jurors might need to be empaneled because of the possibility that some jurors chosen might not be emotionally able to complete the trial. The last time a trial for a county crime was tried outside of the county was reportedly the escape case involving then-convicted murderer Nicholas Yarris, who jumped out of a constable’s car in West Whiteland and fled while being transported from state prison to Delaware County. That was held in Carlisle, Cumberland County in the mid-1980s. The infamous Johnston Brothers murder trials were also heard by out-of-county juries in the early 1980s. Yacoubian, the private attorney who was hired by Gary Fellenbaum’s family to replace the county’s Public Defender’s Office’s lawyer over the summer, has made it clear in his motions that he is very concerned about the way the jurors are given the evidence in the case. In his motions, he asks Mahon to forbid all “in-life photographs” of McMillan that might prove inflammatory to the jurors; shield them from knowing beforehand what case they might be hearing; and order that there be strict rules about behavior by those attending the trial, including no talking or shaking heads during testimony, or displaying signs, banners, or clothing that might be prejudicial, both in the courtroom and outside the courthouse. For its part, the prosecution also filed motions in the case. In them, they ask Mahon to allow a computer simulation of the case to be used in opening statements, and to have McMillan’s older brother, who is expected to testify, give his testimony outside the presence of Fellenbaum. Beginning in October 2014, according to the allegations set forth in the case against the Fellenbaums and Tait, Gary Fellenbaum began physically abusing both of Tait’s sons. The abuse included punches and beatings, but also whipping with a crudely fashioned “cat o’nine tails,” and tying the boys to chairs or hanging them upside down by their feet. Allegedly Fellenbaum’s beating of Scott McMillan escalated to the point where the boy could not hold down his food. Angered, Fellenbaum allegedly punched him in the face so hard he fell out of his chair, and he later punched him in the stomach. The boy began vomiting and later passed out. Although Fellenbaum and Tait tried to revive him, they left him alone in a bedroom for several hours before finding him completely unresponsive on the evening of Nov. 4, 2014. Amber Fellenbaum, 24, who did not participate in the alleged abuse, gave a statement to investigators after McMillan’s lifeless body was found in the trailer by emergency personnel who responded to her 911 call. In her statement, she said that for two weeks prior to McMillan’s death, she saw Fellenbaum and Tait spanking him for lying or disrespecting Fellenbaum. In one instance, Fellenbaum began “wailing on his rear end,” because he would not respond to his questions. She allegedly said she saw the couple beat McMillan on his buttocks with a frying pan, and both of them punch him in his face, stomach, and buttocks. “His buttocks were purple and red, his face was swollen, and his body (had) numerous bruises,” she told the police. Amber Fellenbaum also witnessed the incident in which her estranged husband taped McMillan to a kitchen chair with his hands above his head, and then proceeded to “pummel him” until he vomited and his body went limp. She said that after McMillan became unresponsive and had labored breathing, she asked the couple to take him for “immediate medical attention,” but that they both declined to do so. It was not until about 7:30 p.m. that day, when McMillan had stopped breathing, that she called for emergency help. To contact staff writer Michael P. Rellahan call 610-696-1544.

(JAKE NAUGHTON/NYT) Kirsten Green was ranked among the dozen most successful venture investors in the world this year thanks to her early role in Dollar Shave Club, Jet.com and other startups where she saw potential for building strong brands. Share story By KATIE BENNER and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Kirsten Green had only dabbled in investing in startups before she began a venture-capital fund in 2012. What she had instead was years of experience covering the retail business as an analyst on Wall Street. So Green, 45, parlayed that retail knowledge into her venture-capital endeavors and used it to bring specialized advice to her companies. In one of her first moves as a venture capitalist, she put $1 million into Dollar Shave Club, then a tiny company, which sells razors to consumers online. Later, she invested in Jet.com, an e-commerce startup that was vocal about wanting to take on Amazon. Last year, both those startups hit the jackpot: Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, while Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com for $3.3 billion. For Green, that translated into a bonanza of returns.

The Dollar Shave Club and Jet.com deals have helped vault Green this year to No. 12 among the top 50 venture capitalists in the world, according to data compiled by CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital. Other venture capitalists on the list also landed their spots partly because of big sales or initial public offerings of their startups, including the recent IPO of Snap, the maker of the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat. The place of Green, who did not rank in the top 20 last year, on the list demonstrates that the real measure of success in venture capital is how much a startup is worth when it sells or goes public. CB Insights put together the list using criteria such as the size of a return an investor was able to generate when the investments went public or were acquired. The firm focused on the performance of investors since 2009 for the list. Green is an unorthodox venture capitalist for several reasons. Apart from having never worked at a venture-capital firm before starting her own in 2012, she is also a woman in a male-dominated field. (Of the top 20 venture investors this year, only two were women.) And unlike many generalist venture investors, who work in a range of areas, Green focuses specifically on commerce and other retail-related startups. Investors have tried for years to find the next Amazon or eBay, often with little success. Recent high-profile e-commerce failures include Fab.com, One Kings Lane, Shoedazzle and Gilt, all of which were financed by brand-name investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and General Atlantic. Green’s roots in retail run deep. She began her career as an accountant auditing retailers. In the late 1990s, she covered those companies as a stock analyst for Montgomery Securities, studying measurements like customer traffic in retail locations and a store’s profitability per square foot. She also observed the rise of brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach and Ugg. She soon concluded that online commerce would underpin the next generation of important retail brands, but that consumers would not rely on just one way to shop. With the rise of Amazon and other online retailers, Green saw more bankruptcy filings from traditional retailers, as well as news of store closings and reports of market-share shifts. But she also saw stores do well when companies could make an emotional connection with shoppers and better analyze their behavior. “Retail is now totally propelled by consumers and their needs,” she said. “People can buy what they want in any way that they want it. That trend started a long time ago, and it has really changed everything.” In 2003, Green decided to jump from analyzing this shift to investing in it. For a time, she worked as a consultant to a private equity firm before turning to venture capital because of her interest in young companies. In 2010, she raised an angel investment fund to make one-off investments in companies like Birchbox, a cosmetics subscription service, and Warby Parker, an eyeglasses retailer, while she studied how to raise a venture fund. In 2012, Green raised a $40 million venture fund. The investment firm Cendana Capital contributed $10 million, despite the fact that she had never worked as a traditional investor or tech entrepreneur. “When we talked to founders she had worked with, they all said that she had the best expertise and gave the best advice,” Michael Kim, a managing partner at Cendana, said of Green. With that fund, Green put $1 million into Dollar Shave Club when the startup was valued at just $5 million. She also joined the company’s board. After Green invested in Jet.com in 2014, she chatted with Jet’s executives almost weekly about matters including strategy and potential acquisitions, said Katie Finnegan, who was the online retailer’s head of corporate development. Finnegan said Jet still consults with Green even after the company’s sale to Wal-Mart. Green has “a real instinct for brands,” said Rachel Blumenthal, the founder of the children’s apparel startup Rockets of Awesome, which sends subscribers a customized box of clothing for every new season. Blumenthal got to know Green from Warby Parker, which was founded by Blumenthal’s husband, Neil. Green invested in Rockets of Awesome last year and has brought her opinions about consumer behavior to the startup. At a recent company board meeting, Green argued that the online retailer’s subscription box needed to remain distinct from its other packaging. Rachel Blumenthal agreed, saying that making the box “the crown jewel of the customer experience” was the right decision because it was one of the most powerful ways to reach consumers and to learn about them. Green currently serves on more than 10 company boards, including for the men’s clothing company Bonobos, the makeup brand Glossier and the women’s vitamin company Ritual. She has also had her share of flops. Threadflip, an online consignment store in which she had invested, shut down last year and became part of Le Tote, a service that lets users rent clothing. As for exits, Green said she tells entrepreneurs that she expects them to take the companies public or sell to a buyer as soon as appropriate. Of the 30 companies in her first fund, eight have been acquired. In her second $75 million fund, which she raised in 2014, two companies have been acquired, including Jet.com. “Now that people are bombarded with information, we are in a golden age where brands matter,” Green said. “I want to be part of this new era.” KATIE BENNER MICHAEL J. de la MERCED Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Andrew Cunningham (US) - Apr 16, 2017 10:10 pm UTC reader comments 212 Share this story Last November, Nintendo surprised everyone by going back to its roots and releasing the Classic Mini NES. The delightful emulator/nostalgia-fest sparked unanticipated demand, including near-instant supply issues and 200-percent-plus markups in secondary markets. So in December of 2016, we decided to build our own version instead. Since Nintendo bizarrely announced that it won't be making any more of the hard-to-find mini consoles this week, we're re-running this piece to help those of you with a DIY streak once again build your own. Our custom RetroPie gaming box and a decent replica of the SNES gamepad. Andrew Cunningham The Raspberry Pi 3: the heart of our little box. Andrew Cunningham The Pi 3 is a good fit for two reasons: its relatively generous quad-core Cortex A53 CPU and its plentiful I/O. Andrew Cunningham HDMI for audio and video and micro USB for power. Andrew Cunningham The "official" Raspberry Pi case won't win awards for aesthetics, but it's simple to assemble and disassemble. Andrew Cunningham The Pi slides right in. Andrew Cunningham The case when fully assembled. Andrew Cunningham A 64GB microSD card is overkill, but it leaves plenty of room to grow. Andrew Cunningham All plugged in and powered on. The red light is for power, while a blinking green light denotes disk activity. The SD card slot is exposed for easy access. Andrew Cunningham Further ReadingHands-on: Nintendo Classic Mini NES puts old games in a very small package Against my better judgement, I’ve tried a couple of times to snag an adorable little £50 Nintendo Classic Mini NES—once when Amazon put some of its limited stock online and crashed its own site, and once when Walmart was shipping out small quantities every day a couple of weeks ago. In both cases, I failed. But the dumb itch of nostalgia can’t always be scratched by logical thoughts like “do you really need to pay money for Super Mario Bros. 3 again,” and “Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest is probably the weakest of the three NES Castlevania games.” Since it’s not entirely clear if or when those little mini NESes will become readily available, I decided to funnel that small wad of expendable cash and the desire for some nostalgia-fuelled gaming into a DIY project. Further ReadingNintendo Classic Mini NES torn down, chips and hardware specs identifiedIt turns out that the Mini NES is just a little Linux-powered board inside a cute case, and it’s totally possible to build your own tiny Linux-powered computer inside a cute case without spending much more than £50. And by using the Raspberry Pi and freely available software, you can build something capable of doing a whole heck of a lot more than playing the same 30 NES games over and over again. Setting goals I find it helpful when pursuing a new DIY project to start with a list of needs and wants and go from there—possibly a leftover from my IT days helping the non-technically inclined (and actively technology-averse) make purchasing decisions. With my homebrew Mini NES, I wanted to: Spend something close to the same £50 that the Mini NES costs, though I would be OK as long as the bill of materials came in under £80 (because that’s roughly as many Amazon points as I have to dedicate to this project). Make something similar in size to the Mini NES. Make something powerful enough to easily emulate 8- and 16-bit consoles—anything above and beyond that would be great, too, but for these prices you won’t be emulating many games released after the end of the '90s. Include integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for wireless controllers and easy network/Internet connectivity, respectively. Build something that, once fully configured, would provide a relatively easy-to-use and attractive console-like UI. With all that in mind, these are the components I settled on: For the heart of the system, I chose the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, in the form of the official desktop starter kit, which will cost you about £45 from Amazon. This thing ticks a lot of boxes—it’s relatively cheap and relatively powerful, and it can easily handle anything from the original PlayStation on down (Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast emulation is offered but generally too buggy and laggy to be usable in most cases; anything newer is a no-go). It has the integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi I wanted as well as plenty of ports for wired accessories. And the Raspberry Pi is a super-popular lineup of enthusiast boards with tons of official and community support. The Pi has no built-in storage, so you’ll need a microSD card; if you opted for the kit linked above, it comes with a 16GB card, which ought to be good enough. If you want something with plenty of room for future library growth, you can't go too far wrong with a 32GB or 64GB Samsung Evo card for £10 or £20. Whatever card you buy, you don’t want to cheap out—even the best microSD cards don’t have stellar performance, and that’s definitely true when you’re using them as the primary storage drive on a computer rather than as a place to dump large photo or video files. The Wirecutter says that Samsung’s cards usually hang with or handily beat offerings from other companies, which is good enough for me. A pair of Buffalo Classic USB Gamepads for about £15 each. Indie reviewers say that these SNES-style gamepads feel almost exactly like the real thing, and they’ve got 5.5-foot cables that are considerably more generous than the Mini NES's 2.5-foot cables. I already have PS3 and PS4 controllers that will work wired and wirelessly, but in my opinion older 8- and 16-bit games just feel better with a lighter, simpler gamepad. The pad you use is really up to you; die-hard purists who don’t mind dongles can find USB adapters for their original gamepads if they need the feel of the genuine article. Most generic USB and Bluetooth pads are going to work fine, too. If you stick with the bundled 16GB microSD card rather than a more expensive 32 or 64GB option, that bill of materials comes to just £73, which is quite reasonable. Dropping to one gamepad (the Mini NES only comes with one, after all) gets you down to about £60. Many of these components are also common enough that you could save some money by just using things you already have lying around (and for our purposes I’m already assuming you don’t need an HDMI cable because it’s 2016 and we’re all lousy with HDMI cables; here’s a 3-foot one for £4 and a 6-foot one for £5 if you need). The build Further ReadingRaspberry Pi 3 has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, 64-bit chip, still just £30 Putting our little box together is ridiculously easy, and you ought to have no problem with it even if you’ve never opened up a PC tower in your life. The official Pi case splits into five separate pieces, all held together with retention tabs that pull away with firm pressure: the base, the top, the lid, and both sides/port covers. Completely disassemble the case by pulling off the sides and then pressing in on the arrow tabs so you can pull up the top. Then, take the Pi from its box and slide it into the base, making sure that the microSD slot lines up with its cutout on the front of the case. Don’t force the board into the case—if you’re having trouble, put the SD slot side of the Pi into the case at a 45 degree angle, and then lower the back end of the Pi into the case. Small plastic tabs should stick up out of the board’s back two mounting holes if you did it correctly. Then, snap the top and sides of the case back together, and you’re done! If you bought heatsinks, you can stick them to the chips on the top of the board at any point in this process, including after the Pi is already in the case. That’s the easy part. Software is more tricky, though not insurmountably so. Software setup The first thing you'll do when your RetroPie box boots is configure a gamepad. Andrew Cunningham The RetroPie settings screen. Most of these kick you into a text-driven screen that runs setup scripts. Andrew Cunningham Changing UI settings in the EmulationStation menu. Andrew Cunningham For the next parts of the process, you’ll need: A Mac, Windows, or Linux PC with an SD card slot for loading the Pi’s operating system. A USB keyboard or gamepad for setup, maintenance, and gameplay. Making retro game consoles is a fairly common use case for the Pi, so there are a few different operating system choices out there. Most of them involve running libretro and its emulators on top of the Raspbian operating system, and the most prominent also include the EmulationStation frontend. The best supported, most active of these options is RetroPie, which mixes all of these ingredients together into a package that’s relatively easy to use, visually appealing, and customisable. It also includes a huge number of emulators for both consoles and various personal computers, though, as I mentioned, nothing newer than the original PlayStation will run consistently well on the Pi 3’s hardware (the newer systems are confined to the x86 version of RetroPie, which looks and works basically the same but is built on top of Ubuntu and can run on more powerful and expensive hardware). The first thing you’ll need to do is drop a RetroPie boot image on your SD card. Since RetroPie is Linux-based and uses the ext4 filesystem, Windows PCs and Macs can’t natively interact with the card once you’ve reformatted it. The RetroPie download page is here. The imaging tool that the RetroPie developers recommend differs depending on your operating system—Win32DiskImager for Windows, Apple Pi Baker for macOS, and Unetbootin for Linux—but the basic process is the same. Decompress the .gz file you downloaded from the RetroPie site, open the tool, and select the .img file you just unzipped. Point the tool at your SD card—if the tool doesn’t see it, you may need to format it as a FAT32 disk first—and let it do its thing. Once the disk image has been copied to the SD card, pull it out and put it into the Pi, and then plug the Pi into the display with an HDMI cable, plug a controller or keyboard in, and then connect to power. The system ought to boot up and run through some first-time setup things (if the Pi’s red indicator light comes on but nothing else happens, the card may not be formatted correctly, and you should try again). If you did everything right, after a couple of minutes you'll see an EmulationStation prompt asking you to connect and configure a gamepad. Press down any button on your gamepad, and you’ll automatically be asked to map all the controller buttons. If you’re using the Buffalo gamepad I bought, it will ask you to map some buttons the gamepad doesn’t have; just hold down any other button on the gamepad to skip them, and then hold down any button again to enter the main EmulationStation UI. All you’ll see by default is an entry for RetroPie that gives you access to a bunch of settings—this is totally normal, and you’ll see entries for other systems pop up as you transfer ROMs to the Pi. You can navigate through many of these configuration menus with a gamepad, but heading into any of the RetroPie settings kicks you out of the slick EmulationStation frontend into a text-driven, more DOS-like tunnel of menus. If you need to enter text or even hit the Esc key to leave any of these menus, you’ll have to hook up a USB keyboard first. Here’s a short list of stuff to do before we dig into the fun part. From here on out I’ll assume you have both a keyboard and a gamepad to use. Assuming your HDMI cable is handling video and audio, go to the Audio settings in the RetroPie menu and select “HDMI” from the list of outputs. The default is “Auto,” but forcing HDMI can apparently solve some audio problems. If you’re not using wired Ethernet, go to “Wifi” in the RetroPie menu and connect to a Wi-Fi network. The Pi 3 natively supports 2.4GHz 802.11n, which isn’t great, but it’s fine for the price and good enough for our purposes. Once you’re on the Internet, access the command line by pressing F4 on your keyboard or by pressing Start on the gamepad, selecting Quit, and then quitting EmulationStation. Take note of your box’s IP address, which will be displayed along with other system information. Type passwd if you’d like to change the default account’s password for security purposes. The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry. Type sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade. The first command refreshes the list of available packages from the device’s repositories, while the second actually downloads and installs those updates. Go ahead and install all updates when prompted. Once it’s set up, our RetroPie box will be pretty appliance-like; you could disconnect it from your network and never worry about updating it again if you wanted. But new versions of both Raspbian and RetroPie are released periodically, and if you intend to keep the RetroPie box on your network permanently, you should at least install updates periodically. Type sudo shutdown –r now to reboot your box, which will bring it back into the EmulationStation UI. At this point you’ve got a basic RetroPie setup running, you’ve connected your box to your network and you know its IP address, and you’ve updated EmulationStation, its emulators, and the underlying Raspbian operating system to the latest versions. Now it’s time to load up some games.

McIntyre April 16, 2017 6:21 am EDT Print Email Tweet Source: courtesy of Target Corp.Among America’s eight most troubled large retailers, nearly one million jobs are at stake as the industry continues to collapse in on itself damaged by sales which have continued to dive, largest due to e-commerce. Not all of these jobs will be lost. However, as more and more companies in the industry go bankrupt and others slash tens of thousands of jobs, many of these positions are at extreme risk According to the Retail 100, the 20 largest retailers, excluding fast food, include eight walking wounded which are chains which have already shown loses, closed stores and laid off employees, or are already, in the case of Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD), potential Chapter 11 candidates. These are Target (NYSE: TGT) with 300,000 employees, Macy’s (NYSE: M) with 125,000, Sears with 120,000, J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) with  80,000, Kohl’s (NYSE: KSS) with  25,000, Gap (NYSE: GPS) 115,000, Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) with 125,000, and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) with  80,000. Together, they have 970,000 employees. These do not include jobs at retailers which are doing moderately well, for now. This includes Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST), both of which face the headwinds their weaker rivals do. Granted, a large number of people at these companies do not work at stores or in warehouse or logistical operations which serve these stores directly. Headquarters and administrative staff, do, however, rely almost completely on their store performance for ongoing employment. The extent to which any of these jobs are at risk depends on how deep the problems becomes, and some experts believe it will become extremely deep. According to CNBC: The retail industry’s pain is being felt by its massive workforce. Barely a quarter into 2017, year-to-date store closings have already topped the historical high of 2008, a Credit Suisse report said Thursday. About 2,880 stores have closed year to date, compared with 1,153 at the same time last year. Since 60 percent of store closures are typically announced in the first five months of the year, Credit Suisse estimates there could be more than 8,640 store closings this year. The impact of these closures — a mixture of shrinking store fleets and Chapter 11 filings — is already trickling into the industry’s nearly 16 million jobs. Almost 30,000 retail workers lost their jobs in March, and more than 60,000 jobs have been eliminated since January. Over 60,000 jobs lost in one quarter. And, the trend appears to be accelerating.

Reuters photo TOKYO — Naruhito Nogami, a 37-year-old systems engineer in Tokyo, drives to discount stores on weekends to bulk buy cheap groceries, even though he earns enough to make ends meet and the prospects for Japan’s economic recovery are brighter. “I do have money, but I’m frugal anyway. Everyone is like that. That’s just the way it is,” he says. Kazuko Sato, a 50-year-old animation artist, also frequents discount chain Daiso, where most items ranging from groceries and bath towels to kitchenware sell for just 100 yen. “I look for things here first, and if they aren’t here, then I go to the supermarket,” she says, cradling a basket in the stationery aisle. “My job and salary are unstable, so I need to be careful about my spending.” People like them have prompted some companies to embark on sweeping price cuts, showing how tough it will be to eradicate Japan’s deflationary malaise despite the improving economy. It also highlights a new paradox facing the Bank of Japan: a disparity between solid growth and stubbornly weak inflation. Top retailer Aeon Co is cutting prices for over 250 grocery items this month to lure cost-savvy shoppers, and Seiyu, operated by Wal-Mart Stores, cut prices on more than 200 products from February. “It’s unthinkable for us to raise prices at this stage,” Fast Retailing Co CEO Tadashi Yanai said after the owner of clothing brand Uniqlo reported flat revenue last Thursday. To be sure, many retailers say they are protecting their bottom line by offering not just discounts but high-end products. “It’s not just prices consumers are looking at. They are just being selective,” said Takaharu Iwasaki, president of supermarket chain operator Life Corp. But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War Two. “It’s a new conundrum for us,” one official said. “It just shows how sticky Japan’s deflationary mindset is.” Japan’s economy has sustained a modest recovery cycle that kicked off when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his “Abenomics” package of aggressive monetary, fiscal stimulus measures and structural reforms. A recent rebound in overseas demand has helped boost exports and output, pushing up business confidence to its highest in a year and a half, with companies upbeat on their spending plans. Encouraged by recent positive data, the BOJ is expected to offer a more upbeat view of the economy at this month’s rate review than it did last month, people familiar with the matter said. The benefits of the recovery have yet to reach households, though, despite four years of heavy money printing by the central bank and fiscal spending packages. Real wages have been largely flat despite job losses hitting a 22-year low, as firms remain wary of raising wages. Core consumer inflation remained stuck at 0.2% in February, well below the BOJ’s ambitious 2 percent target, as companies hold back on price rises for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households. Japan’s demographics are a key factor working against consumption. Nearly 30 percent of the population will be aged 65 or above in 2020, according to a government estimate. Living off pensions, elderly households are unaffected by any wage hikes and tend to withhold spending, analysts say. Miyako Minamizawa, a 65-year-old pensioner in Tokyo, says the recovery hasn’t changed her life. “I don’t feel like the economy is doing well,” she said, adding she is dipping into her savings because her pension isn’t enough to get by on. In the capital’s upmarket Ginza shopping district, 72-year-old Shimako Naito said: “I used to often impulse buy, on quite expensive clothes and jewelry, but now I take my time and try and buy when things are cheaper.” Inefficiencies in Japan’s highly-protected farm sector have kept fresh food prices high and volatile. A weak-yen trend also hurt households by pushing up the price of imported goods. Food prices rose 1.7% in 2016 from a year earlier, even though overall consumer prices fell 0.1%. Households used 26% of their income to buy food last year, the highest level in almost three decades, leaving them with little left to spend on non-necessities. Food products topped the list of items that households spent more on, a quarterly BOJ survey showed this month, while households cut spending most on eating out, clothing and travel. Roughly 80% of households who replied to the BOJ’s survey said they feel price rises are a bad thing, a sign the central bank has failed to convince the public of the benefits of putting a sustained end to growth-sapping deflation. Masayuki Yamamuro, 51, who works at a real estate firm, says he eats out less and is cutting down on spending because grocery shopping is becoming more expensive. “My salary hasn’t risen. I want to buy a car, own a house or go travelling. But I’m not able to do that.” (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

A weak-yen trend also hurt households by pushing up the price of imported goods. Lets not forget that Dear Leader Abe wanted the yen weaker so exports would sell. It's a double bladed sword he is playing with. Abe "urges" people to spend more, but imports are more expensive, and "buy" Japan costs too much, so what's an average consumer going to do? Hello Daiso! 8 Dango bongApr. 17, 2017 - 07:53AM JST you would be frugal as well if you had to pay $2 for an apple and $7 for a gallon of gas 8 Aly RustomApr. 17, 2017 - 08:14AM JST “My job and salary are unstable, so I need to be careful about my spending.” That right there is the crux of the problem. Isn't a third of the workforce on temp or part-time contracts? These people get no shakai hoken, their transportation isn't paid, they don't get a bonus, AND their jobs are unstable. But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War Two. “It’s a new conundrum for us,” one official said. “It just shows how sticky Japan’s deflationary mindset is.” Because you're idiots born with silver spoons in your mouths... 3 Fred WallaceApr. 17, 2017 - 08:24AM JST This again huh? Is logic really lost on these egg heads? If one earns less, they can't buy more if cost is too high. Naturally they'll be frugal. The constant expectation of the economy to improve while not improving actual lives is akin to one asking the sky for help when faced with an impending doom. It's hollow!! 5 marcelitoApr. 17, 2017 - 08:27AM JST Well said Aly. The reasons are obvious to everyone except the blue blood princes running the government and institutions such as BOJ. On second thoughts , they are probably well aware of the reasons too but won't publicly admit it as it would just point out their obvious policy failures. 8 samwattersApr. 17, 2017 - 08:52AM JST "Japan’s economy has sustained a modest recovery cycle that kicked off when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his “Abenomics” package of aggressive monetary, fiscal stimulus measures and structural reforms." Are you kidding me? Yes, Toyota and a few other companies got a boat-load of corporate welfare but few if any common have seen wages go up. Toyota workers had to bleed a kidney to get a few extra thousand yen a month--not a day but a month!. The fiscal manipulation only cannibalized future sales and created more debt. Not one--not one!---significant "structural reform" has been enacted. The Japanese government is as worthless as a snowblower in Okinawa. 3 fxgaiApr. 17, 2017 - 08:59AM JST the prospects for Japan’s economic recovery are brighter. Based on what? Relative to when? Things are better than after 3.11 I think, but the economy is no where near being in good shape. And there are no structural reforms coming down the pipe to suggest that this might change in future. “I do have money, but I’m frugal anyway. Everyone is like that. That’s just the way it is,” he says. And isn't it the same everywhere? You'd have to be living in a bubble economy waiting to burst to think otherwise. Kazuko Sato, a 50-year-old animation artist, also frequents discount chain Daiso, where “My job and salary are unstable, so I need to be careful about my spending.” A rational consumer, in any place in the world. The pension scam isn't going to be enough to retire on either so being careful is wise. The economy and economic growth is based on production and never ending drive to become more efficient. This is what drives the economy - not people blowing away their savings on crap they don't need or can buy for a more reasonable price. Japan has suffered from economic mismanagement for far too long - in the name of protecting people's lives. 5 sangetsu03Apr. 17, 2017 - 09:13AM JST and the prospects for Japan’s economic recovery are brighter. If prospects were indeed brighter, then there would be more consumption, spending, and higher wages. T But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War Two. Probably because there has been no recovery. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak. You cannot take a climb in the stock market financed by a combination of trillions of deficit spent yen, and the BOJ buying up shares of Japan Inc stocks with newly printed yen and call it a recovery. If anything, the prospects for a real recovery are further dimmed because the increased debts and devaluations which must be overcome before a real recovery can occur are that much the greater. Households used 26% of their income to buy food last year, the highest level in almost three decades, leaving them with little left to spend on non-necessities. And this is the result of Abe and the LDP buying the rural vote (rural voters get three votes per person) by charging sky-high tariffs on imported food, and heaving subsidizing agriculture. This is the their secret to staying in power nearly perpetually for the last 6 decades. And this is is also a result of a uncompetitive and hopelessly backward Japan Inc, who cannot earn a profit unless Abe and the LDP manipulate the yen to give them a trade advantage. The fact is that there is no recovery, and there has been none. And future prospects are dimmer now than they have ever been. And the evidence of all this is clear, the economy remains deflationary, and people are not spending. The population continues to decline, which means consumption, demand, wages, and growth must continue to decline. 8 DisillusionedApr. 17, 2017 - 09:20AM JST the prospects for Japan’s economic recovery are brighter. a disparity between solid growth and stubbornly weak inflation.

The benefits of the recovery have yet to reach households, though, despite four years of heavy money printing by the central bank and fiscal spending packages. Does anybody believe all this garbage? The economy has not improved at all! It's just as stagnant as it was when Abe introduced his 'three arrow Abenomics' plan. In fact, people are worse off than when he took office due to the tax increases. Abe's economic recovery plan is all 'smoke and mirrors'. He has only printed more money and gave tax cuts to corporations at the expense of the rest of the country. There has been no increase in child care, women in the workforce, workplace equality, increase in aged care, increase in salaries, not a flipping thing! He is a fraud! His next job should be performing his 'smoke and mirrors' act at a casino in Los Vegas! 6 MarkXApr. 17, 2017 - 09:20AM JST Don't forget that as of April 1st the amount of money paid to pensioners has been decreased, while the amount paid in by workers has increased, as well as the other tax that we pay for elderly care has also increased. So we increase taxes, cut people's pensions, leave wages stagnant and then sit and scratch our heads when people don't go out and spend more! And every few months the same story emerges and they keep wondering what the problem is. Then they blame deflation and say if we only had two percent inflation everything would be rosy! I still for the life of me cannot understand this mantra that the Abe gov't professes. -1 yokohamaridesApr. 17, 2017 - 09:27AM JST "Naruhito Nogami, a 37-year-old systems engineer in Tokyo, drives to discount stores on weekends to bulk buy cheap groceries."

Excellent post sangetsu. agree with your assessment 2 cjapanApr. 17, 2017 - 10:19AM JST “It’s unthinkable for us to raise prices at this stage,” Fast Retailing Co CEO Tadashi Yanai said after the owner of clothing brand Uniqlo reported flat revenue last Thursday. * Yeah keep the same prices but the make the item smaller or not have as many as previously before. I am a big sweets eater here and everything has been downsized to keep the price. I noticed items started change a few years ago. Items started to have fewer cookies 1 or 2) in the package, and/or the size of the cookie got smaller. Then I noticed the chocolate got thinner and smaller. Consumers don't want to pay more so they have to cut some place. Same with Japanese clothing makers like Uniqlo, they have to compete with likes of H &M and Forever 21 (cheap garbage) so quality goes down and can't compete. I used to buy a lot from Uniqlo but lately all I have seen is junk there. 2 fxgaiApr. 17, 2017 - 10:52AM JST It also highlights a new paradox facing the Bank of Japan: a disparity between solid growth and stubbornly weak inflation. No disparity. There is no solid growth. And who cares if "inflation" is weak. Normal people like it that the value of their money is stable, as the 80% of households noted in the article recognize despite what the central planners say. But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War Two. It's easy to explain. It's a pathetic recovery, albeit a long one - it's not like Japan is growing at 4% real GDP is it. Wages are low because of this lack luster economic growth, rigid labour market laws, and Japanese culture (prefering jobs for life rather than jobs for good pay). Now give me 20 million yen a year and I'll go school those central bank policy makers. Japan’s economy has sustained a modest recovery cycle that kicked off when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his “Abenomics” package of aggressive monetary, fiscal stimulus measures and structural reforms. He never launched the structural reforms, he just talked and talked about it until people stopped believing him. And then he started giving pensioners 30,000 yen handouts and launched new arrows of Abenomics to deflect attention away from his failings. The benefits of the recovery have yet to reach households, though, despite four years of heavy money printing by the central bank and fiscal spending packages. That's because those policies by themselves don't work, the structural reforms are required. Households used 26% of their income to buy food last year, the highest level in almost three decades, leaving them with little left to spend on non-necessities. It's ridiculous. Japan should deregulate the food business in Japan and allow imports galore. Prices would come down for food consumers - everyone. There would be great benefits as a result, the only losers being the protected vested interests who suddenly have to compete in the global marketplace. But Japan as a whole would win, as would the overseas producers. None of this is hard to do, except for politicians. We need to drain the Nagatacho and Kasumigaseki swamps. 2 kiboushaApr. 17, 2017 - 11:42AM JST Abe, you want economic growth ? Give people hope and dreams for the future! Going around undoing peaceful constitution, enacting conspiracy law, encouraging love of nation, don't really inspire dreams and hope for the future. 2 inkochiApr. 17, 2017 - 11:45AM JST Though the freeway costs a bit, a trip from Kochi to Kansai or even just Tokushima takes us to places where things are just cheaper, and the upbeat feel of that is worth it. Kochi has been at the butt-end of the economy for years. Regional variation is a good example of how generalizations are not the best ways to judge. Not just Kochi - think also Eastern Tohoku. In fact, if my income went up instead of down as it seems to have done so in the new year spending some money might my wife might not bite my head off when I come home with 39 yen moyashi instead of 29 yen moyashi . We're not that badly off compared to many around us, but it is not getting better. The psychology of it all is actually pretty significant. 2 Andrew CrispApr. 17, 2017 - 11:59AM JST Decades after the great Japanese property crash the locals have certainly learnt how to live a minimalist life 1 ThunderbirdApr. 17, 2017 - 12:07PM JST I support Book Off, Jumble Store and Second Street almost every week with my hard earned pittance. Oh, and Yahoo Auction is a daily must. 1 JeffLeeApr. 17, 2017 - 12:10PM JST If you cut workers wages and bonuses for nearly 20 years, what kind of consumer mindset did you expect to create? Duh! "But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War Two." I've been explaining this for a while now: The shift toward shareholder capitalism encourages companies to maximize profits while minimizing labor costs. Japanese companies are enjoying their highest profits in history, yet wage hikes have been scant. Again, what else did these eggheads expect from such a policy? -1 fxgaiApr. 17, 2017 - 12:46PM JST Japanese companies are enjoying their highest profits in history Tell it to the Toshiba shareholders. Japanese businesses by and large are old and stale and they aren't doing anything other than just ticking over. Toyota and a few other big exceptions are not the rule. Japan needs a revamp, public and private sector, and the populace won't feel happy until it has finally happened. The leadership hasn't got the guts to what is needed. Too worried about the next election always. The big pitfall of democracy... 0 Gaijin DesiApr. 17, 2017 - 12:55PM JST Lonely peoples think this way... Peoples are jealous of other's happiness... Peoples are not supporting peoples. Family members are meeting like strangers... 0 tmarieApr. 17, 2017 - 01:22PM JST I used to buy a lot from Uniqlo but lately all I have seen is junk there. I used to buy from there as well but yep, the quality has dropped and the price increased. I mean really, they now sell cashmere and dry clean only clothes these days. They expanded too quickly abroad and cut corners and forgot what they started as. Japan needs to start paying living wages to contract workers. Until that happens, people will continue to hold onto their yen. And having a country that saves isn't a bad thing. When things really bottom out, people will at least have saving and won't need as much welfare as some in other countries. Good old Abenomics was ALWAYS the emperor has no clothes on. The foreigners here knew that from the beginning. Voters on the other hand... I have a hard time feeling sorry for locals when they expect so little from their government and leaders and continue to let these monkeys run the show. 0 hamptonApr. 17, 2017 - 01:30PM JST Oh dear. The news now simple announces that we have had 4 years of recovery due to Abe and his ridiculous Abenomics nonsense, despite all evidence to the contrary. -1 Aly RustomApr. 17, 2017 - 01:36PM JST Japan needs to start paying living wages to contract workers. Exactly. People don't have enough money to LIVE and the LDP and BOJ Punks are complaining? How stupid can you be? If you don't have money, you are not going to be able to spend money. I don't know what part of that is difficult to understand... Until that happens, people will continue to hold onto their yen If they can do that. Many people I know can't afford a night out for drinking. Many people are living on 200,000 a month. How do you do that? How do you raise a family? Good old Abenomics was ALWAYS the emperor has no clothes on. The foreigners here knew that from the beginning. Spot on Marie! I actually remember telling that to my Japanese friends. NONE of them were having it. They thought Abe was the bee's knees... I tried to tell them. Voters on the other hand... I have a hard time feeling sorry for locals when they expect so little from their government and leaders and continue to let these monkeys run the show. EXACTLY. you reap what you sow. This is why the LDP is so against foreigners voting. Because they would never hold office ever again. If the Japanese populace don't get off their butts and vote the LDP out, this will go on and on. And Japan will collapse. The population needs to get more political and there needs to be more discourse. This is the future of Japan and its children they are neglecting here. -1 fxgaiApr. 17, 2017 - 01:37PM JST Japan needs to start paying living wages to contract workers. Where does that money come from? Is it good enough to have the Bank of Japan just print some more money off? Or should the government borrow from future generations to come up with the money? Or should businesses charge more from their customers to pay? Or should business owners take the pay cut and pass it on to the people and businesses from which they consume products and services? And should those businesses pass the pay cut on to their workers? I don't see anyone volunteering to take a pay cut for this. Don't get me wrong - I do want people to be paid more money. But I think in order to be able to pay more, the economy must produce more first. having a country that saves isn't a bad thing. That's dead right. A country that doesn't save has to rely on foreigners to provide monies for investment in new businesses. Thankfully Japan has lots of savings, but it's a sad state of affairs that Japanese savers invest so much abroad because there is scant attractive venture to invest in at home (which is why the local economy isn't producing more, and people aren't paid more). Structural reforms and cultural changes could see this change, but the vested interests want their lives protected. 1 YubaruApr. 17, 2017 - 01:47PM JST Amateur!

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah About Utah: He's in it for the real long — and safe — haul By Lee BensonDeseret News Published: April 16, 2017 3:20 p.m. Updated: 53 minutes ago 3 Comments View 3 Items Lee Benson After 51 years and 7 million accident-free miles, Steve Webb's den is full of trucks and truck-driving awards. HEBER CITY — Since Utah Truck Driver of the Year Steve Webb has driven 7 million miles without causing an accident, and since I’m thinking it's safe to assume none of the rest of us can make such a claim, the first question to him is obvious: How in the world ? His answer is just as obvious: “Plan ahead.” When you’re out there on the highway, “always drive ahead of yourself,” Steve says in a tone as matter of fact as using your turn signal and turning on your lights at night. “Don’t drive from your steering wheel to the end of your hood. Look down the road, pay attention to what’s out there. If you see brake lights up ahead on the next hill, slow down. A mile away and more, that’s how I drive.” He’s been doing it for 51 years, ever since his father put him behind the wheel of a Kenworth and sent him from Heber City to Nampa, Idaho, to pick up a load of lambs and deliver them to Los Angeles. Steve was 16. He stood 4-foot-10 and weighed about a hundred pounds. But by this time he’d driven his dad’s trucks — Blaine Webb and his brother, George, owned and operated Webb Bros. Trucking — around the yard and way out in the desert when nobody was watching plenty of times. He’d learned how to work both of the gearshifts, the main and the auxiliary, and often at the same time, back when there was no such thing as an automatic transition. When Steve questioned why his dad was sending him instead of a more seasoned driver, Blaine Webb answered: “You drive as good as they do.” And Steve did have his driver's license. So off he went, all the way to Vernon Avenue in L.A., where he dropped off the lambs without mishap and then literally trucked it all the way home to Heber City, thus starting a driving career that has averaged 140,000 miles a year for over half a century, taken him through 49 of the 50 states (Hawaii being the exception) and earned him, at the Utah Trucking Association's awards banquet last fall, the title of the state’s greatest driver. If it can be hauled, he’s hauled it. Gas, lumber, steel, sheep, cattle, rodeo stock, beer, produce, explosives, cars and trucks, cabinets, even a load of buffalo one time. For the past 17 years he’s driven exclusively for Wal-Mart, delivering pretty much everything it sells in its stores, which amounts to pretty much everything. Lay out his miles end to end and he’s lapped the Earth at the equator 280 times. He’s driven the equivalent of 3,500 trips from Utah to New York. He couldn’t begin to tell you how many books on tape he’s listened to. All that driving, and he’s never been at fault in an accident. He did total a semi once, not long after he started working for Wal-Mart. He was in Montana, in a snowstorm, and a little Pontiac Fiero passed his truck and then started spinning doughnuts in front of him. Steve had a choice: either run into the Fiero or veer over to the guard rail. He chose the guard rail and slid down it like a skateboarder. Fortunately, he rolled to a stop before falling into the chasm beyond. He walked away without a scratch, as did the two people in the Fiero, who otherwise would probably have been killed. Over the span of 51 years he’s seen plenty of truck evolution: from no phones to CB radios to cellphones; from AM to FM to satellite radio; from Dave Dudley to Garth Brooks to Alan Jackson; from manual transmissions to 10- to 18-speed automatics; from no air conditioning and sometimes no heat and over-the-cab sleeper bunks to better climate control than a mall and behind-the-cab sleepers that look like a room at Residence Inn with running water, toilet, microwave, full-size bed and big-screen TV. And yet, for all that, he waxes nostalgic about the old days, back to times when it was easier going, not so many rules and regulations, more camaraderie and A LOT better food at the truck stops. “It’s no restaurants anymore; it’s all fast food,” he laments. A Subway next to a KFC next to a Pizza Hut next to a McDonald’s. But now, as then, the life suits him. The solitude, the loneliness of the highway have never bothered him, he says. He enjoys his own company, and on occasion he’ll bring his wife, Sharon, along for the ride. He takes pride in the fact he’s never been late in 51 years. It’s all part of the Plan Ahead strategy. “I like to be where I’m going an hour ahead of time,” he says. “My dad taught me that. If you’re early you never have to rush.” 3 comments on this story At 68, he has no intention of backing off. He has great support — singling out his wife, his safety manager Brad Clayton and transportation manager Kevin Huggins at Wal-Mart — and wherever it is that great truckers go after they take the final exit, his dad Blaine. “I owe him all the credit and then some,” says Utah’s Trucker of the Year. “As far as I’m concerned, I learned from the best.” Lee Benson's About Utah column runs Mondays.

Major importers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Target Corp. see Lázaro Cárdenas as a key link between Asia’s factories and Mexico’s growing middle class. They also hope to use the port as a backdoor to the U.S., bypassing congested West Coast ports via the “Nafta Railway,” a network of track operated by U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern that can shuttle goods as far north as Memphis. APM Terminals, a unit of the world’s biggest shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, spent five years and $568 million on the new terminal. APM hopes to spend up to $900 million to expand capacity at the terminal to rival the Port of New York and New Jersey by the end of the next decade. But what looked like a sure bet five years ago is less certain today. President Trump has threatened to penalize manufacturers that move operations to Mexico and wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Republicans in Congress have floated a “border-adjusted tax” that would raise the cost of imports. Any of these measures could deal a blow to U.S.-Mexico trade, shipping companies and analysts say. Mexico’s imports have grown more than 30% since 2010, according to the World Bank, and container volumes are up 60% in the past three years at Lázaro Cárdenas’ older facilities, according to trade data firm Panjiva. Auto parts make up a big part of those gains. “The port is a microcosm of global trade flows,” said Christopher Rogers, a research analyst with Panjiva. He added: “it’s very exposed to the auto industry.” Danish conglomerate Maersk, which once touted the new terminal’s “near-sourcing benefits,” a reference to manufacturers producing goods in Mexico and selling them in the U.S., now says it is focusing more on using the port to import goods for Mexico’s consumer market. In an interview this month, Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou said “the main purpose of the terminal is to be a gateway terminal for the Mexico City market,” with cross-border trade secondary. “The U.S. administration has made a number of statements that impact our business on the positive side,” Mr. Skou said. “Then there are the discussions about trade deals, and some of the rhetoric seems more protectionist…It’s really hard for us to judge how this will affect our business.” APM’s terminal unloaded its first ship in February, and the port formally opened with a ceremony in early April attended by Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto and Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Mexico’s government sees developing the port as a priority. In 2013, amid rising drug cartel violence and illegal smuggling, Mr. Peña Nieto deployed thousands of troops to the port and handed over its security to the navy, which still maintains a garrison there. At the ceremony earlier this month, he called the terminal “a testimony to how Mexico has been growing, how it has become a trustworthy destination...that is crucial for the transit of goods bound for the important consumer market that is Mexico, and from here to other important consumer markets.” However, in recent months, Mexico’s president has also said the country will pursue trade deals with Vietnam and Japan and work more closely with China. “Mexico’s path forward is to participate more in world trade, not just to trade with North America,” said Walter Kemmsies, an economist who specializes in ports and shipping. “The investment at Lázaro Cárdenas makes sense, because it’s a gateway to trade with Asia.” On a stiflingly hot morning in late March, giant cranes lifted hundreds of metal boxes from the container ship Charlotte Maersk amid the soft hum of robotic machinery. The new terminal features towering 300-foot-tall ship-to-shore cranes that can span the largest container ships currently plying routes between Asia to North America. The cranes can pluck two containers at a time from ships, then deposit them in piles. Robotic stacking cranes that run on electricity—rather than the usual diesel—use artificial intelligence to arrange the piles in the most time- and cost-efficient order. Such semi-automated systems are common at port terminals in the Netherlands and Singapore, but have never been used in Latin America. The facility is expected to employ about 550 people—or 250 fewer than a similar-size terminal without automation—which makes for fewer accidents and lowers container handling costs by 20%, APM says. “I’ve never seen a terminal this technologically advanced,” said Miguel Ángel Dominguez, a supervisor for cargo operations at the terminal. “It’s much safer, much more dynamic, much more mechanized.” Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Apr 17, 2017 - Page 15　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp ANALYSIS: Frugal Japanese offer no respite for BOJ, retailers Reuters, TOKYO A woman looks at clothes at a Uniqlo store, operated by Fast Retailing Co, in Tokyo’s Ginza District on Tuesday. Photo: Bloomberg Naruhito Nogami, a 37-year-old systems engineer in Tokyo, drives to discount stores on weekends to bulk buy cheap groceries, even though he earns enough to make ends meet and the prospects for Japan’s economic recovery are brighter. “I do have money, but I’m frugal anyway. Everyone is like that. That’s just the way it is,” he said. Kazuko Sato, a 50-year-old animation artist, also frequents discount chain Daiso, where most items ranging from groceries and bath towels to kitchenware sell for just ￥100 (US$0.92). “I look for things here first and if they aren’t here then I go to the supermarket,” she says, cradling a basket in the stationery aisle. “My job and salary are unstable, so I need to be careful about my spending.” People like them have prompted some companies to embark on sweeping price cuts, showing how tough it will be to eradicate Japan’s deflationary malaise despite the improving economy. It also highlights a new paradox facing the Bank of Japan (BOJ): A disparity between solid growth and stubbornly weak inflation. Top retailer Aeon Co is cutting prices for more than 250 grocery items this month to lure cost-savvy shoppers and Seiyu, operated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc, cut prices on more than 200 products from February. “It’s unthinkable for us to raise prices at this stage,” Fast Retailing Co chief executive officer Tadashi Yanai said after the owner of clothing brand Uniqlo reported flat revenue on Thursday. To be sure, many retailers say they are protecting their bottom line by offering not just discounts, but high-end products. “It’s not just prices consumers are looking at. They are just being selective,” supermarket chain operator Life Corp president Takaharu Iwasaki said. However, central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as Japan’s economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War II. “It’s a new conundrum for us,” one official said. “It just shows how sticky Japan’s deflationary mindset is.” Japan’s economy has sustained a modest recovery cycle that started when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his “Abenomics” package of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, and structural reforms. A rebound in overseas demand has helped boost exports and output, pushing up business confidence to its highest in a year-and-a-half, with companies upbeat on their spending plans. Encouraged by the positive data, the BOJ is expected to offer a more upbeat view of the economy at this month’s rate review than it did last month, people familiar with the matter said. The benefits of the recovery have yet to reach households, though, despite four years of heavy money printing by the central bank and fiscal spending packages. Real wages have been largely flat, despite job losses hitting a 22-year low, as firms remain wary of raising wages. Core consumer inflation remained stuck at 0.2 percent in February, well below the BOJ’s ambitious 2 percent target, as companies hold back on price rises for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households. Japan’s demographics are a key factor working against consumption. Nearly 30 percent of the population will be aged 65 or above in 2020, according to a government estimate. Living off pensions, elderly households are unaffected by any wage hikes and tend to withhold spending, analysts say. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1883 times. Comments will be moderated.

With it has come a surging sense of disenfranchisement that has fueled alienation and anger, and even bred nationalism and xenophobia. As people struggle to hold on to their shrinking share of the pie, their anxiety has created a political opening for opportunistic populists, shaking the world order in the process. The gap between rich and poor nowadays is mind-boggling. Oxfam has observed that the world’s eight richest people now own as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion. As US Sen. Bernie Sanders recently pointed out that the Walton family, which owns Walmart, now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of the US population. I can offer my own jarring comparison. Using Credit Suisse’s wealth database, I found that the total wealth of the world’s three richest people exceeds that of all the people in three countries—Angola, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of Congo—which together have a population of 122 million. ADVERTISEMENT To be sure, great progress on reducing extreme poverty—defined as consumption of less than $1.90 per day—has been achieved in recent decades. In 1981, 42 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. By 2013—the last year for which we have comprehensive data—that share had dropped to below 11 percent. Piecemeal evidence suggests that extreme poverty now stands just above 9 percent. That is certainly something to celebrate. But our work is far from finished. And, contrary to popular belief, that work must not be confined to the developing world. As Angus Deaton recently pointed out, extreme poverty remains a serious problem in rich countries, too: “Several million Americans—black, white, and Hispanic—now live in households with per capita income of less than $2 per day.” Given the much higher cost of living (including shelter), he noted, such an income can pose an even greater challenge than it does in, say, India. This trend has coincided with a steep rise in the price of housing: over the last decade, rents have been rising more than three times as fast as wages. Ironically, the wealthy pay less, per unit, for many goods and services. A stark example is flying. Thanks to frequent flier programs, wealthy travelers pay less for each mile they fly. While this makes sense for airlines, which want to foster loyalty among frequent fliers, it represents yet another way in which wealth is rewarded in the marketplace. The better-off also get a whole host of goods for free. One seemingly trivial example: Often, pens simply appear on my desk, unintentionally left behind by people who stopped by my office. They vanish just as often, as people inadvertently pick them up. A nontrivial example is taxation. Rather than paying the most in taxes, the wealthiest people are often able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are not available to those earning less. Without having to break any rules, the wealthy receive what amounts to subsidies. Beyond these concrete inequities, there are less obvious—but equally damaging—imbalances. For example, wealthy citizens can not only vote; they can influence elections through donations and other means. In this sense, excessive wealth inequality can undermine democracy. ADVERTISEMENT Nowadays, disparities of income and wealth have become so extreme and entrenched that they cross generations, with family wealth and inheritance having a far greater impact on one’s economic prospects than talent and hard work. And it works both ways: just as children from wealthy families are significantly more likely to be wealthy in adulthood, children of, say, former child laborers are more likely to work during their childhood. None of this is any individual’s fault. Many wealthy citizens have contributed to society and played by the rules. The problem is, the rules are often skewed in their favor. In other words, income inequality stems from systemic flaws. In our globalized world, inequality cannot be left to markets and local communities to solve any more than climate change can. As the consequences of rising domestic inequality feed through to geopolitics, eroding stability, the need to devise new rules, re-distribution systems, and even global agreements is no longer a matter of morals; increasingly, it is a matter of survival. –Project Syndicate * * * Kaushik Basu is a former chief economist of the World Bank.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) was $422.1 billion and the company was the fourth-largest U.S.-listed firm. The third-largest company by market cap was Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) with a valuation of $501.9 billion. In a note to investors last week, Needham analyst Kerry Rice upgraded Amazon’s shares from Hold to Buy and set a price target of $1,100 on the stock. Amazon’s 52-week high is $923.72, a peak reached on April 5. Based on Friday’s closing price of $884.67, Amazon’s stock would need to appreciate by 24% in order to reach $1,100. With its current 478 million shares outstanding, Amazon’s market cap would reach nearly $526 billion at $1,100 per share. Microsoft’s market cap would need to rise more than 5% to stay ahead of Amazon’s. Both companies posted double-digit share price increases in the past 12 months, but Amazon’s increase of nearly 49% was more than double the nearly 20% increase in Microsoft’s stock price. Share price growth at both companies has slowed in 2017: Amazon’s stock is up about 18% for the year to date while Microsoft’s stock trades up about 4.5%. Needham’s Rice is cited at CNBC: “We believe Amazon’s established dominance in U.S. is sustainable with Prime, mobile penetration and third-party growth.” Rice expects Amazon to add 16% to its retail market share over the next five years, which would mean that the online behemoth would hold about 50% of all U.S. retail market share. From less than 20% of U.S. retail share in 2011 to 50% by 2021 — it’s no wonder that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is pouring enormous investment into its own e-commerce business. Wal-Mart claims about a 5% share of the e-commerce marketplace, in third place behind eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) with an estimated share of 7.7%. If Amazon stock continues to rise at its year-to-date rate of 18% and Microsoft shares remain flat, Amazon’s market cap will catch up to Microsoft’s sooner rather than later. Amazon’s shares closed at $884.67 on Friday, down about 1.3% for the day in a 52-week range of $599.20 to $923.72. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $969.74.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 16, 2017 2:46 pm UTC reader comments 212 Share this story Our custom RetroPie gaming box and a decent replica of the SNES gamepad. Andrew Cunningham The Raspberry Pi 3: the heart of our little box. Andrew Cunningham The Pi 3 is a good fit for two reasons: its relatively generous quad-core Cortex A53 CPU and its plentiful I/O. Andrew Cunningham HDMI for audio and video and micro USB for power. Andrew Cunningham The "official" Raspberry Pi case won't win awards for aesthetics, but it's simple to assemble and disassemble.

Andrew Cunningham Last November, Nintendo surprised everyone by going back to its roots and releasing the NES Classic. The delightful emulator/nostalgia-fest sparked unanticipated demand, including near-instant supply issues and 200-percent-plus markups in secondary markets. So in December of 2016, we decided to build our own version instead. Since Nintendo bizarrely announced that it won't be making any more of the hard-to-find mini consoles this week, we're re-running this piece to help those of you with a DIY streak once again build your own. Hardware recommendations have been updated to reflect current availability and pricing for April 2017. Further ReadingHands-on: NES Classic Edition puts old games in a very small package Against my better judgment, I’ve tried a couple of times to snag one of those adorable little $60 mini NES Classic Editions—once when Amazon put some of its limited stock online and crashed its own site, and once when Walmart was shipping out small quantities every day a couple of weeks ago. In both cases, I failed. But the dumb itch of nostalgia can’t always be scratched by logical thoughts like “do you really need to pay money for Super Mario Bros. 3 again,” and “Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest is probably the weakest of the three NES Castlevania games.” Since it’s not entirely clear if or when those little mini NESes will become readily available, I decided to funnel that small wad of expendable cash and the desire for some nostalgia-fueled gaming into a DIY project. It turns out that the NES Classic Edition is just a little Linux-powered board inside a cute case, and it’s totally possible to build your own tiny Linux-powered computer inside a cute case without spending much more than $60. And by using the Raspberry Pi and freely available software, you can build something capable of doing a whole heck of a lot more than playing the same 30 NES games over and over again. Setting goals I find it helpful when pursuing a new DIY project to start with a list of needs and wants and go from there—possibly a leftover from my IT days helping the non-technically inclined (and actively technology-averse) make purchasing decisions. With my homebrew NES Classic, I wanted to: Spend something close to the same $60 that the NES Classic Edition costs, though I would be OK as long as the bill of materials came in under $100 (because that’s roughly as many Amazon points as I have to dedicate to this project). Make something similar in size to the NES Classic Edition. Make something powerful enough to easily emulate 8- and 16-bit consoles—anything above and beyond that would be great, too, but for these prices you won’t be emulating many games released after the end of the '90s. Include integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for wireless controllers and easy network/Internet connectivity, respectively. Build something that, once fully configured, would provide a relatively easy-to-use and attractive console-like UI. With all that in mind, these are the components I settled on (prices and components updated on 4/14/2017): For the heart of the system, I chose the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, available for $42 from Amazon with a 5V 2.5A micro USB power adapter and little heatsinks (if you already have the minimum recommended 5V 2.0A micro USB adapter, the board itself can be had for around $38). This thing ticks a lot of boxes—it’s relatively cheap and relatively powerful, and it can easily handle anything from the original PlayStation on down (Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast emulation is offered but generally too buggy and laggy to be usable in most cases; anything newer is a no-go). It has the integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi I wanted as well as plenty of ports for wired accessories. And the Raspberry Pi is a super-popular lineup of enthusiast boards with tons of official and community support. The Pi has no built-in storage, so you’ll need a microSD card; you've got a lot of choices here, but both the 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Ultra cards (available for $13 and $22, respectively) are solid, affordable options. These are all overkill capacity-wise, but I want to leave plenty of room for future library growth. Whatever card you buy, you don’t want to cheap out—even the best microSD cards don’t have stellar performance, and that’s definitely true when you’re using them as the primary storage drive on a computer rather than as a place to dump large photo or video files. The Wirecutter also says that Samsung’s cards usually hang with or handily beat offerings from other companies, if you want to try something faster. The official Raspberry Pi 3 case, available for around $8. There are lots and lots of different Pi cases available, from cheap, creaky plastic numbers to sleeker aluminum versions to specialty cases with active cooling systems. I went ahead with the official model because it was cheap, it’s unobtrusive, and it can be completely taken apart and reassembled without tools. A pair of Buffalo Classic USB Gamepads, which were available for about $13 when we originally published this but currently running about $26 each. Indie reviewers say that these SNES-style gamepads feel almost exactly like the real thing, and they’ve got 5.5-foot cables that are considerably more generous than the NES Classic Edition’s 2.5-foot cables. I already have PS3 and PS4 controllers that will work wired and wirelessly, but in my opinion older 8- and 16-bit games just feel better with a lighter, simpler gamepad. The pad you use is really up to you; die-hard purists who don’t mind dongles can find USB adapters for their original gamepads if they need the feel of the genuine article. Most generic USB and Bluetooth pads are going to work fine, too. If you like the feel of an old-school gamepad mixed with the convenience of wireless controllers, 8bitdo makes a fantastic Bluetooth SNES pad available for about $35; it's worth it, given that you can use them as wired controllers with micro USB cables and since the price on the wired models has gone up so much in the last few months. You can get them with both SNES-style purple buttons and Super Famicom-style multicolor buttons, depending on which you prefer. With the 32GB microSD card and one controller, that bill of materials comes to around $89, which is near the top of my price range but still fairly reasonable for what you get. Many of these components are also common enough that you could save some money by just using things you already have lying around (and for our purposes I’m already assuming you don’t need an HDMI cable because it’s 2017 and we’re all lousy with HDMI cables; here’s a 3-foot one for $5 and a 6-foot one for $7 if you need). The build Further ReadingRaspberry Pi 3 has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, 64-bit chip, still just $35 Putting our little box together is ridiculously easy, and you ought to have no problem with it even if you’ve never opened up a PC tower in your life. The official Pi case splits into five separate pieces, all held together with retention tabs that pull away with firm pressure: the base, the top, the lid, and both sides/port covers. Completely disassemble the case by pulling off the sides and then pressing in on the arrow tabs so you can pull up the top. Then, take the Pi from its box and slide it into the base, making sure that the microSD slot lines up with its cutout on the front of the case. Don’t force the board into the case—if you’re having trouble, put the SD slot side of the Pi into the case at a 45 degree angle, and then lower the back end of the Pi into the case. Small plastic tabs should stick up out of the board’s back two mounting holes if you did it correctly. Then, snap the top and sides of the case back together, and you’re done! If you bought heatsinks, you can stick them to the chips on the top of the board at any point in this process, including after the Pi is already in the case. That’s the easy part. Software is more tricky, though not insurmountably so. Software setup The first thing you'll do when your RetroPie box boots is configure a gamepad. Andrew Cunningham The RetroPie settings screen. Most of these kick you into a text-driven screen that runs setup scripts. Andrew Cunningham Changing UI settings in the EmulationStation menu. Andrew Cunningham For the next parts of the process, you’ll need: A Mac, Windows, or Linux PC with an SD card slot for loading the Pi’s operating system. A USB keyboard or gamepad for setup, maintenance, and gameplay. Making retro game consoles is a fairly common use case for the Pi, so there are a few different operating system choices out there. Most of them involve running libretro and its emulators on top of the Raspbian operating system, and the most prominent also include the EmulationStation frontend. The best supported, most active of these options is RetroPie, which mixes all of these ingredients together into a package that’s relatively easy to use, visually appealing, and customizable. It also includes a huge number of emulators for both consoles and various personal computers, though, as I mentioned, nothing newer than the original PlayStation will run consistently well on the Pi 3’s hardware (the newer systems are confined to the x86 version of RetroPie, which looks and works basically the same but is built on top of Ubuntu and can run on more powerful and expensive hardware). The first thing you’ll need to do is drop a RetroPie boot image on your SD card. Since RetroPie is Linux-based and uses the ext4 filesystem, Windows PCs and Macs can’t natively interact with the card once you’ve reformatted it. The RetroPie download page is here. The imaging tool that the RetroPie developers recommend differs depending on your operating system—Win32DiskImager for Windows, Apple Pi Baker for macOS, and Unetbootin for Linux—but the basic process is the same. Decompress the .gz file you downloaded from the RetroPie site, open the tool, and select the .img file you just unzipped. Point the tool at your SD card—if the tool doesn’t see it, you may need to format it as a FAT32 disk first—and let it do its thing. Once the disk image has been copied to the SD card, pull it out and put it into the Pi, and then plug the Pi into the display with an HDMI cable, plug a controller or keyboard in, and then connect to power. The system ought to boot up and run through some first-time setup things (if the Pi’s red indicator light comes on but nothing else happens, the card may not be formatted correctly, and you should try again). If you did everything right, after a couple of minutes you'll see an EmulationStation prompt asking you to connect and configure a gamepad. Press down any button on your gamepad, and you’ll automatically be asked to map all the controller buttons. If you’re using the Buffalo gamepad I bought, it will ask you to map some buttons the gamepad doesn’t have; just hold down any other button on the gamepad to skip them, and then hold down any button again to enter the main EmulationStation UI. All you’ll see by default is an entry for RetroPie that gives you access to a bunch of settings—this is totally normal, and you’ll see entries for other systems pop up as you transfer ROMs to the Pi. You can navigate through many of these configuration menus with a gamepad, but heading into any of the RetroPie settings kicks you out of the slick EmulationStation frontend into a text-driven, more DOS-like tunnel of menus. If you need to enter text or even hit the Esc key to leave any of these menus, you’ll have to hook up a USB keyboard first. Here’s a short list of stuff to do before we dig into the fun part. From here on out I’ll assume you have both a keyboard and a gamepad to use. Assuming your HDMI cable is handling video and audio, go to the Audio settings in the RetroPie menu and select “HDMI” from the list of outputs. The default is “Auto,” but forcing HDMI can apparently solve some audio problems. If you’re not using wired Ethernet, go to “Wifi” in the RetroPie menu and connect to a Wi-Fi network. The Pi 3 natively supports 2.4GHz 802.11n, which isn’t great, but it’s fine for the price and good enough for our purposes. Once you’re on the Internet, access the command line by pressing F4 on your keyboard or by pressing Start on the gamepad, selecting Quit, and then quitting EmulationStation. Take note of your box’s IP address, which will be displayed along with other system information. Type passwd if you’d like to change the default account’s password for security purposes. The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry. Type sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade. The first command refreshes the list of available packages from the device’s repositories, while the second actually downloads and installs those updates. Go ahead and install all updates when prompted. Once it’s set up, our RetroPie box will be pretty appliance-like; you could disconnect it from your network and never worry about updating it again if you wanted. But new versions of both Raspbian and RetroPie are released periodically, and if you intend to keep the RetroPie box on your network permanently, you should at least install updates periodically. Type sudo shutdown –r now to reboot your box, which will bring it back into the EmulationStation UI. At this point you’ve got a basic RetroPie setup running, you’ve connected your box to your network and you know its IP address, and you’ve updated EmulationStation, its emulators, and the underlying Raspbian operating system to the latest versions. Now it’s time to load up some games.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations News Markeith Loyd News Terry Lenamon, Markeith Loyd's hand-picked attorney: A staunch opponent of the death penalty Markeith Loyd wants Miami lawyer with track record for beating the death penalty Markeith Loyd has asked a judget to appoint for him Terry Lenamon, a Miami lawyer who's handled 14 death penalty cases. Markeith Loyd has asked a judget to appoint for him Terry Lenamon, a Miami lawyer who's handled 14 death penalty cases. Rene StutzmanContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Markeith Loyd wants a judge to appoint a Miami lawyer to represent him who specializes in saving the lives of ”the most hated, the most vilified, the ones society wants to kill.” He is Terence “Terry” Lenamon, who describes himself as one of the best lawyers in the state when it comes to saving killers from the death penalty. “I tried 14 death penalty cases through verdict,” he said. “Thirteen of the 14 resulted in life sentences. … (I) believe that the more somebody is hated, the more they need me as a lawyer.” Chief Judge Frederick Lauten last week appointed someone else — Orlando lawyer Roger Weeden — to represent Loyd, but the judge left open the possibility of naming Lenamon, too. Because Loyd is facing the death penalty, he is entitled to two lawyers. Lenamon said his focus isn’t on winning acquittals. “Your ultimate goal sometimes is only to save the client’s life,” he said. “The best they’re going to get is life in prison.” Lenamon, 50, is the highest grossing private attorney handling capital murder cases for indigent clients in Florida, according to the Miami Herald. Since 2000, the state has paid him $5 million for 59 cases, the Herald reported. That’s $85,000 a case. He does not dispute that total. “It’s a costly process,” he said. “Imagine who your best lawyers are in Orlando. Those are the people who should be representing those guys, the most hated, the most vilified, the ones society wants to kill.” Most accused killers are represented by the Office of Public Defender, an agency with dozens of staff attorneys who are paid a salary by the state and do not bill by the hour, but a judge has ruled that it cannot represent Loyd because of a conflict of interest. Loyd faces the death penalty for the slaying of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton, who was shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot Jan. 9. Police Chief John Mina says the confrontation was captured on video. Loyd faces a second the death penalty sentence for the shooting death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, who was slain Dec. 13. “I’m an opponent of the death penalty,” Lenamon said. “I don’t think government should be killing people.” In January, within days of Loyd’s capture, his sister contacted a retired Central Florida judge, asking for the name of a good death penalty defense attorney, the attorney said. The judge recommended Lenamon, who then talked with the sister and Loyd and won them both over. Two weeks ago in court, Loyd specifically asked Lauten to appoint Lenamon. Defendants who don’t have enough money to hire an attorney don’t get to pick who will represent them, the judge said. That authority falls to judges, and in the Ninth Judicial Circuit — Orange and Osceola counties — they work from a list of local attorneys. Lenamon is not on it, not because he’s unqualified but because he’s not local. He is on the list in many other counties, including Marion and Lake, the home base of Brad King, the special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott to handle the Loyd case after State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced she would not pursue the death penalty against any defendant. Loyd and Weeden say the judge should pick Lenamon. “He’s imminently well qualified,” Weeden said. “He has gotten the confidence of Mr. Loyd and Mr. Loyd’s family.” That’s an about-face for Loyd, who for weeks insisted he would represent himself. Lenamon may not be widely known in Central Florida, but he’s worked on some big cases here, including that of Casey Anthony in Orange County and vampire cult killer Rod Ferrell in Lake County. His involvement in the Anthony case was short lived. In 2008, he prepared a 30-page packet, arguing why prosecutors should not seek the death penalty against her. Several weeks later, prosecutors announced they would not, a position they reversed after the body of Anthony’s 2-year-old daughter was recovered. Jeff Ashton, one of the prosecutors in the case, remembered Lenamon as being involved in the case “for half a second, but then, who wasn’t.” The reason for the no-death-penalty stance at the time, he wrote in an email, was because the victim’s body had not yet been recovered. Lenamon also counts Ferrell among his clients, a killer who was sentenced to life in prison for the murders of Richard and Ruth Wendorf in their Eustis home in 1996. Ferrell must be resentenced. He was 16 at the time of the homicides, and the U.S. Supreme Court has since ruled that it is unconstitutional to sentence underage offenders to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lenamon has been a lawyer since 1993. He works in a tiny law firm, one that has just one other attorney, and is a board certified trial lawyer, according to the Florida Bar. On 26 occasions, he has persuaded prosecutors to waive the death penalty, according to his firm’s web page. Steve Laurence, an Altamonte Springs defense attorney who has represented several capital murder defendants, said he had never heard of Lenamon but offered this: “He’s going to need every bit of his skill in Mr. Loyd’s case.” rstutzman@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6394 Caption Arrest made in death of 15-year-old girl found by side of road Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings announces an arrest made in the death of 15-year-old  Melanie Mesen Medina.

The buzz of a text message heralds the latest offer on Amazon’s Treasure Truck – a funky lorry bedecked with funfair lights and retro signs that appears at random in the streets of Seattle with a one-off discounted product for sale. Alaskan cod, four fillets for $17, was the most recent item; a few days earlier it was two 16oz prime steaks for $40. Click on your Amazon app to buy your “treasure” and you’ll be told where the truck is so you can pick it up.

You need to move fast, though – they sell out quickly.” The truck, which launched a year ago, is stocked several times a month with deals that range from turkeys to Nintendo game consoles. There are rumours it will appear in London soon. The Treasure Truck is a quirky manifestation of Amazon’s recent foray into the physical world it once shunned. In late 2015 it opened a book shop in a Seattle mall, and it is currently piloting two types of supermarket in the city, Amazon Go, a hi-tech convenience store, which eliminates the need to queue at a checkout, and AmazonFresh Pickup, where orders placed online can be picked up within 15 minutes at a drive-through. These are currently in beta mode, open only to employees. Amazon’s home town of Seattle is, in effect, its laboratory for its bricks-and-mortar retail experiments. Once glitches have been dealt with, these new stores may be rolled out – there are now five bookshops in the US, with plans for seven more. AmazonFresh vans, delivering groceries ordered online, can be spotted all over the city – another concept trialled in Seattle that was fine-tuned for years before being introduced elsewhere. These latest appearances of the company logo, with its swooshing arrow from the A to the Z, make the company’s presence ever more felt. Not everyone welcomes it. For some, it is mainly Amazon, which now employs 25,000 people in Seattle, that is to blame for the changing character of the city. Jeff Reifman, a consultant and writer, says: “I’m spending [less time in Seattle] now, and Amazon has a lot to do with that. Since 2010 Amazon has been increasing exponentially. There’s a huge impact on traffic, the cost of housing, the affordability.” Amazon Go, which has been in beta mode since December. Customers simply take what they want and leave – tracking technology does the rest. Photograph: Paul Gordon/Zuma Press/Eyevine When he first moved to the city 25 years ago, he says there was “a slower pace”. “There was a connection to nature, a lefty awareness, a hippy culture, a focus on literature and the arts. Seattle is becoming one of the world’s greatest cities, but success has a cost in that it doesn’t have a rich cultural flavour to it.” Others, however, feel differently. At the Amazon bookshop one weekday lunchtime, Tiffany, a digital advertising executive in her 40s, was browsing for holiday reads. “I find it exciting for Seattle to have a new influx of people and ideas. It’s good for the city. It’s super-interesting seeing what they test here. I’m an avid Amazon user – as a mom it makes my life so much easier. I’ll certainly try Pickup and Go when they open.” Analysts say that Amazon is experimenting with bricks-and-mortar projects so it can capture a bigger chunk of certain retail markets. The bookshops are an attempt to attract those customers who prefer to browse in person. While doing so, they’re encouraged to become a $99-a-year Amazon Prime member, which gives free online delivery and extras that include being able to pay the cheaper website price for a book in the shop. But the bigger prize is the grocery market, which has been slow to move online. Online delivery accounts for only 1.4% of food sales in the US and 6.9% in the UK. Many shoppers want to see fresh fruit, vegetables and meat before they buy; others do not want to pay a delivery charge, and then there is the vast size of the US and the logistical issues that brings. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags, and walk out Don Stuart, a managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group, says: “The $800bn-plus grocery market is the Goliath, and Amazon would like to penetrate it more deeply than it can with just Prime or different types of direct online e-commerce activity.” Clearly, Amazon has competition from behemoths such as Walmart, and Seattle is where it is testing its battle plans. “It’s right in their backyard,” says Stuart. “They can keep an eye on things every day, control it, change the variables that they’re testing.” As Amazon spokeswoman Nell Rona puts it: “Experimenting close to customers here helps us innovate and learn faster in the early stages.” The AmazonFresh PickUp store on a busy main road in Ballard, an area that has seen rapid gentrification in recent years, was unveiled last month. The concrete and wood-clad building has a glass foyer with “Hello Ballard” in foot-high white letters on the window. A steel canopy protects parking slots where drivers pull in to pick up their shopping. A notice on a sandwich board says: “Beta Participant Entry”. A man in a green apron, holding a clipboard, stood outside last week. “It’s not open to the public yet,” he told people who wandered up. “You’ll sure hear about it when it is.” Some in the neighborhood aren’t so bothered. Ian Spicknall, 36, a taxi driver, says: “I prefer to go to the store and spend an hour or so choosing what I want, looking at prices. It’s hard to look at groceries on a tablet. It’ll be good for certain types of people, like mini-van moms, being able to pick up their groceries on the way home. © Provided by Guardian News An AmazonFresh Pickup employee wheels grocery bags to a customer vehicle “I think they’re for people of a certain income – probably tech industry workers. I like mom-and-pop shops, the backbone of America, and you feel like you are supporting the community. Seattle is a lot about being green, going hiking, and breweries. People like to shop local.” Whether Amazon will eventually win over the likes of Spicknall remains to be seen, but it is trying to appeal to as many types of shopper as possible. Spokeswoman Nell Rona says: “We have all kinds of customers, who shop in various ways, who look for a wide range of items, and do so on any number of different occasions. As a result, we’ve created a variety of innovative services that satisfy customers’ different needs as it relates to grocery shopping.” In response to criticisms of Amazon’s dominating presence in Seattle, she says: “We’ve made a long-term commitment to invest in the city of Seattle. From unique retail space on the ground floor of all our buildings to public spaces nearby – such as an outdoor dog park, playing fields, a shared-use street that’s designed to be great for pedestrians as well as cars, art installations, covered public walkways and other amenities.” Brendan Witcher, a retail and e-commerce analyst at Forrester, says Amazon was trying to do to the grocery industry what Apple did to the music industry. “They’re trying to create a full grocery-to-home ecosystem. Starting with Alexa [Amazon’s digital personal assistant]. I can say: “Alexa, send me my groceries list minus garlic and tomatoes.” By having locations, Alexa can say to me: “Would you like them to ship or to pick up?” Done. “Amazon will own the device you order from; own the method of delivery; own all the products in that category; own multiple ways to get those products.” The Alexa tool is what other retailers should be most worried about, he says. “That is a critical difference in the customer journey that can allow Amazon to own so much of this space. That compares to me finding my phone or laptop, opening it up, logging in, going on the website, putting things into my shopping cart and checking out. Any time we see a huge amount of friction removed from the customer journey, we see adoption.” Success is not guaranteed though. “Just because Amazon is a great online retailer doesn’t mean it will instantly jump into physical and be amazing at it: they still need to learn about labour, traffic flows, real estate, perishable items in the store environment, security… all these things they didn’t have to worry about as an online retailer.” The Treasure Truck is fun and gimmicky. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a master of PR and getting people excited Amazon Go has been in beta mode since December and was due to open early this year. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags and walk out. No need for checkouts, card transactions or bagging. Nor for cashiers, of whom there are 3.5 million in the US (the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery store workers, has strongly criticised the stores). The Wall Street Journal has reported that the technology has been crashing in tests when the store is too crowded. If these hitches can be solved, Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle, believes that Amazon Go could be a game changer for every segment of retail because the technology is not food-specific. He wrote in a blog: “The proposition for the consumer is simple – save time and hassle. The proposition for retailers may be even more compelling – save labour on the biggest component of the store (the front end) as well as improve throughput. “One can envision a future of Amazon bricks-and-mortar outposts: book stores, beauty stores, drive-through grocery stores and convenience locations all using this technology.” He told the Observer that Amazon had an enormous advantage over other retailers because 40% of US households were Prime members. “They know who their customers are already, they have credit and payment [details] for their customers, and their buying preferences.” Not that he thinks all Amazon’s ideas will have the same impact. “Take the Treasure Truck – it’s fun and gimmicky. Jeff Bezos [the founder and CEO] is a master of public relations, and getting people excited about an idea before it’s commercially viable, including the truck and the Amazon bookstore.” Amazon is not the only global brand using Seattle as a Petri dish. Among other initiatives, Starbucks has trialled its high-end coffee house, the Reserve Roastery, which will now open in several major cities worldwide. Innovation is threaded into Seattle’s DNA, according to Leonard Garfield, executive director of Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry. “In 1852 Henry Yesler was invited into the community of fewer than 100 people because he had a sawmill that was different to any other around. That initial technological innovation distinguished Seattle from any other of these small villages popping up in the woods of the north-west. “You can see it again with Bill Boeing and again with Bill Gates, and it keeps repeating itself – relatively young people who are willing to embrace the new technology, willing to take a risk and willing to invite people to the table who are different than the people already here.” He acknowledges that there has always been a counter-narrative to this. When Microsoft and Boeing were booming a few decades ago, there were people “who weren’t any too enthusiastic about lots of young tech people coming in and maybe changing a little bit of the character. “That scene has been there, but at the end of the day I think it’s a community where the smart idea has always won out.” Time will tell whether any of Amazon’s trial projects will be smart ideas.

Our picks at each level of the offense. The Minnesota Vikings are getting into a more standard salary-cap division among their positions, meaning they will have to have players increase their value. We pick one at each offensive position to fit that role. A veteran starting quarterback means a more mature salary cap. Over the last decade, sans the Brett Favre years, the Minnesota Vikings have essentially been able to spend more in other areas to make up for the lack of well-paid, highly executing quarterback. From the time Daunte Culpepper left – with the underrated Brad Childress quote about picturing Culpepper working out behind a Chinese restaurant in a WalMart parking lot – it’s a been a cattle call of below-market, young, unproven (or negatively proven) quarterbacks. http://www.scout.com/nfl/vikings/story/1769708-2017-vikings-draft-guide The Vikings moved on from Culpepper and went with Brad Johnson, Tarvaris Jackson, Gus Frerotte, Christian Ponder, Matt Cassel and Teddy Bridgewater. And just when Bridgewater was emerging toward the top of the bunch, his dislocated knee dismembered his chances of continuing to prove it last year. Enter Sam Bradford and the high-priced veteran earning his keep. But with that comes the price of playing proven quarterback poker. Bradford will cost $18 million in 2017, the same amount of cap space the Vikings gained by letting Adrian Peterson walk. It essentially allowed the Vikings to be more aggressive with contracts for Riley Reiff, Mike Remmers and Latavius Murray. But it also left a couple of spots unfilled. That’s where a player will need to emerge from the shadows. With that, here are the players we think have to take a step forward at every offensive position: Quarterback – Taylor Heinicke’s decision to use his foot before using his mind last summer impacted his ability to use his arm. After putting his foot through the glass portion of a locked door after returning from a movie, Heinicke had to have surgery that put him out of commission for all of training camp, the preseason and the start of the regular season. Before the kick, Bridgewater was the starting quarterback and Bradford was property of the Philadelphia Eagles. When Heinicke returned, Bridgewater was out with his serious knee injury and Bradford had assumed the starting role in Minnesota. Had Heinicke been part of training camp and proved himself, he might be in better standing now. Instead, it’s Bradford, new signee Case Keenum and Heinicke expected to get the snaps in training camp. Heinicke still has a chance to prove himself, but with all three of the more experienced quarterbacks entering the final year of their contracts, Heinicke’s preseason snaps had better be fruitful. Running back – C.J. Ham put together a pretty decent preseason as an undrafted rookie last year, finishing with the most carries (44) and second-highest average (3.2 yards) behind a shaky offensive line. Without Matt Asiata (or Peterson) on the roster, Ham may get more looks in the preseason in an effort to earn a spot on the roster. He’ll be fighting for that spot with Bishop Sankey and an anticipated draft pick. But don’t count out Ham. Murray and Jerick McKinnon are expected to occupy the first two spots on the depth chart, but Ham could push for time, especially if an injury pops up in front of him. http://www.scout.com/nfl/vikings/story/1770961-one-for-the-thumb Wide receiver – Last year’s breakout player at the position was Adam Thielen. He went from mainly a special-teams guy to a starting receiver as he continued to prove himself. One thing about this coaching staff is they aren’t afraid to see who is ready. Thielen was, as he rendered Charles Johnson and Cordarrelle Patterson to third fiddle. This year, Laquon Treadwell needs that sort of proving time, but we see Jarius Wright being the guy to re-emerge. He’s proven he can do it, but because the coaches were set on trying to make Patterson a threat, Wright’s time was limited. Now, it is his time to be used as the main slot man and get back to his previously productive ways. Tight end – Without Rhett Ellison, David Morgan will see more time. So, too, will an expected draft pick. But Morgan had a year to be slowly immersed into the lineup without the pressure to do it all. This year, without Ellison or Zach Line (still a free agent that could be signed later), Morgan should get the opportunity to explore a bigger role as a move tight end/H-back. Offensive line – In reality, who didn’t get the chance to step up last year? With eight different starting combinations due to injury, if you were an offensive lineman and a warm body, you got your chance. This year, the breakout guy might not be on the roster yet. The feeling here is that the Vikings will use one of their first three picks (one in the second round and two in the third) on a guard. That guy will get every opportunity to win the spot vacated when the Vikings released Brandon Fusco and Mike Harris. They have other options, like Joe Berger or Nick Easton moving from center to guard, or one of the right tackles sliding inside, but ideally a Day 2 pick in the draft is the one to emerge and solidify the spot.  If the Vikings are going to move forward with a more traditional salary-cap structure in which the starting quarterback occupies about $20 million annually, they will need young talent to emerge on a yearly basis. At times, that will mean firmly grasping an opening in the starting lineup. At other spots, they will simply need quality depth to contribute. This year, there are opportunities at both levels and they need a handful of offensive players to emerge.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Dozens of weapons confiscated at Vikings game Grove Bowl: Photo Gallery IV The 6 Most Secret Units in Military History Bianco Boys Forging Own Paths Big Bust Theory Share & Embed In-depth NFL draft analysis: Defensive ends Full Story Viking Update Top Stories As conditioning starts, Zimmer to surgeryThe Minnesota Vikings start their offseason program this week as head coach Mike Zimmer heads to another surgery. by Tim Yotter Viking UpdateYesterday at 6:19 PM One for the thumb?The draft is front of mind at the moment, but, at Winter Park, a pair of franchise-tilting decisions are on the horizon for the Minnesota Vikings. by John Holler Viking UpdateYesterday at 4:23 AM Dozens of weapons confiscated at Vikings gameSecurity at U.S. Bank Stadium confiscated dozens of weapons during Minnesota Vikings games. by Tim Yotter Viking UpdateSaturday at 5:49 AM Big Bust TheoryWho was the worst draft pick in Vikings history, Troy Williamson or Dimitrius Underwood? by John Holler Viking UpdateSaturday at 4:17 AM 2017 VIKINGS DRAFT GUIDEInformation on the Minnesota Vikings' 2017 draft, from where they pick to position analysis, links to stories, mock drafts and more. by Tim Yotter Viking UpdateFriday at 6:30 AM Visitor analysis: Late-round linebacker The Minnesota Vikings have reportedly hosted a late-round linebacker for a predraft visit, a move that makes sense given Chad Greenway’s retirement and the need for depth at the… by Tim Yotter Viking UpdateFriday at 6:03 AM In-depth NFL draft analysis: Defensive endsThe Minnesota Vikings don’t have a great need at defensive end this year, but there are plenty from which to choose.

Customers simply take what they want and leave – tracking technology does the rest. The buzz of a text message heralds the latest offer on Amazon’s Treasure Truck – a funky lorry bedecked with funfair lights and retro signs that appears at random in the streets of Seattle with a one-off discounted product for sale. Alaskan cod, four fillets for $17, was the most recent item; a few days earlier it was two 16oz prime steaks for $40. Click on your Amazon app to buy your “treasure” and you’ll be told where the truck is so you can pick it up. “It’s fun,” says Nicole Jamieson, 42. “My kids love it because it looks cool with all its lights flashing. You need to move fast, though – they sell out quickly.” The truck, which launched a year ago, is stocked several times a month with deals that range from turkeys to Nintendo game consoles. There are rumours it will appear in London soon. The Treasure Truck is a quirky manifestation of Amazon’s recent foray into the physical world it once shunned. In late 2015 it opened a book shop in a Seattle mall, and it is currently piloting two types of supermarket in the city, Amazon Go, a hi-tech convenience store, which eliminates the need to queue at a checkout, and AmazonFresh Pickup, where orders placed online can be picked up within 15 minutes at a drive-through. These are currently in beta mode, open only to employees. Amazon’s home town of Seattle is, in effect, its laboratory for its bricks-and-mortar retail experiments. Once glitches have been dealt with, these new stores may be rolled out – there are now five bookshops in the US, with plans for seven more. AmazonFresh vans, delivering groceries ordered online, can be spotted all over the city – another concept trialled in Seattle that was fine-tuned for years before being introduced elsewhere. These latest appearances of the company logo, with its swooshing arrow from the A to the Z, make the company’s presence ever more felt. Not everyone welcomes it. For some, it is mainly Amazon, which now employs 25,000 people in Seattle, that is to blame for the changing character of the city. Jeff Reifman, a consultant and writer, says: “I’m spending [less time in Seattle] now, and Amazon has a lot to do with that. Since 2010 Amazon has been increasing exponentially. There’s a huge impact on traffic, the cost of housing, the affordability.” Amazon Go, which has been in beta mode since December. Customers simply take what they want and leave – tracking technology does the rest. Photograph: Paul Gordon/Zuma Press/Eyevine When he first moved to the city 25 years ago, he says there was “a slower pace”. “There was a connection to nature, a lefty awareness, a hippy culture, a focus on literature and the arts. Seattle is becoming one of the world’s greatest cities, but success has a cost in that it doesn’t have a rich cultural flavour to it.” Others, however, feel differently. At the Amazon bookshop one weekday lunchtime, Tiffany, a digital advertising executive in her 40s, was browsing for holiday reads. “I find it exciting for Seattle to have a new influx of people and ideas. It’s good for the city. It’s super-interesting seeing what they test here. I’m an avid Amazon user – as a mom it makes my life so much easier. I’ll certainly try Pickup and Go when they open.” Analysts say that Amazon is experimenting with bricks-and-mortar projects so it can capture a bigger chunk of certain retail markets. The bookshops are an attempt to attract those customers who prefer to browse in person. While doing so, they’re encouraged to become a $99-a-year Amazon Prime member, which gives free online delivery and extras that include being able to pay the cheaper website price for a book in the shop. But the bigger prize is the grocery market, which has been slow to move online. Online delivery accounts for only 1.4% of food sales in the US and 6.9% in the UK. Many shoppers want to see fresh fruit, vegetables and meat before they buy; others do not want to pay a delivery charge, and then there is the vast size of the US and the logistical issues that brings. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags, and walk out Don Stuart, a managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group, says: “The $800bn-plus grocery market is the Goliath, and Amazon would like to penetrate it more deeply than it can with just Prime or different types of direct online e-commerce activity.” Clearly, Amazon has competition from behemoths such as Walmart, and Seattle is where it is testing its battle plans. “It’s right in their backyard,” says Stuart. “They can keep an eye on things every day, control it, change the variables that they’re testing.” As Amazon spokeswoman Nell Rona puts it: “Experimenting close to customers here helps us innovate and learn faster in the early stages.” The AmazonFresh PickUp store on a busy main road in Ballard, an area that has seen rapid gentrification in recent years, was unveiled last month. The concrete and wood-clad building has a glass foyer with “Hello Ballard” in foot-high white letters on the window. A steel canopy protects parking slots where drivers pull in to pick up their shopping. A notice on a sandwich board says: “Beta Participant Entry”. A man in a green apron, holding a clipboard, stood outside last week. “It’s not open to the public yet,” he told people who wandered up. “You’ll sure hear about it when it is.” Some in the neighborhood aren’t so bothered. Ian Spicknall, 36, a taxi driver, says: “I prefer to go to the store and spend an hour or so choosing what I want, looking at prices. It’s hard to look at groceries on a tablet. It’ll be good for certain types of people, like mini-van moms, being able to pick up their groceries on the way home. © Provided by Guardian News An AmazonFresh Pickup employee wheels grocery bags to a customer vehicle “I think they’re for people of a certain income – probably tech industry workers. I like mom-and-pop shops, the backbone of America, and you feel like you are supporting the community. Seattle is a lot about being green, going hiking, and breweries. People like to shop local.” Whether Amazon will eventually win over the likes of Spicknall remains to be seen, but it is trying to appeal to as many types of shopper as possible. Spokeswoman Nell Rona says: “We have all kinds of customers, who shop in various ways, who look for a wide range of items, and do so on any number of different occasions. As a result, we’ve created a variety of innovative services that satisfy customers’ different needs as it relates to grocery shopping.” In response to criticisms of Amazon’s dominating presence in Seattle, she says: “We’ve made a long-term commitment to invest in the city of Seattle. From unique retail space on the ground floor of all our buildings to public spaces nearby – such as an outdoor dog park, playing fields, a shared-use street that’s designed to be great for pedestrians as well as cars, art installations, covered public walkways and other amenities.” Brendan Witcher, a retail and e-commerce analyst at Forrester, says Amazon was trying to do to the grocery industry what Apple did to the music industry. “They’re trying to create a full grocery-to-home ecosystem. Starting with Alexa [Amazon’s digital personal assistant]. I can say: “Alexa, send me my groceries list minus garlic and tomatoes.” By having locations, Alexa can say to me: “Would you like them to ship or to pick up?” Done. “Amazon will own the device you order from; own the method of delivery; own all the products in that category; own multiple ways to get those products.” The Alexa tool is what other retailers should be most worried about, he says. “That is a critical difference in the customer journey that can allow Amazon to own so much of this space. That compares to me finding my phone or laptop, opening it up, logging in, going on the website, putting things into my shopping cart and checking out. Any time we see a huge amount of friction removed from the customer journey, we see adoption.” Success is not guaranteed though. “Just because Amazon is a great online retailer doesn’t mean it will instantly jump into physical and be amazing at it: they still need to learn about labour, traffic flows, real estate, perishable items in the store environment, security… all these things they didn’t have to worry about as an online retailer.” The Treasure Truck is fun and gimmicky. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a master of PR and getting people excited Amazon Go has been in beta mode since December and was due to open early this year. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags and walk out. No need for checkouts, card transactions or bagging. Nor for cashiers, of whom there are 3.5 million in the US (the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery store workers, has strongly criticised the stores). The Wall Street Journal has reported that the technology has been crashing in tests when the store is too crowded. If these hitches can be solved, Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle, believes that Amazon Go could be a game changer for every segment of retail because the technology is not food-specific. He wrote in a blog: “The proposition for the consumer is simple – save time and hassle. The proposition for retailers may be even more compelling – save labour on the biggest component of the store (the front end) as well as improve throughput. “One can envision a future of Amazon bricks-and-mortar outposts: book stores, beauty stores, drive-through grocery stores and convenience locations all using this technology.” He told the Observer that Amazon had an enormous advantage over other retailers because 40% of US households were Prime members. “They know who their customers are already, they have credit and payment [details] for their customers, and their buying preferences.” Not that he thinks all Amazon’s ideas will have the same impact. “Take the Treasure Truck – it’s fun and gimmicky. Jeff Bezos [the founder and CEO] is a master of public relations, and getting people excited about an idea before it’s commercially viable, including the truck and the Amazon bookstore.” Amazon is not the only global brand using Seattle as a Petri dish. Among other initiatives, Starbucks has trialled its high-end coffee house, the Reserve Roastery, which will now open in several major cities worldwide. Innovation is threaded into Seattle’s DNA, according to Leonard Garfield, executive director of Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry. “In 1852 Henry Yesler was invited into the community of fewer than 100 people because he had a sawmill that was different to any other around. That initial technological innovation distinguished Seattle from any other of these small villages popping up in the woods of the north-west. “You can see it again with Bill Boeing and again with Bill Gates, and it keeps repeating itself – relatively young people who are willing to embrace the new technology, willing to take a risk and willing to invite people to the table who are different than the people already here.” He acknowledges that there has always been a counter-narrative to this. When Microsoft and Boeing were booming a few decades ago, there were people “who weren’t any too enthusiastic about lots of young tech people coming in and maybe changing a little bit of the character. “That scene has been there, but at the end of the day I think it’s a community where the smart idea has always won out.” Time will tell whether any of Amazon’s trial projects will be smart ideas.

(Photo by John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images) Is Starbucks open on Easter? by Dave Stevenson Is Sam’s Club open on Easter? by Dave Stevenson Lifestyle Is Costco open on Easter? by Dave Stevenson22 hours agoFollow @baltimoredavey Tweet Share x GPlus Pin Comment What are Costco’s store hours on Easter Sunday in 2017?  Easter Sunday is a time for many stores and businesses to close. Employers tend to let their employees spend time with their friends and family. That means most people aren’t interested in shopping on Easter. This includes a lot of stores, except for those offering Easter specials. McDonald’s and most other fast food places will be open on Sunday. However, Costco will not be open on Easter. While their gasoline stations will remain open for everyone’s convenience, their wholesale stores will not open their doors on Easter. This comes as bad news to some people. You always forget to cook or bring something around the holidays. Easter is no exception. While Costco might be closed, most Walmart stores will still be open. So if you need something last-minute, go there instead. Costco is one of the largest wholesale chains in North America. However, they tend to treat their employees rather well. They aren’t open as much as other stores, especially not on holidays. But if you go there during business hours, you can usually find some excellent deals. In particular, their Black Friday deals are amazing. Whatever you want or need, you can probably find it there. They offer just about everything, including food, groceries, produce, clothes, electronics and even appliances. Unlike Walmart, they’re very easy to navigate and the lines are usually much shorter. While they’re not open for Easter, they’re definitely worth checking out. Must Read: Each State's Sports Mount Rushmore They will have normal business hours throughout the weekend, including Good Friday. So make sure you have everything you need for the holiday and hit them up if you don’t. Their stores will resume their normal business hours on Monday April 17, the day after Easter.

Everyone is like that. That’s just the way it is,” he says. Kazuko Sato, a 50-year-old animation artist, frequents discount chain Daiso, where most items ranging from groceries and bath towels to kitchenware sell for just ¥100. “I look for things here first, and if they aren’t here then I go to the supermarket,” she says, cradling a basket in the stationery aisle. “My job and salary are unstable so I need to be careful about my spending.” People like them have prompted some companies to embark on sweeping price cuts, showing how tough it will be to eradicate Japan’s deflationary malaise despite the improving economy. It also highlights a new paradox facing the Bank of Japan: a disparity between solid growth and stubbornly weak inflation. Top retailer Aeon Co. is cutting prices for over 250 grocery items this month to lure cost-savvy shoppers, and Seiyu, operated by Wal-Mart Stores, cut prices on more than 200 products in February. “It’s unthinkable for us to raise prices at this stage,” Fast Retailing Co. CEO Tadashi Yanai said after the owner of clothing brand Uniqlo on Thursday reported flat revenue. To be sure, many retailers say they are protecting their bottom line by offering not just discounts but high-end products. “It’s not just prices consumers are looking at. They are just being selective,” said Takaharu Iwasaki, president of supermarket chain operator Life Corp. But central bank policymakers are struggling to explain why inflation and wages remain so low even as the economy enjoys its third-longest recovery since World War II. “It’s a new conundrum for us,” one official said. “It just shows how sticky Japan’s deflationary mindset is.” Japan’s economy has sustained a modest recovery cycle that kicked off when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took power in late 2012 and launched his three-pronged Abenomics package of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. A recent rebound in overseas demand has helped boost exports and output, pushing up business confidence to its highest in 18 months, with companies upbeat on their spending plans. Encouraged by recent positive data, the BOJ is expected to offer a more upbeat view of the economy at this month’s rate review than it did last month, people familiar with the matter said. The benefits of the recovery have yet to reach households, though, despite four years of heavy money printing by the central bank and fiscal spending packages. Real wages have been largely flat despite reported job losses hitting a 22-year low, as firms remain wary of raising wages. Core consumer inflation remained stuck at 0.2 percent in February, well below the BOJ’s ambitious 2 percent target, as companies hold back on price rises for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households. Japan’s demographics are a key factor working against consumption. Nearly 30 percent of the population will be aged 65 or above in 2020, according to a government estimate. Living off pensions, elderly households are unaffected by any wage hikes and tend to withhold spending, analysts say. Miyako Minamizawa, a 65-year-old pensioner in Tokyo, says the recovery hasn’t changed her life. “I don’t feel like the economy is doing well,” she said, adding she is dipping into her savings because her pension isn’t enough to get by on. In the capital’s upmarket Ginza shopping district, 72-year-old Shimako Naito said: “I used to often impulse buy, on quite expensive clothes and jewelry, but now I take my time and try and buy when things are cheaper.” Inefficiencies in the highly-protected farm sector have kept fresh food prices high and volatile. A weak-yen trend also hurt households by pushing up the price of imported goods. Food prices rose 1.7 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, even though overall consumer prices fell 0.1 percent. Households used 26 percent of their income to buy food last year, the highest level in almost three decades, leaving them with little left to spend on non-necessities. Food products topped the list of items that households spent more on, a quarterly BOJ survey showed this month, while households cut spending most on eating out, clothing and travel. Roughly 80 percent of households who replied to the BOJ’s survey said they feel price rises are a bad thing, a sign the central bank has failed to convince the public of the benefits of putting a sustained end to growth-sapping deflation. Masayuki Yamamuro, 51, who works at a real estate firm, says he eats out less and is cutting down on spending because grocery shopping is becoming more expensive. “My salary hasn’t risen. I want to buy a car, own a house or go traveling. But I’m not able to do that.” Photos Click to enlarge Keywords prices, BOJ, Deflation Economy U.S. commerce chief Ross expected to meet with Abe this week February core machinery orders gain 1.5% on month Worker sentiment index falls for third straight month At ¥2.8 trillion, current account surplus sets February record Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now Tweeters spill their guts on #gaijinconfessionfriday U.S.-Korean war hype rings hollow as verbal jousting continues North Korean test of medium-range missile explodes on launch in latest challenge for Trump China warns against using force on North Korea as Pyongyang readies for important event Tying the knot is unraveling in Japan North Korea: solutions beyond saber-rattling Italian Emma Morano, last known survivor of 19th century, dies at 117 ‘The Social Life of Kimono’: Innovation faces tradition in the fight to keep kimono relevant Creating a real ghost in the shell Blogs Japan Pulse Yen for Living BACK TO TOP The Japan Times on Sunday The Japan Times ST Jobs Study in Japan JT for Women JT Bookclub Japanese School Directory Email Updates | Home Delivery RSS Twitter Facebook Newsletter News National World Business Asia Pacific Reference Columns Multimedia Opinion Editorials Commentary Reader Mail Cartoons Life Travel Digital Food & Drink Environment Style & Design Language Lifestyle People Columns Multimedia Community Voices Issues Our Lives Event Listings How-tos Columns Culture Film Music Art Stage Events Festivals Books TV Columns Multimedia Sports Baseball Soccer Basketball Sumo Rugby Figure Skating Tennis More Sports Columns Multimedia About us Contact us Privacy Policy Link Policy Reprints FAQs Support Press Sitemap Advertise The Japan Times LTD.

(Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) (Jacob Langston / Orlando Sentinel) Mary ShanklinContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel The first two model showhomes have been completed at what stands to be Central Florida’s priciest enclave, a place where buyers forgo waterfront living but get a 5-acre water park, in-home spa services and extra kitchens geared for catering booked through the Four Seasons Resort. With homes starting at $5 million, Orlando’s new Four Seasons Private Residences, on northern parts of Walt Disney World property, are the country’s first single-family homes affiliated with a Four Seasons, according to Walt Disney World. The resort brand has residences in vacation towns around the world, including condos in a half dozen U.S. cities. “Palm Beach is coming here,” said Potomac Land Company President Bill Sullivan, who owns MansionQuest.com, which features high-end estates throughout Florida. “The only places in the state you would be competing with are Palm Beach and Naples. No one else.” Elsewhere in Central Florida, Winter Park and Windermere have dozens and dozens of homes valued on the tax rolls at more than $5 million. The 20-acre Four Seasons neighborhood, which is part of Disney’s Golden Oak, has the highest price of admission in Central Florida, based on starting prices. In other parts of Golden Oak, prices start at less than half that price and have exceeded $5 million. The development has attracted buyers including former Wal-Mart chief executive H. Lee Scott and fitness franchise owner Eric Casaburi. Buyers range from their 20s to their 80s, with most in their mid-to late-50s, Disney executives said. “What we’re amazed with is that, at this price point, we have already sold a third of the 30 lots we have here,” said Page Pierce, vice president of real estate development for Disney resorts. The 16-story Four Seasons hotel can be seen throughout its namesake community of homes. Buyers in the new neighborhood may use the resort’s golf course, clay tennis courts, adult-only and family pools, lazy river, water slides and watch weekly “dive-in” movies. They may dine at the resort’s six restaurants or book in-home catering and spa services. “When you set up that kind of residence system, you’re setting up a social system,” Sullivan said. “It’s all about hanging out.” Like other residents of Golden Oak, Four Seasons home buyers also can use the Summerhouse club with its concierge services, lounge, fitness center, restaurant and entertainment rooms. An adult Easter-egg hunt was planned for this weekend. And bingo is a popular activity, according to staff members. All buyers are club members and the annual dues are $16,889. Homeowner association dues cost $24,514 for Four Seasons Residences, compared to $5,735 in most neighborhoods within Golden Oak. For $7 million, buyers can purchase an Italianate-style home with 8,160 square feet, six bedrooms, six baths, three half baths, a three-car garage, 14-foot-tall wine gallery and elevator. The marble-floored, two-story entry overlooks a bank of glass pocket doors that recede behind walls and open onto a lanai with retractable screens for the dining area and an open-air pool, bar and summer kitchen. The backdrop to the half-acre lot is a preserve. There are no boat docks or sunset lake views. In fact, the house next door is only about 10 feet away but largely hidden by bamboo and other landscaping. What separates the house from many other luxury homes in Central Florida is its fully equipped second kitchen, which is outfitted with Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances and built to serve the catering staff selected by the Four Seasons resort. John Lazenby, former president of Orlando Regional Realtors Association, said the Four Seasons residences will be Central Florida’s leading luxury community because it taps the region’s only AAA five-diamond resort in Four Seasons and Disney amenities. The neighborhood’s builders include Derrick Builders Inc., Goehring & Morgan Construction Inc., Jones-Clayton Construction J. Richard Watson Construction Company Inc. and Stonebridge Homes. “The attention to detail is second to none,” he said. Walt Disney World’s Golden Oak opened in 2011, catering to vacation-home buyers. About half of the buyers have listed their homes there as their primary residence on tax records. More than five years after its debut, the community has home expansions and recreational park openings that point to more families residing there. Whether the new neighborhood next to Four Seasons becomes known as a home — instead of a home away from home — remains to be seen. mshanklin@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5538 See the 25 most valuable Central Florida mansions based on property appraisal records.

Here is how to still find a NES Classic in stock. The Nintendo NES Classic Edition was released in November of last year. The demand for the retro consoles did not die out after Christmas. It continues to this day. Just before the Easter weekend, Nintendo changed the game for consumers on the hunt for a NES Classic. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Nintendo announced on April 13 that the NES Classic Edition will be discontinued. This is not a rumor. It is real. Nintendo released an official statement declaring the end of the NES Classic producution. The news sent reseller prices for the NES immediately north of $340. This is jump of $220. The Nintendo NES Classic reseller price is almost equal to the reseller offers of the new Nintendo Switch.  The supply of the NES Classic for Easter appears to be extremely constraint. iStockNow only reports only 80 Target stores having stock on Easter Sunday. The number of stores has been rising by about 50 compared to Saturday. Some consumers will be able to find the NES Classic in stock today at their local Target store. The best option to find a NES Classic is Amazon Prime Now. The NES has been available over the past days in several cities including Dallas, Washington, Chincinnati and others.

Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo NES. These offers are a scam that lock up your cash. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch and NES Classic Amazon scam for details. The original Nintendo NES Controller has also risen in price to $59.99 on Amazon.com. This is now six times the regular price. There are plenty of 3rd party NES controller that sell for around $10. NES Classic on Amazon Prime Now Amazon has been offering the NES Classic on Amazon Prime Now almost daily throughout the past months. The retail giant makes small batches of the NES console available on its local delivery service since a couple weeks now. This is an obvious marketing campaign for Amazon Prime Now. Check the NES Classic listing for your Zip code on Amazon Prime Now. Shoppers can get notified about the NES Classic availability on Amazon Prime Now with iStockNow.

Slideshow T-shirt keepsakes are millennial must-haves Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon The trendlet Rocker - or band - Ts are the cool layer under a zip-up hoodie or tuxedo jacket that makes Prince or KISS fans squeal with nostalgic delight. Where does it come from? No one knows for sure exactly which boy band members were first to have their likenesses splashed on T-shirts (and other concert paraphernalia). But it's safe to say the Beatles, who formed in 1960, were among the first to be merched as such. As the 1960s rolled into the '70s and '80s, the Ts remained a favorite concert concession staple at Rolling Stones and Run-D.M.C. shows alike. Interesting band-T factoid: In 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood released their debut single, a sexually suggestive song called "Relax." It was temporarily banned from the airwaves, and the group created a T-shirt with the words Frankie Says Relax, which became at least as popular as the song. It wasn't until the late '90s that replica band Ts from fast-fashion labels like Junk Food started to be sold in mall staples like Wet Seal and Urban Outfitters. Eventually, H&M, Target, and, yes, even Walmart got in on the fun. As the web opened up a vast world of virtual retail spaces from Craigslist to eBay, those old Ts tucked in attics and basements became valuable. Throw in festival season, when everything hippie is hip again, and the style couldn't help but explode. In August, rock purists cried foul when Kendall Jenner appeared at the grand opening of a Beverly Hills boutique in a Slayer T-shirt. Were we to believe Jenner actually listened to hard rock? (Well, she did save the world from racism with a Pepsi.) Who is wearing it? Ke$ha in Metallica; Miley Cyrus in a twofer, Biggie/Tu-Pac; Cara Delevingne in KISS; Alicia Keys in Bob Marley. Need I go on? Would Elizabeth wear one? I own two A Tribe Called Quest Ts; one Earth, Wind, and Fire; one Stevie Wonder; and one Fleetwood Mac. I'm on the lookout for a 1970s-era Jackson 5 - when the whole group had Afros. Should you wear one? Yes. But only if you like music. ewellington@phillynews.com 215-854-2704 @ewellingtonphl All T-shirts are available at Haute Mama, 55 E. Main St., #7, Marlton, www.hautemama mala.com.

First came a book shop, but the real prize is in grocery Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Lucy Rock Sunday 16 April 2017 02.00 EDT The buzz of a text message heralds the latest offer on Amazon’s Treasure Truck – a funky lorry bedecked with funfair lights and retro signs that appears at random in the streets of Seattle with a one-off discounted product for sale. Alaskan cod, four fillets for $17, was the most recent item; a few days earlier it was two 16oz prime steaks for $40. Click on your Amazon app to buy your “treasure” and you’ll be told where the truck is so you can pick it up. “It’s fun,” says Nicole Jamieson, 42. “My kids love it because it looks cool with all its lights flashing. You need to move fast, though – they sell out quickly.” The truck, which launched a year ago, is stocked several times a month with deals that range from turkeys to Nintendo game consoles. There are rumours it will appear in London soon. Amazon Go checkout-free stores look set to come to UK Read more The Treasure Truck is a quirky manifestation of Amazon’s recent foray into the physical world it once shunned. In late 2015 it opened a book shop in a Seattle mall, and it is currently piloting two types of supermarket in the city, Amazon Go, a hi-tech convenience store, which eliminates the need to queue at a checkout, and AmazonFresh Pickup, where orders placed online can be picked up within 15 minutes at a drive-through. These are currently in beta mode, open only to employees. Amazon’s home town of Seattle is, in effect, its laboratory for its bricks-and-mortar retail experiments. Once glitches have been dealt with, these new stores may be rolled out – there are now five bookshops in the US, with plans for seven more. AmazonFresh vans, delivering groceries ordered online, can be spotted all over the city – another concept trialled in Seattle that was fine-tuned for years before being introduced elsewhere. These latest appearances of the company logo, with its swooshing arrow from the A to the Z, make the company’s presence ever more felt. Not everyone welcomes it. For some, it is mainly Amazon, which now employs 25,000 people in Seattle, that is to blame for the changing character of the city. Jeff Reifman, a consultant and writer, says: “I’m spending [less time in Seattle] now, and Amazon has a lot to do with that. Since 2010 Amazon has been increasing exponentially. There’s a huge impact on traffic, the cost of housing, the affordability.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amazon Go, which has been in beta mode since December. Customers simply take what they want and leave – tracking technology does the rest. Photograph: Paul Gordon/Zuma Press/Eyevine When he first moved to the city 25 years ago, he says there was “a slower pace”. “There was a connection to nature, a lefty awareness, a hippy culture, a focus on literature and the arts. Seattle is becoming one of the world’s greatest cities, but success has a cost in that it doesn’t have a rich cultural flavour to it.” Others, however, feel differently. At the Amazon bookshop one weekday lunchtime, Tiffany, a digital advertising executive in her 40s, was browsing for holiday reads. “I find it exciting for Seattle to have a new influx of people and ideas. It’s good for the city. It’s super-interesting seeing what they test here. I’m an avid Amazon user – as a mom it makes my life so much easier. I’ll certainly try Pickup and Go when they open.” Analysts say that Amazon is experimenting with bricks-and-mortar projects so it can capture a bigger chunk of certain retail markets. The bookshops are an attempt to attract those customers who prefer to browse in person. While doing so, they’re encouraged to become a $99-a-year Amazon Prime member, which gives free online delivery and extras that include being able to pay the cheaper website price for a book in the shop. But the bigger prize is the grocery market, which has been slow to move online. Online delivery accounts for only 1.4% of food sales in the US and 6.9% in the UK. Many shoppers want to see fresh fruit, vegetables and meat before they buy; others do not want to pay a delivery charge, and then there is the vast size of the US and the logistical issues that brings. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags, and walk out Don Stuart, a managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group, says: “The $800bn-plus grocery market is the Goliath, and Amazon would like to penetrate it more deeply than it can with just Prime or different types of direct online e-commerce activity.” Clearly, Amazon has competition from behemoths such as Walmart, and Seattle is where it is testing its battle plans. “It’s right in their backyard,” says Stuart. “They can keep an eye on things every day, control it, change the variables that they’re testing.” As Amazon spokeswoman Nell Rona puts it: “Experimenting close to customers here helps us innovate and learn faster in the early stages.” The AmazonFresh PickUp store on a busy main road in Ballard, an area that has seen rapid gentrification in recent years, was unveiled last month. The concrete and wood-clad building has a glass foyer with “Hello Ballard” in foot-high white letters on the window. A steel canopy protects parking slots where drivers pull in to pick up their shopping. A notice on a sandwich board says: “Beta Participant Entry”. A man in a green apron, holding a clipboard, stood outside last week. “It’s not open to the public yet,” he told people who wandered up. “You’ll sure hear about it when it is.” Some in the neighborhood aren’t so bothered. Ian Spicknall, 36, a taxi driver, says: “I prefer to go to the store and spend an hour or so choosing what I want, looking at prices. It’s hard to look at groceries on a tablet. It’ll be good for certain types of people, like mini-van moms, being able to pick up their groceries on the way home. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An AmazonFresh Pickup employee wheels grocery bags to a customer vehicle. Photograph by Stephen Brashear/Getty “I think they’re for people of a certain income – probably tech industry workers. I like mom-and-pop shops, the backbone of America, and you feel like you are supporting the community. Seattle is a lot about being green, going hiking, and breweries. People like to shop local.” Whether Amazon will eventually win over the likes of Spicknall remains to be seen, but it is trying to appeal to as many types of shopper as possible. Spokeswoman Nell Rona says: “We have all kinds of customers, who shop in various ways, who look for a wide range of items, and do so on any number of different occasions. As a result, we’ve created a variety of innovative services that satisfy customers’ different needs as it relates to grocery shopping.” In response to criticisms of Amazon’s dominating presence in Seattle, she says: “We’ve made a long-term commitment to invest in the city of Seattle. From unique retail space on the ground floor of all our buildings to public spaces nearby – such as an outdoor dog park, playing fields, a shared-use street that’s designed to be great for pedestrians as well as cars, art installations, covered public walkways and other amenities.” Brendan Witcher, a retail and e-commerce analyst at Forrester, says Amazon was trying to do to the grocery industry what Apple did to the music industry. “They’re trying to create a full grocery-to-home ecosystem. Starting with Alexa [Amazon’s digital personal assistant]. I can say: “Alexa, send me my groceries list minus garlic and tomatoes.” By having locations, Alexa can say to me: “Would you like them to ship or to pick up?” Done. “Amazon will own the device you order from; own the method of delivery; own all the products in that category; own multiple ways to get those products.” The Alexa tool is what other retailers should be most worried about, he says. “That is a critical difference in the customer journey that can allow Amazon to own so much of this space. That compares to me finding my phone or laptop, opening it up, logging in, going on the website, putting things into my shopping cart and checking out. Any time we see a huge amount of friction removed from the customer journey, we see adoption.” Success is not guaranteed though. “Just because Amazon is a great online retailer doesn’t mean it will instantly jump into physical and be amazing at it: they still need to learn about labour, traffic flows, real estate, perishable items in the store environment, security… all these things they didn’t have to worry about as an online retailer.” The Treasure Truck is fun and gimmicky. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a master of PR and getting people excited Amazon Go has been in beta mode since December and was due to open early this year. Shoppers scan their apps on entering the shop, put what they want in their bags and walk out. No need for checkouts, card transactions or bagging. Nor for cashiers, of whom there are 3.5 million in the US (the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery store workers, has strongly criticised the stores). The Wall Street Journal has reported that the technology has been crashing in tests when the store is too crowded. If these hitches can be solved, Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle, believes that Amazon Go could be a game changer for every segment of retail because the technology is not food-specific. He wrote in a blog: “The proposition for the consumer is simple – save time and hassle. The proposition for retailers may be even more compelling – save labour on the biggest component of the store (the front end) as well as improve throughput. “One can envision a future of Amazon bricks-and-mortar outposts: book stores, beauty stores, drive-through grocery stores and convenience locations all using this technology.” He told the Observer that Amazon had an enormous advantage over other retailers because 40% of US households were Prime members. “They know who their customers are already, they have credit and payment [details] for their customers, and their buying preferences.” Not that he thinks all Amazon’s ideas will have the same impact. “Take the Treasure Truck – it’s fun and gimmicky. Jeff Bezos [the founder and CEO] is a master of public relations, and getting people excited about an idea before it’s commercially viable, including the truck and the Amazon bookstore.” Amazon is not the only global brand using Seattle as a Petri dish. Among other initiatives, Starbucks has trialled its high-end coffee house, the Reserve Roastery, which will now open in several major cities worldwide. Innovation is threaded into Seattle’s DNA, according to Leonard Garfield, executive director of Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry. “In 1852 Henry Yesler was invited into the community of fewer than 100 people because he had a sawmill that was different to any other around. That initial technological innovation distinguished Seattle from any other of these small villages popping up in the woods of the north-west. “You can see it again with Bill Boeing and again with Bill Gates, and it keeps repeating itself – relatively young people who are willing to embrace the new technology, willing to take a risk and willing to invite people to the table who are different than the people already here.” He acknowledges that there has always been a counter-narrative to this. When Microsoft and Boeing were booming a few decades ago, there were people “who weren’t any too enthusiastic about lots of young tech people coming in and maybe changing a little bit of the character. “That scene has been there, but at the end of the day I think it’s a community where the smart idea has always won out.” Time will tell whether any of Amazon’s trial projects will be smart ideas.

(Aaron Rosenblatt/Daily Republic) Fairfield Kiwanis of Fairfield host annual Easter egg hunt By Susan Hiland From page A1 | April 16, 2017 0SHARES ShareTweet 0 SHARES ShareTweet FAIRFIELD — The Easter Bunny was greeted Saturday with squeals of delight from little children, and older ones ran over to say “hello” at Lee Bell Park. The Kiwanis of Fairfield have been bringing smiles to children’s faces this time of year for 53 years. The Kiwanis Fairfield Annual Easter Egg Hunt is a little different from others because the children hunt for candy and only a few eggs are hidden in the green grass. Those that find the special eggs get a large Easter basket filled with goodies. Kiwanian Tess Downey has become an expert at getting the event together for the past five years. Her car was filled with baskets for boys and girls. “Walmart again donated 36 baskets this year,” she said. Other businesses, such as Jelly Belly, Raley’s, Safeway and Metro Candy, also donated sugary goodies for the annual event. “We probably have hundreds of pounds of candy,” Downey said. Spencer Young, 13, of Vallejo, decided not to hunt for eggs and candy this year. He’s hoping his five siblings will share their loot with him later. “My favorite part of the day is spending it with family and celebrating what I believe, which is the resurrection of Christ,” he said. His grandfather, Tom Bender of Marysville, brought his dog and grandchildren for a day out, giving his daughter a chance to recover from surgery. He’s staying in their Travis Air Force Base home to help the family out. “She has the house to herself for awhile, so she can recover,” he said. High school students from Armijo High School’s Key Club came to help spread the candy on the grass. With about 20 Kiwanians and 15 high school students, the day came together in a short time. People showed up early, including Teresa Montes of Fairfield and her daughter Maile Swisher, 7½, who enjoyed the warmth of the sun while the Kiwanis tossed candy on the grass. “We have come to this event a couple of times,” Montes said. Her daughter expressed a love of Jolly Rancher candy and hoped the day didn’t end at Lee Bell Park but continued for a few more hours at some other Easter egg hunts. “Do you want to do a couple more after this?” asked her mother. Swisher gave her mom a big smile and a nod of her head. “I’m not going to be tired,” Swisher said. Her mother agreed and thought she might be getting some help with the boundless energy from some of the candy in her basket.

Check these retailers over the next few weeks.More NES Classic Edition will be in stock this month for the last time in the foreseeable future. If you’re looking to get your hands on Nintendo’s discontinued retro console, we’d advise checking out these retailers. Target: Target has been regularly stocking the NES Classic Edition throughout 2017, and stores will likely continue to do so until the very end. Here’s a link to the  store locator for physical purchases. If you want to buy online, try the  NES Classic Edition page. The latter is empty at the time of writing, however. Amazon: Should you want to get an NES Classic Edition at Amazon, your best bet is to make sure you have a Prime subscription first. Recently, Prime-exclusive sales are the only way this online superstore has been able to keep demand in check. You’re especially lucky if you live in a city with Amazon Prime Now availability. If the NES Classic becomes available via Prime Now, it will be sent to your house that day. Check out Amazon’s NES Classic Edition page, and click here for more details about Prime Now. If you don’t have Prime, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial. Best Buy: Best Buy has essentially the same deal as Target. Check out the store locator for physical purchases and try the NES Classic Edition page for online ones. GameStop: The GameStop situation is fairly similar as well. Here are the store locator and NES Classic Edition page should you want it. This time we didn’t link to a specific product because GameStop tends to sell popular items in pricey bundles. If you’re willing to pay more than others, you might be able to get a genuine NES Classic here. Walmart: Walmart has the same options as most other big-box stores. Here are a store locator and the  product page. eBay: This should be a last resort, because you’ll likely be paying a pretty penny to score an NES Classic. At the time of writing, the average price is about $300 or $400. Some listings are going as high as $600. If this is the path you take, always be sure to check star ratings and sellers carefully so you don’t get scammed. Look for lots of five-star reviews. Here’s a link to the latest NES Classic Edition auctions happening right now. NES Classic Online Stock Checkers And Tools: These sites will point you to specific retailers beyond the ones we’ve listed here. NowInStock: This site tracks stock from major retailers and can alert you to any changes via text or email. [here] BrickSeek: It’s an alternative to NowInStock. It monitors stock of the NES Classic at major retailers and can send alerts as necessary. [here] Reddit: There are a few subreddits you should be watching to keep track of availability. Try the ones for GameDeals and Nintendo. Wario64 Twitter: Wario64 is easily the best Twitter account for tracking game deals and availability of hot items. A tweet will be posted seconds after the NES Classic becomes available at any major store. [here] That’s just about anything you could ever possibly need to find an NES Classic Edition online or in store. Nintendo has confirmed final shipments will be doled out this month, but retailers have yet to announce specific dates or times. Should you be able to find one, the NES Classic Edition retails for $59 and comes preloaded with 30 retro games. Will you be hunting for an NES Classic Edition this month?

Email Print Facebook Tweet Post a comment By Conrad Swanson — Lawrence Journal-World April 17, 2017 Advertisement Since the Iola Police Department installed a pair of digital crime-information kiosks in town about two months ago, it has received a number of tips directly linked to the new tools. "I know of at least a couple $10,000 warrants that were called in," said Mike Ford, community resource officer for the Iola Police Department and president of Kansas Crime Stoppers. "We're a small town, so those are pretty big ones." Currently the town of 5,600 people has two of the kiosks, and the department is pleased with the number of tips it has received, Ford said. Now, Patrick Rapp, chairman of Kansas Crime Stoppers, is vying to install a few of the digital kiosks — called the Pro-Tektor — in Douglas County. He hopes they'll produce the same results the Iola Police Department is noticing. The kiosks stand several feet tall and have a display screen that is divided into three sections, Rapp said. The first section is current or breaking news, Rapp said. It can display Amber Alerts, missing-person reports or criminal news. "Maybe there's a robbery going on at 23rd Street," he said. "It's immediate." The second section displays community alerts, Rapp said. "Maybe we've got a storm coming, we've got a tornado in the area, we've got a bridge out," he said. Douglas County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Kristen Dymacek said if the kiosks were placed in the area, the sheriff's office could use them for public service announcements as well as for the community alerts. These types of public service announcements might include drug take-back events and things like "Coffee with a Cop," Dymacek said. And the third section displays a rotating list of offenders and suspects wanted by police, accompanied by their pictures and other information, Rapp said. The overall idea, of course, is to help make the community safer, Rapp said. The kiosks are meant to draw in additional tips to local law enforcement, help departments work together and raise community awareness. The goal is to find several area businesses who are willing to pay for the kiosks, which are priced at $3,895 with a monthly software fee of $50, Rapp said. In exchange, the businesses can have their logos displayed at the top of the kiosk. The law enforcement agency that operates the kiosk will have its logo prominently displayed at the bottom of the device. In addition, Ford said the business logos can be shown on the kiosk's screen. However, they're not allowed to advertise specific deals, sales or things of that nature. Ford said that in Iola, multiple businesses were offered an opportunity to buy into the kiosk for a fraction of the total cost. Then, all the businesses that contributed can have their logos stream across the kiosk's screen every two or three minutes, he said. Once the kiosks are paid for and installed, the company will train the operating law enforcement agency how to work them, Rapp said. At the moment, Rapp said he is lobbying the Douglas County Sheriff's Office for the task. He'd like to see the Lawrence Police Department involved as well, but with Chief Tarik Khatib retiring this summer, he's waiting until they have a less tumultuous schedule. Training the deputies wouldn't take much time, Rapp and Dymacek agree. In addition, the kiosks themselves are simple and easy to operate, Ford said. Now, he can update the screens directly from his cellphone if he needs to. "The investment from the Sheriff's Office would be minimal," Dymacek wrote in an emailed response to questions. "It would take no more time, effort and money on the part of the Sheriff's Office than it does entering information onto our social media accounts or relaying information to the media." Dymacek said the kiosks would complement the office's online efforts. "Obviously, social media is a great way to get out important information to the public," she said. "The kiosks would be an additional avenue to share information with the community." A part of that effort to share information is determining where to place the kiosks, Rapp said. They tend to have the most impact in high-traffic areas like Wal-Marts or other stores with large numbers of customers, he said. Ford said in Iola the department has one kiosk at the town's Wal-Mart and another in the lobby of the city's municipal court. "It's kind of funny, we get tips that coincide with court times," he said. "The people are probably coming in for court, hanging out in our lobby and they've started to call in tips." Dymacek said kiosks in Lawrence might also be effective downtown and on the University of Kansas campus. Ford said Iola's two kiosks suit the small town just fine and they likely won't be adding more in the near future. But considering the size of Lawrence and Douglas County, Rapp said he'd like to see four in the area. Perhaps two in Lawrence, one in Eudora and one in Baldwin City, he said. Another benefit to the devices, Rapp and Ford agreed, is that they can share information with other departments or jurisdictions who also use the kiosks. For example, if a wanted person in Iola moved to Wichita, Ford said he can send a digital wanted poster to that area, which would then be approved by local law enforcement and posted within a matter of minutes. "If there was information from a neighboring agency the Douglas County community needed to know about, such as an Amber or Silver Alert, that would be something we could and would want to have shared on the kiosks," Dymacek said. In all, Rapp said the kiosks are located in approximately 21 states. And all of them have the potential to communicate with one another. It's unclear if, or when, the kiosks might be available in Douglas County, Rapp said. But he'd like to see a few installed sooner rather than later. Really, it all comes down to finding businesses that are willing to front the costs and host their location, he said. Anyone who might be interested in the kiosks is encouraged to call Kansas Crime Stoppers at 785-843-8477, Rapp said. The organization is looking to add new community board members, as well.

AROUND THE STATE & NATION: SOUTH OF THE WALL BROWNSVILLE, Texas - The last time U.S. officials built a barrier along the border with Mexico, they left an opening at the small road leading south to Pamela Taylor's home on the banks of the Rio Grande. Taylor hadn't been told where the fence would be built, and she doesn't know now whether officials are coming back to complete it. "How would we get out?" asked Taylor, 88, sitting in the living room of the home she built with her husband half a century ago. "Do they realize that they're penalizing people that live along this river on the American side?" Taylor's experience illustrates some of the effects that the border wall President Donald Trump has imagined could have on residents in the Rio Grande Valley, the sunny expanse of bilingual towns and farmland that form the southernmost point of the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall could seal some Americans on the "Mexican side" - technically on U.S. soil, but outside of a barrier built north of the river separating the two countries. Landowners could lose property, and those that already lost some for the existing fence are already preparing for a new battle. By Nomaan Merchant. SENT: 1000 words. AP Photos. XGR-WHAT WE'RE WATCHING AUSTIN, Texas - The Texas House all but buried school vouchers. Could the Senate do the same with the school finance fix? After the Senate approved a sweeping bill offering taxpayer funds to private and religious schools, the House overwhelmingly passed language in its version of the state budget forbidding the practice - likely killing state-subsidized "school choice."

Now that his children have taken over, is it O.K. to eat there? By Lauren Collins Kathleen Purvis, a food editor, wrote, “When I learned about Bessinger’s history, I stopped buying his products.”CreditIllustration by David Sandlin In February of 2015, Kathleen Purvis, the food editor of the Charlotte Observer, drove to Birmingham, Alabama, to attend Food Media South, an annual symposium. The keynote session, “Hey, You, Pitch Me Something,” was meant to be a friendly wind-down to a weekend of talks. Participants were invited to get up in front of the editor of the Web magazine the Bitter Southerner and, well, pitch him something. There were several hundred people in the room. Purvis knew that in the name of politeness she should probably stay quiet, but she couldn’t resist the opportunity to “toss a good word grenade,” she recalled later, into a clubby crowd that she felt tended to overlook, along with chiffon cakes and canning, some of the most complicated questions about Southern cuisine. She raised her hand, and the editor nodded her way. “Men are the new carpetbaggers of Southern food writing,” she said. He replied, “Sold.” The resulting essay argues that “the Southern food-writing world has been unduly influenced, usurped, yes, even invaded, by a barbecue-entranced, bourbon-preoccupied and pork belly-obsessed horde of mostly testosterone-fueled scribes,” who dwell on hackneyed tales of Southern eccentricity without developing “the clear-eyed vision” to see them in a contemporary light. The piece generated controversy, though not as much as Purvis’s investigation into the racial dimensions of the practice of putting sugar in corn bread. “Honest to God, I really hate that hokey-jokey Hey-us-Southerners-aren’t-we-cute stuff,” she told me. “I’ve always said that my beat is food and the meaning of life.” Gamely, the organizers invited her to the conference the next year as a speaker. “I was getting ready to get up and talk,” Purvis said. “I was sitting there very quietly in a corner, and a woman came up to me and said, ‘So, is it O.K. to go back to the Piggie Park?’ ” The woman was referring to Maurice’s Piggie Park, a small chain of barbecue restaurants, established in West Columbia, South Carolina, in 1953. The original restaurant occupies a barnlike building on a busy intersection and is presided over by a regionally famous electric marquee that features the boast “WORLD’S BEST BAR-B-Q,” along with a grinning piglet named Little Joe. The Piggie Park is important in the history of barbecue, which is more or less the history of America. One reason is that its founder, Maurice Bessinger, popularized the yellow, mustard-based sauce that typifies the barbecue of South Carolina’s Midlands area. Another is that Bessinger was a white supremacist who, in 1968, went to the Supreme Court in an unsuccessful fight against desegregation, and, in 1974, ran a losing gubernatorial campaign, wearing a white suit and riding a white horse. In 2000, when the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina statehouse dome, Bessinger raised Confederate flags over all his restaurants. (By then, there were nine.) A king-sheet-size version went up over the West Columbia location, where he had long distributed tracts alleging, for example, that “African slaves blessed the Lord for allowing them to be enslaved and sent to America.” He was a figure whose hate spawned contempt, leading a writer from the Charleston City Paper to fantasize about how “Satan and his minions would slather his body in mustard-based BBQ sauce before they dined.” In 2007, Bessinger, who suffered from Alzheimer’s at the end of his life, handed the business over to his two sons, Paul and Lloyd, and a daughter, Debbie. In the months before his death, in 2014, they took down the flags and got rid of the slavery pamphlets. “Dad liked politics,” Lloyd, who serves as the public face of the operation, told a reporter. “That’s not something we’re interested in doing. We want to serve great barbecue.” By the time the news reached Kathleen Purvis, she hadn’t eaten Bessinger’s barbecue in nearly three decades. She grew up in Wilson, North Carolina, where her father was an R.C. Cola salesman and barbecue sauce is made with vinegar. Early in her career, she’d become a fan of the Bessinger family’s line of packaged foods—“handy for a quick dinner when I was working nights”—but, she wrote, in an article in the Observer in December, “When I learned about Bessinger’s history, I stopped buying his products. I followed a simple policy on the Piggie Park: I didn’t go there. Ever.” During the flag scandal, thousands of South Carolinians made the same call, going cold turkey. “I first made Maurice’s acquaintance when I was a child,” the barbecue expert William McKinney wrote, on the Web site of the Southern Foodways Alliance. “His barbecue was sold in the freezer aisle of the grocery store. It would bubble up in our family’s oven, its orange sauce as vivid as a river of lava. My mother would pack his barbecue in my lunch bag routinely, and I ate those sandwiches all the way through high school, wrapped up in aluminum foil and still a touch warm once lunch time came around.” It was as though Jif peanut butter or Katz’s Deli had become irredeemably tainted. “Please hurry—I don’t know how long my cat can keep him subdued.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon The Piggie Park had bad vibes, but it retained a pull on the community. For barbecue obsessives, it held a special fascination as one of the few restaurants in the country to still cook entirely over hickory wood, using no electricity or gas. One prominent Columbia resident, a black man, told me that he was addicted to Bessinger’s sauce, but that he would never admit it in public. The regime shift, then, represented a touchy moment. Some people wanted to go only if things had changed (but, if they were going to go, they wanted to get there before things had changed too much). For others, no amount of change was ever going to mitigate the legacy of a man who had caused so much hurt. Even asking if it was O.K. to return was a form of blindness to that pain. “They could change the last name, redo the building, then dig the old man up . . . it still wouldn’t matter to those who continue to carry the ‘chip on the shoulder’ mentality,” a man named James Last, of Wilmington, North Carolina, wrote in response to Purvis’s article, prompting Durward White, of Katy, Texas, to reply, “Are you saying no matter how vile and disrespectful his actions were we should move on? People still can’t move on from Tom Brady and deflate gate and that was 3 years ago.” Barbecue might be America’s most political food. The first significant reference to it that the barbecue scholar Robert F. Moss has been able to find is in “The Barbacue Feast: or, the three pigs of Peckham, broiled under an apple-tree,” an account of a 1706 banquet in Jamaica. The revellers were English colonists, but the pigs were “nicely cook’d after the West Indian manner”: whole, over coals, on long wooden spits on which they turned as a cook basted them in a spicy sauce (green Virginia pepper and Madeira wine), using a foxtail tied to a stick. Native Americans on the East Coast of North America used similar cooking techniques. But the main thing about barbecues is that they were social affairs, a day’s entertainment for the community. Between 1769 and 1774, George Washington attended at least six of them, he wrote in his diary, including “a Barbicue of my own giving at Accotinck.” A whole hog can feed as many as a hundred people. Barbecues, often held on the Fourth of July, became overtly political in the nineteenth century. As Moss writes in “Barbecue: The History of an American Institution,” they were “the quintessential form of democratic public celebration, bringing together citizens from all stations to express and reaffirm their shared civic values.” They adhered to a ritualized format: parade, prayer, reading of the Declaration of Independence, oration, and dinner in a shady grove near a drinking spring, after which dignitaries gave a series of “regular” toasts (thirteen of them, on patriotic subjects), followed by “voluntary” toasts from the masses (thirty or forty, on issues ranging from local elections to the free navigation of the Mississippi, or whatever else happened to be the day’s concerns). Often, the festivities turned rowdy. If an antebellum politician had wanted to rile folks up about building a wall, he would have done it at a barbecue. Before the Civil War, enslaved men often cooked these civic meals. They prepared their own feasts, too, either sanctioned by their owners or organized on the quiet. Much of the planning for the rebellions organized by Gabriel Prosser and Nat Turner took place at barbecues. After emancipation, black men continued to be some of the country’s leading pit masters, catering enormous spreads that featured everything from barbecued hogs, shoats, chickens, and lambs to stuffed potatoes, stewed corn, cheese relish, puddings, coffee, and cigars. In 1909, the Times noted the death of a man born around 1865, on a plantation in Edgefield County, South Carolina. “Pickens Wells, one of the most famous barbecue cooks in the South, dropped dead today while preparing a barbecue,” the item read. “Pickens prepared the famous barbecue at which President Taft was the guest of honor last Winter. White men here are raising a fund to erect a monument to the negro as a tribute to his fidelity and character.” Barbecue restaurants, like lunch counters, played an outsized role in the desegregation battles of the nineteen-sixties. In Birmingham, in 1964, Ollie McClung, of Ollie’s Barbecue, challenged the legality of the Civil Rights Act, arguing that the restaurant’s practice of denying sit-down service to black customers was none of the federal government’s business, since Ollie’s, a mom-and-pop operation, wasn’t involved in interstate commerce. Pointing out that forty-six per cent of Ollie’s’ meat came from out of state, the Supreme Court upheld the act’s constitutionality in a 9-0 ruling. It included a concurring opinion from Justice Hugo Black, an Alabamian who reportedly voted over the objection of his wife, a regular diner at Ollie’s. In 1964, Maurice Bessinger was the president of the National Association for the Preservation of White People. On August 12th of that year, Anne Newman and a friend drove to the West Columbia Piggie Park. They stopped outside the lot for curbside service. A waitress emerged and, seeing that they were black, returned to the building without speaking to them. Then a man with a pad approached the car but refused to take their order, even though white customers were being served. In Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., the district court asserted that “the fact that Piggie Park at all six of its eating places denies full and equal service to Negroes because of their race is uncontested and completely established by evidence,” but it concluded that the restaurants, because they were principally drive-ins, weren’t subject to the public-accommodation provision of the Civil Rights Act. When a higher court reversed the ruling, Bessinger appealed to the Supreme Court, claiming that being forced to serve black people violated his religious principles. He lost, in a unanimous decision. (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently cited the case in her Hobby Lobby dissent.) In “Defending My Heritage,” Bessinger’s 2001 autobiography, he claims that he and his family always treated black people well, citing his father’s practice, at a restaurant he owned, of giving a black employee discarded food and old grease. (Then he says that they fired her for stealing half a ham.) He writes, “I have concluded that the civil rights movement is a Satanic attempt to make it easier for a global elite, a group of extremely wealthy men with no Constitutional or national or cultural loyalties, working at an international level to eventually seize power in this country.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon Bessinger launched his run for governor from his cattle range, which he called Tara, after the O’Hara plantation in “Gone with the Wind.” One of his opponents remembered the primary race as “something between a comic opera and depressing satire.” Out of seven candidates, including a competing barbecue baron, Bessinger came in fifth, garnering 2.5 per cent of the vote. Business suffered, whether from his notoriety or his distraction. He decided to focus on rebuilding his restaurant empire, betting that people—white people, at least—would eventually forget about his period of activism. Many of them did. The corollary to white innocence is white passivity, the feeling that what one’s ancestors did was so messed up that it couldn’t possibly make a difference where one eats a barbecue sandwich. According to his birth certificate, Maurice Bessinger was born on July 14, 1930, on a farm near Cope, South Carolina. It occupied land that had been willed to his mother, Genora, by her grandfather, a veteran of the Civil War. Maurice thought that his real birth date was probably closer to July 4th, as his father, Joseph, went to the county courthouse, where births were recorded, only a couple of times a month. Maurice was the eighth of eleven children. In his autobiography, he says that he helped pick cotton from the age of four, using a “small, ten-pound little cloth sugar bag,” and graduating, at six, to “a full, 100-pound bag like the grown-ups used.” The family ate clabber, corn bread, grits, and vegetables that they grew in their garden. Meat was scarce; eggs, occasional. Maurice’s grandmother told him that, anticipating the arrival of Sherman’s troops, she and her neighbors had buried smoked pork shoulders, hams, bacon, and sausage, covering them with desiccated leaves to disguise fresh digging. When Maurice was nine, his father gave up farming, selling the family’s cow to buy a roadside café from a widow in Holly Hill, about halfway between Columbia and Charleston. Maurice started to work that year at the Holly Hill Café, swatting flies and bussing tables. By the time he was twelve, he was living in a small room in the back of the café, getting up at 5 A.M. to run the breakfast shift, spending a few hours at school, and then returning to the restaurant to work. Tired and skinny, he failed fifth and sixth grades. Two Saturday nights in a row, the local policeman shot a black man dead. Maurice wrote, in 2001, of one incident, “The perpetrator ran, and Mr. Workman dropped him with one shot at about 150 paces!” By 1946, Joseph had sold the Holly Hill Café and opened Joe’s Grill, where he perfected the secret recipe—its mustard kick supposedly inspired by his German roots—for which the family was coming to be known. In 1949, in Maurice’s senior year of high school, Joseph died of a heart attack. Despite Maurice’s insistence that his father had told him that the business would be his, the restaurant went to one of his brothers, who was seven years older and had come back from the war with three Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart. Furious, Maurice joined the Army and shipped out to Korea. In the aftermath of the fight over Joe’s Grill, many of the eleven siblings struck out across the state to set up their own enterprises. The Bessinger name now dominates South Carolina barbecue, presiding over a complex diaspora of interrelated but not always amicable interests. “I grew up being told that yellow sauce was my heritage,” the journalist Jack Hitt, who was raised in Charleston, wrote in the Times Magazine in 2001. “But it’s clear that without the siblings’ anxieties and their nomadic habits, Joe Sr.’s recipe would have died out after Joe’s Grill closed. South Carolina would have remained just another outpost in the national camp of red barbecue sauce.” By 2000, Maurice was easily the most successful of his generation of Bessingers. In addition to the nine restaurants around Lexington County, he had the frozen dinners, a mail-order business, and a bottling plant that distributed his Southern Gold sauce (with a Confederate flag on the label) to three thousand grocery stores along the East Coast, making him the largest barbecue wholesaler in the country. People called the Piggie Park “the best all-in-one barbecue restaurant in America.” Pat Buchanan, running for President on the Reform Party ticket, held fund-raisers at the main restaurant, whose pits burned non-stop. When an economic boycott of South Carolina, led by the state’s N.A.A.C.P. chapter, resulted in the removal of the Confederate flag from the statehouse dome, Maurice acted quickly. “I surrounded the city of Columbia with Confederate flags,” he later said. “I didn’t even tell my wife. I had it all planned.” Acting on a tip, John Monk, of the State newspaper, went to the Piggie Park and discovered Bessinger’s stock of revisionist literature. The N.A.A.C.P. decided to challenge him next. “We didn’t have any idea that we would change his mind,” Lonnie Randolph, Jr., the chapter’s longtime president, told me. “The goal was to make South Carolina, if there’s such a thing, whole again—to let folks know that this isn’t the way life should be.” Under pressure from the association, Sam’s Club, Walmart, Winn-Dixie, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Bi-Lo, Kroger, and Publix stopped carrying Southern Gold. Piggly Wiggly, the lone holdout, said that it would continue to stock the sauce, owing to customer demand. Bessinger was defiant. He likened his treatment to that of Jewish merchants during Kristallnacht, and told a newspaper, “Winn-Dixie is going to have to take that name off and call it Winn-Yankee.” Eventually, Piggly Wiggly dropped his products, too. Only months earlier, John McCain’s Presidential campaign had been ruined by a series of robocalls that asked voters, “Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain . . . if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?” Still, the views that a person could get away with espousing, at least in public, had changed since the nineteen-sixties. Joe McCulloch, a Columbia attorney, recalled, “After that, Maurice became radioactive, as did his barbecue.” In 2000, when the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina statehouse dome, Maurice Bessinger raised Confederate flags over all nine of his restaurants. A king-sheet-size version went up over the original location, where he also distributed tracts alleging that “African slaves blessed the Lord for allowing them to be enslaved and sent to America.” Photograph by Rich Glickstein / The State Bessinger claimed that his business shrank by ninety-eight per cent, amounting to a twenty-million-dollar loss. Eventually, he closed several restaurants and shut down the bottling plant. Nonetheless, he held his ground, portraying himself as a champion of free speech and state sovereignty, and vowing, like proud Southerners after Sherman’s march, to “root hog or die.” In the wake of the controversy, the Bessingers were able to cultivate an alternative clientele. If some diners continued to patronize the restaurants in spite of Maurice’s views (“Elton John’s gay, but I still listen to his music,” one customer told the Baltimore Sun in 2002), others showed up explicitly to support his cause (“The man’s got the guts to stand up for his beliefs,” another said). Glen McConnell, then a state senator, began stocking Bessinger’s sauce at CSA Galleries, a Confederate-memorabilia store that he ran with his brother. (I Googled McConnell, and was shocked to learn that he is now the president of the College of Charleston.) Even today, a rump of supporters regard Bessinger as the heroic victim of a liberal conspiracy. In 2014, a reader wrote to a local paper that “after Bessinger publicly supported keeping the Confederate Battle Flag on the S.C. Statehouse, his business was sabotaged by anti-Southern activists who would go into grocery stores and surreptitiously open a bottle of Maurice’s barbecue sauce and lay it on the top shelf, ruining a section of merchandise and creating a mess for the store to clean up.” In January, I called Lloyd Bessinger, Maurice’s elder son. Our conversation began smoothly, but, after a few minutes, he asked me if there would be any political angle to the article I wanted to write, and, when I said yes, things got uncomfortable. He sounded anguished as he said that, while he was no racist, he did not want to dishonor his father, whom he had known as a good and loving man. When we hung up, I was left uncertain whether the changes that Lloyd and his siblings had made at the Piggie Park were business decisions or evidence of a genuine transformation. Even if he had taken down the flags, Lloyd had never really explained why he made the move: out of principle, or pragmatism, or even, as a local news channel had reported, because of the rising cost of dry cleaning. (“I think we should all be united by one country and one flag, the American Flag,” he said later.) I wrote to him, asking if I could come to see him in Columbia. “It was nice talking to you today,” he replied, declining. “Hopefully time will heal the past.” One of the reasons I’d become interested in the Bessinger story is that it struck me as a small, imperfect test case for how to act in our political moment. Of the many moral issues that have beset Americans since November, one of the most nagging is that of the once beloved relative who appears at the Thanksgiving table spouting contemptible ideas. When something or someone you love troubles your conscience—when your everyday relationships are political acts—do you try to be a moderating force, or are you obligated to make a break entirely? I decided to visit some less fraught outposts of the Bessinger barbecue empire, hoping to get a sense of what makes yellow-sauce barbecue—a seemingly minor comfort—something that, like Amazon or Uber, even some people who consider themselves hugely opposed to the ethics of its purveyors find difficult to renounce. I grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, eating barbecue at Flip’s Barbecue House. It occupied a cinder-block building with an orange sheet-metal roof, and its hulking stuffed bear, reportedly shot by Flip himself, was once named one of the “seven wonders of the Cape Fear region.” Because barbecue is an intensely regional food, it’s also an intensely emotional one, the sort of thing you wake up in the middle of the night fiending for when, say, you’re pregnant and living three thousand miles from home. I got that. Still, I’d always got over it, even when Flip’s closed, in 2013. (If Eastern North Carolina-style barbecue is your thing, and you can’t have it, dump a pork shoulder and all the vinegar you’ve got into a Dutch oven and let it cook, low, on the stovetop for as long as you can stand to.) My first stop was Bessinger’s Barbecue, which two of Maurice’s brothers opened in 1960. I ordered a large barbecue plate. I also got a banana pudding. The restaurant’s Web site features testimonials from customers, including Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Beazley, of Evans, Georgia (“We flew in our private plane to shop for rugs. You were near and looked interesting. BEST BBQ EVER!”) and the television personality Andrew Zimmern (“The best spicy sauce I’ve ever tasted!”). I found a seat, tore a paper towel from a roll that sat on the table, and started eating. The barbecue was satisfying, full of browned bits and ends, but ever so slightly dry. I kept daubing on more sauce—its bright color suggested a starring role in a stain-removal infomercial—which may have been exactly the point. Lonnie Randolph, the N.A.A.C.P. chapter president who led a boycott of the Piggie Park, saw Maurice Bessinger as part of an ideological lineage that stretched back to the Civil War. “He represented a hate that was so deeply-rooted,” Randolph said. “I knew it was dangerous.” Photograph by Jacob Krejci After the meal, I asked at the counter if any Bessingers were around. Michael Bessinger, a third-generation barbecue man, appeared, with an apron tied around his waist, and led me to an upstairs office. Near the cash register, amid pictures commemorating visits from Elizabeth Dole and Mitt Romney, I’d seen a framed newspaper article in which a relative had spoken frankly of the Bessinger schism (“Everybody wanted to be a chief and not Indians”). Michael told me that his branch of the family wasn’t close to Maurice’s—they never got together for the holidays, for example—but he seemed to regard his uncle with a sort of detached amusement. “Maurice always liked the spotlight, positive or negative,” he said. He said that he, too, was trying to move forward without disrespecting the past. He was thinking about introducing alcohol and had recently added brisket to the menu—a concession to modern customers’ expectations of barbecue, however regionally dubious. Across town at Melvin’s Barbecue, I ordered another barbecue plate, this time with a side of butter beans. It arrived on a stylish brushed-metal tray, instead of a plastic plate. A list of the Ten Commandments printed on the side of my cup momentarily counteracted the progressive atmosphere, but then I walked over to the condiments bar, and, scanning vats of pickled peppers, noticed a bullet-shaped bottle with a green nozzle. Sriracha! I wondered if Melvin David Bessinger, who in 2004 inherited the business from his father, Melvin, might be the family’s great unabashed modernizer, the King Abdullah of yellow-sauce barbecue. Melvin, who died in 2012, was the fifth child of the eleven Bessinger siblings—the older brother who, after their father’s sudden death, Maurice wrote, “was conspiring against me to move me out of the business and take it for himself.” (Melvin was equally confident of his status as rightful heir, claiming that, when he was ten years old, his father had entrusted him with the secret recipe, promising, “Son, this sauce is gonna make you a million dollars some day.”) In 2000, when the N.A.A.C.P. initiated the boycott, Melvin swept in, picking up much of Maurice’s forfeited business. Melvin’s sauce was called Golden Secret, instead of Southern Gold. To dispel the suspicion that the business might be a front for Maurice’s—same sauce, Confederate-flag-less bottles—Melvin David issued a press release: “Melvin and his brother do not share political or social views. Despite their being brothers, they do not speak to each other. Melvin’s views on the Confederate flag, slavery and race relations are not those of his brother.” Maurice angrily told reporters, “I taught Melvin everything he knows about barbecue sauce—but I didn’t teach him everything I know.” Melvin David was out of town the day I visited the restaurant, but I reached him on the phone later. “When you come from a large family, not everybody’s going to agree,” he told me. “Some people can’t even get along with a brother and sister—how about if you have eleven and you all went into the same business?” Whatever the extent of the brothers’ animosity, he said, Melvin and Maurice had reconciled before Melvin died. “I’m ashamed to use my last name,” Melvin David had said, in a 2001 interview, a statement he now regretted. “I was being accused of a lot of things, a lot of negative things were coming my way, and it just kind of got to me,” he told me. “No doubt this was a great name that we were given when we were born.” Lexington County, which encompasses all but one of the dozen Piggie Park restaurants now in operation, remains a bedrock of hard-right politics. It is the home of Donnie Myers, the prosecutor known during his decades-long tenure as Dr. Death, for his zealousness in pursuing capital punishment; and Joe Wilson, the congressman who heckled President Obama during a speech to a joint session of Congress, shouting, “You lie!” In the 2016 Presidential election, 65.6 per cent of the county’s residents voted for Donald Trump. Lake E. High, Jr., the president of the South Carolina Barbecue Association, agreed to meet me at the original Piggie Park, in Columbia, one day in January. That morning, while renting a car in Charleston, I struck up a conversation with a late-middle-aged white man behind the counter. When I told him I was writing about Maurice’s Piggie Park, he reminisced, “You’d get a few cocktails in you, drive up, get that big-ass fried tempura onion ring, and yum, yum, yum.” He continued, “All that stuff you see on CNN, the liberal side—that division, that prejudice, that’s not who we are.” I took the keys and headed up to Columbia. When I reached the Piggie Park, I pulled the car in under the same formerly futuristic drive-in canopy where, fifty-three years earlier, Anne Newman had been refused service. I walked into the restaurant, where High—a big man in a sweater vest, with a mottled complexion and an omniscient smirk—was sitting at a round table. He explained that he’d got into barbecue as a challenge. “Somebody said, ‘We got the best damn barbecue in the nation, and the worst judges,’ and I said, ‘Well, I tell you what, I think we could fix that,’ and we started the South Carolina Barbecue Association in 2004.” When Anthony Bourdain visited South Carolina for an episode of “No Reservations,” he asked High to show him around. (As for his name, which he shares with his father, when his great-grandmothers were squabbling over what to call the coming child, High’s grandfather banged a fist on the table, pointed to a map that was hanging on the wall, and said, “What’s behind me?” “Lake Erie,” one of the great-grandmothers answered. “Well, that’s his name.”) September 8, 2014 Share Tweet Buy a cartoon In High’s estimation, the Piggie Park was “hundred-mile barbecue”—worth driving a hundred miles for. “It’s the iconic South Carolina sauce is what it boils down to,” he said, surveying the restaurant, with its lazy Susans, ceiling fans, and brown linoleum floor. Country music was playing on the radio; a muted television showed Fox News. The crowd was white, mostly older. In the guest book, I found comments that read, “Where’s the flag??!” and “Thanks for Taking It Down! God Bless!!” Near the entrance, a portrait of Maurice presided over a shrine of sauces. I ordered some barbecue. The chop was delicate, and the sauce was nearly fluorescent. “It tastes like mustard that’s got some mouthfeel to it,” High continued. “I’d say it’s somewhere in the middle of the light-to-sharp spectrum.” High spoke favorably of the Piggie Park’s new management—“Paul and Lloyd, and he’s got a daughter whose name I forget, cute girl. They’re real dedicated.” He had also thought highly of Maurice, who, he said, was always friendly and insisted on top-of-the-line ingredients. “He and Strom Thurmond were talking about all-natural thirty years ago,” he said, which seemed a bit like remembering Oswald Mosley for his advocacy of brown bread. I asked whether he thought Maurice’s political legacy posed a problem. “It wasn’t nearly as bitter as modern day makes it seem,” he said. He went on to talk about the trouble with racially interbred societies, the genetic basis of criminality, and his belief that the South should secede. After a disquisition that touched on everything from slavery (“It’s been around since Day One, and they talk about it in the Bible”) to Trump (“I happened to see him speaking to a crowd before he declared, and I came into the kitchen and I said, ‘Lovebug, that man’s gonna be President’ ”), he returned to the Piggie Park. “This is the most taken-for-granted barbecue house in America,” he said. Lonnie Randolph, the N.A.A.C.P. state president who had led the boycott of Piggie Park, told me that Maurice Bessinger was part of an ideological and economic lineage that stretched back to before the Civil War. “He represented a hate that was so deeply rooted,” Randolph said. “I knew it was dangerous.” He didn’t think that it was possible to let the past be the past. “ ‘It doesn’t affect me’—white people can say that, because it didn’t affect them. But, when I think of the damage that has been done, it cannot be undone,” he said. Things might be different, he conceded, if the new generation of Bessingers were taking some sort of active steps toward reparation. “But I’m not familiar with them supporting any issues that support the lives of the people he abused for so many years.” Representative Joe Neal, a longtime member of the state legislature and the chairman of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus during the flag battles of the early aughts, placed a similar emphasis on the younger Bessingers’ actions, or lack thereof, when I got him on the phone in January. (Neal died the next month.) “I don’t think they have to apologize,” he said. “I think what people are waiting for is to find out who they are.” After talking to Randolph and Neal, I couldn’t stop thinking about Nat Fuller’s Feast. Nat Fuller, born in 1812, was a slave who became a celebrated restaurateur, opening the Bachelor’s Retreat, a Charleston catering hall famed for its pastries, game, and turtle soup. In April of 1865, two months after Charleston surrendered to Union forces, Fuller orchestrated a grand meal—historians have remembered it as a “reconciliation banquet”—to which he invited dozens of the city’s prominent citizens. A society doyenne wrote in her diary of the “miscegenat dinner, at which blacks and whites sat on an equality and gave toasts and sang songs for Lincoln and Freedom.” The evening’s menu has been lost to time, but, in 2015, a group of chefs and scholars tried to re-create the meal, using dishes that Fuller had served at other events. On a drizzly April night, forty Charlestonians gathered for the feast. “This is the beginning for all of us,” B. J. Dennis, a black chef, said, making a toast. Fifteen days earlier, Walter Scott, an unarmed black man with a broken brake light, had been shot in the back by a white North Charleston police officer. Two months later, the white supremacist Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and killed nine people, including Clementa C. Pinckney, Mother Emanuel’s pastor. Pinckney was at the dinner that night, trying to acknowledge and refute history over watermelon brandy, chowchow, shrimp pie, chapon chasseur, and truffled squab served with silver ewers of walnut ketchup. Before I left West Columbia, I decided to try Lloyd Bessinger one last time. In the wood-panelled office at the main Piggie Park, a secretary invited me to have a seat. Lloyd walked out: trim, mostly bald, wearing navy chinos and a red Piggie Park polo. Lloyd was as unassuming as his father had been outlandish. His ambition, it seemed, was to be left alone. When I asked about the 2000 boycott, he said, “I try not to think about it that much anymore.” “Do you support white supremacy?” I asked. “No! Of course not,” Lloyd said. “White supremacy is totally wrong—and my father was not like that. He was a Southerner and a South Carolinian. He enjoyed reading about the history and the heritage of America.” Lloyd had recently been to a friend’s funeral at a black church, and “two hundred people were there, and”—he chuckled—“ninety per cent of them were black, and that was fine.” I told Lloyd what Lonnie Randolph and Joe Neal had said, that people needed a tangible sign that the Bessinger family understood the pain they had caused, and that until they gave one it would persist. “Mmmkay,” he said. “Well, I don’t know how I can do that. I’m not objecting to doing that. I just need to know what that is.” “Excuse me, sir—care to take a moment to check out my new clipboard? Ma’am? I just got a new clipboard. New clipboard, anyone? Anyone?”May 3, 2010 Share Tweet Buy a cartoon That Lloyd could afford not to have much of an opinion—that he simply didn’t have to think about race while making choices big and small—was a privilege he had never considered. He seemed caught between the worlds of his parents and his children, the values with which he had grown up and those he now perceived to be ascendant. I recalled what Kathleen Purvis had said to me about Lloyd: “I felt very sympathetic to him. My family’s from Georgia—I have family members who had beliefs, used language that was awful. My grandmother, the last thing she remembered about me when she was disappearing into dementia was ‘Oh, yeah, that’s the girl that loves black people so much.’ That was a very painful thing, and to ask me to denounce my grandmother for that—you can’t. So being Southern always involves that complicated dance.” “I can’t change anything,” Lloyd said, before I left. “All I can do is speak for myself today. I don’t look at race. I look at people. We’re all equal, O.K.?” In 2009, the Daras family, of Fort Washington, Maryland, moved to Orangeburg, South Carolina. Tommy Daras had just retired from running gas stations. “I’d come down here fishing, and I liked it,” he said recently. “I always thought the people were nice, and Florida was too hot.” For a while, he and his wife, Deborah, enjoyed the weather and their newfound freedom. Then, in 2015, they spotted a cute brick bungalow on John C. Calhoun Drive, an out-of-business Piggie Park. “We were at home, bored, and decided to clean it up, fix it up, and make some money on it,” Daras said. They added teal-and-white awnings and named the place Edisto River Creamery & Kitchen. Daras recalled, “An ice cream shop near a park, how hard could that be?” They hosted such events as Bible studies and a Pokémon Go tournament. Their outdoor sign welcomed hunters and advertised a bacon palmetto burger. Daras said, “I did notice that there were no black customers”—the population of Orangeburg is eighty per cent African-American—“and I was trying to figure that out. Man, why am I not getting their business?” The Darases bought the property from Maurice Bessinger’s children, knowing that a Confederate flag flew on a small bit of land in a corner of the lot. From what Daras understood, the parcel, through some quirk of local real-estate history, belonged to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, having been donated to them by Maurice Bessinger in 2005. Daras wasn’t a fan of the flag, but it didn’t really bother him. It became impossible to ignore, however, when, shortly after the massacre at Mother Emanuel, members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans showed up, took down the flag, and replaced it with a new one that was three times as big. “Before, I’d just sucked it up, but then it was, like, ‘Man, I’ve got to try to do something here,’ ” Daras said, explaining that he could no longer abide “this huge flag sticking up in the air telling everyone to screw themselves.” Daras reëxamined his deed. With the help of a lawyer, Justin Bamberg, he is filing a lawsuit arguing that the corner parcel belongs to him. (The Sons of Confederate Veterans maintain their ownership.) Bamberg, who is thirty, grew up near Orangeburg and now serves as a Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. I called him to discuss the details of the lawsuit, but, as our conversation went on, he started talking about what the Piggie Park had meant to him as a young African-American man. “It was one of those places I remember as a kid, always riding by there, feeling like in some people’s eyes I was less a person. I did not go into Maurice’s until I was in college,” he said, recalling one afternoon when he had felt compelled to just walk into the restaurant, leaving without ordering anything. “It was a personal thing—for so long, this place always had control over some part of how I felt. For me, it was like, ‘It’s gonna end today.’ ” It will be up to a court to conclude the story of Maurice Bessinger’s flags, the last of which is, for the moment, still flying, his final provocation. ♦ Lauren Collins began working at The New Yorker in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

News Nation & World Midwest In Kiron, Iowa, pop. 229, the meaning of a life, a death and another cup of coffee Kiron, Iowa Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post Russell Paulson shows up for coffee at the Quik Mart in Kiron, Iowa. Regulars gather one by one each morning and afternoon, except Sundays. Russell Paulson shows up for coffee at the Quik Mart in Kiron, Iowa. Regulars gather one by one each morning and afternoon, except Sundays. (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) Stephanie MccrummenWashington Post Russell Paulson had already heard by the time he arrived at the Quik Mart for his afternoon coffee. Walt Miller had died. "Died last night, huh?" someone was saying as Russell pulled up a chair. "Yeah, last night," another man said. Russell listened; he had known Walt. At the age of 80, he knew almost everyone in Kiron, a town of 229 people, one of whom is U.S. Rep. Steve King, who has a house on the edge of town. Russell knew King, too, knew that he was the sort of person always stirring controversy, often by raging against what he called "cultural suicide by demographic transformation." More recently, King had said that "we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies," a comment embraced by prominent white supremacists and widely condemned around the country as demonizing Latino and other non-European immigrants. There was little controversy across King's district, though, a swath of rural America made up of tiny towns with tiny, aging white populations that routinely elected King with more than 70 percent of the vote. In Kiron, people brushed it off as King being King, a man they all knew, expressing a plain truth they all understood: the white population was shrinking and towns like theirs were vanishing, with the few exceptions being places such as Denison, Iowa, a pork-processing town 20 minutes down the highway where population growth was being driven by immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Kiron, meanwhile, was losing steam. According to the most recent census figures, the population included nine Mexicans; the other 220 were all white, and their numbers were decreasing by 10 or so each year, and now, on a Wednesday, by one. "Oh Walt Miller? He did pass?" Dwain Swensen, 67, said, sipping his coffee. "What'd he have, pancreatic cancer or something?" said Ron Streck, 70. "Liver," said Herman Kohnekamp, also 70. "I think that's what it was, wasn't it, Russell?" "I knew he passed but didn't know any details," Russell said. It was a quiet afternoon, the ritual 3 p.m. coffee in a place where, as one regular put it, "You can figure out Steve King by understanding all of us." Every day but Sunday, the bell on the front door rang as they arrived. The wood-paneled backroom was waiting. The Bunn-o-Matic and the Styrofoam cups. The space heater humming. The clock with the squinting Merit cigarette man on one wall, the calendar on the other, the cracked blinds dangling over the window where the view through the slats was a sea of farm fields, and on a hill in the distance, a stand of evergreens where the cemetery was. Now the bell on the front door rang again, and Russell looked up. "Oh," Ron said under his breath, seeing who it was. "Here comes trouble." Kiron, Iowa Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post Bob James, left, Herman Konnenkamp, center, and Russell Paulson often gather for coffee around 6:30 a.m. in the wood-paneled backroom of the Quik Mart in Kiron, Iowa. Bob James, left, Herman Konnenkamp, center, and Russell Paulson often gather for coffee around 6:30 a.m. in the wood-paneled backroom of the Quik Mart in Kiron, Iowa. (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) It was Kevin Lloyd, 52, who came in occasionally, and had been in the day before, all riled up about the latest Steve King situation, waving his hands and going on about how people had misunderstood what he'd meant about "other peoples' babies." "If you're American, you got to take care of America!" he had said then. "I love that people want to come here from Mexico, from Ukraine, from the Middle East, but they need to come here legally." Dwain, Ron, a woman named Jane Gronau and Russell had been there, sipping their coffees, as Kevin had continued that he had no idea why people would call King a "white supremacist," or, for that matter, why people would call President Donald Trump racist. "Now, is Barack Hussein Obama a Muslim? In my opinion, yes," he had said, and that had brought him to the other thing he figured King meant about babies. He had meant Muslim babies of the Muslims that Obama had allowed into the country. "And here, I'm going to quote a great president, Abe Lincoln," he had said. "He said the fall of America will come from the inside. Well, if you're allowing all these children in, and if they hate America, how long is it going to be before we're not the United States of America anymore?" Jane had nodded: "If you study the number of Muslims, there are going to be so many here, and they're going to have so many kids, they're going to be able to take over that way." Dwain had nodded: "They say 'freedom of religion' but if you're Muslim, and you become Christian, you're ousted. Sometimes, they kill 'em." "They behead 'em," Kevin had said into a quiet Iowa afternoon. "I think what King was trying to get across is, look: We can only grow so many hogs, so much beans and so much corn," Kevin had said. "If we let everybody in, we're going to be without a food source. And what happens when that's gone? Then we're all in trouble." Chaos, beheadings, starvation, the death of one America and the rise of another - that was the trouble Kevin had raised the day before, and now he was back, interrupting the conversation about Walt Miller. "What are you up to, Mr. Paulson?" he said to Russell. "Just listening and learning," Russell said, looking at the floor, holding his coffee. "Every once in a while, I learn something here. Every once in a while, I learn something about myself." "So how old was Walt?" Ron continued. "Mid-60s, I'd say," said Herman. "Died last night," Ron said again. "Last night," Herman said again. After a while, Russell asked, "I wasn't sure if he was home?" "Yeah, he was at home," Herman said, and Russell was quiet the rest of the afternoon. Kiron, Iowa Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post Russell Paulson, 80, holds a portrait of his wife, Glenda, who died 18 months earlier. Russell Paulson, 80, holds a portrait of his wife, Glenda, who died 18 months earlier. (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) The next day, Russell had his morning coffee and got into his car. He stopped by the bank where he'd been going since the 1940s. "Hi Russell," the one teller said to her one customer. He got back into his car and drove one block to the edge of town, turned onto the two-lane highway, then one long gravel road after another, straight lines stretching out into still-fallow fields. "Some of the roads have been abandoned," he said. "Because there's not as many people living out here, the roads just disappeared." He knew the roads better than anyone. His own family's roots in the area stretched back to the 19th century, when the U.S. government was aggressively removing Native American tribes to make way for one of the largest immigration waves in American history. The Swedes came, the Germans came, the farms, the towns and generations of babies, one of whom was Russell Elmer Paulson, born in 1927. He was raised on his mother's family farm in rural Kiron and never left other than a stint in the army, and one in Dubuque, Iowa. "It wasn't for me," he said, driving along. He and his wife, Glenda, inherited land when Russell's parents died and lived on it until they retired and moved into town. Russell's work had been farming and insurance adjusting. His culture was being a Methodist, a Mason and listening to polka, though most of that had fallen away. The church he and Glenda had gone to "died for lack of people and money," he said. There were hardly any Masons left. Polka was not enjoying a revival. His kids had left for jobs in other areas. Glenda had died last year. "See that ridge? That's the old railroad bed," he said now, driving along, squinting through his gold-rimmed glasses. "My aunt bought this," he said, passing a stand of trees where farmhouses had been. "Walt would go there," he said, pointing out a repair shop where Walt Miller had coffee, and soon he turned onto a narrow dirt road leading to the farm where he and Glenda had lived, a collection of storage buildings where Russell now kept his old tractors, and one he used as an office, where he went these days to work crossword puzzles or just sit and think. "Commune with God and the birds," he said. "Well, not too many birds now." He glanced around at the old buildings, now shuttered and locked, though someone had broken into one of them recently. "They stole a bunch of tools and such," Russell said, pulling back onto the gravel road. "No need to get all worked up about it." He had a huge bag of peppermint Life Savers on the console, and he unwrapped one and put it in his mouth. He passed a rotting barn and a bird on a stretch of barbed wire, and after a while, a gray house with a huge American flag. "This is Steve King's house here," he said, looking at it. He had known King a long time and saw no reason to be bothered by something or other he said. He supported King -- "I have no reason in the world to dislike the man" -- but wasn't one to rant about politics. He had no computer, no smartphone. His television had no cable. He watched a half-hour of national news, a half-hour of local, followed by "Wheel of Fortune" and Lawrence Welk. He ate chicken tenders and food he described as "American." "He's just kind of one of us," Russell said of King, driving on past a field where a church had burned down, and the home of a man who'd died last year. It began to rain. "When it comes down like it's doing now, it's just wonderful," he said. He drove past fields and more fields until he came to another stand of trees on a hill. "This is the cemetery," he said, pulling in. He drove slowly past the headstones. "A lot of these people I knew," he said and began reading names. "Larson." "Lind." "Gustafson." "Paulson -- this would be my folks right here," he said, and then he noticed the time, almost 3 p.m. He headed back to town, pulling onto Main Street where a wooden sign said, "Kiron, Blessed with the Best." After King had made his comment about babies, some out-of-town protest group had put up another sign below that one that said, "White Supremacist." The sign didn't make any sense to Russell and, after it was removed, his main worry was that the protesters might have damaged the town sign, which had started to rot a few years ago. Russell had taken on the job of maintaining it. He had trimmed the tree branches that had grown through the wood. He had taken down "Blessed with the Best" and repainted each of the letters. He went to a lumberyard and had a new K, I, R, O, and N made, painting each letter several times and spraying them with wood preservative. One year, he and Glenda had planted a bed of petunias and geraniums. "I don't think we will ever have a better display of flowers," he said now, and soon he was pulling up to the Quik Mart for the afternoon coffee. As he walked inside, he saw a funeral notice on the front door with a photo of a smiling man in gold-rimmed glasses. "Oh," Russell said, pausing for a moment. "There's Walt." He glanced at the funeral information for Walt Miller, poured his fourth coffee of the day, and sat down in the backroom. Dwain and Charlie Harm were already there but they weren't talking. A car swooshed by. An eighteen-wheeler swooshed by. Charlie tapped his nails on the table. The Coming Changes in Small Town Iowa Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post The Kiron Cemetery sits on a hill overlooking the tiny town of Kiron, Iowa. The Kiron Cemetery sits on a hill overlooking the tiny town of Kiron, Iowa. (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) The next day, the bell rang as the door with the funeral notice swung open, and it was Dwain, then Bob James, then Herman, then Russell. The Merit cigarette clock showed a few minutes after 3 p.m. Russell got the coffee pot and poured. The bell rang again, and it was a man named Glen Ballantine. "Time for plowing?" Herman asked the 84-year-old farmer. "Two weeks," Glen said, sitting down. Bob was reading the paper. Russell was sipping his coffee, looking out the window. "Got the visitation tonight," Herman said. He didn't have to mention Walt Miller's name because they all knew what he meant. They went back to talking about plowing, and Glen was saying how different farming was now than when he was a young man, which for some reason reminded him of one of his first jobs, digging graves. "For 18 bucks," he said. "You dug a regular grave for 18 bucks?" said Dwain. "Oh yeah, and we had to fill 'em back up again," said Glen. "I helped dig one once," said Russell. "You know, manually. Only one. I don't know what I got paid. But. That's a long way down to the bottom of that." "If there was frost in the first foot, you got $1 more," said Glen. "What'd you use to get through the frost?" asked Bob. "Pickax and sledgehammer," said Glen. "And when we'd fill 'em, we'd fill 'em in 14 scoops. We were just little kids, more or less." "We had more dirt than we needed," Russell said. "And had to --" "Had to haul that away," said Glen, finishing his sentence. "Had to put that on the pickup," said Russell, and they went on talking like that until Herman got up to leave. It was after 3:30 p.m. "Funeral home starts, what, at 4?" Herman said. "Four till 7, it says on there," Russell said. The funeral home was in Denison, and the sun was going down as Russell turned onto the two-lane highway toward one of the only towns in Steve King's district that was growing, and which appeared in the distance as a cluster of lights and rising steam from the pork-processing plant. Russell turned by the Walmart, bustling on a Friday payday, and turned again into a neighborhood where Latino kids were playing in a yard. Up a hill, he parked in front of the funeral home, where people were still streaming in near 7 p.m. Russell made his way through the receiving line, his hat off, comb lines visible in his gray hair. He shook hands with Walt's family, who thanked him for coming, and inched forward until he reached the open casket. He stood there a moment. He looked at Walt. He looked at the light-blue satin lining and the farm scene etched into it. A man stood next to Russell. "Went fast," he said of Walt, who had passed away soon after his diagnosis. "That's what you hope for." "I do," said Russell, still looking at Walt, and soon, he headed back to Kiron. The Coming Changes in Small Town Iowa Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post The fresh grave of Walt Miller at Kiron Cemetery in Kiron, Iowa. The fresh grave of Walt Miller at Kiron Cemetery in Kiron, Iowa. (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) The funeral was the next day at Zion Lutheran Church in Denison, and more people came from Kiron and other vanishing towns like Odebolt and Ida Grove. They sat in jeans and dresses and suits on the wooden pews of a church founded in 1872, and read about Walt in the program, where it was said that "farming and fixing equipment and household items were his favorite things to do," and soon the church bells began ringing. The pews creaked as everyone stood and watched the pallbearers roll in the coffin draped in a white cloth with a red cross, and a procession of dozens of family members that included exactly one baby, a girl with a black ribbon around her head. "Your world has changed," the pastor began. When it was over, people got back into their cars and drove 20 minutes up the highway to the cemetery in Kiron, a long procession of headlights passing through fields and more fields, then turning right, then heading up the hill to the stand of evergreens, and afterward, at 3 p.m., the bell on the Quik Mart door began ringing. It rang for Herman, who arrived with a loaf of homemade bread. It rang for Dwain, for Bob, and for Charlie, who shuffled into the backroom and said, "Buried a nice guy this morning." It rang for Russell, who poured his coffee, walked back into the wood-paneled room, and pulled up a chair. "Strawberries come to life this time of year, Russell?" Dwain asked. "I don't know," Russell said. They talked about the frost, and when spring might arrive. "Well, I better get moving," Charlie said and headed out. "I got things to do, too," Russell said, but then he didn't leave, not yet. He got up and sat where Charlie had been, closer to the window. "Well, I gotta go," Herman said. "See you, Herman," Russell said. "Bye, Herman," Dwain said, and now there were just the three of them left. Dwain cleared his throat. A car passed by. The space heater hummed. Bob finished his coffee. Russell swallowed the last of his. "You want more coffee, Mr. Bob?" Russell asked. "Do you?" said Bob. "Yeah," Russell decided, and walked over to get the coffee pot. He poured some into Bob's cup. He poured some into Dwain's cup. He filled his own and sat down again. He tapped his thumb on the table. Eventually he stood up and walked toward the door, where Walt's funeral notice no longer was. "See ya, Russell," said Dwain. "See ya, Russell," said Bob. "I hope so," Russell said.

The new round of funding will keep Flipkart’s fires burning against Amazon’s onslaught; more importantly, it will also keep the party going for the bargain-hunting Indian consumer. While the valuation of Flipkart has gradually eroded to $11.6 billion in this round of funding compared to the peak valuation of $15.1 billion two years ago, the money will infuse new life into Flipkart in a contest that seemed to be running away in favour of Amazon. Falling Short E-tailing, or the selling of everything from mobile phones and electronics to books and bed sheets on the digital marketplace, hasn’t performed as well as it had been predicted. After various forecasts of galloping revenues of $120 billion by 2020, today all the players put together are struggling at about $15 billion. Growth has been a measly 16 per cent last year with online sales accounting for just two per cent of total retail sales. China is over 40 times ahead with online retail sales of $752 billion in calendar 2016, a 26.2 per cent increase from the previous year; and online purchases accounting for as much as 15.5 per cent of the total retail pie. So far, Indian e-tailers have only losses to report. Flipkart more than doubled its net loss to Rs 2,000 crore in FY16. Amazon India’s losses for FY17 could touch Rs 6,500 crore. As funding is drying up, the industry is going through sharp consolidation. Snapdeal has initiated a merger process with Flipkart. Two years ago, Snapdeal founder Kunal Bahl boasted he would achieve gross merchandise value of $10 billion by the end of FY16. Today, Snapdeal is virtually non-existent. Discounting Strategy The traditional big e-tailers’ strategy is to sell products at heavily discounted prices, with the option of returning the product. This cash burn route, they hope, will shift consumer behaviour away from physical stores to dependency on the ease and comfort of online sales. Once the consumer is ‘hooked’, discounts will disappear and profits emerge. But, the Indian story has never been so simple. The severe competition between well-funded players has ensured that discounts have gotten bigger. The advantage of saving on physical stores has been eroded by the huge cost of marketing and of logistics – of supply chains, of warehousing, and of dealing with returns. The Indian consumer is smart. He is not loyal to any seller and is willing to bend the rules. Sample this: A young professional in Dehra Dun who regularly shops online explained his modus operandi. When movies were still being watched on DVDs, he would order half a dozen, watch all of them overnight, and then ship the DVDs back claiming they were defective. No Leader In both the US and China, after fierce competition and cash burn, a single e-tailer emerged as leader and was able to call the shots in pricing and strategy. In the US, it is Amazon that dominates by a huge margin. For online sales for the 12-month period up to May 2016, eMarketeer reported Amazon revenue growing nearly 16 per cent to a humungous $82.7 billion compared to the nearest rival Walmart at $12.5 billion. Similarly, Alibaba has emerged the leader in China. Its various retailing sites control over 80 per cent of the market, and in 2016 notched sales of over $20 billion and net profit of $5.8 billion. In India, there is no leader. So far, it has been a three-way fight among Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. Snapdeal has given up but there is a third fighter now waiting in the wings. The Vijay Shekhar Sharma-founded Paytm, which has successfully run an e-wallet operation, is now launching an online shopping marketplace in alliance with Alibaba. The China giant has pumped in $200 million so far and could hold up to 50 per cent in the new venture. This means, the three-way slugfest will continue with no dominant leader any time soon. This also means the happy times of bargains and discounts are here to stay for a while.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie McCrummen By Stephanie McCrummen April 16 at 6:30 PM Russell Paulson shows up for coffee at the Quik Mart in Kiron, Iowa. Regulars gather one by one each morning and afternoon, except Sundays. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) KIRON, Iowa — Russell Paulson had already heard by the time he arrived at the Quik Mart for his afternoon coffee. Walt Miller had died. “Died last night, huh?” someone was saying as Russell pulled up a chair. “Yeah, last night,” another man said. Russell listened; he had known Walt. At the age of 80, he knew almost everyone in Kiron, a town of 229 people, one of whom is U.S. Rep. Steve King, who has a house on the edge of town. Russell knew King, too, knew that he was the sort of person always stirring controversy, often by raging against what he called “cultural suicide by demographic transformation.” More recently, King had said that “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” a comment embraced by prominent white supremacists and widely condemned around the country as demonizing Latino and other non-European immigrants. There was little controversy across King’s district, though, a swath of rural America made up of tiny towns with tiny, aging white populations that routinely elected King with more than 70 percent of the vote. In Kiron, people brushed it off as King being King, a man they all knew, expressing a plain truth they all understood: The white population was shrinking, and towns like theirs were vanishing, with the few exceptions being places such as Denison, a pork-processing town 20 minutes down the highway where population growth was being driven by immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Kiron, meanwhile, was losing steam. According to the most recent census figures, the population included nine Mexicans; the other 220 were all white, and their numbers were decreasing by 10 or so each year, and now, on a Wednesday, by one. “Oh, Walt Miller? He did pass?” Dwain Swensen, 67, said, sipping his coffee. “What’d he have, pancreatic cancer or something?” said Ron Streck, 70. “Liver,” said Herman Kohnekamp, also 70. “I think that’s what it was, wasn’t it, Russell?” “I knew he passed but didn’t know any details,” Russell said. It was a quiet afternoon, the ritual 3 p.m. coffee in a place where, as one regular put it, “you can figure out Steve King by understanding all of us.” Every day but Sunday, the bell on the front door rang as they arrived. The wood-paneled backroom was waiting. The Bunn-o-Matic and the Styrofoam cups. The space heater humming. The clock with the squinting Merit cigarette man on one wall, the calendar on the other, the cracked blinds dangling over the window where the view through the slats was a sea of farm fields, and on a hill in the distance, a stand of evergreens where the cemetery was. Now the bell on the front door rang again, and Russell looked up. “Oh,” Ron said under his breath, seeing who it was. “Here comes trouble.” *** Coffee time for the regulars in the wood-paneled backroom of the Quik Mart. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) It was Kevin Lloyd, 52, who came in occasionally, and had been in the day before, all riled up about the latest Steve King situation, waving his hands and going on about how people had misunderstood what he’d meant about “other peoples’ babies.” “If you’re American, you got to take care of America!” he had said then. “I love that people want to come here from Mexico, from Ukraine, from the Middle East, but they need to come here legally.” Dwain, Ron, a woman named Jane Gronau and Russell had been there, sipping their coffees, as Kevin had continued that he had no idea why people would call King a “white supremacist,” or, for that matter, why people would call President Trump racist. “Now, is Barack Hussein Obama a Muslim? In my opinion, yes,” he had said, and that had brought him to the other thing he figured King meant about babies. He had meant Muslim babies of the Muslims that Obama had allowed into the country. “And here, I’m going to quote a great president, Abe Lincoln,” he had said. “He said the fall of America will come from the inside. Well, if you’re allowing all these children in, and if they hate America, how long is it going to be before we’re not the United States of America anymore?” Jane had nodded: “If you study the number of Muslims, there are going to be so many here, and they’re going to have so many kids, they’re going to be able to take over that way.” Dwain had nodded: “They say ‘freedom of religion’ but if you’re Muslim, and you become Christian, you’re ousted. Sometimes, they kill ’em.” “They behead ’em,” Kevin had said into a quiet Iowa afternoon. “I think what King was trying to get across is, look: We can only grow so many hogs, so much beans and so much corn,” Kevin had said. “If we let everybody in, we’re going to be without a food source. And what happens when that’s gone? Then we’re all in trouble.” Chaos, beheadings, starvation, the death of one America and the rise of another — that was the trouble Kevin had raised the day before, and now he was back, interrupting the conversation about Walt Miller. “What are you up to, Mr. Paulson?” he said to Russell. “Just listening and learning,” Russell said, looking at the floor, holding his coffee. “Every once in a while, I learn something here. Every once in a while, I learn something about myself.” “So how old was Walt?” Ron continued. “Mid-60s, I’d say,” said Herman. “Died last night,” Ron said again. “Last night,” Herman said again. After a while, Russell asked, “I wasn’t sure if he was home?” “Yeah, he was at home,” Herman said, and Russell was quiet the rest of the afternoon. *** Paulson holds a portrait of his wife, Glenda, who had died 18 months earlier. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) The next day, Russell had his morning coffee and got into his car. He stopped by the bank where he’d been going since the 1940s. “Hi, Russell,” the one teller said to her one customer. He got back into his car and drove one block to the edge of town, turned onto the two-lane highway, then one long gravel road after another, straight lines stretching out into still-fallow fields. “Some of the roads have been abandoned,” he said. “Because there’s not as many people living out here, the roads just disappeared.” He knew the roads better than anyone. His own family’s roots in the area stretched back to the 19th century, when the U.S. government was aggressively removing Native American tribes to make way for one of the largest immigration waves in American history. The Swedes came, the Germans came, the farms, the towns and generations of babies, one of whom was Russell Elmer Paulson, born in 1937. He was raised on his mother’s family farm in rural Kiron and never left other than a stint in the Army, and one in Dubuque. “It wasn’t for me,” he said, driving along. He and his wife, Glenda, inherited land when Russell’s parents died and lived on it until they retired and moved into town. Russell’s work had been farming and insurance adjusting. His culture was being a Methodist and a Mason and listening to polka, though most of that had fallen away. The church he and Glenda had gone to “died for lack of people and money,” he said. There were hardly any Masons left. Polka was not enjoying a revival. His kids had left for jobs in other areas. Glenda had died last year. “See that ridge? That’s the old railroad bed,” he said now, driving along, squinting through his gold-rimmed glasses. “My aunt bought this,” he said, passing a stand of trees where farmhouses had been. “Walt would go there,” he said, pointing out a repair shop where Walt Miller had coffee, and soon he turned onto a narrow dirt road leading to the farm where he and Glenda had lived, a collection of storage buildings where Russell now kept his old tractors, and one he used as an office, where he went these days to work crossword puzzles or just sit and think. “Commune with God and the birds,” he said. “Well, not too many birds now.” He glanced around at the old buildings, now shuttered and locked, though someone had broken into one of them recently. “They stole a bunch of tools and such,” Russell said, pulling back onto the gravel road. “No need to get all worked up about it.” He had a huge bag of peppermint Life Savers on the console, and he unwrapped one and put it in his mouth. He passed a rotting barn and a bird on a stretch of barbed wire, and after a while, a gray house with a huge American flag. “This is Steve King’s house here,” he said, looking at it. He had known King a long time and saw no reason to be bothered by something or other he said. He supported King — “I have no reason in the world to dislike the man” — but wasn’t one to rant about politics. He had no computer, no smartphone. His television had no cable. He watched a half-hour of national news, a half-hour of local, followed by “Wheel of Fortune” and Lawrence Welk. He ate chicken tenders and food he described as “American.” “He’s just kind of one of us,” Russell said of King, driving on past a field where a church had burned down, and the home of a man who’d died last year. It began to rain. “When it comes down like it’s doing now, it’s just wonderful,” he said. He drove past fields and more fields until he came to another stand of trees on a hill. “This is the cemetery,” he said, pulling in. He drove slowly past the headstones. “A lot of these people I knew,” he said and began reading names. “Larson.” “Lind.” “Gustafson.” “Paulson — this would be my folks right here,” he said, and then he noticed the time, almost 3 p.m. He headed back to town, pulling onto Main Street where a wooden sign said, “Kiron, Blessed with the Best.” After King had made his comment about babies, some out-of-town protest group had put up another sign below that one that said, “White Supremacist.” The sign didn’t make any sense to Russell, and, after it was removed, his main worry was that the protesters might have damaged the town sign, which had started to rot a few years ago. Russell had taken on the job of maintaining it. He had trimmed the tree branches that had grown through the wood. He had taken down “Blessed with the Best” and repainted each of the letters. He went to a lumberyard and had a new K, I, R, O, and N made, painting each letter several times and spraying them with wood preservative. One year, he and Glenda had planted a bed of petunias and geraniums. “I don’t think we will ever have a better display of flowers,” he said now, and soon he was pulling up to the Quik Mart for the afternoon coffee. As he walked inside, he saw a funeral notice on the front door with a photo of a smiling man in gold-rimmed glasses. “Oh,” Russell said, pausing for a moment. “There’s Walt.” He glanced at the funeral information for Walt Miller, poured his fourth coffee of the day, and sat down in the backroom. Dwain and Charlie Harm were already there, but they weren’t talking. A car swooshed by. An eighteen- wheeler swooshed by. Charlie tapped his nails on the table. *** The Kiron Cemetery sits on a hill overlooking the tiny town. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) The next day, the bell rang as the door with the funeral notice swung open, and it was Dwain, then Bob James, then Herman, then Russell. The Merit cigarette clock showed a few minutes after 3 p.m. Russell got the coffee pot and poured. The bell rang again, and it was a man named Glen Ballantine. “Time for plowing?” Herman asked the 84-year-old farmer. “Two weeks,” Glen said, sitting down. Bob was reading the paper. Russell was sipping his coffee, looking out the window. “Got the visitation tonight,” Herman said. He didn’t have to mention Walt Miller’s name because they all knew what he meant. They went back to talking about plowing, and Glen was saying how different farming was now than when he was a young man, which for some reason reminded him of one of his first jobs, digging graves. “For 18 bucks,” he said. “You dug a regular grave for 18 bucks?” said Dwain. “Oh yeah, and we had to fill ’em back up again,” said Glen. “I helped dig one once,” said Russell. “You know, manually. Only one. I don’t know what I got paid. But. That’s a long way down to the bottom of that.” “If there was frost in the first foot, you got $1 more,” said Glen. “What’d you use to get through the frost?” asked Bob. “Pickax and sledgehammer,” said Glen. “And when we’d fill ’em, we’d fill ’em in 14 scoops. We were just little kids, more or less.” “We had more dirt than we needed,” Russell said. “And had to —” “Had to haul that away,” said Glen, finishing his sentence. “Had to put that on the pickup,” said Russell, and they went on talking like that until Herman got up to leave. It was after 3:30 p.m. “Funeral home starts, what, at 4?” Herman said. “Four till 7, it says on there,” Russell said. The funeral home was in Denison, and the sun was going down as Russell turned onto the two-lane highway toward one of the only towns in Steve King’s district that was growing, and which appeared in the distance as a cluster of lights and rising steam from the pork-processing plant. Russell turned by the Walmart, bustling on a Friday payday, and turned again into a neighborhood where Latino kids were playing in a yard. Up a hill, he parked in front of the funeral home, where people were still streaming in near 7 p.m. Russell made his way through the receiving line, his hat off, comb lines visible in his gray hair. He shook hands with Walt’s family, who thanked him for coming, and inched forward until he reached the open casket. He stood there a moment. He looked at Walt. He looked at the light-blue satin lining and the farm scene etched into it. A man stood next to Russell. “Went fast,” he said of Walt, who had passed away soon after his diagnosis. “That’s what you hope for.” “I do,” said Russell, still looking at Walt, and soon, he headed back to Kiron. *** The fresh grave of Walt Miller at Kiron Cemetery. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) The funeral was the next day at Zion Lutheran Church in Denison, and more people came from Kiron and other vanishing towns like Odebolt and Ida Grove. They sat in jeans and dresses and suits on the wooden pews of a church founded in 1872, and read about Walt in the program, where it was said that “farming and fixing equipment and household items were his favorite things to do,” and soon the church bells began ringing. The pews creaked as everyone stood and watched the pallbearers roll in the coffin draped in a white cloth with a red cross, and a procession of dozens of family members that included exactly one baby, a girl with a black ribbon around her head. “Your world has changed,” the pastor began. When it was over, people got back into their cars and drove 20 minutes up the highway to the cemetery in Kiron, a long procession of headlights passing through fields and more fields, then turning right, then heading up the hill to the stand of evergreens, and afterward, at 3 p.m., the bell on the Quik Mart door began ringing. It rang for Herman, who arrived with a loaf of homemade bread. It rang for Dwain, for Bob, and for Charlie, who shuffled into the backroom and said, “Buried a nice guy this morning.” It rang for Russell, who poured his coffee, walked back into the wood-paneled room, and pulled up a chair. “Strawberries come to life this time of year, Russell?” Dwain asked. “I don’t know,” Russell said. They talked about the frost, and when spring might arrive. “Well, I better get moving,” Charlie said and headed out. “I got things to do, too,” Russell said, but then he didn’t leave, not yet. He got up and sat where Charlie had been, closer to the window. “Well, I gotta go,” Herman said. “See you, Herman,” Russell said. “Bye, Herman,” Dwain said, and now there were just the three of them left. Dwain cleared his throat. A car passed by. The space heater hummed. Bob finished his coffee. Russell swallowed the last of his. “You want more coffee, Mr. Bob?” Russell asked. “Do you?” said Bob. “Yeah,” Russell decided, and walked over to get the coffee pot. He poured some into Bob’s cup. He poured some into Dwain’s cup. He filled his own and sat down again. He tapped his thumb on the table. Eventually he stood up and walked toward the door, where Walt’s funeral notice no longer was. “See ya, Russell,” said Dwain. “See ya, Russell,” said Bob. “I hope so,” Russell said. national Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

April 15, 2017 — 12:19am Isabel Subtil Devee McNally, CEO and founder of MadeSmart, the St. Paul-based designer of home-organizer tools, with the original "junk-drawer" organizer that she designed in 1990. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEAL ST. ANTHONY Devee McNally, the founder in 1990 of St. Paul’s MadeSmart, regrets that vote last November for President Donald Trump. “I’m a businesswoman and I gave him credit for building a brand,” said the owner of the design-distribution company that makes plastic organizers for home and office. “But I just pray this ‘border tax’ doesn’t go through. “This could put me out of business. My priority should be building my company. I thought my bumpy years were over.” In January, Trump embraced the so-called “border adjustment tax” contained in the House Republicans’ tax bill, essentially a 20 percent tax on imports, as a way to protect American manufacturers and possibly finance the Mexican border wall and tax cuts that opponents say tilt toward the rich. McNally, whose business has grown to 25 employees and $25 million in sales last year, is part of a business group, Americans for Affordable Products, opposing the Republican plan that was conceived as pro-business growth. Trump, who has reversed numerous stances that helped him win election with his sky-is-falling, anti-immigrant, anti-trade campaign, was dancing around the border tax last week. As a candidate, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator, pull out of the impending Pacific region multilateral trade agreement, quit the North American Free Trade Agreement and impose big import taxes, ostensibly to create U.S. jobs. Many economists and business interests note that America has added millions of higher-value jobs in health, software, design, wind and solar energy and manufacturing automation as lower-cost countries did more of the basic manufacturing work, thanks to international trade. Blue-collar workers have lost jobs. Ironically, Trump’s budget would cut many of the programs that have retrained displaced workers for other careers since the Great Recession of 2008-09. Executives from Target to General Motors to small business people such as McNally oppose the border tax. Many experts say it would bring retaliatory trade-and-tariff wars that would do more damage to the American economy and workers. “The sole reason we went to China is to get high-quality, low-cost goods,” said McNally, who designs and imports dozens of plastic houseware products for major retailers. “If I absorb the 20 percent border tax contained in the Republican tax bill, I would be at a loss.” McNally closed a small factory she owned in Wisconsin “that wasn’t working” to move production overseas in 2004. Her company today employs more who make an average salary of about $75,000 plus benefits. It’s housed in St. Paul’s Midway area on University Avenue. “I compete against huge Rubbermaid and others on quality,” McNally said. “We’re a design company. That’s it. Read the brand on products at any retail store. It’s U.S. companies sourcing overseas to take advantage of lower cost [emerging-economy] production. I’ve invested $2.5 million in tooling in China. I’m out of debt. I had $4 million when I sold the Wisconsin plant. We’ve grown and I’m hiring. I’m profitable. Sales were up $1 million in the first quarter. I pay high taxes. It’s working. I’ve never been better from a business standpoint.” The Republican House tax bill, crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, embraces Trump’s campaign-driven view that is designed to raise up to $2.4 trillion over a decade to be used largely for tax cuts designed to turbocharge the U.S. economy. The Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, representing 1,000 auto-industry suppliers, has warned that the border adjustment tax would raise car prices by up to $2,500 and kill American manufacturing jobs. A trade war would hurt American-manufactured auto-part exports as well. “I never would have gone to China if there had been a way to stay in the U.S.,” McNally said. “My investment in tooling in China fuels our growth here. I have 450 household items sold at MadeSmart online and at most major retailers.” Client retailers include Target, Wal-Mart, Lowes, T.J. Maxx and Bed Bath and Beyond. Brady told CNBC recently that he believes the border tax will be included as part of the final tax plan. And he has backers, including the American Made Coalition, a group of large manufacturers and others who argue that an import tax, used to some extent by other countries, won’t start a trade war and that the total package also will lower taxes and boost the American economy and jobs. McNally still feels threatened. She remembers her last brush with Trump. Her then-boyfriend was so impressed with Trump’s 1980s-vintage biography that she and the boyfriend plunged into the residential rental business. “I had to file bankruptcy,” McNally recalled, though she does not blame Trump for the lack of execution. The housewares business has worked out better so far.   Neal St. Anthony has been a Star Tribune business columnist and reporter since 1984. He can be contacted at nstanthony@startribune.com.

Courtesy Shannon Coulter hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Shannon Coulter Activists took to the streets in Washington, D.C., and several other cities Saturday — the traditional Tax Day (which officially falls on April 18 this year) — to try to pressure the president to release his tax returns. Liberal protests are fast becoming a fixture of Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's first full day in office kicked off with a massive Women's March. Then there were the Day Without A Woman protests. Next weekend, communities across America plan to hold Earth Day March for Science rallies to highlight climate science and protest proposed EPA cuts, among other issues. But for others, marches are not enough. Politics ACLU Lawyer Sits At Heart Of Legal Resistance To Trump Agenda In San Francisco, Shannon Coulter is looking to expand her national Grab Your Wallet boycott movement into a broader nonprofit aimed at corporate accountability as well as resistance to Trump. The boycott Coulter founded is aimed at Trump family products, properties and companies whose executives and board members actively support the president. Accidental activist Coulter didn't spend her college years occupying various administration buildings or her post-college years publicly taking up progressive causes. She's a career marketing consultant who owns a small digital marketing, social media and branding business for corporate clients. "I don't consider myself an activist. Even now, it's a strange label to me," the 45-year-old says from inside a rent-by-the-day office in downtown San Francisco. #GrabYourWallet has no permanent office space. "I think of myself first and foremost as a businessperson. The newer role of activist is still taking shape for me." The boycott took shape last October in reaction to Donald Trump's now infamous vulgar comments about women that were released from a 2005 TV appearance outtake. "You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait," Trump said in an Access Hollywood tape picked up by a hot mic. "And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything," Trump said. Outraged that the then-Republican nominee was speaking about women in such offensive terms, Coulter tweeted a screenshot of a handful of companies that sell Trump family products. The boycott was soon born. Today, #GrabYourWallet's simple spreadsheet on a web site of the same name gets more than two million unique views a month and has his hit more than 950 million shares on social media. Not bad for an organization with no budget, no paid employees and no office. A handful of social media volunteers help Coulter manage and promote the site. #GrabYourWallet's hashtag reach has surpassed 950 million. Courtesy of Shannon Coulter hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Shannon Coulter "What I hear a lot from #GrabYourWallet participants is: 'This gives me some sense of control over the situation right now,' " Coulter says. "We may have lost at the ballot box, but we can vote at the cash register every day. I'm going to continue to reach out to these companies to let them know I'm not doing business with them until they sever their relationship with the Trump family." Today, more than 50 companies are on the boycott list. She encourages consumers not to spend their money with them because they sell Trump products or because a member of the company's board or a senior executive has backed Trump's campaign. "If you're going to give money to the campaign of a guy who makes fun of disabled people, who questions the nationality of our country's first black president, who likes to grab women by the genitals, you are going to raise the ire of consumers," Coulter says. "That's a part of your brand. And any company that thinks it's not a part of their brand is being naïve." Do boycotts really work? Coulter says she's weathered hate mail and nasty phone calls and tweets from Trump supporters as well as numerous denial of service attacks on her web site. She's kept her small marketing business going. But she says moonlighting with #GrabYourWallet has all but taken over. "The balance is that there is no balance," she says. "There are long days of doing both my small business and #GrabYourWallet. Both take a lot of time and attention." It's not clear what, if any, economic impact the boycott is having. Politics 'The Resistance' Faces A New Question: What To Do With All That Money Some studies show these consumer protests and divestment drives often have a limited effect on a company's bottom line and rarely alter long-term corporate policies. But a brand's reputation can take a serious PR hit. And that's part of what Coulter is banking on. Her success metric for this isn't a company's stock price or quarterly sales. Her benchmark is how many companies have been taken off the boycott list. So far, it's about two dozen including Nordstrom, Kmart and Neiman Marcus. "Some of have made public statements and some haven't. For our purposes, it doesn't really matter why a company has dropped Trump products, only that they have," Coulter says. More than 50 companies remain boycott targets including some major players such as Amazon, MillerCoors, Walmart and L.L.Bean, whose board member Linda Bean has donated to a political action committee that backed Trump's presidential campaign. But the Maine-based outdoors retailer company has also won some local praise for hiring Somali refugees. "It's great that they do that," Coulter says. "But it's just not good enough. We're not going to shop at L.L.Bean until our dollars aren't going into the pockets of somebody who may use that money to donate to extremists." An L.L.Bean spokeswoman did not respond to NPR's phone calls or emails requesting comment. The Two-Way Should Scientists March? U.S. Researchers Still Debating Pros And Cons Coulter calls Amazon "the most opaque and nonresponsive company on the list. We haven't heard a thing from them," she says. "Either about the advertising they continue to do on Breitbart or the Trump products that they continue to distribute and sell." We reached out to more than a dozen companies on the boycott list, including Amazon. All declined to comment — except for MillerCoors. Pete Coors — a board member of the parent company Molson Coors — has actively supported and raised money for Trump. In a statement, the company said, "Boycotting our brands only harms our hard-working employees and their families." The company declined to say if the boycott has affected sales, saying only "We respect the rights of every one of our employees to support whichever candidate they choose. And, we encourage all of our employees to participate in the democratic process and vote." Ivanka's brand One of #GrabYourWallet's biggest targets is Ivanka Trump and companies that sell her fashion line of clothes, jewelry, shoes and accessories. Ivanka Trump has called the boycott misguided and political. Fortune reports that her clothing line had a great 2016 despite the boycott. It may be too soon to tell, however. #GrabYourWallet got off the ground late in the final quarter of last year.

Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP One of Grab Your Wallet's biggest targets is Ivanka Trump and companies that sell her fashion line of clothes, jewelry, shoes and accessories. Mark Lennihan/AP And Ivanka has pushed back in other ways. In her first interview since being made an official White House adviser, Trump recently told CBS This Morning that her lack of "public denouncement" of any of her dad's policies does not mean she's been silent with him. "I think there are multiple ways to have your voice heard," she told the network. "In some case, it's through protest and it's through going on the nightly news and talking about or denouncing every issue on which you disagree with. Other times, it is quietly and directly and candidly." "So where I disagree with my father, he knows it. And I express myself with total candor. Where I agree, I fully lean in and support the agenda and hope that I can be an asset to him and make a positive impact," Ivanka said. Some Trump critics have long hoped Ivanka would exert as moderating influence on her father. But Coulter isn't buying it. She says Ivanka is making a mockery of the conflict-of-interest rules by putting her company in a trust run by family members — not a blind trust. The Two-Way Women's March Floods Washington, Sparking Rallies Worldwide The White House power and influence of Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are expanding, according to numerous news reports. Coulter sees no evidence Ivanka is having a tempering impact. "You might as well try to housebreak a hyena," Coulter says. "Ivanka is not moderating him." A broader impact? Coulter says one sure sign of the boycott's broader impact is the speed with which dozens of companies quickly stopped advertising on Bill O'Reilly's Fox News show in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against the host and settlement payouts. "When O'Reilly Factor's advertisers proactively began jumping ship, I saw that as proof positive that consumer movements like #GrabYourWallet and Sleeping Giants are having an effect and helping companies be more thoughtful about their advertising choices and what those advertising choices mean about their own brands," she says. Politics Message To 'Resistors' From Occupy Co-Creator: Stop Protesting. Run For Office Angie's List, the crowd-sourced website that reviews companies, emailed Coulter that it was pulling its ads from The O'Reilly Factor. Coulter says #GrabYourWallet supporters told her they were particularly upset that a "woman-founded business wasn't taking a stand for women at a critical moment and really rejoiced when they saw they had a positive impact on that decision. "I think that there's just a lot of appetite right now to understand how we as consumers can use our spending power to promote inclusivity and respect in our society," she adds. The boycott Coulter co-founded is just six months old. She says she's now having "lots of conversations" with a wide range of people and organizations about how to morph this movement into a wider, perhaps nonprofit vehicle, for taking on Trump and advocating for broader corporate social responsibility. "#GrabYourWallet has taken on a life of its own, so I'm trying to understand what the right structure is for that going forward," she says. "It feels like this movement wants to be something more than it is today. There's a lot of momentum behind this. There's a lot of activity around it still, and I want to leverage that into something larger." trump Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1" />

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  −  two  =  6 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter You can join the $7.2 trillion economic revolution with what some call "OBL" fuel. But what is "OBL" fuel? Recently discovered in the Andes Mountains, locals call this crystal "Oro Blanco" or "White Gold." What Is "OBL" Fuel? The Holy Grail of Energy The name is fitting since demand for "OBL" fuel from the automobile industry alone is set to increase 11 times current production levels. This energy source is 1,693 times more powerful than gasoline. One gallon of OBL fuel could power your car from New York City to Los Angeles and back seven times. "OBL" fuel is so efficient because it doesn't evaporate in high heat. With a boiling point of 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit, or over 20 times higher than gas, there is no chance of any fuel burning off in the heat of the engine. "OBL" fuel is so powerful that Alphabet Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOG) Google was one of the first to invest in related technologies. It is a central piece in Google's plan to independently produce 100% of its own energy for its offices in every major country, housing 61,814 employees. Google isn't the only major corporation with a 100% independent energy production plan, either. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has a similar mission, and the savings are estimated to be $1 billion a year. With large corporations jumping on board with this "OBL" fuel, demand is soaring, and that will create a huge profit opportunity… Profiting from OBL Fuel Demand for OBL fuel is so high, and the crystals are so scarce, that this energy play could be even bigger than the fracking boom. The price of OBL fuel has doubled twice in the last 14 months. That kind of price increase will mint money for anyone who has a claim. And that's what this tiny little miner in Death Valley is sitting on. The claim has an estimated 816,000 metric tons of OBL fuel, valuing the reserve at $20.4 billion.

Photograph: Tom Williams/Getty Images US politics Two questions Trump must answer if he wants to drain the tax swamp Trump has promised a ‘phenomenal’ plan to reform America’s labyrinthine tax system, but it’s a feat no president has achieved since Reagan Marchers across US to demand Trump’s tax returns Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Dominic Rushe in New York @dominicru Sunday 16 April 2017 06.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 16 April 2017 06.02 EDT “Historic”, “massive”, “phenomenal”. Donald Trump has pulled out all his increasingly tired superlatives to describe his plans for reforming the byzantine and bonkers US tax system. Well, good luck with that. Steve Bannon: is Trump's right-hand man falling from grace? Read more As he ponders his next move at Mar-a-Largo this Easter weekend, Trump will do well to remember that tax reform has a way of leaving a president with egg on his face. It’s not without reason that no commander-in-chief has achieved it since Ronald Reagan, in 1986. Reagan, wildly popular, didn’t pass tax reform until his second term and it took 10 tense months to pull it off. Trump, who is wildly unpopular and has yet to even appoint most of the people who would do the heavy lifting on tax reform, wants it done by summer. Say what you like about Trump, he doesn’t lack ambition. When he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, Jimmy Carter (the anti-Trump) called the US tax code “a disgrace to the human race”. “All my life I have heard promises about tax reform,” he said, “but it never quite happens. With your help, we are finally going to make it happen. And you can depend on it.” Forty years on, the federal tax code covers close to 75,000 pages, 187 times longer than it was a century ago. The main problem, according to Cato Institute senior fellow Michael Tanner, is that tax reform lies at the heart of Washington’s quagmire. “The tax code isn’t just part of the Washington swamp,” Tanner wrote recently. “It is the swamp.” But to hear it from the Trump camp, tax is easy. After the failure to “repeal and replace” Obamacare, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin recently told a group of financial journalists: “Healthcare is a very, very complicated issue. In a way, [tax reform is] a lot simpler. It really is.” Richard Rubin (@RichardRubinDC) Pro tip: Only 4 tax reform stories. *It's hard. *What does X mean for reform? *What does reform mean for X? *Check out weird tax thing. https://t.co/M4kBupsqKj March 28, 2017 Few beyond the Trumposphere would agree. But don’t worry, dear reader. As Richard Rubin, the Wall Street Journal’s tax wonk, recently pointed out, while tax policy is labyrinthine, tax reform stories are actually simple. In fact, there are only four: “It’s hard”, “What does X mean for reform?”, “What does reform mean for X?”, “Check out weird tax thing”. When it comes to taxes, though, we’re all in favor of simplification. Right? So let’s cut Rubin’s Rules down to two: “Why is it hard?” and “What does X mean for reform?” Those are the two questions that, in the weeks to come, will keep the president padding through the corridors of power, into the wee small hours. Why is it hard? The White House needs a big win after its humiliating defeat over healthcare reform. In principle, everyone agrees that the US needs tax reform. The Tax Foundation’s last survey of tax competitiveness ranked the US a dismal 31st out of the 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries it measures. (If you really want simple taxes, move to Estonia or New Zealand). While everyone in Congress would like to see that score improve, no one agrees how. Trump’s plan is to cut taxes on middle-class Americans, reduce business taxes and simplify the tax code. Three tax bands will replace the current seven, with the threshold for paying tax rising and the top rate falling. Tax cuts that add to the national debt – that are not “revenue neutral” – have to expire after 10 years. Tax reform is more ambitious and Trump must balance the books in order to get it passed. In order to do so he has proposed cutting loopholes for the super-rich and corporations – including, perhaps, the “carried interest” loophole used by billionaire hedge funders. A one-off 10% tax on repatriating the $2.5tn corporations have sitting in cash sitting overseas would pay for some cuts, as would a controversial “border adjustment” tax on imported goods. But even if Trump can get his pluses and minuses to balance out, the plan has to pass Congress. Democrats, hoping for a second major Trump fail, won’t give the president any votes, not least because an analysis of Trump’s plan by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded it would give rich people the biggest tax cuts, with about half of the benefits going to the top 1%. Among Republicans too, tax reform is a knotty issue. The proposed border tax has reportedly managed the unusual feat of uniting Paul Ryan, the House speaker, and Stephen Bannon, Trump’s top strategist. The tax would raise $1tn in revenue over 10 years, paying for other cuts and incentivizing US manufacturing (or so Trump argues) over overseas production. It also contains the word “border”, which should appeal to his isolationist base. Facebook Twitter Pinterest US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA But treasury secretary Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn are against the tax, as are business leaders who argue it will effectively translate into a tax on consumers as retailers and others pass costs on to buyers. Even for Republicans, tax cuts for the rich paid for by price hikes at Walmart might prove a tough sell as the midterm elections approach. Then there are the special interest groups and their pet politicians who will be fighting to keep their tax breaks while lobbying for new ones they’d like. Rewriting 75,000 pages of tax code will create a feeding frenzy of opportunity. “Tax cuts are easy, tax reform is hard,” says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan and nonprofit organization that studies the impact of fiscal policy. Even with the national debt now marching its way to $20tn (a credit card debt of more than $61,000 for every US citizen) MacGuineas said she saw little sign that politicians were making the tough choices needed to pass true tax reform. “We are in a period of giveaways and politicians are reluctant to talk about hard choices,” she said. What does X mean for reform? Where X equals the Affordable Care Act, the answer is everything. Politically, Trump’s failure to make good on his promise to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy makes passing any new and major legislation both more important and more difficult. The rightwing Freedom Caucus played chicken with Trump’s health plans and Trump was the first to blink. His threats of retaliation look about as convincing as those of an overweight school bully who finds his “victim” has a blackbelt in jiu-jitsu. The Freedom Caucus now knows it can hold out for the tax policies it likes and will likely derail any plan that appeases the moderates. Don Benton: the Trump 'shadow' adviser taking over the US draft system Read more Financially, the failure to repeal Obamacare also gives Trump a tax headache. Trumpcare (aka the American Health Care Act) could have cost 24 million Americans their health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while handing $144bn in tax cuts over the next decade to those with incomes of $1m or more by axing new taxes created under Obamacare, according to the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation. It would also have shaved $337bn off the federal budget over the next decade. If Trump’s tax plans are to remain revenue neutral, and they will have to placate the Republican’s deficit hawks, Trump will have to find other ways to make up that saving. He will also be under pressure to shoehorn those tax breaks back in to the tax reform package. He has pledged to go back for a second run at healthcare but to do so while tackling tax reform would risk creating a tsunami of wonk that could drown an administration that so far has shown little patience for the details. The net result of this swamp-a-thon? The grand plan will collapse and Republicans will eventually pass a 10-year tax cut for the rich, said Cato’s Tanner. “They are not going to just come out and say they want tax cuts for the rich,” he said. “Tax reform sounds so much more noble.” But in the end? “I don’t think they really care about paying for those tax cuts.” Topics US politics Tax and spending Trump administration Donald Trump US economy Economics analysis Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US selected politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US selected politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video US News › US politics back to top US world science US politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Blue Apron boxes include cooking instructions for meals and suggested wine parings -- shiitake mushroom burgers with a Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Grenache, for example. The raw ingredients, which include such exotica as romanesco cauliflower and fairy tale eggplants, are sourced from family farms and artisans. Then they're sorted, chopped and packaged in giant fulfillment centers and delivered to homes around the country. It's an enormously complicated operation, and Blue Apron has built sophisticated software to manage the supply chain and wring out costs typically borne by the food industry. The company has been signing up subscribers at an impressive clip and last year generated between $750 million and $1 billion in revenue, according to a person familiar with its finances. That far exceeds the $300 million to $400 million goal for 2016 that was pitched to investors a few years back, says this person, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. Backed by the Bessemer Venture Partners, Fidelity Investments and other venture firms, Blue Apron is the largest company of its kind, with more subscribers than rivals like HelloFresh and Plated. Meanwhile, dozens of other food-related startups have disappeared or are struggling. Attracting and keeping customers is Blue Apron's foremost challenge. It's not easy persuading people to pay $240 to $560 a month for a service that saves time shopping when there are still faster, cheaper ways to get fed. Plus, to keep existing customers happy, Blue Apron must continually improve its offerings with new recipes and more customization. The bigger Blue Apron gets, the harder it becomes to maintain quality, and the more things can go wrong. Subscribers are always one or two bad experiences -- a late arrival, the wrong food, wilted parsley -- from canceling. "If we're even a day late, that's a really terrible experience for the customer to not be able to cook dinner that night," says chief technology officer Ilia Papas. "If you're buying a toothbrush, and it shows up a day late, you're not going to stop your relationship with that business. But with us, trust is a big part of it." Blue Apron was decidedly low-tech when it got started in New York City in a warehouse district in Queens in August of 2012. The three founders, Matt Salzberg, Matt Wadiak and Papas crowded into a 150-square-foot cooler in a rented commercial kitchen and packed the first 30 boxes themselves from bins of fresh meat and vegetables. They made sure to double-check every box; getting it right was key if the new, unproven startup was to build trust with subscribers. Blue Apron quickly generated positive feedback, and orders started flowing in. At the time, customers received identical boxes with two portions per recipe. For the first two years, Blue Apron kept track of progress with whiteboards; managers took photos of the boards at the end of a shift and emailed them around. If someone rubbed up against a board by accident, the information was lost and they'd have no clue how many ingredients had been packed and whether they were on schedule. Everything was done manually and with pen and paper. For a while, a leftover shipping label was one of the few indications that something had gone wrong. Today Blue Apron is a high-tech operation with more than 4,500 employees in three fulfillment centers around the U.S. Located in a warehouse district in Jersey City, N.J., southwest of Manhattan, the biggest facility is mostly refrigerated to a chilly 37 or so degrees and about the size of a Wal-Mart supercenter. Work goes on around the clock in three shifts; up to 500 or so men and women work any given period, garbed in blue latex gloves, smocks and heavy coats. When they arrive for their eight-hour shifts they wade through a trough filled with powdered disinfectant, then take up positions around the facility, which is loud enough to make conversation difficult. A large screen flashes green and red to show which lines are on schedule and which have fallen behind. There is an air of controlled chaos. Blue Apron long ago replaced the whiteboard with software that guides workers every step of the way. Workers use computers throughout the facility to find out where bulk and prepped ingredients are located. Apple iPads tell employees working on lines how much of a given ingredient goes into each portion and how many portions they must complete per minute to stay on schedule. Those running low on ingredients can in a few taps notify a runner to bring over a new pallet without having to interrupt the process. Not so long ago, switching a line to pack a different kind of box could take hours, leaving workers standing around. "There's no way we could have reached the scale that we're at without the custom software," technology officer Papas says. "We've been going through everything that's a manual process and seeing if we can turn it into software." Leslie Burns, a 52-year-old community volunteer from Boulder, Colo., tried Blue Apron after a friend recommended the service as a way to try new recipes. She lasted three months. The meals often didn't resemble the photos, and she found the portions too small. What pushed her over the edge? All the boxes and bags required to keep the food fresh and unblemished. Hers is a sentiment shared by many current and former customers. "I just felt so horrible at the end of the week, taking my stuff down to the curb," Burns says. "It felt so decadent, a physical reminder of what I was doing. It just seemed not necessary." Almost five years after Blue Apron started in that Queens kitchen, it still has to work hard persuading people that make-it-yourself meal kits are worth paying for. Hence all the marketing entreaties and one-month-free offers showing up in mailboxes around the country. And the commercials that air regularly on the Cooking Channel, Food Network and TBS with the tagline: "Food is better when you start from scratch." Still, Blue Apron continues to grow. It's about to open a fourth fulfillment center in New Jersey -- more than double the size of the first facility -- and has plans for another one in California next year. The company recently started a beta program giving customers more recipe choices and more control over frequency. Even with dozens of meal-kit companies vying for attention and new ones popping up all the time, Blue Apron is the unquestioned leader. The company has shown investors it has a path to sustainable profit. And if Blue Apron pulls off an initial public offering this year, it will become the most high-profile New York startup to test the public market since Etsy's debut three years ago.

Ami Shah A steady rise in D-Mart share prices aside, JP Morgan expects Avenue Supermarts to post an EPS CAGR of 28% over 2017-19, higher than Wal-Mart (7%) and Costco (11%). Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint Mumbai: Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs the D-Mart supermarkets chain, is now the world’s most expensive retail stock, following a bumper listing in March and steady gains thereafter. Analysts believe the company’s long-term growth story remains lucrative, and do not rule out a near-term pause in the stock’s rally. On its stock market debut on 21 March, Avenue Supermarts shares rose 114.30% from its offer price, and has been gaining since. On Tuesday, it closed at Rs778.20, up 160.27% from the offer price. Its market capitalization now stands at Rs48,566.25 crore. A day earlier, its stock had touched a record high of Rs806.80, achieving a market capitalization of Rs50,351.13 crore. ALSO READ: Radhakishan Damani’s path from one-room flat to building retail empire Avenue Supermarts is the most expensive retail stock among its global and regional peers, with price to earnings ratio for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 at 55.9 and 42.2 times respectively, said brokerage firm JP Morgan, which started covering the stock with a “neutral” rating on 7 April. “We like the company’s execution capabilities, single format focus, sensible approach toward operating stores which offer healthy profit/return metrics, prudent store expansion strategy and strong focus on customer satisfaction,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note. JP Morgan estimates 27% revenue and 34% earnings per share (compounded annual growth) over fiscal years 2017-20 driven by store additions, healthy same-store-sales growth, inflation and modest margin improvement. ALSO READ: Avenue Supermarts listing: Lessons for retailers from stellar market debut It believes the premium valuations commanded by Avenue Supermarts are justified as it has almost 3-4 times EPS CAGR than the global/regional peers. JP Morgan expects Avenue Supermarts to post an EPS CAGR of 28% over calendar years 2017-2019, and those of American peers Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which is the world’s largest retailer, and Costco Wholesale Corp., at around 7% and 11% respectively. EPS is short for earnings per share and CAGR expands to compound annual growth rate. JP Morgan also sees other Indian retailers Trent Ltd and V-Mart Retail Ltd posting EPS CAGR of 34% over the same period. “We were expecting it to reach Rs660 in 18 months. It is already beyond that level. The company’s operations are the best in the sector,” said R. Sreesankar, head of research at Prabhudas Lilldher Pvt. Ltd. The brokerage started covering the stock on 21 March with a “buy” rating. ALSO READ: Irrational exuberance in D-Mart shares “We think it is a good long-term story. Having said that, the short-term outperformance post-listing has been so strong, it will become expensive if the prices spike more,” added Sreesankar. However, there is some discomfort with respect to valuation. “The market cap of this company is around Rs50,000 crore. So, if they have 150 stores right now, the valuation would be valued at more than Rs300 crore per store,” said investment adviser Sandip Sabharwal, owner of asksandipsabharwal.com. “One can buy an entire mall for that price (of one store),” added Sabharwal.

More than 1,000 — nearly 500 of them children — came out for the annual event, which featured 25,000 eggs and free prizes. Hundreds flock to New Creation Church of Craig’s Easter egg-stravaganza By Andy Bockelman Sunday, April 16, 2017 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Discuss Comment Advertisement Easter weekend holds many surprises and causes for celebration for families, and those who turned out to the grounds at New Creation Church of Craig had plenty of both. The annual Easter egg hunt spectacular hosted by the local place of worship saw more than 1,000 total people turn out as 470 children hit the grass to get their share of 25,000 plastic eggs containing candy, prizes and more. Photo Gallery 2017 New Creation Church of Craig Egg Hunt The yearly egg hunt hosted by the Craig church featured 25,000 eggs containing candy and prizes. 470 kids joined in the fun with a crowd of more than 1,000 total people. Kids ranging from infancy to fifth-grade made short work of the selection of eggs and were ready for more fun as they cracked open their bounty. Cousins Xavriel Robles and Angela Almaraz, both 9, hit the shade to sort through their goods. The two couldn’t come to a consensus about their favorite things within — both liked candy like Starburst, though Almaraz preferred the eggs containing small bracelets with Christian messages on them. The petting zoo on site was also fun, they added. “I really like the goats,” Almaraz smiled. Bounce houses, a bubble pool and other activities kept families leading up to the egg hunt, though it was a large prize giveaway that had everyone’s attention as organizers drew names for bicycles, Easter basket and gift cards. Among the biggest prizes were $100 Visa gift cards that went to fifth-graders Axel Quintana and Valerie Teeter. Teeter said she has yet to decide what she’ll buy, though she wants to get something her whole family can enjoy. “Just getting to spend time with my family is the best part of today,” she said. In her first year at the egg hunt, 2-year-old Quincey Loya was excited by virtually everything around her. Though, she also had another reason for being there, with some prompting from mother Kelsey. “Celebrating Jesus!” they both said. Amber and Chris Goodenow are the lead organizers for the event, which included donated materials from KRAI, Walmart, Craig Steel, Axis Steel and The Copy Shop Dozens of parishioner volunteers also offered their time to make things go smoothly, many of whom were clad in bunny ears to befit the occasion. “This year there were a lot of obstacles, but the church came through with flying colors, and the community showed up big to help us out,” Amber said. “Every year, we’re growing bigger and bigger, and we love to see the community come together.” Contact Andy Bockelman at 970-875-1793 or abockelman@CraigDailyPress.com.

But the garments needed to conjure up eternal chic are spending less time on shop racks and in homes than ever before. Global clothing production doubled between 2000 and 2014, as apparel firms’ operations became more efficient, their production cycles became quicker and fashionistas received more for their money. From just a few collections a year, fast-fashion brands such as Zara, owned by Spain’s Inditex, now offer more than 20; Sweden’s H&M manages up to 16. Dressing to impress has an environmental cost as well as a financial one. From the pesticides poured on cotton fields to the washes in which denim is dunked, making 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of fabric generates 23 kilograms (50.7) of greenhouse gases on average, according to estimates by McKinsey. Because consumers keep almost every type of apparel only half as long as they did 15 years ago, these inputs quickly go to waste. The latest worry is shoppers in the developing world, who have yet to buy as many clothes as rich-world consumers but are fast catching up. Most apparel companies know that sooner or later, consumers’ awareness of this subject will rise. That is a worry. Various furors in the 1990s and afterward over the working conditions of people making goods for firms such as Nike, Wal-Mart and Primark badly damaged brands. The clothing industry cannot afford to appear so ugly again. One obvious way in which firms can answer environmental concerns is to use renewable energy to power their facilities. Beyond that, they can cut back sharply on water and chemical use; and they can develop new materials and manufacturing processes that reduce inputs. The record in this regard is mixed. H&M was the largest buyer in the world of “better cotton” last year — that is, cotton produced under conditions to eliminate the nastiest pesticides and encourage strict water management.. Nike’s Flyknit method of weaving items, including trainers, reduces waste by 60 percent in comparison with cutting and sewing. But for many firms, research and development into new materials and methods is not a priority. A handful of brands encourage customers to recycle old clothes by returning them to stores. But almost all apparel today is made of a mix of materials — very often including polyester. Separating them out is difficult and mechanical methods of recycling degrade fibers. Chemical methods are too expensive to be viable.

FILE PHOTO By Rachel Uranga, Long Beach Press Telegram Posted: 04/15/17, 4:50 PM PDT | Updated: 7 hrs ago # Comments Mario Cordero (Photo by Brittany Murray / Daily Breeze) Rough seas ahead? Mario Cordero knows that. Cordero, former chair of the Federal Maritime Commission and longtime figure in the shipping industry, was chosen Friday to run the Port of Long Beach. The cargo hub partners with the Port of Los Angeles to comprise the busiest port complex in the nation. Cordero’s experience is deep, his expertise established. So he understands quite well that he — along with his L.A. peer, Gene Seroka — has challenges to face. What’s on the horizon? Oh, only the shipping industry emerging from an international slump, a massive infrastructure project, looming labor contract talks and the tightening of already challenging environmental standards. Good luck, sir. Here are five of the most pressing scenarios awaiting the ports: 1. Regulation The California Air Resources Board is in the midst of formulating new rules that could require all docked cargo vessels to cut emissions beyond levels that are already among the toughest in the nation. Currently, 70 percent of all container and cruise ships must plug into electric power well at berth, but regulators want to see improvement by 2030. Regulators also want terminal operators to replace many of the fossil-fuel-burning cranes, tractors, yard trucks and forklifts with cleaner-fueled alternatives. Meanwhile, Gov. Jerry Brown is pushing for more zero-emission cargo trucks. And the twin ports are developing new clean-air requirements aimed at reducing greenhouse gas and smog-forming particulates. It won’t be cheap. Consulting firm Moffat & Nichol estimates the price tag for the two ports and Oakland to replace equipment with all zero- or near zero-emission technology at $23 billion. Sure, both ports have committed to the cleanup. But the question remains: Who will fund it? 2. Labor Nobody wants a repeat of the crippling labor slowdown that rocked the docks in 2014 and 2015. The standoff rippled through the nation’s economy, left businesses unable to stock shelves and stuck farmers with rotting produce on the idled docks. By some estimates, the slowdown cost the economy more than $7 billion. And it marred the ports’ image among retailers and suppliers. Delegates representing 20,000 International Longshore and Warehouse Union workers at 29 ports will meet at district headquarters in San Francisco in the coming weeks to discuss whether to extend their current five-year contract, which expires on July 1, 2019. Advertisement Last year, nearly two dozen members of Congress signed a letter urging for a speedy resolution. Industry officials are watching closely. 3. Competition The West Coast — once considered the natural route for cargo heading East — has been losing market share to hubs in the Gulf, on the Eastern seaboard and various points abroad. More than a decade ago, around half of the nation’s imported goods came through the twin ports. Now, it’s 37 percent. An expanded Panama Canal opened last year, intensifying fears that such retail giants as Wal-Mart and Home Depot could bypass Southern California’s ports. But many of the Gulf and Eastern ports aren’t ready to handle many of the bigger ships with bigger loads the shippers are now using, that could be changing. They’re sinking billions into upgrading their infrastructure. Meanwhile, there’s increased competition from Port Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico and Prince Rupert in Canada. To keep pace, both Long Beach and Los Angeles are upgrading their terminals. A $4.5 billion infrastructure enhancement is underway in Long Beach, including an expanded, automated Middle Harbor Terminal. But long-term planning in such an uncertain industry is tough. And incurring the debt for such projects can be risky. 4. Trade policy Months ago, then-candidate Donald Trump said he would slap a 45 percent tariff on goods from China, the nation’s largest trading partner and the leading importer at the two local ports. And he vowed to label the Asian superpower a currency manipulator. But last week now-President Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his resort in Florida. Perhaps now believing that coping with volatile North Korea calls for more Pacific Rim teamwork than he’d originally wagered, Trump has visibly softened his stances. And he hasn’t been afraid to say he’s open to changing his views. Peter Navarro — the Team Trump insider with the most hard-line stand on China — appears to be taking a back seat to others with more moderate approaches. That could be a good sign for trade-dependent California. And for retailers stocking shelves with lower-priced Made-in-China electronics and fashions. And for shippers at the ports whose job depends on Asian container traffic. Port officials will surely lobby hard. But they likely won’t have much sway over the still-tough-to-predict actions of the new president. 5. Alliances The cargo business made headlines last year. The wrong kind. Hanjin Shipping melted down in public, stranding crews and ships packed with goods at ports around the globe — and revealing an industry in crisis. Operating losses of $3.5 billion plagued the world’s biggest shippers. In response, they created new alliances with competitors to cut costs and ease overcapacity. Such agreements allow shipping lines to pool their resources and use one another’s vessels to move cargo. Shippers allied in the three pacts now carry 90 percent of the goods along the Asia-North America route, giving them enormous power to shape the future of West Coast ports. Companies working together can run fewer ships — but bigger ones packed with more boxes. In the months ahead, that could put pressure on dock crews to unload and load ships faster and more efficiently. Fewer ships could also intensify competition between the Southern California ports. The strength of the new alliances, however, could be tested. The U.S. is concerned the alliances could lead to anti-competitive behavior. Last month, Reuters reported the Department of Justice served subpoenas to several executives at shipping lines as part of a price-fixing probe in the container industry.

The carrier is facing a lawsuit after a doctor was dragged off a flight last week and this week, KHOU-TV has learned a bride and groom headed Costa Rica for their wedding were kicked off their flight out of Houston on Saturday. The couple from Salt Lake City, identified as Michael Hohl and Amber Maxwell, told the local station they were the last to board their plane and simply moved into other economy-class seats when they noticed another passenger was spread across their row napping. Not wanting to disturb the man, the couple says they moved to different seats and let him carry on sleeping. They said the flight was half full with multiple empty rows, so they decided to sit three rows up, assuming they were in the clear. “We thought not a big deal, it’s not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat,” said Hohl. “We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat.” However, in the plane they had boarded, a Boeing 737-800, United considers those seats to be “economy plus,” an upgrade. Hohl said he was approached by a flight attendant who asked if they were in the right seat. According to KHOU-TV, the couple explained the situation and asked for an upgrade, but were told to go back to their seats. Shortly after they complied with the flight attendant’s request, a U.S. Marshal approached the couple and told them to get off the plane. They left the plane without incident and in a state of confusion. “They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,” said Hohl. United Airlines tells a different story, and provided the station with this statement on Saturday: We’re disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn’t measure up to their expectations. These passengers repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats. We’ve been in touch with them and have rebooked them on flights tomorrow. They were booked on another flight the following day, but Hohl tells KHOU-TV they won’t be flying United again. “I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill,” said Hohl. “The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd.” Their wedding is still planned for Thursday.

But even there Le Pen has some supporters. Eleanor Beardsley / NPR Listen Listening... / If Marine Le Pen is elected president of France in May, she says she promises to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union. Her EU-skeptic stance is an unlikely vote-winner in France, where the EU is still very popular. That's especially true eastern France, near the border with Germany, but even there Le Pen has some supporters. The majestic French city of Metz was built by the French and the Germans, and has a shared history going back more than a thousand years. Metz is in the heart of the Alsace Lorraine region, which changed hands four times since the Franco-Prussian war in 1871. In the city's cathedral square, a group of soldiers for the Deutsche-Fransuziche Brigade is showing off their tank and military hardware to the public. The group is a bi-national military brigade in which the German and French units work together. Jonathan Naegele is the communications officer for the brigade and part of the French army says this region has close-knit ties with Germany in just about every area. He describes it as a sort of kinship between the two peoples. It's Franco-German friendship week in Metz and French and German flags fly together all over town. It wasn't always like this, says Metz mayor Dominique Gros. The 75-year-old says his father, grandfather and great-grandfather all fought in wars against Germany. "When I was little I learned that Germany was our enemy, but we've managed to overcome this ancestral hatred," Gros says. "And we built Europe together. Today we work together, our young people go to university together and we have the same democratic values." But Gros says people are beginning to look inward again, and he's worried by the nationalist feelings being stirred up by Marine Le Pen. Despite the deep European sentiment here, a recent poll showed Le Pen has a lot of support in Alsace Lorraine. Franck Bucher is a political reporter for a local paper. He says many French people are frustrated when they see the strength of economies in nearby Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg, where many of them go to work. "People feel like the French politicians aren't able to do anything about the economy and social problems in France," Bucher says. "So part of Le Pen's success comes from this despair, and because she has never been in power she is able to position herself as the anti-system candidate." While Metz is celebrating Franco-German friendship, on the other side of town Le Pen is holding a rally. She accuses her opponents of trying to scare people about her opposition to the EU. She says the French people don't need the EU to go shopping or to work in Germany. "Putting back borders doesn't mean closing your country and keeping people and goods from coming and going," Le Pen says. "It just means being able to control which people and goods come and go, and to keep certain people from getting into our country and staying." Jerome and Julien Ferrand are brothers in their 60s. They started voting for Le Pen's party, the National Front, in 2005 when the French people rejected the enlargement of the EU in a referendum. But the French government pushed the measure through parliament anyway. Jerome Ferrand says the people's "no" was turned into a "yes" to build an EU that nobody wanted. "We want a Europe of nations in solidarity, but one where every country has control and can do what's best for its own people," Jerome says. "We don't want to live under German hegemony." The brothers say they don't blame Germany, they blame French politicians for taking the EU too far. The men say Franco-German relations will be just fine without the EU. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: And now to France, where the polls show a tight race in the upcoming presidential election. Among the subjects dividing the population is membership in the European Union. The EU is still very popular in France, but right-wing candidate Marin Le Pen says if elected, she will hold a referendum on leaving the EU, and that is winning supporters in unlikely places. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley has our story from eastern France near the border with Germany. (SOUNDBITE OF BELLS) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Cathedral bells ring out over the majestic French city of Metz. Metz was built by the French and the Germans and has a shared history going back more than a thousand years. Metz is in the heart of the Alsace-Lorraine region, which changed hands four times since the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Today, a group of soldiers is showing off their tanks and military hardware to the public in the cathedral square. JONATHAN NAEGELE: My name is Jonathan. I'm the communication officer for the Deutsche-Fransuziche Brigade. It's a binational military brigade with German and French units working together. BEARDSLEY: Jonathan Naegele of the French army says this region has close-knit ties with Germany in just about every area. He describes a sort of kinship between the two peoples. It's Franco-German friendship week in Metz, and French and German flags fly together all over town. (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: Mayors from twinned cities speak at a reception. It wasn't always like this, says Metz Mayor Dominique Gros. The 75-year-old says his father, grandfather and great-grandfather all fought in wars against Germany. DOMINIQUE GROS: (Through interpreter) When I was little, I learned that Germany was our enemy, but we've managed to overcome this ancestral hatred, and we built Europe together. Today, we work together. Our young people go to university together. And we have the same democratic values. BEARDSLEY: But Gros says people are beginning to look inward again, and he's worried by the nationalist feelings being stirred up by Marine Le Pen.

BEARDSLEY: While Metz celebrating Franco-German friendship, on the other side of town, Le Pen is holding a rally. She accuses her opponents of trying to scare people about her opposition to the EU. We don't need the EU to go shopping or to work in Germany, she says. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LE PEN: (Through interpreter) Putting back borders doesn't mean closing your country and keeping people and goods from coming and going. It just means being able to control which people and goods come and go and to keep certain people from getting into our country and staying. (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: Jerome and Julien Ferrand are brothers in their 60s. They started voting for Le Pen's party, the National Front, in 2005 when the French people rejected the enlargement of the EU in a referendum. But the French government pushed the measure through parliament anyway. Jerome Ferrand says the people's no was turned into a yes to build an EU that nobody wanted. JEROME FERRAND: (Through interpreter) We want a Europe of nations in solidarity but one where every country has control and can do what's best for its own people. We don't want to live under German hegemony. BEARDSLEY: The brothers say they don't blame Germany. They blame French politicians for taking the EU too far. The men say Franco-German relations will be just fine without the EU. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Metz, France. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 14, 2017 Share Advertisement Briefs Briefs Chinese delegation visits FPCCI By our correspondent LAHORE: Henan Chamber of Commerce and Industry vice president Hu Zengmin said economic globalisation and regional integration has provided enormous opportunities for further cooperation between China and Pakistan. During his visit to the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Regional Office Lahore on Wednesday, he said, “Both Countries are strongly associated together and both countries’ mutual relations are based on solid foundations.” Zengmin said Pakistan was an ideal destination of foreign investment and top priority of the Chinese investors. FPCCI vice president and regional chairman Manzoor Ul Haq said while China was one of the important trade partners of Pakistan, there was dire need of trade balancing between both countries. “China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and business friendly investment policies have turned Pakistan into the best trade and investment destination.” He highlighted various investment and joint venture opportunities, and said joint ventures with Chinese enterprises would facilitate vital transfer of technology, as Pakistan needed to upgrade the value-addition process. Highlighting regional trade opportunities, he said CPEC was the largest overseas investment, which was coming in the next three years. The investment would further upraise the potential of Pakistani market to the world.   Govt, international bank to sign deal ISLAMABAD: The government will soon sign an agreement with an international bank to ensure funding for the construction of the much-delayed Dasu Dam. Minister of state for water and power Abid Sher Ali informed this to the National Assembly during the Question-Hour session on Thursday. The agreement with an international bank worth $350 million is expected to be finalised soon, as these banks are in the process of providing commercial financing up to $800 million against the World Bank Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) and the government of Pakistan guarantees. The state minister said the agreement for commercial financing of Rs114 billion against the government of Pakistan guarantees and the balance-sheet of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) was signed on March 29, 2017 with the consortium of seven local banks led by Habib Bank Limited. Other banks in the consortium included National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank, Faysal Bank and Meezan Bank. Answering a supplementary question, the state minister said loan agreement between the government, Wapda and the World Bank for an IDA credit of $588.4 million along with an IDA Partial Credit Guarantee of $460 million was signed on August 25, 2014 in Islamabad and this loan agreement was effective from November 20, 2014.   Industry-academia body formed By our correspondent LAHORE: The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has declared 2017 as the year of industry-academia linkage, a statement said on Thursday. The decision was made by LCCI president Abdul Basit, senior vice President Amjad Ali Jawa and vice president Muhammad Nasir Hameed Khan. A special Standing Committee on Industry-Academia linkage has also been established. The LCCI office-bearers said the purpose of this initiative is to enhance interaction between the industrial sector and educational institutions. It would help produce skilled human resource as per the requirement of the industry. They said the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry is focusing on development of research activities and capacity building.   EDB to attend Hannover Messe-2017 ISLAMABAD: The Engineering Development Board (EDB) is all set to participate in the Hannover Messe-2017 scheduled in Germany from April 24 to April 28. The ministry of commerce would provide funds for this participation through Export Development Fund (EDF), sources said on Thursday, adding, as many as 6,500 international exhibitors participate in the event every year. The sources said the Pakistan's Pavilion would be set up in the Industrial Supply Category, where the product showcase for innovative subcontracting will take place. The objective of this participation primarily is to look for new markets for Pakistan's value-added engineering products, besides giving an exposure to high quality production technologies and the international norms and standards to the local business community. The EDB revived this event in 2016 after a break of six years and the participation received an overwhelming response and generated quality leads. Many industries received export orders from across the world, the sources said, adding, this year's participation is in continuation of the previous event and is expected to bring home much more.   TSMC Q1 profit up 35pc TAIPEI: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co on Thursday said profit rose 35.3 percent in the first quarter, below estimates, after revenue for the world´s largest contract chipmaker and major supplier to Apple Inc missed guidance. Net profit hit T$87.63 billion ($2.90 billion) for January-March, traditionally a weak period for the tech sector after the year-end sales rush. That missed the T$88.26 billion median analyst estimate in a Thomson Reuters/Eikon poll. The result was also down from the T$100.2 billion of the fourth quarter of last year, which was a quarterly record. Gross profit margin was 51.9 percent while its operating margin was 40.8 percent. TSMC earlier this week said first-quarter revenue, at T$233.91 billion, missed the lower end of its guidance for T$236 billion given in January due to a strong Taiwan dollar. TSMC will detail its second-quarter outlook in an earnings conference on Thursday where analysts will listen for its views on the possibility of bidding for Toshiba Corp´s chip business.   Carrefour reports rise in sales PARIS: French supermarket retailer Carrefour reported higher first-quarter revenue, slightly above the consensus market forecast, and maintained its full-year sales growth outlook. Carrefour, the world´s second-biggest retailer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc, said first-quarter sales had risen 6.2 percent at current exchange rates to 21.3 billion euros ($22.7 billion), boosted by a strong performance in Brazil. The consensus sales forecast, according to a poll for Reuters compiled by Inquiry Financial, stood at 21.2 billion euros. Carrefour said it was sticking to its target for full-year 2017 sales growth of between 3 and 5 percent, at constant exchange rates.   Bank of Korea holds rates SEOUL: South Korea´s central bank raised its growth outlook for this year and kept interest rates unchanged at a record low for a 10th straight month on Thursday, while its governor shifted policy to a more hawkish stance. The Bank of Korea´s monetary policy committee held its base rate steady at 1.25 percent, in line with forecasts from 21 analysts surveyed in a Reuters poll. A majority of analysts see the central bank on hold for the rest of the year and some see tightening beginning next year.     Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Ruling party loses Srinagar seat Wrong blasphemy accusers must be dealt with strictly: Imam-e-Ka’aba Budget to be presented on May 26: Dar Huge cache of arms recovered in Orakzai, Parachinar ‘Yes’ camp edging ahead in Turkey poll on Erdogan powers View more... see all opinions Opinion Syed Talat Hussain Mashal’s murder Zaigham Khan The century of ulema in politics Umer Khalid Why children don’t attend school Dr A Q Khan Women and engineering Fazal Shah Mohmand Fata merger Medea Benjamin A massive bomb see all opinions Newspost 5G technology The chairman’s protest Cakes and bombs Tale of intolerance Tears in Syria View more... see all opinions Editorial Rising tensions Handling North Korea View more... see all opinions National Bahria Town unveils dancing fountains Looters won’t go scot-free: Punjab CM Mashal case: Seven more accused remanded in police custody ‘Power production increased as compared to 2013’ Christians celebrate Easter in Lahore amid tight security View more... see all opinions World French presidential hopefuls battle for votes Macron, 39-year-old French prodigy eyeing presidency Modern life intrudes on Ethiopia’s ancient salt trade ‘Islamic’ kindergartens cause a stir in Austria The bus mafia controlling Nepal’s smog-choked capital View more... see all opinions Sports Firmino lifts Liverpool back to third ‘Performance of Kamran, Shehzad below expectations’ Rana, Rohit, Pollard seal another Wankhede chase Aamer shines as Balochistan edge Punjab Pak bowlers toil against WI President’s XI View more... see all opinions Business see all opinions Karachi Bilawal promises peace and prosperity in city CTD claims emergence of new group of assassins in Karachi Presence of Rangers in Sindh need of the hour, says governor CM reviews development projects of four Sindh districts KU announces admissions schedule View more... see all opinions Lahore Farmers forced to sell wheat at low price Power production has increased: CM Mercury reaches 42°C Two killed, eight injured in shootout Mother of All Bombs of corruption View more... see all opinions Islamabad Rawalpindi crime ratio reaches new high ‘Lok Mela’ ends with colourful cultural show Institute of Psychiatry arranges lecture on Borderline Personality Disorder Hot weather in days ahead People Are Talking About — View more... see all opinions Peshawar see all opinions Advertisement PRIVACY POLICY | CONTACT US | BACK ISSUES © 2017 THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL Back To Top

Adam Bowles 8:33 AM, Apr 16, 2017 BAKERSFIELD, CA - https://www.facebook.com/AdamBowles23ABC/   Need to grab something before heading to to Grandma's on Sunday? Keep in mind that not all stores will be open on Easter Sunday.   Easter is unlike a lot of holidays because some stores will be open, but some give their employees the day off. That means half the stores in a mall may be open, while the other half will be dark.   It's also a day many people end up frustrated, showing up to an empty parking lot when they need something in the store.   Closed businesses   Stores that will be closed Easter Sunday 2017 include:   Target Dillard's Macy's JC Penney Nordstrom TJ Maxx/ Marshalls Best Buy Costco Sam's club Michael's Stores Publix supermarkets (one of the few big grocery stores that will be closed) Open Businesses   Stores open, though hours may be limited, include:   Kroger supermarkets Giant Eagle supermarkets Safeway supermarkets CVS, Walgreens, and Rite-Aid Walmart Home Depot Lowe's Sears Most stores specializing in Spring gardening, such as Home Depot, Lowe's, Sears and Walmart will be open, as many people will be working in their yards after they finish off their Easter ham. © 2017 Newsy.com.

A reader wants to know if chains like Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops are struggling due to broad retail weakness or a long-term shift in consumer preferences. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Apr 16, 2017 at 11:35AM Clifford makes the latest contribution to the Industry Focus mailbag after he wrote in to ask whether declining interest in hunting, fishing, and outdoor sports has been a major factor in the demise of many outdoor and athletic gear retailers. On this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen is joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to address the softness in the outdoor sports market. While some traditional pastimes have lost their luster, there is a bright spot for the industry. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 11, 2017. Vincent Shen: Clifford asks, "Hey do you have a source that confirms that the outdoor equipment market is not shrinking? My suspicion is that with the changing face of America, many people just aren't fishing or hunting or camping." At first glance, you consider some of the major challenges we talked about with brick-and-mortar chains, brands that have in general, encountered over the past year or so. Just some examples, Sports Authority, gone, City Sports, gone, Vestis Retail, which operated Eastern Mountain Sports, Bob's Stores, and Sports Chalet, those chains, it declared bankruptcy last summer, reemerged as Eastern Outfitters, and just in the past week, Eastern Outfitters announced they will be closing a number of stores. Their bounce back has not been as successful as they'd hoped. It seems like Clifford might be on to something in terms of these outdoor retailers finding themselves facing a smaller market than what we may have previously had. Dan, have you taken your son hunting or fishing at all? Even camping? Kline: We've gone fishing. Knowing we were going to talk about this, I danced around this a little bit in the last segment. I think it's fair to say that there's some softness in some of these markets. You're right, there might be less hunting. We talked a little bit about that gun sales in general, which were at all time highs due to fears that President Obama might pass some regulations against guns, have softened a little bit, or at least, there is some fear that they're going to soften. So there absolutely could be a lower demand, but I don't see how the lower demand has caught up to the incredible loss of retail capacity. If you're Cabela's (NYSE:CAB), you've seen competitors go out of business or get a lot smaller left and right. So, clearly, the Amazons (NASDAQ: AMZN) and the REI's and the people who are succeeding in the space -- Dick's, to a very small extent -- they have grown. There might be a smaller pie, but there's less people going after that. Absolutely, have I gone fishing? Sure. But how often do you buy a new fishing rod? You bought camping supplies this year, where did you get them? Shen: I, admittedly, went online for a lot of that, through some companies that do you have a major physical store presence, like REI, like you mentioned, which is privately held, and sometimes, on Amazon or somewhere that's a strict online operation. I have data here, specifically, from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that shows ongoing declines in the number of hunters and fishermen in this country over the past several decades. In 1970, I think it was 40 million Americans had hunting licenses compared to just 14 million or so today. You have to keep in mind, as well, the country's population has grown in that same time period from about 200 million to over 320 million. So the rate of participation is even gloomier, I would say. Fishing fares a little bit better, with estimates that the number of anglers in the U.S. is about 40 to 50 million. But even then, participation among especially the youth, called the next generation of fishermen, and hunters, both these activities show a far less encouraging outlook. But they're still huge multi-billion dollar industries. I think the bright spot is, Clifford mentioned camping as well. Despite what amounts to a huge number of entertainment alternatives and activities out there that are available to people today -- the internet, streaming, television, video games, school sports, all these activities that keep both adults and younger consumers and kids busy these days, they haven't really completely abandoned the outdoors. National Park Service actually reported record visitation in recent years with annual visitors topping 300 million. Pretty impressive in that regard. But the last point I'll make, you brought up gun sales and gun ownership. That's really reflected even in Cabela's results. They have their hunting equipment, which includes firearms, scopes, archery equipment and related accessories and supplies. Hunting equipment as a percentage of Cabela's sales went up from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2016. This, I would say generally reflected a huge boom period during the administration for President Obama in gun sales. But, when it comes down to it, there's definitely a lot of debate in terms of gun ownership, different surveys, different data, is it actually going down? You have these record sales, is it more people buying firearms? But the rate of ownership among households is declining. What do you think, Dan? Kline: There was compelling pressure, at least in a certain political lobby to, when you had a Democrat who was perceived as being anti-gun -- although he never particularly did anything anti-gun -- in charge to go out right now and buy guns. And that created a bit of a frenzy, because if you are a gun manufacturer, let's say Sturm, Ruger, you're going to be very careful about increasing capacity because, if you build a new factory, which they did, a couple of years ago, but if you build a new factory for short-term demand without factoring in that that demand may cool off, you're going to end up with a lot of excess factory space, and all of the negatives that go with that. So, during this whole peak period, even as there were ebbs and flows in how people felt about Obama, the gun sales were still high because a guy got on the waiting list for a model he wanted nine months before and then he got it. We're still dealing with the industry shaking some of that off. And I do think there will be a softening, because there is no possibility of upcoming gun legislation, at least until 2018. Guns are not cheap, so if you already own a few of them, you're probably going to back off. But the reality is, the Cabela's and the Bass Pro Shops are so diverse in what they sell, I think the mistake here might be them not shifting their merchandise or their focus based on changing needs. If camping is more popular than fishing, the Cabela's I went to in Connecticut pretty regularly didn't change that much. Their displays, their allocation of space, was about the same. Maybe that's something that the merged company can deal with. If traditional retailers do a lot more seasonal moving around, then maybe some of these sporting goods type retailers -- obviously, they deal with seasons, winter, summer -- but maybe you do need to massively change how much space you allocate for fishing in certain markets, because it's not as popular. The same with hunting, and the same with all the other categories. Shen: For Clifford, final takeaways, I think it's interesting to see this balance, with hunting and fishing, with that ongoing decline, you still have what amount to be very significant businesses for these various chains and retailers. I think the best way that you put it, Dan, was shifting that product mix. Kline: They need to get more sophisticated. When your competitor is Amazon -- and I think we're seeing this with Costco and some of the other companies we're talking about, no matter how immune your business is, eventually, the sheer efficiency of Amazon and their one-click ordering, their return process -- I just bought something from a third party on Amazon that never showed up, even though they said they shipped it, and within 48 hours, I had a complete refund. That's where the old world retailers like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops, they're still thinking like physical stores. And they need to go more like Costco and Wal-Mart and say, "We have this asset of physical stores. How do we tie that into, now, we're not limited to what we have here, we have this entire world of stores, you can try it here, you can buy one that's there, the size doesn't fit, we have that in another place, you can drop off a return." And they've really got to step that up. I would love to see Bass Pro Shops when these companies combine do what Marc Lore from Wal-Mart has said and go out and buy a start-up, go hire some talent and really rethink how you approach all of this for the digital age. Shen: Yeah. And I'll say, too, with firearm sales, for example, I think that is still a space where the physical presence is still really important to buyers, and it makes sense that some of these, during the Obama Administration, when sales were really booming, they shifted their product mix. Now, it seems like they'll be shifting again potentially, if that part of the industry is softening. And as you mentioned, if camping is more popular, especially with, for example, the National Park visitation numbers going higher. But, any other final takeaways from you, Dan, before we wrap up? Kline: There is no scenario where I'll be camping, but if you'd like to go shooting sometime, that seems like a good time. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Today, every single person on the Forbes 400 list is a billionaire. Many have become philanthropists, and they are reshaping public policy, and society, as they see fit. And because of their numbers, they have far more influence than the philanthropists of the past, argues David Callahan, author of a new book on philanthropy, The Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age. Many are now household names: the Gates, the Kochs, the Waltons, the Steyers, the Mercers, to name a few. They come in all political stripes. "We're seeing just an escalating ideological arms race as more money pours in from wealthy donors across the spectrum," says Callahan, who founded the news website Inside Philanthropy. In an interview with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Callahan describes a meeting with philanthropist Laura Arnold, who said, "When you open the newspaper in the morning and you see things that you don't like, things that upset you, if you have a foundation you can do something about it, you can try to solve the problem and take action." So what's wrong with this? Ways Philanthropists Can Influence Public Policy When people talk about the influence of money in politics, they often mean campaign donations. But wealthy philanthropists can influence policy in many other ways. Author David Callahan says they can do this by setting up a foundation to fund these things: Think tanks Academics who publish research to support a given opinion Lawyers to pursue change through litigation Activists to stage protests and pressure campaigns Pop-up media blitzes Creation of media outlets Underwriting of books and magazines Documentaries to persuade public opinion Callahan says this philanthropic money comes at a time when most Americans feel disenfranchised. "More and more public policy debates looks like Greek gods throwing lightning at each other, billionaires on the left and the right, as the rest of us watch from the sidelines," he says. When wealthy Americans set up a charitable foundation, they can avoid paying taxes, while influencing public policy. "If I give a donation to a politician, that's not tax deductible. If I give a donation to a Washington think tank that whispers in the ear of that politician, I can get a tax break for that," Callahan says. "The IRS makes few distinctions in what is tax-deductible giving, and I think that's a problem." Callahan says the influence of big donors will become greater as government steps back, through budget cuts to public agencies, and as private philanthropy steps forward. Whether it's from the left or the right, Callahan says, all of it is troubling.

How? Amazon Independent Booksellers In terms of sheer dollar amounts, it's unclear who gives more. But Callahan says right wing donors have been more effective when it comes to shaping economic and fiscal policy, bankrolling big think tanks in Washington that advocate for cutting the size of government. Those include The Heritage Foundation, which now plays a big role in the Trump administration. Liberal donors, Callahan says, have been successful in advancing social issues, such as LGBT rights. Callahan cites the role of philanthropist Tim Gill, in advancing marriage equality. Public education is another area where there has been an influx of money from billionaire donors. The Waltons of Wal-Mart fame and Betsy DeVos, now the education secretary, for example, are well-known supporters of charter schools. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was a powerful force behind ushering in the Common Core educational standards. (The Gates Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation are among NPR's financial supporters.) "More than any single actor in U.S. education, [the Gates] really made the Common Core happen," Callahan says. "That's an astonishing achievement for private philanthropy."

Today, every single person on the Forbes 400 list is a billionaire. Many have become philanthropists, and they are reshaping public policy, and society, as they see fit. And because of their numbers, they have far more influence than the philanthropists of the past, argues David Callahan, author of a new book on philanthropy, The Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age. Many are now household names: the Gates, the Kochs, the Waltons, the Steyers, the Mercers, to name a few. They come in all political stripes. "We're seeing just an escalating ideological arms race as more money pours in from wealthy donors across the spectrum," says Callahan, who founded the news website Inside Philanthropy. In an interview with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Callahan describes a meeting with philanthropist Laura Arnold, who said, "When you open the newspaper in the morning and you see things that you don't like, things that upset you, if you have a foundation you can do something about it, you can try to solve the problem and take action."

Zeri D. Brewer was scheduled to appear before Magisterial District Judge Joseph Homanko, Weatherly, on Tuesday when he waived his right, according to court records. He now awaits a May 9 formal arraignment in Carbon County Court, Jim Thorpe. State police at Hazleton said Brewer was traveling at 90 miles per hour on Brenkman Drive (Route 4010) when his vehicle crashed into a vehicle driven by Mary Beth Thamarus, 55, Weatherly. Brewer lost control of his vehicle while negotiating a curve in the westbound lane and veered into the path of Thamarus’ vehicle, which was eastbound, just before 9 p.m., troopers said. Thamarus was later pronounced dead at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Hazleton and her death was attributed to multiple traumatic injuries sustained in the crash. The speed limit in that area is 50 mph. Troopers filed charges for involuntary manslaughter, homicide by vehicle and five summary traffic violations against Brewer on Feb. 8. ­— AMANDA CHRISTMAN Man to serve up to 3 years in prison for police chase A Ringtown man is headed to state prison after being sentenced Wednesday in Schuylkill County Court in connection with an incident that resulted in a police chase. Dean J. Zelinsky, 51, must serve 10 to 36 months in a state correctional institution for his crimes, Judge John E. Domalakes decided. Zelinsky pleaded guilty on Feb. 22 to fleeing or eluding police, terroristic threats, driving under the influence, failure to drive on roadways laned for traffic and harassment. Prosecutors withdrew charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, resisting arrest, failure to keep right and careless driving. State police at Frackville charged Zelinsky with threatening his neighbor, Richard Eroh, with a shotgun and then leading them on a chase starting at 11:20 p.m. March 31, 2016. Zelinsky was DUI during the chase on Route 339, police said. Under the terms of Domalakes’ sentence, Zelinsky also must pay costs, $325 in fines, $100 to the Substance Abuse Education Fund, $50 to the Criminal Justice Enhancement Account and $520 restitution to Lehigh Valley Hospital Network, have no contact with Eroh and perform 20 hours community service. McAdoo man’s parole revoked Schuylkill County Judge John E. Domalakes on Thursday revoked the parole of David N. Benitez, 33, of McAdoo, and recommitted him to prison for almost four months at the least. Benitez admitted violating his parole by failing to report to his supervising officer, not making payments on his costs and fees and not successfully completing his drug and alcohol evaluation. He cannot reapply for parole until at least Aug. 10 and could remain behind bars until July 14, 2018, under the terms of Domalakes’ order. Benitez originally pleaded guilty on June 17, 2015, to two charges of theft. At that time, Domalakes sentenced him to serve 39 days to 23 months in prison and pay fines, costs and restitution. Kline Township and Tamaqua police charged Benitez in separate thefts on Feb. 1, 2014. On Wednesday, Benitez pleaded guilty to a count of false identification to law enforcement filed against him by Hazleton police after a Feb. 8 offense while a count of use or possession of drug paraphernalia was withdrawn by officers. He was ordered to confinement from Feb. 10 through March 12 by Magisterial District Judge Joseph Zola, Hazleton.

The students, along with others at Central Primary School and in the Arkadelphia community, are rallying together to support Colleen on her cancer journey and raise funds for the upcoming Relay for Life on Friday. ARKADELPHIA — In her 28 years of teaching, Debbie Robertson of Arkadelphia has experienced a wide range of dynamics and joy from her students. Yet she’d never been quite as touched by a student as she has by Colleen Herron, a cancer survivor and Central Primary School second-grader. Robertson recently organized the #teamcolleen fundraiser in conjunction with the local Relay for Life initiative of the American Cancer Society. “When I met Colleen the first day she entered my classroom, she also entered my heart,” Robertson said. “I went home and couldn’t stop thinking about her. She apologized to me for having to push her wheelchair, apologized to me for having to rearrange my room, and she apologized to me for just about everything. She clearly felt like a burden to others. I could not let her feel that way. I decided that we all needed to get on her team and show her how much she means to us at Central Primary.” In 2015, Colleen was diagnosed with a rare cancer, adamantinoma, in her left tibia, said her mother, Kelly Haddox. Surgery removed the tumor, and Colleen healed and began walking again. Months later, Colleen went back to Arkansas Children’s Hospital for a routine scan, and her family was told her cancer had returned. Colleen’s leg is healing and growing now after undergoing special surgeries to remove the entire tibia and replace her bone with a donor femur and inject it with her own DNA from her pelvic bone. Through everything, “she’s still smiling,” Colleen’s mother said. “Throughout the whole ordeal, she has remained extremely resilient and very optimistic. She’s our family’s hero. She inspires us all. Colleen still has more healing to do, but her future looks hopeful.” Robertson shared her fundraising idea with other school administrators, as well as local Relay for Life coordinators Ryan and Kimberly Ellison. The kickoff was held March 2, and the Ellisons “went above and beyond to highlight our girl,” Robertson noted. “The students were cheering loudly and, for the first time, understood why we do Relay for Life. Colleen has since made a whole school of friends and sees every day that she is not a burden, but a blessing, to all of us at Central Primary.” Despite missing so much school because of undergoing surgeries, Colleen has almost caught up to where she needs to be, Robertson said. “She wants to do good and gives it her all every time we work with her,” the teacher said. “On a personal level, I must say that Colleen has such a big heart for others and animals.” On the day of this interview, Robertson said Colleen was late to school because she had to stop and help a dog on the side of the road. “She said, ‘We saw an older dog walking on the side of the road. He looked all dirty and hungry. He even looked blind in one eye. I felt sorry for him and couldn’t just leave him there. I made Momma stop and pick him up. She is giving him a bath and feeding him while I’m at school. I’ll check on him when I get home,’” Robertson said. In a video holding large flash cards to describe her journey, Colleen said she hopes to be walking fully by this summer. She said she walked briefly in February. She won’t be able to jump again or play sports. She said that without her dogs, family, friends and amazing teacher, Mrs. Robertson, her journey would be a lot more difficult. It’s been an amazing feat to see the school and community join together for a cause, Robertson said. “Business and people in our community donated money to help us buy shirts that say #teamcolleen. Every child in my classroom has one now, and I saw a lady at Walmart yesterday, and she had one of the shirts on. She was explaining it to another lady. I just smiled when I passed by.” Colleen has touched more people than she’ll ever know, Robertson said. “A burden? No way,” Robertson said. “She’s such a huge blessing instead.” Robertson and other Colleen supporters will be conducting their final fundraiser this week, Monday through Friday. Colleen and her friends will be selling #teamcolleen buttons at school for $1, Robertson said. Robertson’s whole class will walk during the Relay for Life, scheduled for Friday at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia. “We will walk in her honor while pushing [Colleen] in her wheelchair,” Robertson said.
