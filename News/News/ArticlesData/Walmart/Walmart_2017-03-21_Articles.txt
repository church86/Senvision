The incubator will focus on startups engaged in machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality. Lore unveiled the plans at the annual Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas. The move reflects Walmart's ambition to catch up to Amazon in the e-commerce retail space. Lore took the helm of Walmart's e-commerce business after Walmart acquired Jet.com, the company he cofounded. More Walmart acquisitions are in the works, he said, as the company accelerates its expansion in the online arena. Established Distribution Network Walmart intends to take advantage of its already strong presence in brick-and-mortar locations, which can serve both as traditional showrooms for customers and as distribution centers for online shoppers who want to find clickable discounts and pick up purchases from a reliable distribution center that is close to their neighborhoods. "Walmart does a pretty good job of enabling online sales for its retail inventory," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Where it falls short is enabling a retail ecosystem where many companies can sell goods and services under their umbrella," he told the E-Commerce Times. Amazon has put together an enormous technical and intellectual property base to support and extract revenue from such an online marketplace, while Walmart has fallen short in that regard, Jude added. Walmart currently operates almost 11,700 retail units globally, including 4,672 in the U.S. alone. It also operates in more than 6,300 in overseas markets. In addition, it runs 660 Sam's Club warehouse locations. Walmart's Shopping Spree Lore's announcement followed several months of strategic acquisitions by Walmart. It has added a number of online apparel retailers to its growing Walmart online ecosystem, allowing them to retain their own brand identities and human talent, with the goal of building on existing customer relationships. "These are small, but they are telling and they're tactical," noted Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's. "Walmart starts to pick things off in subsegments of retail and bolt them on," he told the E-Commerce Times. Walmart earlier this year acquired ShoeBuy for US$70 million. Founded in 1999, it was one of the first retailers to sell shoes on the Web. Although Shoebuy continues to operate under its own brand -- with CEO Mike Sorabella, his top executives and 200 employees remaining in place at its existing headquarters -- it now is part of the Walmart retail e-commerce business. Walmart next acquired Moosejaw, an outdoor apparel and sporting goods retailer, for $51 million. Considered one of the leading online stores in the category, it operates 10 physical locations. Under that agreement, Moosejaw CEO Eoin Comerford, his executive team and the company's 350 employees became part of Walmart's e-commerce retail operation, but continue to operate under their own brand at the same locations. Walmart's most recent acquisition, ModCloth, brought one of the leading online specialty retailers of women's apparel and accessories to the retailing chain. Modcloth is known for offering a diverse range of apparel for different body sizes and lifestyles, and for promoting a positive body image. As with the other acquistions, ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his top executives and the retailer's 300-plus workers will continue to operate under the same brand and at the same locations as before.

Moosejaw sells popular outdoors gear, apparel and merchandise from brands like Patagonia and North Face at its 10 physical stores. Walmart's real interest here, though, would appear to be online. Moosejaw is an established e-commerce player in apparel and accessories. Walmart said that Moosejaw's CEO and more than 350 employees will continue to operate out of Michigan, where they'll keep on overseeing their site and physical stores as "a standalone and complementary brand" in Walmart's growing e-commerce portfolio.

Now Walmart is expanding its e-commerce ambitions, and it has tapped a Jet executive to help it build new startups within the company. The company said this week that it has formed Store No. 8, an internal venture meant to hatch new online retail businesses. It is the latest sign that Walmart is trying to revamp its e-commerce playbook. That effort began in earnest last year, with the acquisition of Jet. And last week, Walmart struck a deal to buy ModCloth, an online purveyor of trendy women’s clothing. Behind the strategic shift has been a recognition that Walmart, long dominant in the world of physical retailing, has fallen far behind in the business of selling goods online — and particularly far behind Amazon. Jet had ambitions of becoming Amazon’s most formidable rival at a time when few credible challengers had emerged. But Jet failed to achieve profitability or emerge as a robust competitor. Many big companies have internal venture arms. And Walmart already has an internal research lab, WalmartLabs of San Bruno, that has focused on developing new e-commerce applications for the retailer. But Store No. 8 is the first incubator or investment arm of its kind at Walmart, which has a market value of $213 billion. The new venture takes its name from an early Walmart store, built in an old bottling plant, that the company founder Sam Walton would use to try out new retail strategies. Store No. 8 is meant to foster relationships with entrepreneurs, particularly those in the fields of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies. “We knew we needed to keep investing in the future of retail,” Seth Beal, one of the principals of Store No. 8, said in a recent interview. “We’re making sure that we make the right short-term decisions but don’t neglect the long term.” Beal, who was previously a senior vice president for global marketplace and digital store operations at Walmart, will be joined by Katie Finnegan, who led Jet’s corporate development and has a background in fundraising and mergers. “When the mother ship is ready, we’re sort of ahead of the eight ball,” Finnegan said. “Our goal is to have whatever we work on integrated into the mother ship.” Store No. 8 is somewhat like corporate venture arms at other companies and will be charged with identifying emerging technologies that could prove useful. But rather than simply taking stakes in existing ventures, the new division is intended to help create new startups. It will also strike strategic partnerships with other promising young e-commerce companies. Along with incubating new ventures, Finnegan said, Store No. 8 will be able to draw on Walmart’s resources to support any startups that it launches. “We’re giving these portfolio companies the best chance for success,” she said. Beale and Finnegan declined to comment on how much money Walmart would commit to the new venture, saying that Store No. 8 did not have a set goal for money to use in its investing.

Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart.com and jet.com, made the announcement Monday during the Shoptalk Conference held in Las Vegas this week. Lore said he spends much of his time evaluating potential startups for acquisition. Store No. 8 will do just that under the direction of Seth Beal of Wal-Mart eCommerce U.S., and Kate Finnegan of Jet.com. Lore said the retailer is just beginning with its acquisitions because there are other specialty retail categories where deeper expertise is needed. When asked about the strategy Wal-Mart is using with the startup acquisitions of ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy, Lore said the retailer is convinced it will win the e-commerce war by having something for everyone. He said Jet.com and Walmart.com, though they share logistics and merchandising expertise, are different brands. He said Jet.com services more upscale and urban consumers and is growing its shopper base at increased speed since marrying Wal-Mart. He recently shot 1,000 personal videos from Jet.com to provide a personal touch for shoppers regarding products sold on that site. He said not having to spend the time to raise capital allows Jet.com to focus on improving service and product offerings. He said Walmart.com reaches the masses and is also continuing to improve over the past six months. Lore said shoppers in stores will soon find their complete basket purchases on Walmart.com in a shopping list form they can print and take back to the store, or simply click to re-order and pickup in a store of their choosing. He said it would take a long time to curate a long shopping list on Walmart.com but soon customers won’t have to do that work themselves. Lore said it’s important for Jet.com and Walmart.com to not overlap but grow their own distinct shopper bases. With respect to the recent acquisitions, Lore said the CEOs will have responsibility not only for their own websites but also from the specific category at Jet.com and Walmart.com. For instance the CEO of ShoeBuy will oversee all footwear sold at Walmart.com and Jet.com. Lore said the there is a wealth of untapped opportunity in many categories and these acquisitions and more in the future that will be addressed. He said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon has empowered him to make radical changes in the operation and he’s giving the CEO’s of the acquired startups much the same liberation. Lore said five years from now he expects Walmart.com and the new startups acquired to be major disruptors in the market. “We can do a lot of damage,” he said. Lore said the long term gain is to perfect its expertise in every category. He hinted that acquisitions in the future will likely be more vertically integrated where the online retailer largely controls its supply chain such as with ModCloth. He said suppliers will be given an opportunity to sell into Jet.com and possibly Walmart.com where it makes sense. “We are having success getting brands to come on to Jet first. We build that relationship there and do what we say. We hope to try and move some of them on to Walmart.com over time,” Lore said. “My mandate is to crush the U.S. The first order of business is to make sure we win in the U.S. and that means win, But it won’t happen in 12 months.” Annibal Sodero, assistant professor of supply chain logistics at the University of Arkansas, said recently that Wal-Mart must grow online market share through acquisition. He said the retailer has few other options given that Amazon is the dominant player. He said growth by acquisition gives Walmart.com access to consumers they might not otherwise have, but he said the different cultures of the startups might not be easy to integrate with Wal-Mart. Lore said that has not been problem because Wal-Mart is not integrating the brands, but instead providing them with financial security to grow in their own space, while also helping Walmart.com and Jet.com in the process.

Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

The so-called Store No. 8 will be located in Silicon Valley and marks the latest attempt by the company’s new head of e-commerce operations, Marc Lore, to speed up innovation at the company. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, brought over Lore, the founder of Jet.com, when the discounter bought the online retailer last year for more than $3 billion. Wal-Mart has been on an acquisition binge since then, snapping up ShoeBuy, Moosejaw and ModCloth. The incubator lab’s mission will be to house new startups that will run independently from the company. It will hatch, invest in and team up with entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists to create proprietary technology. Wal-Mart says these startups “will be ring-fenced from the broader organization, so they have the room to grow and develop.” Store No. 8 is named after an early store where Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton used to test different ideas that could be rolled out.

But the spectacle soon found its way inside the store. “We were just riding and a buddy of mine was, like, ‘Let’s go to Walmart,’ and I was, like, ‘Man, I’m not going to Walmart.’ He was, like, ‘Come on, let’s go!'” The two men and their horses strode into the store, passing by security and began wandering the aisles. “We is in ‘Wally World,'” Fields can be heard saying in the video as a young shopper is seen waving at him and the horse. According to Fields, one of the horses relieved itself inside the store.

Wal-Mart executives announced Monday they will be developing “Store No. 8” in Silicon Valley in hopes of making improvements to its online retail experience. Store No. 8 will experiment with autonomous vehicle and drone delivery, virtual reality and personalized shopping. Last summer, Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com, an online retailer, for $3.3 billion in an effort to compete with Amazon, the dominant force in online shopping. Marc Lore, founder of Jet.com joined Wal-Mart’s ecommerce team following the purchase. Store No. 8 will work with virtual reality and artificial intelligence entrepreneurs as well as technology start-ups who they deem beneficial to their goals. Wal-Mart has been a leader in the physical retail spectrum for many years, but has struggled to keep up with major companies in online sales. At the end of January, Wal-Mart announced free two day shipping on more than two million items with no membership fee required. It also moved the free shipping price requirement from $50 to $35 for those items that don’t qualify for the free two-day shipping. These changes were made in hopes of adding their name to an already vast list of online retailers. “We knew we needed to keep investing in the future of retail,” said Seth Beal, a principal of Store No. 8 in a recent interview. “We’re making sure that we make the right short term decisions but don’t neglect long term.” Store No. 8 will work to develop new products and services for Wal-Mart, but it will also have access to Wal-Mart’s resources for other business ventures they desire to pursue. For example, it will receive assistance for any start-up they wish to develop or further invest in. Last week, Wal-Mart signed off on a deal to buy ModCloth, an online women's clothing company that began in 2002. Wal-Mart will help them open more stores throughout the country and expand their online reach. Wal-Mart already has a research development team, but not to the extent of Store No. 8. The resources and idea behind Store No. 8 could cause major changes in the ecommerce world.

In order to better compete, retailers such as Walmart have grown to offer everything you could possibly want under one roof. In order to do that, the stores became massive. Walmart's Supercenters, for example, can be as large as 260,000 square feet. Walmart also realizes you may not want to walk around looking for products, so it is now considering using drones to fetch them for you. Drone deliveries face many hurdles including regulatory permission to fly, but that's outdoors, and while companies such as UPS are testing such systems, Walmart wants drones flying indoors through its own stores, which should be a lot easier to achieve. First spotted by Fortune, Walmart filed a patent entitled "Method to carry an item within a retail shopping facility." The patent describes being able to dispatch a drone within a retail shopping facility to collect and return with specific items. Essentially, Walmart is describing a personal shopper drone. Related Walmart Reduces Free 2-Day Shipping Requirements Walmart Reduces Free 2-Day Shipping Requirements As the patent explains, a computer would oversee drone flights within a store, with each being told where to fly, what to collect, and where to deliver it to. Sensors mounted on the drone will help avoid collisions, and drones would fly above shelves rather than aisles so as not to annoy shoppers who do decide to walk around the store. There's a number of advantages to offering such a service. It could encourage customers to shop while they have a coffee or meal and then simply collect their goods before leaving. Customers walking around the store may see something they want, but don't want to carry it around the store, so use their smartphone to ask a drone to collect it for them. Such a system is also going to be useful to Walmart for restocking shelves, which could be automated and carried out when the store is closed. Automating the shopping process and increasing convenience, the potential to replace some staff with drones and therefore cut costs, and the lack of regulatory hurdles because the system is only required to work indoors, suggests Walmart could try and roll this system out pretty quickly.

Now Wal-Mart is expanding its e-commerce ambitions and it has tapped a Jet executive to help it build new start-ups within the company. Wal-Mart announced on Monday that it had formed Store No. 8, an internal venture meant to hatch new online retail businesses. It is the latest sign that Wal-Mart is trying to revamp its e-commerce playbook. That effort began in earnest last year with the acquisition of Jet and last week Wal-Mart struck a deal to buy ModCloth, an online purveyor of trendy women’s clothing. Behind the strategic shift has been a recognition that Wal-Mart, long dominant in the world of physical retailing, has fallen far behind in the business of selling goods online — and particularly far behind Amazon.com Inc. Jet had ambitions of becoming Amazon’s most formidable rival at a time when few credible challengers had emerged, but it failed to achieve profitability or emerge as a robust competitor. Many big companies have internal venture arms and Wal-Mart already has an internal research laboratory, @walmartlabs, that has focused on developing new e-commerce applications for the retailer, but Store No. 8 is the first incubator or investment arm of its kind at Wal-Mart, which has a market value of US$213 billion. The new venture takes its name from an early Wal-Mart store, built in an old bottling plant, that company founder Sam Walton used to try out new retail strategies. Store No. 8 is meant to foster relationships with entrepreneurs, particularly those in the fields of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and other emerging technologies. “We knew we needed to keep investing in the future of retail,” Seth Beal, one of the principals of Store No. 8, said in an interview. “We’re making sure that we make the right short-term decisions, but don’t neglect the long term,” he said. Beal, who was previously a senior vice president for global marketplace and digital store operations at Wal-Mart, is to be joined by Katie Finnegan, who led Jet’s corporate development and has a background in fundraising and mergers. “When the mother ship is ready, we’re sort of ahead of the eight ball,” Finnegan said. “Our goal is to have whatever we work on integrated into the mother ship,” she said. Store No. 8 is somewhat like corporate venture arms at other companies and will be charged with identifying emerging technologies that could prove useful, but rather than simply taking stakes in existing ventures, the new division is intended to help create new start-ups. It will also strike strategic partnerships with other promising young e-commerce companies. Along with incubating new ventures, Finnegan said Store No. 8 would be able to draw on Wal-Mart’s resources to support any start-ups that it launches. “We’re giving these portfolio companies the best chance for success,” she said. Beale and Finnegan declined to comment on how much money Wal-Mart would commit to the new venture, saying that Store No. 8 did not have a set goal for money to deploy in its investing.

Pranksters Ride Through Walmart Aisles On Horseback Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Pranksters Ride Through Walmart Aisles On Horseback March 21, 2017 12:15 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler a horse in walmart a shopping horse horse prank retail that's not a shopping cart walmart The brilliant, absurd Walmart.horse might be gone, but its spirit lives on in the form of some Texas men who decided it was  good day for a horse ride through their local Walmart. KPRC reports that a man posted a video of himself and two friends sauntering through the big box store on horseback Sunday. The video, which contains some explicit language, shows two of the men riding their horses up and down the aisles of the store, while onlookers smiled in surprise. You can hear the clapping of the horses’ hooves on the cement as the man recording the video proclaims, “we is in Wally World. Walmart low prices, baby.” The man recording the video tells KPRC that he just wanted to make people smile and laugh with the prank. He said that he and two friends ride every weekend and got the idea to try something new. “I wasn’t trying to hurt nobody, or do anything destructive. It was just, like, you only live once, you know? That’s all,” the man tells KPRC. While most of the shoppers caught on the video smile, the man says a few seemed a bit scared, perhaps a bit shocked by the sight. After about two minutes, the man says, he and his friend left the store to meet the third man outside. While the rider recording the video made it outside without incident, his friend was apparently stopped by security. Walmart tells KPRC that it in no way condones the prank and are thankful that no one was hurt.

Woody Fields and two of his friends ride their horses together each weekend. Sunday evening, they decided to mix up their routine by going into a Walmart on Bissonnet and the Beltway, while still riding their four-legged friends.

"That security guard just sat there looking - we walked on in." He continued to explain that no one said anything to him and his friends, so they went in to buy a candy bar. While he was there, Walmart patrons were startled by the horses, with a few of them jumping when they turned the corner to see a tall horse looking down at them.

That could be changing for the retail giant since its subsidiary Jet.com recently acquired trendy fashion startup ModCloth for an undisclosed amount. Analysts believe the deal will cost Wal-Mart Stores between $50 million and $75 million, not significant enough to require the retailer to disclose to investors through a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It is believed Wal-Mart will return some of the $78 million in capital raised by ModCloth from venture capital groups, according to TechCrunch. The match between Wal-Mart and ModCloth may seem unlikely to some, but the fashion retailer has struggled in recent years to grow profits, and also brought in a new CEO in 2015 in Matthew Kaness, previously chief strategy officer at Urban Outfitters. Wal-Mart e-commerce spokesman Ravi Jariwala told Talk Business & Politics that Kaness and ModCloth’s 300 or so employees will continue to be based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh and join the Walmart U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Marc Lore, president and CEO of Wal-Mart e-commerce U.S., no doubt saw potential in the trendy online fashion retailer that caters to women largely between the ages of 18-35. Like the company’s recent acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, the customer base is largely urban and perhaps a little more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart core customer. The ModCloth customer base likely aligns pretty well with Jet.com. ModCloth is largely an online fashion retailer with its own exclusive designs covering many occasions from weddings to swimsuits. The one physical store ModCloth runs is located in Austin, Texas. There Jariwala said customers can schedule 1:1 styling appointments with ModStylists. The apparel retailer offers thousands of clothing and accessories, including independent designers as well as national brands and private label garments in a full range of sizes promoting diversity and positive body images that has garnered the company a large following on social media. Jariwala said the ModCloth team will continue to operate its site and store as a standalone and complementary brand to Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sites. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness “The ModCloth team will bring its significant experience and unique talents to our U.S. e-commerce efforts and will further strengthen the collective capabilities of the overall team,” Jariwala said. “Apparel and accessories is the number one category for digital commerce, according to comScore, and we gain the experience of a well-recognized specialty apparel e-commerce brand that’s trusted by millions of millennial women. “The compelling styling, branding and content currently available online, along with deep industry relationships and expertise, will help us further enhance our overall customer experience,” he added. Retail insider Carol Spieckerman said ModCloth is a unique acquisition for Wal-Mart on a couple of fronts. Spieckerman is the CEO of Bentonville-based Spieckerman Retail. “First off, it positions itself as a community, not just as a place to shop, and all of the styles are unique to Modcloth,” she told Talk Business & Politics. “In other words, ModCloth, unlike Moosejaw and ShoeBuy, isn’t a purveyor of national brands — it is the brand. ModCloth is a true niche play that allows Walmart to continue with its fairly conservative and volume-oriented apparel strategy in its stores, while reaching digital [and on a limited basis, physical] tentacles into other waters.” She said the ModCloth model removes the need to assess “fit” because Wal-Mart is not overtaking ModCloth or attempting to integrate it into its stores, though that could be a possibility in the future. “For the short term, I wouldn’t be surprised to find ModCloth items on Jet.com and eventually on Walmart.com,” she said. “I don’t expect physical scale [building lots of ModCloth stores] to be high on the agenda for now. Through its growing portfolio of digital-forward properties, Wal-Mart is building digital scale and increasing its search relevance in more categories and with more brands. Walmart knows better than to attempt to ‘Walmart-ize’ these new properties. The value lies in their distinction.” Comments comments Previous post 3D Systems unveils Figure 4 additive manufacturing platform Next post Governor signs bill giving King own holiday, praised floor speech of Fort Smith legislator Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Eva Madison Laws that apply to liability lawsuits are changing Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, the politics of color, and celebrating creativity Gov.

Since then, Wal-Mart has acquired three small web retailers to add urban and millennial shoppers. The venture, called Store No. 8, will work with startups that specialize in areas that include robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Lore said at Shoptalk, a retail conference in New York. It will be based in California's Silicon Valley, he added. Wal-Mart will keep the startups separate from the broader organization so that they will not affect the retailer's bottom line in the near term, Seth Beal, senior vice-president, incubation and strategic partnerships, said in an interview. He declined to give a time frame for the launch. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

(The new initiative is named after an early Walmart store that company founder Sam Walton used to try out new retail strategies.)   The new venture is being spearheaded by Marc Lore, Wal-Mart's e-commerce head, who joined the retailer after it acquired his company, Jet.com, last August. Speaking at the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas, Lore said Store No. 8 will work with startups that specialize in areas that include robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence.    Store No. 8 will headed up by Seth Beal, previously senior VP for global marketplace and digital store operations at Walmart and Jet's Katie Finnegan. It will be charged with identifying emerging technologies that could prove useful, and also help create new start-ups, according to The New York Times. It will also strike strategic partnerships with other promising young e-commerce companies.   Speaking at Shoptalk, Lore said Wal-Mart has an advantage over pure-play online retailers due to its large network of stores that attract shoppers for such items as fresh food.   "Every day, I become more and more convinced about the omnichannel advantage," Lore said.  Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Sears issues dire warning about its ability to survive The world’s most valuable retail brands are… Confirmed: Walmart acquires another online retailer Walgreens makes executive moves First Look: Target’s next-generation store concept President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Rebecca Minkoff puts virtual mirror into shoppers hands Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

Vallabh Bhanshali Chairman | Enam Securities Earnings key trigger for market; Bank Nifty may rally: Experts Check out: Top chart picks by market experts Here are stock trading ideas from market experts Providing the best possible service to customers at competitive prices is one of the biggest reasons for D-Mart's success, said Vallabh Bhanshali of Enam Securities. Radhakishan Damani is a modest and a very wise person, he does not live in a fantasy world, said Bhanshali. Damani did not have a vision when he launched the D-Mart chain of supermarkets, it was created by accident, he added. Below is the complete transcript of CNBC-TV18's interview with Vallabh Bhanshali Anuj: You have tracked Radhakishan Damani’s journey for many decades now. When he started this company in 2002, did you ever think it would be worth Rs 40,000 crore in a matter of 15 years? Bhanshali: Not the least, for two reasons. One, RK Damani did not start with a big vision. This started almost as an accident. However, more importantly, because RK Damani never talks about the future. He is such a modest person. However, one thing was clear that he was onto something very nice and very big because we had seen his success in the stock market, but to say that could we see Rs 40,000 crore, no way. Sonia: You have known RK Damani for over three to four decades now, what do you think his vision is here on because so far he has achieved a lot of success in the retail space, but what next, are we looking at him creating a Walmart out of a D-Mart or are there some other avenues that he his sight set on? Bhanshali: We must understand RK Damani as a person. He is an incredibly modest person and incredibly wise person which means that he doesn’t think in a fantasy like manner. He tries to understand the basic principles which take life forward, take business forward, etc. and he has tried to adopt that in all aspects of life, his personal life, his children’s life, wherein he was a speculator or a stock market investor, and now in this business. He says keep it simple, try and do your best whether it becomes Walmart, bigger than Walmart or some small mart, it doesn’t matter to him. So, I would not want to talk in that language. However, I think what he has shown is that if you keep it simple which means I deliver the best value for my customer, and I work within my capacity and my circle of competence, India is a country of growth and you can do very well. So, I think these are the three things that this is a tripod on which he works – keep it simple, know your competence, and India is a growth market so you don’t have to do anything funny, just keep working. Given that we don’t know how big this can become. Anuj: The Midas touch and going into areas where you sometimes don’t know anything, even relaunching Sridevi’s movie and even that becoming a big hit, so, it tells a lot about the man. I know you are saying that if you keep it simple in a country like India, you will achieve success, but clearly that vision stands out. Bhanshali: Yes, I have known Radhakishan for now almost 35 years, from the time he came to the market. He was somebody who was not from the stock market, his father was very much a part of the market floor, but he unfortunately died young and Radhakishan took over from him. However, he was an amazing listener, and a very avid learner. People know this is not a myth, it is the truth that he would stand at the corner of Dalal Street for 5-10 hours a day meeting hundreds of people and he learned from everybody, he respected everybody and therefore he has seen the world from ground level up. At the same time he always admired whosoever had succeeded particularly those who had succeeded in the right manner. So he knew all the great stories that were happening and he knew the common man and he has been putting the two together in all that he did. He knew the pulse of the market, he knew the principles by which great people had succeeded, he tried to apply them in his own simple manner and therefore when it came to D-Mart, he said I don’t understand credit, I don’t want to make borrowings and so on and why not deliver a simple product to the customer. One thing that I can share with you, I think one of the questions asked them on the roadshow was that what about special schemes for consumers and how do you incentivise them, and they said we don’t want to confuse the consumer. Every time you give a special scheme, he has to go into thinking and sometimes he is tempted wrongly. So, we don’t want to do that. We simply just give him the best possible price with a smiling face in the most efficient manner. So this is the kind of wisdom that he has developed through his grounds-up approach and once you understand this part, you will understand why people are so excited about D-Mart. Sonia: Today is a phenomenal day for investors as well, I mean 100 percent premium in one trading session or more than 100 percent. You don't get to see that very often, I have hardly seen it and I have heard a lot of stories about how RK Damani has shared his wealth a lot in the past as well, much before D-Mart became a success. I want to understand from you, is there a learning in this for a lot of young entrepreneurs to leave a little more table for shareholders at the time of listing? Bhanshali: I had an occasion to be part of the listing ceremony and I said RK Damani’s life is university; learning from that will be more profitable even than investing in D-Mart. If you know him socially, he is somebody who never speaks loudly. He doesn't want to win every argument. He is happy to stand in a corner and he just showed that how developing an acumen is more important than being supremely intelligent, how having the right information is more important than being extremely well informed, knowing the right people who he can trust is more important than having a large network and trusting people that he works with. If you know him socially, he is somebody who never speaks loudly. He doesn't want to win every argument. He is happy to stand in a corner and he just showed that how developing an acumen is more important than being supremely intelligent, how having the right information is more important than being extremely well informed, knowing the right people who he can trust is more important than having a large network and trusting people that he works with. So he has trusted Neville Noronha and his team ardently, given them few principles and he let them function. He is such a low profile, I think the atmosphere in the company is one of an IT start-up. We fail to understand, fail to believe that how goodness, listening, and modesty along with business acumen of course can create wonder. So, I think it is an extraordinary learning, not only for youngsters, but for all those who care to learn. I am one of them, I am a great admirer of the man more than his company. Anuj: Of course today is not the day to talk about whether the stock is expensive or not, but let us talk about this business because the fact is that the brick and mortar model is struggling a bit in the face of the kind of online models which are there right now. What next because if this company has to scale up from here - the existing model, while it is working also needs scaling up, do you think that will happen as you move forward? Bhanshali: What prevents RK Damani from developing a proper platform for e-commerce too? At the end of the day if you understand the proposition that you must deliver the best goods at best prices, he doesn't have to do himself. I am sure that number of professional teams will want to come and work with him, so, he is open to it. I am not saying that he will do it or that there is a plan to do it, but I simply think that there are so many companies that have survived for decades, not based on the original business plan. They have the ability to learn and evolve, I think the same opportunity lies with RK Damani and D-Mart and I am sure they would be looking at it.

They have the ability to learn and evolve, I think the same opportunity lies with RK Damani and D-Mart and I am sure they would be looking at it. Sonia: Everything is electronic now. No one goes to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) anymore. So, this was the first day after many years that we saw all the market veterans come together in the Bombay Stock Exchange. So pretty historic day for all of us. If you had to tell us one fond memory that you have of the times when you guys used to trade in the ring together with RK Damani, what would that one memory be? Bhanshali: I was not someone who went to the ring much, but in the 2007-2008 period, that is not dream-period. I am sorry, I am not able to think of an event which was linked to the ring with RK Damani, but of course, I have seen crisis in the ring many times, when we saw the markets crash and rise, etc. However, with RK Damani, I am sorry, I do not have a memory. Sonia: I know you are one of the few people who know RK Damani closely, not just as an investor, but as a human being as well. Tell us, as an investor your first take on the man and more importantly, the learnings you have had from him over the last many years. Jayakumar: As an investor, it is very clear to those who know him, and for those who do not, it is absolutely wonderful to see somebody with the kind of uncanny trading skills hand-in-hand with a long-term value investment outlook. I have not seen this kind of combination of a trader, value investor almost in anyone else. Anuj: Also, tell us a bit about RK Damani as a human being. Jayakumar: He is one of the finest listeners I have ever met in my life. He is seen frequently talking to everyone from whether it is a kirana store, a pan-wala and he listens, he speaks so little as it were. More than anything else, the attention to detail and to my mind, at least the biggest takeaway, the humility and grace with which he handles success. I think management institutes only theorise about these things, but to my mind, he is the finest example of a walking, non-talking case study on human attributes and the ability to handle success. Sonia: Tell us a little bit about what you learned from his three to four decade old journey into several businesses which turned into a success?Jayakumar: The important thing here, the big takeaway is that, I think Sunil Gavaskar once said it about retirement, he said you need to leave at the peak of your career which is when people say why, rather than why not. So, the question here is when he decides to do something, the first question is why rather than why not. To my mind, the unexpectedness, hand-in-hand of course with the ability to get detail oriented and everything else that goes in running a business -- many of us, for instance would be keenly observing as to if there is a fourth innings, a fourth venture that he would brave the waters for.

When they came across a Walmart, Fields and one of his friends decided to do something highly unusual by taking their horses into the store.  'We were just riding and a buddy of mines was, like, "Let's go to Walmart," and I was, like, "Man, I'm not going to Walmart." He was, like, "Come on, let's go!"' Fields recalled to Click 2 Houston.  Woody Fields (front) and one of his friends (not the one pictured in the back of the picture) rode their horses through a Walmart in Houston, Texas on Sunday. Above, another picture from that day  Fields recorded the unusual ride on his phone and posted the video to Facebook  The video has since been viewed more than 1.5million times. The ride only lasted a few minutes  At the end of the video, Fields is seen joining one of his other friends outside, left, while they wait for the other rider to exit the store, right  The rider that stayed outside then congratulates the other two on their wild ride  Fields filmed the quick two-minute trip on his phone, showing mystified shoppers staring at the horses in befuddlement, much to delight of the children in the store.  Their horses seemed completely at ease in the store environment, walking calmly through the aisles and past the crowds of humans doing their weekly shop.  Fields told KHOU that he was initially concerned that the wax floors might pose a challenge for his horse to walk on.  But they were apparently so comfortable that one of the horses even defecated inside the store.    Fields and his two riding buddies are pictured above posing outside the Galleria Mall on the horses on Sunday  Fields says he and his friends ride their horses every weekend, and wanted to change things up this time by riding in an urban setting  The threesome brought a smile to almost everyone they pasted in their photos and videos posted to Facebook  'I was just trying to make people smile and laugh,' Fields said RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Can YOU match the faces to the sculptures? Facial... From fairytale tree tunnels to woodlands perched over... Share this article Share The two men were in the store for only a few minutes, so security barely had time to confront them. Fields came out of the store first, but he says that his friend got a talking to before he exited on horseback. He says they apologized to the store and won't be coming back unless on foot.   'I was just trying to make people smile and laugh,' Fields said. After hearing about the incident, Walmart issued a statement condemning the ride. The three men were also pictured cooling down with beers with their horses  'We in no way condone yesterday's reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions,' the company said.  However, the company is reportedly not seeking legal action against the group.   The Houston Humane Society was also not impressed.  'At minimum, riding a horse inside a store is incredibly irresponsible. This would be extremely stressful on any horse. Horses can easily become spooked, endangering not only themselves, but also any shoppers they might encounter. 'The Houston Humane Society urges all pet owners to think and act responsibly when it comes to the lives of animals in their care,' the organization said in a statement.   Read more: Video of 2 men riding horses in Houston Walmart goes viral Men ride horses through Walmart in Houston | khou.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 205 shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

Elizabeth Thomas has not been seen since March 13 when she is feared to have been taken by Tad Cummins, her married former teacher. An Amber Alert has been issued in her home state of Tennessee and in neighboring Alabama but police say the pair could be 'anywhere'. On Tuesday, the girl's family told how she warned them to call police if she did not return home by 6pm on the day she vanished. Authorities however say it is 'entirely likely' she does not yet consider herself a victim and chose to go with him willingly. Newly released surveillance footage shows Cummins, who police say is armed with two handguns, buying women's hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart a day before they disappeared. It also emerged on Tuesday that Cummins, who describes himself online as a 'Jesus freak, grandfather and father', was under police investigation after being seen kissing the girl when he disappeared with her.  Another student claimed to have seen the pair kissing in Cummins' classroom at Culleoka High School in Columbia, Tennessee, on January 23 while his grandson, who is also a student there, used the computer. She reported it to police and to the school board but Cummins was allowed to carry on work and was not arrested.  Scroll down for video  Elizabeth Thomas, 15, left, has been missing from Columbia, Tennessee, with her former science teacher Tad Cummins, 50, right, since March 13  Elizabeth changed her Instagram biography before she vanished to describe herself as a 'wife'. She also added a ring emoji to the description  The student claimed she confronted the teacher before reporting it to her own family and he told her they had a 'father daughter relationship'.  Elizabeth's own family did not learn about it until a week later when Maury County Sheriff's Department officers visited their home to make inquiries.   This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished. She appears to be carrying clothes School board staff interviewed the girl several times and police began investigating her claims but Cummins was allowed to carry on teaching. They removed Elizabeth from his class but they were caught again together on February 3 by the school principal. The school eventually suspended Cummins on February 6 after receiving an outraged letter from her father demanding to be kept in updated about the investigation.   Cummins was not officially fired by the school district until he disappeared with the girl on March 13. Students said Elizabeth was angry with the other girl for reporting their classroom kiss and 'growled' at her in the hallway.  She believed the pair were friends, they said, but authorities believe Cummins was grooming her for sex.   In the days before her disappearance, Elizabeth posted several cryptic Instagram photographs about love. Among them was an illustration of Beauty and The Beast. 'Every beauty needs her beast to protect her from everything but him,' it read.  Cummins visited a Walmart in Columbia, Tennessee, the day before he vanished with the girl. He was filmed on surveillance cameras buying dark brown women's hair dye  Cummins was dressed in a camouflage hat, a dark blue t-shirt and matching jacket  The dark brow hair dye teacher Tad Cummins was seen buying (right) and Elizabeth in a family photograph (left)  She captioned the post 'Good Morning'. She changed her biography to 'wife' and added a ring emoji to it. On March 12, the day before they vanished, Cummins was spotted buying women's dark brown hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart. He also appeared to have bought men's toiletries.

Share this article Share Days earlier, he took out a $4,500 loan and was also seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day of their disappearance. It's entirely likely Elizabeth doesn't believe - at least right now - that she's a victim  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine  On March 13, Elizabeth told her family she was spending the day with a friend. She told one of her ten siblings to call police if she had not returned by 6pm, according to People.  Police believe Cummins, who she has known for more than two years, brainwashed her into abandoning her family. They have not confirmed whether she went willingly with him on March 13. 'It's entirely likely Elizabeth doesn’t believe – at least right now – that she’s a victim,' Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine told DailyMail.com on Tuesday. In the days before her disappearance, she referred to a 'mission' on social media while sharing quotes about love. Police issued the last photograph of her before her disappearance on Monday. In it, she appeared carrying a pile of clothes in her arms.  Elizabeth posted this image on Instagram in the days before she disappeared, writing simply beside it: 'Good morning'  Elizabeth referred to a 'mission' before disappearing on March 13. Police believe she was groomed by Cummins who she has known for more than two years  The pair were seen kissing at Culleoka High School by another student on January 23. Staff notified police but did not immediately tell her family or suspend Cullins  Tennessee investigators say Elizabeth is in imminent danger. They believe Cummins is armed with two handguns She was dressed in a plaid shirt and dark leggings with her blonde hair scraped back in to a ponytail.  The bureau did not specify where the image was taken but investigators previously stated that Elizabeth had been dropped off at a restaurant by a friend in Colombia, Tennessee, before she was taken.  'Nothing investigators have learned about Cummins or his intentions for the young girl since issuing the AMBER Alert calms the imminent concern for Elizabeth’s well-being.  'In fact, it only heightens it,' a statement issued by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation on Saturday read. Josh DeVine, the bureau's spokesman, said he was eager for the public to grasp how dangerous the situation is.  'She's 15. He is 50. He is facing a charge in which the district attorney has identified her as the victim and they are missing.  'We want her home, we want him in custody, he said last week at a press conference.   Cummins now faces charges for sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Each of the pair's families has issued desperate pleas for them to return.  Cummins' wife Jill appealed directly to him, telling him: 'Tad this is not you. This is not who you are. We can help you get through this. Cummins' embattled wife Jill made an emotional plea for his return last week, telling him: 'Tad, this is not you.' Elizabeth's father Anthony (right) said the teacher 'stole' his daughter from him  Cummins was seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day the pair disappeared There is a $1,000 reward for information which may lead police to the pair. Tennessee investigators have received 450 tips but do not yet have a strong lead  'No matter how far you've gone or what's happening right now, God's grace is sufficient for you and he wants you to come home. Your family wants their poppy back.

Woody Fields posted a video to Facebook recorded from atop his horse as he rode through the Walmart on Bissonnet in Houston Sunday evening. The ride elicits many amazed looks from customers, especially young ones enamored of the horse. Security personnel are seen in the video, but take no action to stop the man or his horse. Fields, who was joined inside the store by another man on a horse, told KTRK-TV he and the other man were going "parking lot pimping" when they decided on a whim to go inside the store. Fields said the other man also had his horse inside the store for a time and one of the equines relieved itself inside the store. "I was just trying to make people smile and laugh," Fields told KPRC-TV. "I wasn't trying to hurt nobody, or do anything destructive. It was just, like, you only live once, you know? That's all," Fields said. Walmart released a statement critical of Fields' actions. "We in no way condone yesterday's reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions," the company said in a statement. The Houston Humane Society also released a statement about the incident. "At minimum, riding a horse inside a store is incredibly irresponsible. This would be extremely stressful on any horse. Horses can easily become spooked, endangering not only themselves, but also any shoppers they might encounter," the Humane Society said. "The Houston Humane Society urges all pet owners to think and act responsibly when it comes to the lives of animals in their care."

By Mary-Ann Russon March 21, 2017 13:06 GMT Walmart has filed a patent for drones that would help deliver products from the stock room to help shop assistantsReuters US retail giant Walmart is looking to deploy drones in its stores to speed up customer service by getting the drone to search and locate items from the warehouse. Walmart has filed a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office describing an airborne unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can be dispatched to retrieve a product from a non-public stock room, and then fly the item out of the stock room doors or a window and over to a delivery area where staff can retrieve the item. The idea is that instead of having to trek across the warehouse floor to grab products from endless rows of shelves, the drone can do it instead. To keep customers and employees safe, the drone sticks to the stock room and to areas that are not on the public shop floor, and shop managers and assistants just have to retrieve the item from the delivery area once the UAV has deposited the item and left, or has landed and is stationery. The drone system will rely on a control circuit with sensors embedded in the areas so that a central computer system always knows where the drone is and sends the UAVs pre-set flight paths as well as detect obstacles that might be in the drone's path. Drones would be good for restocking products "So configured, an airborne drone can be readily utilised to move items, such as products being offered for retail sale, from one place in a retail shopping facility to another place in that same facility. A considerable number of such airborne drones can be simultaneously fielded and utilised to facilitate moving a considerable number of items simultaneously," Walmart writes in the patent. "Accordingly, these teachings can greatly improve the customer experience without overburdening the human associates of the facility." Walmart has long had an interest in using UAVs – in June 2016 the retail giant demonstrated to journalists how drones could be used to photograph inventory and then send data about stock shortages over the air immediately to computers at the distribution centre. This would help to speed up delivery of items to the shop floor and help Walmart to compete effectively with online shopping services like Amazon. The retail giant is also keen to invest in emerging technologies that don't yet have a key use case. To that end, on Monday 20 March it announced the launch of a tech incubator called Store No 8 in Silicon Valley. Store No 8's job will be to grow startups that run independently from Walmart and collaborate with venture capitalists and academics to develop proprietary artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality and augmented reality technologies with practical applications.

Lauren Rohr | Staff Photographer Plote Property Management LLC has proposed repurposing the former Wal-Mart building in East Dundee and constructing two new structures on the existing parking lot to be used by industrial and commercial tenants. Courtesy of the village of East Dundee East Dundee is considering rezoning the 620 Dundee Ave. property to allow for the operation of multi-tenant commercial and industrial buildings. Courtesy of the village of East Dundee Plote Property Management LLC has proposed repurposing the former Wal-Mart building in East Dundee into a structure to be used by multiple commercial and industrial tenants. Courtesy of the village of East Dundee   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     A redevelopment project in East Dundee that would turn a shuttered Wal-Mart property into an industrial business park is moving forward after trustees gave a thumbs-up to a developer's rezoning request. Plote Property Management LLC plans to repurpose and expand the vacant 115,000-square-foot structure at 620 Dundee Ave. to create a multi-tenant commercial and industrial building, according to the company's proposal. The East Dundee Commerce Park project would also include constructing two new 28,000-square-foot buildings on the existing parking lot. "This will increase the tax base, create over 200 new jobs and will create an economic spillover where new employees and business owners will be buying and doing business within the village," said Ryan Trottier, Plote's vice president of land development. The property, which has been vacant since Wal-Mart moved to a new store in Carpentersville last June, was zoned as a service business district. The village board voted 4-1 Monday to change the property's zoning to a limited manufacturing district, giving Plote the green light to move forward. Plote is not seeking any financial incentives from the village on the project, which is expected to cost between $12 million and $15 million, said company President David Plote. The company plans to purchase the property, he said, though the sale has not yet closed. Trustee Jeff Lynam, who voted against the measure, said he believes more effort should be put into attracting big-box retailers to the site to replace Wal-Mart, which generated more than $800,000 in annual sales tax revenue for the village. "I'm not against the idea of a project like this, but I would like to see us explore more opportunities to bring back the type of retail we had," he said. But Plote representatives, who have been working with outside firms to determine the site's best use, said it isn't garnering long-term interest from such companies, and the location would no longer serve as a viable retail destination. There is, however, a demand for the light industrial use that would be the focus of the new mixed-use development, David Plote said. The company has recently had to turn away businesses interested in its nearby Rock Road Industrial Park, which is 97 percent full. Many of the tenants at the East Dundee Commerce Park may have a retail component that will generate sales tax, he said, noting retailers and other types of businesses would also be welcome. "This is some different space where we'd be able to be more flexible," Plote said. "It makes sense all the way around. The market has changed. It's a different world now." The company will fine-tune development plans and start seeking tenants right away so it can begin retrofitting the Wal-Mart building, which will also get an exterior facelift, Plote representative Kurt Kresmery said. The project's proposed 30,000-square-foot addition to the Wal-Mart structure and construction of the other two buildings will be phased in based on market demand. "This is an opportunity to fill this space," Trustee Dan Selep said. "If we don't do this, I could see other nearby businesses closing down or leaving. I'm all for this."

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Walmart is bringing a tech incubator to Silicon Valley Phil Wahba, Fortune March 21, 2017 3:19 AM Tags: Fortune, Wal-Mart, Walmart Above: A Walmart retail store. Image Credit: Walmart Walmart wants to drastically speed up its development of retail tech. To do that, the discount retailer announced on Monday it was launching Store No 8, an innovation cluster whose entrepreneurs will be free from the diktats of its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters and Wall Street’s short attention span, to develop the retail tech Walmart needs in order to modernize over the next five to ten years. And, more crucially, the tech is aimed at helping it fight back against rivals like Amazon.com. Store No 8 will be located in Silicon Valley and will house startups wholly owned by Walmart but run independently. It’s the latest manifestation of the new, dynamic culture Walmart is looking to instill into its e-commerce strategy under the leadership of Marc Lore, whose Jet.com online store Walmart bought last year for $3 billion. “There’s not a focus just on today, they can actually think bigger,” Lore said at the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas. “It’s ring-fenced from the organization so they can just run fast.” Walmart has been on something of a hot e-commerce streak lately: the expansion of its marketplaces has re-ignited online growth — digital sales rose almost 30% during the holidays. And in the last two months alone, Walmart has bought three online retailers — ModCloth, ShoeBuy and Moosejaw — to diversify its online offering. But Walmart is also trying to get ahead of whether retail and e-commerce are going. CEO Doug McMillon is hoping to harness Jet.com’s ethos to help its gigantic parent company renew itself and said he intends not to “hug Jet.com too tightly” and let it be a startup, as he put it at an investor conference last week. Indeed, the raison d’être of Store No 8 will be to incubate, invest in, and work with other startups, venture capitalists and academics to develop its own proprietary robotics, virtual & augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. As Walmart puts it, these startups will be sheltered from Walmart itself so they can grow and try things out without the pressure of being part of the world’s largest retailer. Target is also looking to instill a startup culture for the next generation of retail tech. The Minneapolis-based company has partnered with Techstars, an incubator. At the same time, in a sign that sometimes retailers need a quicker payoff from the tech they invest in, Target last month abruptly scrapped its “Store of the Future” — a prototype for a small-format Target store it was building featuring robots, because, as Target CEO Brian Cornell explained at Shoptalk, he wanted to make sure” all of our innovation dollars are providing benefits in the near term.” Target is trying to shake a losing streak of sales declines in the last three quarters. Store No 8 harkens back to a store opened up by Wal-Mart Stores founder, the late Sam Walton, as an experimental store to let bolder retail ideas get a try. “Sometimes you invest in these big transformative ideas that maybe aren’t ready for prime time today,” said Seth Beal, a four-year Walmart executive leading the Store No 8 initiative with Katie Finnegan, a head of strategy at Jet.com. “How do we make a safe place for entrepreneurs to go innovate around these ideas?” Beal added. But Finnegan said she and Beal, along with Walmart executives occasionally, would regularly check in with them to make sure they don’t geek out too much and invent things with practical applications rather than pie-in-the-sky.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 21 March 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Wal-Mart unveils ‘Store No. 8’ tech incubator in Silicon Valley Future-proofing: The incubator will partner with startups, venture capitalists and academics to promote innovation in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to Wal-Mart. — Reuters Wal-Mart Stores Inc is creating a technology-startup incubator in Silicon Valley to identify changes that will reshape the retail experience, including virtual reality, autonomous vehicle and drone delivery and personalised shopping.  The incubator will be called Store No. 8, a reference to a Wal-Mart location where the company experimented with new store layouts. Marc Lore, chief executive officer of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations, announced the incubator Monday at the ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas.  The world’s biggest retailer has been overhauling its online team to better challenge Amazon.com Inc with greater selection and lower prices. Lore founded Jet.com, which Wal-Mart purchased in September for about US$3.3bil (RM14.61bil) in pursuit of Amazon in the e-commerce race. Lore said Wal-Mart has an advantage over “pure play” e-commerce companies because of its large network of stores that attract shoppers for such items as fresh food.  ”Every day, I become more and more convinced about the omnichannel advantage,” Lore said, referring to a sales strategy that combines online and in-store shopping.  Store No. 8 is the latest example of Lore’s influence on Wal-Mart. In January, Lore announced management changes and a new incubation and strategic-partnerships division, to be led by Seth Beal. Lore gave more details about the division, including its name and areas of focus, at the conference on Monday.  The incubator will partner with startups, venture capitalists and academics to promote innovation in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to Wal-Mart. The goal is to have a fast-moving, separate entity to identify emerging technologies that can be developed and used across Wal-Mart. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

In a bid to catch up with Amazon, the world's largest retailer will continue seeking out brands that bring new, unique products to its assortment, Marc Lore, president and CEO of Wal-Mart eCommerce U.S., said Monday. Through these types of purchases, Wal-Mart is able to scale specialty categories more rapidly, as the companies already have relationships with key vendors. What's more, their management teams have established expertise in their specific categories, when it comes to things like writing product reviews, Lore said. The executive made his comments while speaking at the Code Commerce event in Las Vegas. "We're being pretty active," the founder of Jet.com said. "We're behind." Since Wal-Mart acquired Jet last year, it's purchased three companies that specialize in specific product categories. It started with Shoebuy in December, followed by Moosejaw, an outdoor apparel retailer, in February. Most recently, Wal-Mart acquired the ModCloth women's apparel label. "There's definitely been a nice surge in the categories that we've been acquiring and so we will continue to do it," Lore said. Indeed, Wal-Mart is seeing momentum in its digital sales, which grew 29 percent during the holiday quarter. Still, the world's largest retailer has a way to go before it catches Amazon — if it ever happens. According to the receipt-mining company Slice Intelligence, Amazon accounted for 53 percent of U.S. e-commerce growth in 2016. "Win means win," Lore said. "It's not going to happen in 12 months, but win means win." Krystina GustafsonEditor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT ---

Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, is in preliminary merger talks with Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. (REED SAXON / Associated Press) Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Every grocery chain seeking to thrive in the modern world must provide organic kale alongside the Hot Pockets and Fritos. That point was driven home by merger talks in recent weeks between Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. The preliminary discussions may not lead to a deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For Albertsons, which may be beefing up ahead of an initial public offering, taking Sprouts private and adding it to the portfolio would mean a deeper push into foods that appeal to a growing segment of shoppers. Longtime staples like cereal and canned soup have struggled as health-conscious consumers pursue less-processed options. That’s pushed organics into the mainstream, with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger expanding into a market long dominated by Whole Foods Market Inc. and other niche stores. Albertsons seems ready to jump deeper into the lettuce patch. “They’re looking to add some sex appeal,” said Roger Davidson, an industry consultant. “A lot of their stores tend to be boring, standard supermarkets. If they don’t do something, they’re going to continue to struggle.” Fresh produce is a draw to brick-and-mortar stores, even as online ordering has devoured swathes of the retail landscape. With Amazon intent on pushing into the business, despite its struggles with delivering fresh food, grocers are increasingly focused on the quality of fruits and vegetables. An Albertsons takeover of Sprouts could help persuade investors that there’s demand for shares of a giant U.S. grocery chain this year, Davidson said. The company, backed by Cerberus Capital Management, operates about 2,300 U.S. stores, including the Shaw’s, Safeway and Acme chains. The company almost went public in 2015 before pulling the IPO because of turbulence in the stock market. The offering has been on hold almost 18 months. Cerberus, which manages more than $30 billion in private equity holdings, distressed debt, credit assets and real estate, first invested in Albertsons in 2006 and then bought stores in 2013 from Supervalu. Albertsons more than doubled in size in 2014 when it acquired Safeway Inc. in a deal valued at about $9.2 billion. The company has a presence on the East Coast, but its stores are mainly west of the Mississippi River. Sprouts has more than half of its outlets in California and Texas, two of the most competitive U.S. markets. Sprouts is “one of the few high-quality growth platforms remaining in grocery and a concept we believe will continue to take market share,” Chris Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note. Winnie Lerner, a spokeswoman for Albertsons, declined to comment. With the IPO in limbo, Albertsons has struggled to find growth. Food deflation has battered the industry over the past year, weighing down sales and prompting price wars that have eroded profit margins. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, in the fourth quarter posted negative same-store sales for the first time in more than a decade. Its shares have plunged 15 percent this year. Albertsons faces pressure from both ends. It needs organics to appeal to more affluent customers concerned with health. But its current stores aren’t quite cheap enough to draw low-end customers who shop at dollar-store chains or Wal-Mart. The price war has gotten even more intense with the German chain Aldi expanding rapidly in the U.S., not to mention the planned arrival of European competitor Lidl this year. Organic food isn’t a panacea. Whole Foods has struggled because of the perception that it’s overpriced. Same-store sales have dropped for six straight quarters, pulled down by conventional retailers encroaching on its turf with lower prices. Sprouts has taken a hit from food deflation as well, but posted a 2.7 percent same-store sales gain in 2016. And while Albertsons has experimented with smaller outlets heavy on produce, Sprouts would provide a strong foothold in a fast-growing market, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Willard Bishop, a consumer research firm in Chicago. “They’re looking for growth, and they don’t see it as much with the traditional supermarket,” he said. “The growth is happening with peripheral formats – that’s where the consumer is.” Published: March 21, 2017, 6:05 p.m.  Tags: albertsons, grocery stores, sprouts, supermarkets Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. The projected upper bound is: 71.87. The projected lower bound is: 68.00. The projected closing price is: 69.93. Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 5 white candles and 5 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 25 white candles and 25 black candles. Three black candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three black crows, the steady downward pattern is bearish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 16.1291. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a buy 7 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 50.42. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 16 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -52. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 16 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 12 period(s) ago. Rex Takasugi – TD Profile WAL-MART STORES closed down -0.080 at 69.900.

Summary WAL-MART STORES is currently 1.2% below its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is extremely low when compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. There is a good possibility that there will be an increase in volatility along with sharp price fluctuations in the near future. Our volume indicators reflect moderate flows of volume out of WMT.N (mildly bearish). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bullish on WMT.N and have had this outlook for the last 26 periods.   news, NYSE, NYSE:WMT, outlook, shayne heffernan, trading, Wal-Mart Stores Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) Long Term Bearish Outlook added by HEFFX Australia on March 21, 2017 View all posts by HEFFX Australia → The following two tabs change content below.

Dodge H. Teague Jr., 88, 210 Fish Springs Road, Hampton, was struck by a 2008 Kia Sorrento driven by a 46-year-old woman, whose name was not released. Officer Samantha Maney of the Elizabethton Police Department said she responded to the scene and saw Teague lying on the ground, suffering from a leg injury and cuts to his face and arm. Maney spoke with the driver, who told her she was pulling into a parking space on the right side of row 5 when she heard someone yell “stop” and looked to her left. She stopped and was then told to back up. When the driver got out of her car to see what happened, she said she saw a man lying on the ground in front of her vehicle. The store security camera recorded the accident. Sgt. Curtis Bullock viewed the video and reported that it showed Teague loading groceries into his vehicle. He then walked across the row to return the grocery cart to the collection rack. Bullock said Teague then returned to his car and his body was bent forward, as if he was walking into the wind.  Bullock said Teague was walking into the row just as the Kia was pulling into the parking spot. Bullock said Teague never looked up or stopped walking. He also said the brakes were not applied on the Kia. No charges have been placed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 March 2017 by Military News Wal-Mart Launches New Venture to Boost e-Commerce Business Shutterstock photo Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc . WMT is planning to create a technology-startup incubator in California’s Silicon Valley in order to boost the e-commerce business and enhance online shopping experience. The venture, called Store No. 8, will function separately from the broader organization. This will help the company’s acquired e-commerce businesses to grow and flourish and not hurt the bottom line in the near term. These initiatives are expected to reshape the retail experience, including virtual reality, autonomous vehicle and drone delivery and personalized shopping. This set up which will be built in partnership with retail start-ups, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs will remain focused on the development of e-commerce businesses. Marc Lore, Wal-Mart’s e-commerce chief, would head the plan. We note that Lore joined the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company from Jet.com which was acquired by Wal-Mart in August for more than $3 billion. Since then Wal-Mart has acquired three small web retailers with the most recent being the buyout of trendy online clothing seller ModCloth. Although the details of the deal have not been disclosed yet officially, media reports claimed that the buyout was worth $51-$70 million. Post-acquisition, ModCloth will continue to operate its own website as a standalone and complementary brand. Prior to ModCloth, Wal-Mart bought Moosejaw, an outdoor apparel and gear retailer for $51 million and e-commerce shoe retailer ShoeBuy for $70 million in 2017. This move was aimed at raising the company’s stake in the online business. It is encouraging that the retail giant is trying every means to compete with e-commerce king Amazon.com Inc. AMZN . In this regard, the company continues to make huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. Meanwhile, the company’s increased investment in Walmex hints at its efforts to hold substantial market share in Mexico where Amazon is expanding. Bentonville, AR-based Wal-Mart is also aggressively foraying into e-commerce in China with an aim to deliver goods from its stores around the world to consumers within hours. Wal-Mart has also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay in all of its 4,500-plus U.S. stores in Jul 2016. This system enables shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app. This marks another step toward accelerating the company’s online business and making shopping easier and faster. Wal-Mart is also aggressively trying to get a share of the pie in the online grocery shopping and delivery industry. Recently in Jan 2017, the company started offering free two-day shipping to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 on over 2 million items. This program will replace Wal-Mart’s existing two-day shipping program – Shipping Pass – that charges shoppers an annual membership fee of $49. It is interesting to note that unlike Amazon Prime (which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping) or Wal-Mart’s existing Shipping Pass program, shoppers does not need to pay any membership fee to avail the service. Wal-Mart also expects to expand its online grocery pickup – Walmart Grocery – from the current 600 to roughly 1,200 stores in fiscal 2018. Further, its valuations are compelling. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Wal-Mart carries a VGM score of ‚A,’ and a Value and Growth score of ‚A.’ This indicates that there is substantial potential in the stock. Though the company still faces many headwinds which are likely to impact earnings in the near term, Wal-Mart’s efforts to boost sales and regain investors’ confidence remain impressive. Share Price Movement We note that in the past one year, Wal-Mart’sstock gained 3.1%, in comparison to the Zacks categorized Retail-Supermarkets industry’s dip of 0.6%. Further, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the past six consecutive quarters. Key Picks Better-ranked stocks in the retail sector include The Children’s Place, Inc. PLCE and Kate Spade & Company KATE . Both Children’s Place and Kate Spade sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . While Children’s Place has an expected long-term earnings growth of 10.3%, Kate Spade has an expected earnings growth of 28.3% for the next three to five years. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here’s another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It’s not the one you think.

And it has now been revealed Cummins did a number of online searches for the topic of teen marriage on March 5.  Scroll down for video  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has released this picture, taken in January, showing Elizabeth Thomas at school with her former teacher and the man who allegedly abducted her, Tad Cummins Elizabeth Thomas, 15, left, has been missing from Columbia, Tennessee, with her former science teacher Tad Cummins, 50, right, since March 13  The 50-year-old also researched whether his car could be tracked by law enforcement, News Channel 5 reports.  The disturbing new information was announced after a shocking picture taken of the teenager at school with Cummins was published. The photograph, released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, shows Thomas sat at a desk with the teacher, her elbow resting on the table as she listens to him talk.  The TBI said it was taken in January - just days before Cummins allegedly had sexual contact with Thomas on school property.  The agency said it is still hopeful of: 'reuniting the young girl with her family, friends, and community.' The picture was released hours after the 15-year-old's family said she she warned them to call police if she did not return home by 6pm on the day she vanished.  Authorities however say it is 'entirely likely' she does not yet consider herself a victim and chose to go with him willingly. Speaking after the picture was published, Thomas' father, Anthony, told People Magazine Cummins preyed on his daughter. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Police hunting for armed 50-year-old teacher accused of... Mystery as teenage girl is found dead in woodland two days... Share this article Share Elizabeth changed her Instagram biography before she vanished to describe herself as a 'wife'. She also added a ring emoji to the description  'He built up a system where she was dependent on him,' he told the magazine, before explaining how Cummins: '[gave] her money, bought a microwave so she would heat food up in his room [and] try and get her out of trouble.'  'She had always had a lot of confidence about herself, and suddenly this year she had been very outwardly saying that she thought she was ugly. 'It must have been Tad was the only one who was making her feel good.' This image of Elizabeth was taken on March 13, the day she vanished. She appears to be carrying clothes He then added: 'Please come home. Get away from that man and come home. Everybody here loves you. That man is just using you.'  A friend of Thomas' also pleaded with the teen to ditch Cummins and go home to safety. 'I know that you may love him and think he's perfect, but he's not,' 15-year-old Ashlee Riggins told News Channel 5. 'I love you, and there's so many people here who need you and want you back. 'She always stood by my side and I love her with all my heart, she may not know that right now... but hopefully she'll know.'  Newly released surveillance footage shows Cummins, who police say is armed with two handguns, buying women's hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart a day before they disappeared. It also emerged on Tuesday that Cummins, who describes himself online as a 'Jesus freak, grandfather and father', was under police investigation after being seen kissing the girl when he disappeared with her.  Another student claimed to have seen the pair kissing in Cummins' classroom at Culleoka High School in Columbia, Tennessee, on January 23 while his grandson, who is also a student there, used the computer. The student reported it to police and to the school board but Cummins was allowed to carry on work and was not arrested.  Cummins visited a Walmart in Columbia, Tennessee, the day before he vanished with the girl. He was filmed on surveillance cameras buying dark brown women's hair dye  The student claimed she confronted the teacher before reporting it to her own family and he told her they had a 'father daughter relationship'.  Elizabeth's own family did not learn about it until a week later when Maury County Sheriff's Department officers visited their home to make inquiries.   School board staff interviewed the girl several times and police began investigating her claims but Cummins was allowed to carry on teaching. They removed Elizabeth from his class but they were caught again together on February 3 by the school principal. The school eventually suspended Cummins on February 6 after receiving an outraged letter from her father demanding to be kept in updated about the investigation.   Cummins was dressed in a camouflage hat, a dark blue t-shirt and matching jacket  The dark brow hair dye teacher Tad Cummins was seen buying (right) and Elizabeth in a family photograph (left)  Cummins was not officially fired by the school district until he disappeared with the girl on March 13. Students said Elizabeth was angry with the other girl for reporting their classroom kiss and 'growled' at her in the hallway.  She believed the pair were friends, they said, but authorities believe Cummins was grooming her for sex.   It's entirely likely Elizabeth doesn't believe - at least right now - that she's a victim  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine  In the days before her disappearance, Elizabeth posted several cryptic Instagram photographs about love. Among them was an illustration of Beauty and The Beast. 'Every beauty needs her beast to protect her from everything but him,' it read.  She captioned the post 'Good Morning'. She changed her biography to 'wife' and added a ring emoji to it. On March 12, the day before they vanished, Cummins was spotted buying women's dark brown hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart. He also appeared to have bought men's toiletries. Days earlier, he took out a $4,500 loan and was also seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day of their disappearance. Elizabeth posted this image on Instagram in the days before she disappeared, writing simply beside it: 'Good morning'  Elizabeth referred to a 'mission' before disappearing on March 13. Police believe she was groomed by Cummins who she has known for more than two years  On March 13, Elizabeth told her family she was spending the day with a friend. She told one of her ten siblings to call police if she had not returned by 6pm, according to People.  Police believe Cummins, who she has known for more than two years, brainwashed her into abandoning her family. They have not confirmed whether she went willingly with him on March 13. 'It's entirely likely Elizabeth doesn’t believe – at least right now – that she’s a victim,' Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine told DailyMail.com on Tuesday. In the days before her disappearance, she referred to a 'mission' on social media while sharing quotes about love. Police issued the last photograph of her before her disappearance on Monday. In it, she appeared carrying a pile of clothes in her arms.  The pair were seen kissing at Culleoka High School by another student on January 23. Staff notified police but did not immediately tell her family or suspend Cullins  Tennessee investigators say Elizabeth is in imminent danger. They believe Cummins is armed with two handguns She was dressed in a plaid shirt and dark leggings with her blonde hair scraped back in to a ponytail.  The bureau did not specify where the image was taken but investigators previously stated that Elizabeth had been dropped off at a restaurant by a friend in Colombia, Tennessee, before she was taken.  'Nothing investigators have learned about Cummins or his intentions for the young girl since issuing the AMBER Alert calms the imminent concern for Elizabeth’s well-being.  'In fact, it only heightens it,' a statement issued by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation on Saturday read. Josh DeVine, the bureau's spokesman, said he was eager for the public to grasp how dangerous the situation is.  'She's 15. He is 50. He is facing a charge in which the district attorney has identified her as the victim and they are missing.  'We want her home, we want him in custody, he said last week at a press conference.   Cummins now faces charges for sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Each of the pair's families has issued desperate pleas for them to return.  Cummins' wife Jill appealed directly to him, telling him: 'Tad this is not you. This is not who you are. We can help you get through this. Cummins' embattled wife Jill made an emotional plea for his return last week, telling him: 'Tad, this is not you.' Elizabeth's father Anthony (right) said the teacher 'stole' his daughter from him  Cummins was seen filling up his silver Nissan Rogue with gas on the day the pair disappeared There is a $1,000 reward for information which may lead police to the pair. Tennessee investigators have received 450 tips but do not yet have a strong lead  'No matter how far you've gone or what's happening right now, God's grace is sufficient for you and he wants you to come home. Your family wants their poppy back. Please do the right thing, and turn yourself into the police and bring Beth home.'  The teacher describes himself as a 'Jesus freak, father and grandfather' online.   Elizabeth's father spoke at a vigil in their hometown. 'What Tad did, he stole my daughter from me but Maury County is a big community.  'He didn’t just steal from me, he stole from the whole community.' On Monday, the bureau said it had received 450 tips from dozens of different states but that none had produced a strong lead.  'The individuals could be anywhere, and the TBI continues to urge national vigilance in the ongoing effort to locate the missing girl and apprehend her alleged abductor,' it said.  There is a $1,000 reward for information which could lead police to Cummins. Investigators are urging anyone with information to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. If they spot Cummins' vehicle, which has the license plate TN 976-ZPT, they are urged to call 911 immediately.    Read more: Tennessee AMBER Alert: Teen Warned Parents to Call Police Witness at school considered Tad Cummins a ¿mentor,¿ but reported seeing him kiss Elizabeth Thomas - News - The Daily Herald - Columbia, TN Elizabeth Thomas: Photo Released of Her with Tad Cummins Elizabeth Thomas' Dad Speaks Out After Alleged Abduction TBI Reveals 'Troubling Pattern Of Behavior' Of AMBER ALERT Suspect - NewsChannel 5 Nashville Share or comment on this article e-mail 227 shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

According to reports, a vehicle Hudgins was driving on Athens Highway was stopped at 3:55 a.m. for allegedly speeding. Consequent to the stop, reports state, an officer noted that Hudgins smelled of alcohol. Huggins offered that there was an open beer can in the center console of the vehicle. Reports state that a deputy also allegedly found a small amount of suspected cocaine in a plastic bag in a Newport cigarette box in the vehicle. On March 19 a damage to property complaint was filed at a Double Bridges Road residence. According to reports, a man said someone in a dually pickup truck ran through a wire fence on his property, turned around in the pasture and then left through the gap in the fence. A neighbor’s mailbox was also destroyed. On March 18 a dog complaint was filed at a Nunnally Street, Rutledge residence. According to reports, a man alleged that a neighbor’s Pit Bull dogs were coming into his yard and chasing his dogs. The complainant said there was also a third dog, a grey Pit Bull, that was coming into his yard and chasing his daughter. The man said he wanted a police report filed in case he had to use deadly force against the dogs. On March 18 a prowler complaint was filed at a Newborn Road residence. According to reports, a man said that at 4 a.m. he heard his dogs barking and he observed a white figure in the his back yard near a pump house. The man said he grabbed a pistol and made his way outside and positioned himself where he could still faintly see the figure standing in the same spot. The complainant said when the figure bent over to pick something up from the ground he raised his pistol in a defensive position. The man said the figure then disappeared into the wood line behind the property. The complainant said he heard no noise when the figure left. The complainant also said there had been other unusual occurrences at the property including a gate being left open when neither he nor his fiancée leave the gate open and that he has found beer cans inside a fenced area that are from brands that no one allowed on the property drinks. On March 17 an entering auto complaint was filed at Country Boys RV Park, Eatonton Road. According to reports, a man said someone entered his 2002 Ford 250 and removed a Dell laptop computer, black notebook and a water bottle with “Baxalta” printed on it. The man said a  stainless Ruger 9 mm pistol was also taken. The man said he had not locked the truck prior to the theft. On March 17 a fraud complaint was filed at an Academy Lane, Rutledge residence. According to reports, a woman said she was contacted by someone who claimed they were a representative of the complainant’s health insurance company. She said the woman advised her to take a picture of her W2 tax form and check stubs and send them to a cell phone number. The woman said she did and then she received a text requesting her birth date. The woman said she then contacted her insurance company and was told that they had already received the information via normal channels and that she should not send out that information. On March 16 a fraud complaint was filed at a Oak Lane, Madison residence. According to reports, a man said that after he had dropped off tax information to a Social Circle accountant, he was informed by the accountant that someone else had used his Social Security information to filed taxes. On March 15 a criminal trespass complaint was filed at an Athens Highway residence. According to reports, a man alleged that his girlfriend had come to his residence and attacked him. The man had a small laceration on his neck, reports state. A deputy spoke to the girlfriend and she said that the man had stopped talking to her and she was curious the cause and while attempting to extract the source of the silence, an argument ensued. The property owner requested that the girlfriend be banned from the property. On March 14 an information report was filed at a Fears Road residence. According to reports, a man said a woman with whom he had a joint checking account with had written a counter check for $1,300 from the account and did not have permission to do so. The man said the incident occurred after the man told the woman she could no longer live at his residence. On March 14 a theft by taking complaint was filed at a Davis Academy Road residence. According to reports, a man alleged that someone entered a safe in his house and removed $1,000. The man said the last time he had opened the safe he did so with difficulty so he did not secure the safe and left it partially open. On March 14 a entering auto complaint was filed at a Mission Road residence. According to reports, a woman said someone broke into her locked Chevrolet Tahoe and took $20. Reports state that greasy fingerprints were left on the top of the vehicle’s door.

He also holds the position of Distinguished Research Professor of Science at the University of Missouri - St. Louis How an obscure Obamacare provision is quietly saving lives, and money, in Missouri By Sheree Crute Washington Monthly Mar 21, 2017 (…) +1  +1  Dr. Joe Parks serves as the Director of MO HealthNet, Missouri's Medicaid authority in Jefferson City, Missouri. He also holds the position of Distinguished Research Professor of Science at the University of Missouri - St. Louis Missouri Health Connection About a decade ago, Pat Powers’ life began to spin “out of control,” as she puts it. Powers, a soft-spoken Missouri native, was stressed out from working at Walmart and two other part-time jobs to make ends meet. She was also suffering from diabetes and severe anxiety and depression. Powers found her way to Crider Health Center in St. Charles, a federally funded community health facility that provides a host of physical and mental health services to Medicaid patients such as Powers, all under one roof. There, a psychiatrist, realizing that Powers could not juggle multiple jobs and hope to get better, got her onto disability as he worked to stabilize her mental health issues. A physician also prescribed medication for her diabetes. Yet despite the treatment, Powers still couldn’t tame what she called her “nervous breakdowns” — emotional storms that left her seeking help in Missouri emergency rooms. While she fought to regain her emotional stability, her diabetes only got worse. The problem was that the care Powers was receiving wasn’t well-coordinated, and she wasn’t receiving the guidance and support she needed. Her psychiatrist and the doctor treating her diabetes weren’t communicating sufficiently, and no one knew whether she was taking her prescribed medications (it turns out that she wasn’t, at least not regularly). The management at Crider, which is part of the Compass Health Network, was aware of the lack of coordination, and like thousands of health care professionals around the country, they were seeking ways to fix it. But like any facility trying to survive on Medicaid’s penurious reimbursement rates, the funding wasn’t available to do much more. Meanwhile, the lack of investment in coordination was, ironically, costing taxpayers a bundle. In 2011 alone, Powers racked up more than $10,000 in care, primarily in emergency rooms. Powers is a member of a group with a dubious distinction: the “5/50” population, short for the 5 percent of patients who account for approximately 50 percent of the nation’s health care costs. These are people who typically suffer from two or more chronic, complex health conditions. Many are elderly. Some, like Powers, also have mental health issues that make treating their physical ailments especially challenging. “They could be hearing voices, they could be in a manic phase and not be able to focus,” Pam Haynes, a nurse care manager at Crider says of her patients. “Some people don’t understand, for example, that a piece of paper they are given by a doctor is a prescription and that you actually take that to a pharmacy. … [They] might go back to the hospital in three days and say, ‘I’m still having the same problem. What am I supposed to do?’” Things began to turn around for Powers in 2012. That’s when Crider and 25 other community mental health centers around Missouri began to receive two years of enhanced federal funding to test integrated care for high-need Medicaid patients as part of Medicaid’s Section 2703, a provision of the Affordable Care Act. Section 2703 grants help health care providers defray the costs of becoming “health homes” — that is, organizations that offer a range of carefully integrated services, including clinical and behavioral health care, along with supportive social services — care thought to be particularly effective for high-need, high-cost patients such as Powers. Crider used its share of the funds to, among other things, hire and train nurse managers to help patients set goals and guide their care. It also brought in integrated care managers to help all of the health home’s various care providers — and often outside social service agencies — work in concert for every patient. Those social services might include home visits, and support addressing tough issues like homelessness, unemployment, and social isolation. In Powers’ case, health home care involved sharing information about her medications, hospitalizations, diet, diabetes management, and even employment and housing status. “Like a lot of my clients here, she struggled with basic things, like ‘What’s a carbohydrate’ and how to eat for her diabetes,” says Mary Puetz, the dietician on Powers’s team. By working together, the team helped Powers lower her A1C (a measure of blood glucose) from a dangerous 9.0 to a more manageable 7.4 (6.5 is considered normal) and her cholesterol from 210 to 172. “They helped me understand my depression and cope with things that I stress on, and they helped me with my weight control and diabetes,” says Powers. “Now I’m taking my medication … and I lost 10 pounds.” They also helped her find a part-time job. Now, instead of showing up at emergency rooms, she shows up to work the buffet at a local restaurant. “I feel better about myself,” she says with evident pride. “I know I can handle any situation I come across.” The 2703 program is one of the many types of care delivery and payment reform buried in the law known as Obamacare, and it has been notably successful in improving patient outcomes while driving down health care costs in many states. Yet as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration try to make good on their promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act — ostensibly because of its high cost — the 2703 program is at no small risk of getting wiped out. More integrated approach The idea of coordinating care for better results is hardly new. The concept dates to at least the 1960s, when some pioneering physicians became concerned that ever-increasing medical specialization and the growth of complex chronic diseases among the elderly required a more integrated and scientifically driven approach to health care. These physicians organized the first large-scale health maintenance organizations (HMOs), in which primary care doctors would coordinate care in large, multi-specialty medical group practices that would be part of a system of hospitals, labs, and pharmacies. But the HMO experiment largely fizzled out, and numerous other attempts to encourage integration also failed to take off. One reason is that most health care payment systems, be they private insurance companies or government programs like Medicare, make it difficult for providers to be reimbursed for much of the work — like home visits and coordination meetings — that integrated care typically requires. Another obstacle is cultural: organizations are hard to change, and doctors, nurses, and other health care providers were trained to work in silos. The level of care integration — or “wraparound care,” as some experts call it — is a challenge to achieve. Health care professionals in Missouri understood the need for integrated care, especially after a 2006 report by Joe Parks, a researcher and the current director of MO HealthNet, a division of Missouri’s Department of Social Services, showed that patients with serious mental illness were dying 25 years earlier than the rest of the population. “They were dying of things we could help with — chronic health problems,” recalls Nancy Gongaware, a senior vice president of outpatient health care at Missouri’s Compass Health Network, “but we needed to develop a new way of taking care of them.” Among other things, Missouri health care officials arranged for primary care doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists, along with social workers, dieticians, and others, to be located in the same building so that patients could have “one-stop shopping” for all their health care needs. But just because these professionals worked under the same roof did not guarantee that they would work together. They were neighbors, but not yet teams. The opportunity to go further came when Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Missouri, under then Gov. Jay Nixon, was one of the first six states to apply for the ACA’s new 2703 grants. Eventually, 19 states, including the District of Columbia, would do the same. For years, health policy experts have known that “a lot of the expense in health care comes from poor care coordination,” says Cheryl Damberg, who studies payment reform for RAND. The ACA established policies supplying billions of dollars that fast-tracked experiments in new and better ways aimed at comprehensive health care, while achieving savings through that improved care. According to a review by the Missouri Department of Mental Health, the results of the 2703 grant program in that state have been impressive. The more than 23,000 Missourians who have received care under the health home initiative met or exceeded six of nine benchmark goals for disease management after the ACA-supported expansion. For patients with diabetes alone (America’s most costly disease, at approximately $332 billion a year), the number with controlled blood glucose levels rose from 18 percent to 61 percent. The percentage of patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease who controlled their blood pressure went from 24 to 67 percent, and their good cholesterol levels soared from 21 to 56 percent. On the cost side, hospitalizations and emergency room visits for this group dropped 14 percent and 19 percent respectively. This saved the state $31 million just in the first year of the program, and the savings have continued, according to Natalie Fornelli, manager of integrated care at Missouri’s Division of Behavioral Health. In 2015, Missouri’s health home program won the American Psychiatric Association’s Gold Achievement Award for community health services. The program is now considered a national model. If there is a downside to the health home initiative, it is that too few Missourians benefit from it. That’s largely because of the politics of Obamacare. While Nixon, a Democrat, had the statutory ability to request the 2703 grant funds, and did so aggressively, Missouri’s GOP-controlled Legislature adamantly opposed accepting federal Medicaid expansion funds under the ACA. As a result, 632,000 Missourians remain uninsured, including 40 percent of the 1 in 10 Missouri residents with serious mental illness. That situation is unlikely to change anytime soon, unless Missouri’s new Republican governor, Eric Greitens, who replaced term-limited Nixon in January, can convince his legislators to change course — an uphill climb at best. Last April, the Legislature went in the opposite direction, passing a bill requiring Medicaid recipients to pay an $8 copay for any ER visit that is not deemed an emergency, or any missed doctor’s appointment. Nixon vetoed the law in July. It will go to Greitens next. At the national level, the fate of the 2703 program is also in doubt. It’s possible that, as Republican lawmakers in Washington and the Trump administration wrestle with the complexities of repealing and replacing Obamacare, they’ll conclude that failing to continue the 2703 grants will likely cost more in tax dollars than it saves, even as it would deprive hundreds of thousands of poor, mentally ill Americans the coordinated treatment that can save their lives. But, as Sidney Watson, a professor at the St. Louis University School of Law and an expert on health care access for the poor, observes, Trump’s new Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, “has expressed a lot of skepticism about the Medicare and Medicaid demonstration centers.” Still, the advances made at places like Crider Health Center are real and ongoing, even if, without more 2703 grants, they’re unlikely to spread to other community mental health centers. The improved care at Crider has certainly done a world of good for patients such as Powers. “Without it,” she says, “I wouldn’t be here. I’d be gone.” Sheree Crute is a health policy writer based in Brooklyn, and the author of “Health Insurance, a Brief History: The Impact of Obamacare.” This story appears in the current edition of The Washington Monthly. © 2017 Washington Monthly Publishing LLC Reprinted with permission of Washington Monthly. +1  +1  Dr. Joe Parks serves as the Director of MO HealthNet, Missouri's Medicaid authority in Jefferson City, Missouri.

This article will appear in the Spring 2017 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. Tony Avelar/AP Images Otto-mated: One of Otto’s self-driving, big-rig trucks leaves the garage for a test drive during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters on August 18, 2016, in San Francisco. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school. LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Official Leweb Photos/Creative Commons Uber’s Travis Kalanick speaking in London.  Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.” FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Several Seconds/Creative Commons Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers.  Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene. TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” State Department/Public Domain Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin shows then-Secretary of State John Kerry the sensor displays inside one of Google’s self-driving cars in Palo Alto, California.  Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.” NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” AP Photo/Jared Wickerham Pit Stop: Uber testing driverless cars on Pittsburgh streets, 2016.  MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on March 22, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: March 22, 2017 @ 9:58 am Filed Under: 24/7 OSI, Americas, Economics, Energy, English, Environment, Intelligence, Internet Communications Technology, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Security, United States Government, United States of America, US Amalgamated Transit Union, US Unions NEXT ARTICLE → S. 576, Follow the Rules Act ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Intelligence and Security Bill passes third reading About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts ‘Öfisi ‘Omipatimení ko e Me’afua ki he Fakahoko Fatongia ‘a e Ngaahi Potungāue mo e Ngaahi Kautaha ‘a e Pule’angá New Zealand Employment: NZ’s investment in infrastructure creating jobs New Zealand Sport: Rugby League World Cup 2017 ANNOUNCE WOLF BLASS AS OFFICIAL WINE PARTNER Freshwater focus for World Water Day $400m Huawei investment will promote innovation and create opportunities © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

The program, called Guaranteed Delivery, will launch this summer for customers in the United States. eBay will also include options for one-to-two-day delivery. The three-day guaranteed delivery applies to 20 million eligible items on eBay, the company said.

"While the majority of items on eBay already ship within 3 days or less, as well as for free, Guaranteed Delivery will give shoppers even faster delivery options and the confidence that their items will arrive on time," eBay’s North America Senior Vice President Hal Lawton said in a statement. The delivery program will be at no additional cost to sellers, but eBay says sellers will have meet certain requirements to participate. Read: Losing Jobs To Robots?

Walmart previously had ShippingPass, which resembled Amazon Prime’s two-day shipping. ShippingPass, priced at $49, failed to takeoff and was nixed. Although Amazon is double the price of Shipping Pass, it offers more services to customers, such as Amazon Video, music streaming and its photo cloud. The company also introduced a credit card that gives Prime members five percent back on their purchases with Amazon.

Gates, whose wealth is estimated at $86 billion, led the list for the fourth straight year. He was followed by Berkshire Hathaway chief Warren Buffett – with an estimated wealth of $75.6billion, before a bevy of American tech giants dominated the rest of the top ten. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was number three with a net worth of $72.8billion, Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg was fifth with $56billion, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison came it at number seven with $52.2billion in the bank. The rest of the top ten included Amancio Ortega – Inditex fashion group founder and the richest non-American – at number four with $71.3billion, Mexican telecommunications tycoon Carlos Slim at six with $54.5billion, Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch in eighth and ninth with $48.3billion, while Michael Bloomberg rounded it out with $47.5billion. Trump's plummet down the list to number 544 with an estimated net worth of $3.5billion was the result of $1billion being slashed from his valuation in the same list last year. Forbes attributed Trump's drop to sluggishness in the Manhattan real estate market which is responsible for a disproportionate amount of his wealth. 'Forty percent of Donald Trump's fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,' Forbes said. 1. Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder: $86billion 2.

Sheldon Adelson,Las Vegas Sands Corporation CEO: $30.4billion 'Lately, the neighborhood has been struggling (relatively speaking).' Trump had steadfastly refused to release his tax returns, which would prove how much he is truly worth, however the Forbes figure is substantially lower than the president has claimed. During the campaign, then-candidate Trump boasted he was worth, 'in excess of $10billion', the Guardian reports. Trump was in fact tied with 19 other people at number 544, including disgraced former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, and Texas billionaire Robert McNair. However, the president will perhaps take some comfort in outranking Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on the list, who has an estimated net worth of $3.4billion. Overall, the global billionaire population jumped 13 per cent from last year to 2,043, the biggest annual increase in the 31 years since the magazine began compiling the list, Forbes said. Including in the 195 newcomers to the list are 15 self-made women. The new arrivals took the total number of women ranked by Forbes to 227. The US led countries with the most billionaires with 565, while China was second with 319 billionaires, and Germany was third with 114. This year it took at least $3.7 billion in wealth to make it onto the list, but only in a tie for 501st place, a group that included Hollywood director Steven Spielberg. The total worth of the names on the list was about $7.67trillion – or about 46 per cent of the US' GDP. Forbes explained how it creates its 'snapshot' ranking as part of the list. 'The Forbes Billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth taken on February 17, 2017; we used stock prices and exchange rates from around the world to calculate net worths,' the magazine said. ' We list individuals rather than multi-generational families who share large fortunes, though we include wealth belonging to a billionaire's spouse and children if that person is the founder of the fortune.' -3news More International | Latest News Comments No Comment Leave your Comment Do you have an story for publication?

Last April Ford announced plans to transform its 60-plus-year-old Dearborn campus into a high-tech, high-efficiency headquarters. The automaker said the project, which will cost upwards of $1.2 billion, according to some estimates, will seek LEED Silver and LEED Gold green building certification for all renovated facilities and new construction, respectively. Additionally, Walmart has pledged to invest $250 billion in American manufacturing by 2023 in an effort to making it both easier and more competitive to manufacture goods in the US. As part of this commitment, in January the Walmart US Manufacturing Innovation Fund invested about $3 million in projects that aim to make domestic manufacturing more cost-effective and sustainable, bringing its grants awarded total to $10 million.  A planned $140 million sustainable manufacturing institute, led by the US Energy Department, that will focus on reducing the cost of technologies needed to reuse, recycle and remanufacture materials could save manufacturers’ billions of dollars, the DOE says. And just today the International Living Future Institute (ILFI), in partnership with Green Building Alliance (GBA), announced the opening of a Living Product “Hub,” which aims to accelerate sustainable manufacturing and create jobs in Pittsburgh. The partners say the Hub, co-located at GBA’s office in Pittsburgh’s South Side neighborhood, will be a center of education and outreach, connecting innovative buildings, communities and projects. “The Hub will support Pittsburgh’s ongoing efforts to reinvent itself as a place where innovation and invention meet the future,” said James Connelly, director of the Living Product Challenge for ILFI, in a statement. The Living Product Challenge provides a framework for manufacturers to create products that are “healthy, inspirational and give back to the environment.” Using the Living Product Challenge and the Declare label program, the Hub will “provide hands-on assistance to companies who are committed to creating transparent, nontoxic and sustainable products,” Connelly added.         Categories Feature, ManufacturingTags Ford, Green Building Alliance, International Living Future Institute, Walmart 2 thoughts on “What Walmart, Ford, ILFI and Green Building Alliance Are Doing to Make Manufacturing Profitable, Sustainable” Buy American Campaign March 22, 2017 at 4:11 pm | Reply Any investment in the American manufacturing industry, to help create/preserve American jobs both in the manufacturing plant and in the companies that supply them, is a good thing. Let’s encourage/reward this investment by buying American made products. SandyMontalbano March 22, 2017 at 5:26 pm | Reply These efforts are good for the U.S. economy and the environment. The time is right to make more Made in USA products available to U.S. consumers. As companies adopt a more comprehensive total cost analysis they are finding that the “hidden costs” of offshoring often counterbalance any remaining savings from cheap price or labor abroad. These companies are investing and sourcing in the U.S. because it makes good economic sense for them to do so. The Reshoring Initiative Can Help In order to help companies decide objectively to reshore manufacturing back to the U.S. or offshore, the not-for-profit Reshoring Initiative’s free Total Cost of Ownership Estimator (TCOE) can help corporations calculate the real P&L impact of reshoring or offshoring. http://www.reshorenow.org/TCO_Estimator.cfm Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Home » Outdoors & Gear » Ask the Gear Guy » How to waterproof an inexpensive tent How to waterproof an inexpensive tent Q. I have an 8-person tent I got from Wal-Mart a few years ago. It has been fine for camping in the backyard with the family but we are going to a couple of state parks soon so the convenience of running in the house if it starts to rain is not an option. The tent boasted “weather-tec” or something like that, basically claiming it will stay dry. I really don’t want to buy a new tent.  How do you think it will fair if it begins to rain? –Concerned Keith, Chicago, Illinois A. Hello Keith. Thanks for the good question. Your gut is right on — there’s indeed a good chance that your tent won’t be truly waterproof. Inexpensive tents from stores like Wal-Mart may be just fine for fair weather outings. What they usually lack is durability, weather-proofness and they are often heavier than high-end camping gear. I hear what you’re saying about not wanting to buy a new one so it’s good to know there are a couple things you can try to make your tent work. First, you could get a basic tarp at the hardware store (probably will cost you less than $15) and hang that above your tent. That way, the tarp shelters your tent and takes the brunt of the rain during a storm. Second, you could treat your tent with a waterproofer like Nikwax Concentrated Tent & Gear Solar Proof ($13-$39; http://www.nikwax.com), which you mix with water. Simply pitch your tent, spray it down with a hose, and then use a sponge to cover the entire thing with the Nikwax mixture. For a tent as large as yours, you’ll likely have to use most of the 1-liter pouch, which costs about $39 bucks. The Nikwax will boost your tent’s water repellency and prevent the fabric from being damaged by prolonged exposure to the sun. Will it make your Wal-Mart tent ready for an expedition on Everest? Not a chance, but it should get you through a season of camping fun.

I use the tarp also to make a porch covering. scoutmom // October 2, 2015 at 7:13 pm // Reply we have purchased walmart tents for 18 years and never had a water problem. The reason being we also purchase waterproofer sold near the tents and put a good coat on every spring. It is about $4 a can and it takes 2 cans for a couple coats on a 4 man tent. We usually break the poles after 3-4 years and go buy the next tent. My guys are scouts so we camp at least once a month and usually a lot more Dreward // October 2, 2015 at 10:03 am // Reply I would recommend in addition to use seam sealer on all seams on the fly and tent. allo // June 24, 2014 at 2:08 pm // Reply Am in england looking at buying a 12 man tent but some ov the coments a have seen about them say they leak a little what is the best thing to use to stop it leaking like a spray or wax does any one know what a have to get and how much campergirl // June 30, 2009 at 4:48 pm // Reply We also have an 8-person tent from Wal-Mart and the only time it’s seen rain was a total disaster! Water-proof guarantee notwithstanding, water poured in like a faucet from the center of each of the three roof domes. (None came in from the floor, though) Thanks for these suggestions… Anonymous // June 19, 2013 at 8:58 am // Reply Same thing happened to us this past weekend – nightmare! murphy // June 7, 2009 at 10:48 pm // Reply Buy a can of Atsko Silicone Water-Guard spray at Walmart for about $4. One coat of it on a tent or anything and it will be water proof. Much cheaper than Nikwax products and just as effective. c-rad // May 29, 2009 at 5:28 am // Reply thanks i have the same problem Anonymous // June 2, 2015 at 1:18 pm // Reply This is the same product we’ve used to waterproof the majority of the tents in our home. It’s exceptional and lasts for years. The only time it has failed is when we’ve failed to apply it before rain. 😉 Jack // August 10, 2015 at 7:53 am // Reply Thanks so much!! Yes, I have used this in the past and it does work well. Thanks for the reminder. Just purchased a 12-person Cabin tent from Walmart. Ajy // October 2, 2015 at 1:32 pm // Reply What they said ^. I used the cheap silicone water guard spray at Walmart two coats around $5 bucks and the water just bounces right off. It rained 5 days and nights at summer camp we got the left overs of a hurricane off the gulf and not one leak. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Please do not use your real name.

William Thornton / wthornton@al.com  It was graduation day at Walmart. A drummer led the column of graduates marching through Gadsden's Walmart Supercenter, as cheerleaders and a band played. It was a site replaying itself across the country, as the retail giant has committed to building up to 200 training academies by years-end in the U.S. to prepare hourly supervisors and department managers. There was plenty of school spirit. The graduates were led by Jacksonville State University's cheerleaders in spelling out Wal-Mart, ending with, "Who's Number One? Customers, always!" Gadsden is home to one of the training academies, in its East Gadsden store. Attendees get two weeks of training in both the classroom and on the sales floor. The first week deals with retail fundamentals, while the second week encompasses training on the floor. Graduates complete work in leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service. The academies are built to train employees at several different stores across broad areas. The company anticipates training about 140,000 people a year at the academies. John Tow, a regional general manager with Walmart, has been with the company since he was hired out of high school 34 years ago. He said the academies are aimed at creating "a better and more consistent customer experience." It's the sort of thing Sam Walton would have approved of, he said. "Skills training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth and helps make working at Walmart a smart career choice," he said.

Fields also has pictures of himself galloping through the Galleria area on horseback...at least that time, they were outside.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Libby Copeland By Libby Copeland March 21 Finlandia imported butter is sold at Walmart and other stores. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post) Have you ever eaten butter by the spoon? Butter without toast to prop it up or eggs to fry in it — butter for its own tangy, full-flavored, exquisite sake? Elaine Khosrova does this, not infrequently. She warms a variety of types to room temperature, gets a glass of water to clear her palate between rounds and pries delicately at her subjects with scientific curiosity, observing how the different textures yield to her knife. Seven types of butter are in front of her today, made from cow, sheep and goat cream, ranging from a sunny gold to a soft, bridal white. “Butter: A Rich History” by Elaine Khosrova (Algonquin Books) “You see how totally cohesive this is?” she says, prying at the first and mildest sample, a sweet cow butter made in New Zealand by a brand called Anchor. She slides a slab of the thick, pale yellow Anchor onto her spoon. The author of “Butter: A Rich History,” Khosrova has worked as a pastry chef, at a restaurant trade journal, in a magazine test kitchen and as the editor of a cheese magazine, and she has researched the history of butter going back to the Stone Age. The resident of Hudson Valley, N.Y., has made it her job to know the differences between conventional and grass-fed, between sweet and cultured (fermented with live cultures). She can explain how tender springtime grass creates butter that’s more yellow (it’s from the beta carotene in the plants), and, when she’s tasting, pick out the diacetyl (that quintessential buttery flavor) and the lactones (they impart a sweetness, she says). She is, in short, a butter savant in a country coming around to butter again. “It’s been downtrodden for so long, between the margarine wars and the diet wars,” says Khosrova. Even in the ’80s, when “fat was so taboo,” she says, “I never gave up on butter.” How, precisely, do you taste-test butter? It turns out it’s much like tasting wine, only . . . thicker. Khosrova lifts the spoon, sniffs and slides it into her mouth, the spoon clanking against her teeth. Elaine Khosrova concentrates while describing flavor nuances during a butter tasting. “I never gave up on butter,” she says. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) “I try to kind of keep it in the front of my mouth,” she says stickily. “You really want it to dissolve as slowly as possible.” She makes a breathy, guttural sound. “You’re trying to almost smell from the back of your throat.” [Undocumented workers help fuel U.S. farms. Does affordable produce depend on them?] Between the initial saltiness and the full-flavored fattiness that coats the tongue and makes everything else seem like a distant dream, Khosrova’s palate catches the butter’s “terroir.” It has “almost, like, a green vegetable quality,” she says. “It’s so fleeting. It’s there and then it’s gone.” The amateur tries to catch this subtlety and just winds up with a mouthful of butter. Which is not actually a bad thing. Sacred, or at least special Khosrova’s book, which was released in November, could not have better timing. In recent years, countless headlines have declared butter “back,” amid some science suggesting we may have overrated its health dangers. People are putting butter in their coffee, and the demand for “real food” is pervasive enough that in 2015, McDonald’s swapped out margarine for butter in its Egg McMuffin. Butter’s story is a very American story, because the arc of its vilification and subsequent redemption is a parable for how we get food wrong time and again. We alternately demonize and idealize individual ingredients — not just butter but also sugar, caffeine, red wine and supposed miracle foods featured on “The Dr. Oz Show” — and in doing so, we miss the big picture. Even now, at butter’s supposed moment of glory, many nutritional scientists worry that the pendulum may be swinging too far in its direction. American food trends are hopelessly reminiscent of Newton’s third law, says David L. Katz, founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center: “For every boneheaded action, there’s an opposite and equally boneheaded reaction.” But before we get to all that, it helps to go back to the beginning. Khosrova writes that butter is believed to hark back to the Neolithic era. While the exact circumstances of its discovery are unknown, she imagines a herdsman storing milk inside an animal skin. Over the course of many hours, the milk is ripened by bacteria, chilled and agitated by a bumpy ride, causing delicious, golden butter flakes to form, and delighting the herdsman. Cultured Butter can be made in a food processor. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post) Over time, Khosrova says, butter became not just beloved but revered. In ancient Sumeria, people brought butter offerings to a temple to celebrate the union of a fertility goddess with a mythological dairy shepherd. The Vedic Aryans filled their sacred texts with references to butter (“waves of butter flow like gazelles before the hunter,” went one hymn), while Tibetan Buddhist monks made sacred butter sculptures for centuries, and still do. Ancient Druids paid homage to a pagan goddess by making butter — “the phallic thrusting of the dasher in the churn” symbolizing “the blessing of fertility,” she says. Khosrova says butter was seen as holy by many people in part because they didn’t understand how it formed. If things like temperature or fat content weren’t right, butter wouldn’t emerge at all. Its appearance, therefore, was capricious and special — proof of the goodness of the universe. [Make the recipe: Cultured Butter] “It was really valuable, too,” Khosrova says. She is tall and willowy; friendly with a touch of reserve. When she talks dairy, she is scrupulous, sometimes consulting a trade manual that deals with matters such as oxidation and rancidity. “It tasted delicious, it was used as a medicine, it was used for waterproofing.” And “it was rich. If you didn’t have a lot of animal meat, for instance, you had this richness to sustain you.” By the 16th century, buttermaking was well established as women’s domain, but it eventually went male and mechanical during the Industrial Revolution, marked by inventions such as the centrifugal cream separator, and the rise of commercial creameries with big equipment that was believed to require muscly men. By 1887, the annual report of the Nebraska Dairymen’s Association was bidding a florid goodbye to the “sound dairymaid,” with her “full, rounded arm” and “sweet voice.” Not too long after that, butter began its decline. A cycle of scapegoats The story of butter’s shifting fortunes over the past century is complex and messy, featuring a sharp-elbowed war between butter and margarine, changing scientific wisdom over matters such as saturated fat and trans fats, and finger-pointing over an obesity epidemic that has panicked policymakers, advocacy groups and average Americans. Once upon a time, Americans ate butter unapologetically. In the early 1900s, we consumed more than 18 pounds of butter per person per year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Margarine, invented in 1869 and cheaper than butter, was attacked early on by the dairy industry and subjected to all sorts of regulations. But margarine’s fortunes rose over time, assisted by scarce butter supplies during World War II and concerns over the saturated fat in butter, and it surpassed butter in popularity during the 1950s. More recently, as the health impact of artificial trans fats prevalent in some forms of margarine have come to light, as our interest in more “natural” products has grown, and as sugar has taken its place as the most hated of foodstuffs, butter has come to be revered in many circles, like a long-lost love back from war. Butter consumption surpassed margarine’s in 2005, and as of 2014, the average American was consuming 5.6 pounds per year — a 40-year high, though nowhere near where it once was. Consumption of butter in the United States is up to 5.6 pounds a year, a 40-year high. In the early 1900s, it was around 18 pounds. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) In her book, Khosrova writes about the benefits of certain micronutrients in butter, especially the grass-fed kind. And in recent years, research has prompted debates over just how saturated fats affect the body. But many nutritional experts say butter is, at best, a neutral force in the diet and recommend moderation; if we went overboard in demonizing it, neither should we lionize it. “The type of fat we eat is very important, and an optimally healthy diet will be low in butter,” emails Harvard doctor and nutritionist Walter Willett. “The central reason for confusion is the issue of to what butter is being compared.” [For decades, the government steered millions away from whole milk. Was that wrong?] Willett says butter is clearly not as healthful as certain kinds of oil, such as olive, soybean and canola. But on the other hand, replacing butter with carbohydrates doesn’t constitute an improvement as far as risk of cardiovascular disease. In other words, if you cut back on butter, sub in olive oil, rather than low-fat cookies. Katz, of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, says the ­butter-is-back story line reflects our failure to look at our own diets as a whole. “We seem to be in a cycle lasting decades of seeking sequential scapegoats. Right now there’s a cottage industry in implying that the one thing wrong with our diets is sugar. . . . That doesn’t exonerate pepperoni pizza,” Katz says. “The focus on a scapegoat invites the food industry to do what they’ve done to us for decades, and that is keep inventing new kinds of junk food.” Tasting the subtleties Khosrova is a fan of moderation when it comes to butter, if only because her beloved condiment is packed with calories and so flavorful that a little goes a long way. But on tasting days, moderation is by necessity on hold. The seven butters on display come from six countries — France, New Zealand, Ireland, Canada, England and two from the United States — the priciest being the $24 sheep butter by Haverton Hill Creamery in California which arrives in what looks like a small ice cream tub. All are salted to make comparisons easier. Over time, even the amateur starts to pick up on the subtleties. There’s a butter from Stirling Creamery in Ontario made from whey cream (a byproduct of the cheesemaking process), which has what Khosrova calls an “umami cheesiness” that does a back flip in your mouth. There’s a cultured butter from Vermont Creamery that’s a startling 86 percent butterfat, rather than the 80 percent of most of the others — it’s at once milky and tangy. The French cultured butter from Isigny Ste-Mere, churned in a traditional style, has a wonderful balance, the tanginess mixed with coarse rock salt and a satisfying fatty fullness at the end. Separate from the tasting, Khosrova pulls out a butter-that-shall-not-be-named as an example of what can go wrong; its flavor is marked by a distinct cardboardiness, which she says is likely related to compounds known as aldehydes. Elaine Khosrova hosts a tasting of several varieties of butter. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) There is so much to know about butter, such as how cows convert plant matter into fatty milk, and why some breeds make better-tasting butter, and what precise combination of elements makes Land O’Lakes taste, Khosrova says, “like my childhood.” For “Butter,” Khosrova traveled to Bhutan, Ireland, Wisconsin and Iowa; she talked to an animal science expert and an expert in lactation physiology. Abundant milk-producing Holsteins are popular in the dairy world, Khosrova says, but when she makes her own butter, which is often, she uses Jersey cream she gets from a shop about 20 minutes from her home in New York’s Hudson Valley. (However, the gold standard, in her opinion, is the “fabulous cream” of Guernsey cows, which is “really hard to find.”) Unlike Khosrova, the amateur unused to eating so much butter at once finds herself slightly queasy four butters in, and a little punchy. (This makes it, again, not unlike a wine tasting.) But she rallies at the end for the pricey sheep butter, which tastes for all the world like the strip of fat you pull off lamb chops, and for a goat butter by Delamere, which is sweet and gamy and somehow — this is hard to describe — tender. It nearly brings tears to the eyes. “That’s so funny,” says Khosrova. “Michael Pollan wrote about a butter that he tasted in Spain and he said it was absolutely ‘poignant.’ That was the word he used.” Another amateur at the tasting asks what the goat butter would pair well with, but the answer is already obvious. Clearly, a spoon. Copeland is a former Post reporter who writes on culture and human behavior.

Fields, one of the riders, recorded video of the prank. He and his friends ride every weekend and they just wanted to try something different. “I wasn’t trying to hurt nobody, or do anything destructive. It was just, like, you only live once, you know? That’s all,” Fields said. Walmart’s corporate office issued a statement, saying, “We in no way condone yesterday’s reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions.” Get breaking news, weather and traffic on the go.

Hot Topics: Sunshine Week Mount Wachusett CC Special Section Bridal Guide Trump Transition Local Heroes Where We Live Print   Email   Font Resize Man arraigned after he fled the scene Sentinel & Enterprise Updated:   03/21/2017 08:28:08 AM EDT LEOMINSTER -- When a New Hampshire man attempted to the leave the WalMart on Jungle Road with over $475 of shoplifted merchandise, security officers confronted him and during the struggle, the man dropped his car keys and fled on foot, according to a police investigation. With the keys to Thomas Loughlin's vehicle, a 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer, his license plate number and motor vehicle registry information, officers issued a warrant for his arrest for larceny over $250 last week in District Court. On Monday, Loughlin, 25, was arraigned for two counts of larceny over $250 for the March 13 incident, when he struggled with store security, and for an earlier shoplifting on March 9, according to court documents. Loughlin, according to police, on both dates loaded up a shopping cart with merchandise and left the store. During the March 9 incident, Loughlin allegedly left the store with nearly $450 of merchandise. During his arraignment on Monday, Loughlin was ordered held in lieu of posting a $200 cash bond or $2,000 surety bond. His next court appearance is April 27. LEOMINSTER -- A city man was arrested for assault on Friday after striking another man over 60 years old, according to court documents. Anthony Fortunato, 57, was charged with assault and battery on person over 60-years-old or disabled, as a result of the incident, according to court documents. Advertisement Fortunato, according to a police narrative of the incident, and the 66-year-old victim were arguing when it turned violent. The victim, according to the narrative, suffered minor injuries, which didn't require medical treatment, that were consistent with his account. Fortunato was released after posting a $300 cash bail, stay away from the victim and ordered to return to court on May 4.

The Union City Police Department said the incident began at around 6 p.m. Sunday when the female suspect attempted to return some batteries. When store employees declined to accept the batteries, she became extremely agitated, police said. After returning to her car, she backed up quickly and almost crashed into a family of five, knocking down a 3-year old girl in the process, police said. And that’s when police say she went from angry to ballistic. “The victims were actually saying that she was yelling and screaming in the car, pounding her fists on the steering wheel,” says Union City Police Sgt. Steven Mendez. Then, surveillance video shows, she peeled out of her parking space - right at the family again. “Thankfully, Mom had the presence of mind to reach down and pick up her daughter. Because as soon as she was able to pick her up, the female gunned it again and backed up in that direction. Had the child been there, she probably would have been hit by the car,” Mendez said.

That point was driven home by merger talks in recent weeks between Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. The preliminary discussions may not lead to a deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For Albertsons, which may be beefing up ahead of an initial public offering, taking Sprouts private and adding it to the portfolio would mean a deeper push into foods that appeal to a growing segment of shoppers. Longtime staples like cereal and canned soup have struggled as health-conscious consumers pursue less-processed options. That’s pushed organics into the mainstream, with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. expanding into a market long dominated by Whole Foods Market Inc. and other niche stores. Albertsons seems ready to jump deeper into the lettuce patch. “They’re looking to add some sex appeal,” said Roger Davidson, an industry consultant. “A lot of their stores tend to be boring, standard supermarkets. If they don’t do something, they’re going to continue to struggle.” Fresh produce is a draw to brick-and-mortar stores, even as online ordering has devoured swathes of the retail landscape. With Amazon intent on pushing into the business, despite its struggles with delivering fresh food, grocers are increasingly focused on the quality of fruits and vegetables. Poised to Sell An Albertsons takeover of Sprouts could help persuade investors that there’s demand for shares of a giant U.S. grocery chain this year, Davidson said. The company, backed by Cerberus Capital Management LP, operates about 2,300 U.S. stores, including the Shaw’s, Safeway and Acme chains. The company almost went public in 2015 before pulling the IPO because of turbulence in the stock market. The offering has been on hold almost 18 months. Cerberus, which manages more than $30 billion in private equity holdings, distressed debt, credit assets and real estate, first invested in Albertsons in 2006 and then bought stores in 2013 from Supervalu Inc. Albertsons more than doubled in size in 2014 when it acquired Safeway Inc. in a deal valued at about $9.2 billion. The company has a presence on the East Coast, but its stores are mainly west of the Mississippi River. Sprouts has more than half of its outlets in California and Texas, two of the most competitive U.S. markets. Sprouts is “one of the few high-quality growth platforms remaining in grocery and a concept we believe will continue to take market share,” Chris Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note. Winnie Lerner, a spokeswoman for Albertsons, declined to comment. Food Deflation With the IPO in limbo, Albertsons has struggled to find growth. Food deflation has battered the industry over the past year, weighing down sales and prompting price wars that have eroded profit margins. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, in the fourth quarter posted negative same-store sales for the first time in more than a decade. Its shares have plunged 15 percent this year. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Albertsons faces pressure from both ends. It needs organics to appeal to more affluent customers concerned with health. But its current stores aren’t quite cheap enough to draw low-end customers who shop at dollar-store chains or Wal-Mart. The price war has gotten even more intense with the German chain Aldi expanding rapidly in the U.S., not to mention the planned arrival of European competitor Lidl this year. Organic food isn’t a panacea. Whole Foods has struggled because of the perception that it’s overpriced. Same-store sales have dropped for six straight quarters, pulled down by conventional retailers encroaching on its turf with lower prices. Smaller Outlets Sprouts has taken a hit from food deflation as well, but posted a 2.7 percent same-store sales gain in 2016. And while Albertsons has experimented with smaller outlets heavy on produce, Sprouts would provide a strong foothold in a fast-growing market, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Willard Bishop, a consumer research firm in Chicago. “They’re looking for growth, and they don’t see it as much with the traditional supermarket,” he said. “The growth is happening with peripheral formats -- that’s where the consumer is.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. Tony Avelar/AP Images Otto-mated: One of Otto's self-driving, big-rig trucks leaves the garage for a test drive during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters on August 18, 2016, in San Francisco. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school.   LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Official Leweb Photos/Creative Commons Uber's Travis Kalanick speaking in London.  Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.”   FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Several Seconds/Creative Commons Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers.  Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene.   TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” State Department/Public Domain Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin shows then-Secretary of State John Kerry the sensor displays inside one of Google's self-driving cars in Palo Alto, California.  Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.”   NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” AP Photo/Jared Wickerham Pit Stop: Uber testing driverless cars on Pittsburgh streets, 2016.  MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road. <a href="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=92678&cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> About the Author   Steven Greenhouse was a reporter at The New York Times for 31 years and was its labor and workplace reporter from 1995 to 2014.

As a result, Johnson’s character, Roy, is leading a team of unlikely heroes in his fight against the enemy. Roy and his supporters’ attack on the terrorists can now be witnessed by audiences across the country, as the drama is now available on home entertainment. ‘Check Point’ has been distributed on all formats, including such online platforms as iTunes US, Google Play, Xbox, Amazon Instant, Amazon DVD, Vudu (Walmart online) and Playstation. The cable providers that are broadcasting the action thriller are Comcast, Cos, Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse, Verizon Fios, Frontier, Suddenlink, Charter, Mediacom, CenturyLink, Google Play, Dish, DirecTV and Blockbuster/Sling TV. The DVD retailers releasing the movie are Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon.com, Netflix, Redbox, and Military Base shops. Award-winning filmmaker Thomas J. Churchill wrote, directed and produced the movie. While discussing ‘Check Point,’ the helmer revealed, “I have written many scripts and produced (and) directed a few films. But nothing compared to where my mind went with ‘Check Point.'” Churchill added that “The idea of ‘Check Point’ was something that has been with me since 1987. At one time, I wanted to be in the service as my father, uncles, grandfather and even my brother served our country. But I realized that it takes a very special kind of person to wear the uniform and defend their country. At that time in my life, my mind drifted more to the cinema and I wanted to make movies…where people can escape their worries and problems and lose themselves for a bit and get caught up in the world of cinema.” In addition to Johnson, ‘Check Point’ stars an ensemble cast, including WWE Universal Champion Bill Goldberg, William Forsythe, Martial Arts Hall of Famer Mel Novak, Kane Hodder, Tyler Mane, Fred “The Hammer” Williamson, Former UFC Champion John Lewis and Krista Grotte. The thriller also features the last last on screen performance by the late Ricky Harris. ‘Check Point’ follows the result of what happens when a sleeper cell terrorist plot is discovered in a small town where everyone knows one another, or so they thought. Justice seems lost, especially when an insurgent attack threatens to escalate into a full-blown invasion of the US. But a team of unlikely heroes, who are led by Roy, rises up to protect their beloved country.

If I remember correctly, it’s the democrats that want to legalize drugs so people like this can be a burden on our society, rape our children, steal from the innocent. There should be discretion in law enforcement. With this much evidence on scene, maybe we should just let them overdose and not be a burden on the taxpayers.

Trump's trade nominee Bob Lighthizer has dropped hints on other NAFTA priorities, without committing himself, including patent protections, Canadian grocery shelves and Canadian softwood lumber.  (Zach Gibson / Bloomberg)   By Alexander PanettaThe Canadian Press Tues., March 21, 2017 WASHINGTON—The Trump administration says liberalizing cross-border online shopping is one of its trade priorities with Canada, according to a document that provides new clues on the administration’s plans entering NAFTA renegotiations. The statement comes in an exchange of letters between the administration’s nominee for trade czar and the top congressional committee that handles trade, which is considering his nomination. Canada has one of the lowest allowances in the developed world for online duty-free shopping — Canadian consumers are allowed to purchase $20 worth of goods online from Amazon, eBay or other retailers before duties kick in, compared to $800 in the U.S. Read more: Trump calls NAFTA a ‘catastrophe,’ suggests negotiating ‘extra F’ for ‘fair’ Article Continued Below Canada fires off letter to U.S. lawmakers who support Buy American rule Ontario leads pushback against New York state's Buy American policy Trade nominee Bob Lighthizer was asked about that by a member of the Senate finance committee, which is one of the congressional bodies that by law must be consulted before, during, and after the U.S. holds trade negotiations. He received written questions about wine, dairy, softwood lumber and pharmaceuticals, in addition to oral questions and answers at a public hearing this month where lawmakers made it clear they want important changes in NAFTA. In his written responses, he said the duty-free level, known as “de minimis,” would be an issue. “I believe that increasing Canada’s de minimis level could be a significant issue in our overall bilateral trade engagement with Canada, as well as in our engagement with Canada in multilateral trade forums,” Lighthizer wrote back, in a 124-page exchange of letters obtained by Inside U.S. Trade. “I will consult with Congress and domestic stakeholders to develop a strategy that seeks to address concerns with Canada’s low de minimis level.” That debate has also begun in Canada. It’s pitted online retailers against the lobby group for bricks-and-mortar stores, the Retail Council of Canada which represents 45,000 stores including some giants like Walmart, Best Buy and Lowe’s. Lighthizer dropped hints on other priorities, without committing himself. Pharma: A U.S. drug company, Eli Lilly, has just lost a major lawsuit it launched against the Canadian government and been ordered by a NAFTA tribunal to pay millions in court costs. A lawmaker urged Lighthizer to demand stronger patent protections, which have been repeatedly invalidated in Canada. He replied that intellectual property was a high priority. Wine: Asked about restricted access to Canadian grocery shelves, which has already prompted U.S. action, Lighthizer said he would address unfair barriers to U.S. exports. Dispute settlement: A lawmaker complained that the dispute settlement process in NAFTA’s Chapter 19 had been used to weaken punitive actions against the dumping of Canadian softwood lumber. Lighthizer said he would work with Congress and industry on Chapter 19. Supply management: Several lawmakers have asked about Canadian controls over dairy and poultry imports. Lighthizer promised, without getting specific, to enhance export opportunities. Before opening NAFTA talks, the Trump administration must consult with Congress for at least 90 days. The president has said he’s eager to start. Donald Trump wants to turn to an economic agenda of tax cuts and trade, after a bruising few weeks marked by scraps over health care, Russian hacking, and partisan delays to nominations like Lighthizer’s. It’s unclear whether the White House can even start the 90-day NAFTA consultation without Lighthizer in place. It’s his legal role to consult with Congress. But his nomination is being held up in a round of intra-party horse-trading that could take weeks to resolve. The finance committee chair said Tuesday he could start NAFTA now: “We’re ready to roll,” Orrin Hatch said. He added, however, that it would be easier if Lighthizer was in place: “It’s gonna be hard to do it without him.” Hatch is tied up with other issues. He’s among the senators considering the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and said, “That’s where my mind is right now.” He would also have a role in health-care reform, if a controversial health bill gets approved by the House of Representatives. He’s got issues with the health bill: “The whole thing gives me heartburn,” he joked. A nail-biter of a vote is coming up in the U.S. capital on Thursday, with potential consequences on the Trump agenda. It appears votes for health reform might fall short, and the president made a trip to Capitol Hill to plead his case Tuesday. Donald Trump has warned lawmakers that if health reforms fall apart, that could affect tax and trade reforms. In a closed-door speech to Republicans, he personally singled out some of the conservatives threatening to stall the health bill. Trump made a joke that some interpreted as a threat — to launch 2018 primaries against lawmakers who block him. Some were unswayed. “I have a conservative district,” said Walter Jones of North Carolina. “My calls (from constituents) are running 10 to 1 against this bill.” In a few weeks, lawmakers could get their chance to confirm Lighthizer with a short-term spending bill up for review. It appears destined to become an omnibus negotiation. A West Virginia Democrat hopes to advance a personal priority — a bill involving coal miners’ pensions. Lighthizer is a bargaining chit. “I have nothing personally (against him) whatsoever,” said Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat. “Bottom line is — he’s the only vehicle I have (to get a pension deal).” Read more about: Donald Trump, United States Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The Suburban was located a short time later by police who arrested the driver on an outstanding warrant. Police searched the vehicle and found three knives, a loaded Winchester rifle, an unloaded SKS rifle, a prohibited SKS magazine and several rounds of ammunition. The male driver of the Suburban has been charged with 12 firearms-related offences and breach of recognizance. The female passenger of the vehicle is facing eight firearms-related charges and breach of recognizance.

An Amber alert has been issued in Tennessee and Alabama for missing teen who was last seen at a Shoney’s restaurant on the morning of March 13, the day she disappeared. She’s believed to have been kidnapped by her high school teacher, Tad Cummins, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is asking for the public’s help in finding Cummins and the missing Tennessee girl. A warrant has been issued for his arrest on charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor New video surveillance shows Cummins shopping for women’s dark brown hair dye at a Tennessee Walmart days before the alleged kidnapping. Daily Mail reports that Elizabeth had also changed her Instagram profile to “wife” with a ring emoji. TBI has determined, however, that the hair dye purchase “was not part” of the kidnapping. Nevertheless, Elizabeth’s family is shaken up by the footage. Cummins, 50, was seen gassing up his car at a local gas station near Shoney’s on the morning of Elizabeth Thomas’ disappearance. He was driving a Silver Nissan Rogue with a Tennessee license plate 976ZPT. He’s believed to be “armed and dangerous.” Tennessee student’s family shaken by video of alleged kidnapper shopping for hair dye days before abduction https://t.co/fjGGViaP5e pic.twitter.com/W0Ho6ww263 — People Magazine (@people) March 21, 2017 Tad Cummins was a teacher at Culleoka High School in Columbia, Tennessee and was suspended in February by the Maury County School District after a witness saw him kissing Elizabeth in his classroom in January. It wasn’t until a few weeks ago that he was fired. When the student who witnessed Cummins kiss Thomas, he said he was helping with issues at home and that they were best friends. Elizabeth Thomas is said to have a good relationship with her father, who got sole custody of her in 2015. Elizabeth Thomas is still missing. Please RT till she is found. #TNAMBERAlert @MissingKids pic.twitter.com/s5myVCE6EN — Spring Hill Police (@springhillpdtn) March 20, 2017 Thomas family attorney, Jason Whatley, told People magazine that Cummins is a “predator” and was grooming Elizabeth by creating vulnerability in her. He also revealed that Elizabeth told one of her siblings that if she wasn’t back by 6 p.m. on the day she went missing to call police. In other clues into the kidnapping, Cummins took out a $4,500 loan days before Thomas went missing. The teen also referred to a “mission” on social media before her disappearance and posted quotes about love. Whatley has no doubts that the teacher had the alleged kidnapping well planned out in advance. In earlier reports, it was noted that he watched survivalist shows and that might be one reason it’s been hard for law enforcement to track him down. They’re urging the public to look for the missing teen and her abductor in recreational areas, parks, garages, and other isolated areas. Cummins’ wife, Jill, gave a statement on Saturday pleading with her husband to return and bring Elizabeth back safely. “Tad this is not you. This is not who you are. We can help you get through this,” Jill said. “No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you and he wants you to come home. Your family wants their poppy back. Please do the right thing, and turn yourself into the police and bring Beth home.” Authorities say that it’s “entirely likely” that Elizabeth Thomas doesn’t see herself as a victim and went with Cummins willingly. She’s known the teacher for two years. Elizabeth was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. She’s 5-feet-5-inches-tall and weighs 120 pounds. She has blonde hair and hazel eyes. Cummins is 6-feet-tall and weighs 200 pounds with brown hair and eyes. If anyone sees Elizabeth Thomas or Tad Cummins, they’re asked to call the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.

The bad news: by the time they’re built we’ll probably need another 70. At the moment there are long-term care people in Cariboo Memorial Hospital because there is nowhere else for them to be. CMH isn’t geared for long-term care. Its beds are intended for and needed by acute care patients. The shortage of long-term facilities really is unfortunate for everyone involved. As someone who could end up in “care” any day, I’m glad the new place will be on the Cariboo Lodge site. Some younger people of my acquaintance believe it would be better up by Walmart — more to see, more to do. My response is I’ve been young once but they haven’t been old. For us oldies, the current downtown is our comfort zone. When they are old, ‘up there’ might be their comfort zone. *** Atlantic Power has been under fire for wanting to burn railway ties, but what about the Ministry of Environment standards. Are they strong enough? And most of us have noticed the increased hydro rates, but is anyone paying attention to who produces our electricity? Supporters of the independent power producers (IPPs) say we’re getting good service from them. They diversify our electricity grid, provide economic benefits (jobs and taxes) especially in the 250 area code areas. Can’t argue with that, but some IPPs are getting paid for power even when they aren’t producing any because of oversupply. Could it be that BC Hydro has over-estimated the province’s power needs? B.C. will pay $58 billion to buy electricity from wind, small-scale hydroelectric,run-of -the river, solar, tidal , biomass and other power projects over the next 55 years. According to Auditor General Carol Bellringer, BC Hydro’s deals with the IPPs make up more than half of the $102 billion the province has promised to pay for goods and services. With these long- term, locked-in contracts with IPPs, and at a time when technology is finding ways to produce cheaper electricity, why do we need Site C? Just asking. *** The sun shone on the first day of spring. Is that a good omen? Diana French is a freelance columnist, former Tribune editor, retired teacher, historian, and book author.

Ernest Pattee has been charged with obstructing a peace officer, bail jumping, criminal endangerment, resisting arrest and revocation of a suspended sentence. He is currently being held in the Flathead County Detention Center. According to the Kalispell Police Department, law enforcement received a report of a suspicious vehicle in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Responding officers located the vehicle, which had been reported stolen the previous day, and found a male and female inside. Officers asked the couple to step out of the vehicle but they initially refused. The female eventually got out but Pattee still refused to exit. After repeatedly asking Pattee to exit the vehicle, an officer broke a window but before they were able to get hold of the man, Pattee started the truck and drove off. Kalispell officers followed the vehicle throughout the Kalispell area before being joined by deputies from the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office. Law enforcement followed Pattee to Von Der Heide Lane near Kila where he ditched the vehicle and ran on foot. The vehicle soon burst into flames, with the fire located in the engine compartment. The SWAT team and Two Bear Helicopter were deployed to aid in the search for Pattee who was found two hours later in a creek. He was placed under arrest and treated for hypothermia.

Amazon Sellers Face Nearly $2 Billion In Missed Taxes By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 03/21/17 AT 6:22 PM Close Amazon.com’s third-party sales doubled in 2016, but many of those sellers, who use the online retailer’s Fulfillment by Amazon service, may be liable for $1.9 billion in missed sales tax payments in 2016 as a result of Amazon’s growing inventory storage infrastructure. By moving third-party sellers’ inventories from state to state—including 18 states where storage at a fulfillment center makes the product’s originator liable for sales tax—without “clear notice,” the Seattle-based e-commerce giant left them obligated to pay taxes on sales in those states, according to a report from the investigation and analysis service Capitol Forum. Sellers whose items were stored in those 18 states also owed the states sales taxes even if their products were later sold on non-Amazon websites, the Capitol Forum found. Read: eBay Takes on Amazon Prime, Walmart With Three-Day Guaranteed Delivery Sales by Amazon itself became liable for state sales taxes about four and a half years ago. As of Tuesday, the company paid sales taxes on items shipped to 42 states and was poised to add Idaho and Hawaii to the list in April. But for sales taxes resulting from the Fulfillment by Amazon program, the e-commerce giant places responsibility on its third-party sellers’ shoulders. (Tax advisory sites like TaxJar and Avalara offer guides to keep sellers from getting slammed with sales taxes they may have missed.) But third-party sellers’ goods are located, on average, in close to seven fulfillment centers within their first month as a Fulfilled by Amazon seller, and in 15 centers by the end of their first year, according to a study by the online sales news site PracticalEcommerce. California, Texas and Florida lost the most in foregone sales taxes, with missing sales tax revenues of $431 million, $264 million and $186 million, respectively, according to the Capitol Forum report, which used company data and sales tax compliance census information. Among 5,000 of the top sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon, the sales tax compliance rate for cases in which products were stored in fulfillment centers and sold in the same state was just 5.5 percent. Read: Homelessness In Los Angeles 2017: Residents Vote On Sales Tax Increase To Fund Millions In Better Services The Amazon’s use of fulfillment centers has grown in recent years, winning the company hundreds of millions in tax subsidies that come from the establishment of stock warehouses, and the company stood poised to beat Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in terms of total state and local subsidies awarded, Bloomberg reported Monday. The e-commerce behemoth also won $92 million in tax credits for setting up fulfillment centers over a period of just three months, the business news site found, citing research from the advocacy group Good Jobs First. “Amazon is a juggernaut in terms of tax breaks,” Good Jobs First Executive Director Greg LeRoy told Bloomberg. “They were pulling down $125 million annually for at least two years and they are on pace for that in 2017, given the deals we’ve seen already for the year. So it won’t be long before they surpass Wal-Mart.” Amazon did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The statement comes in an exchange of letters between the administration’s nominee for trade czar and the top congressional committee that handles trade, which is considering his nomination. Canada has one of the lowest allowances in the developed world for online duty-free shopping — Canadian consumers are allowed to purchase $20 worth of goods online from Amazon, eBay or other retailers before duties kick in, compared to $800 in the U.S. Trade nominee Bob Lighthizer was asked about that by a member of the Senate finance committee, which is one of the congressional bodies that by law must be consulted before, during, and after the U.S. holds trade negotiations. He received written questions about wine, dairy, softwood lumber and pharmaceuticals, in addition to oral questions and answers at a public hearing this month where lawmakers made it clear they want important changes in NAFTA. In his written responses, he said the duty-free level, known as “de minimis,” would be an issue. “I believe that increasing Canada’s de minimis level could be a significant issue in our overall bilateral trade engagement with Canada, as well as in our engagement with Canada in multilateral trade forums,” Lighthizer wrote back, in a 124-page exchange of letters obtained by Inside U.S. Trade. “I will consult with Congress and domestic stakeholders to develop a strategy that seeks to address concerns with Canada’s low de minimis level.” MORE: Trump on NAFTA renegotiation: ‘That’s gonna be an easy one’ That debate has also begun in Canada. It’s pitted online retailers against the lobby group for bricks-and-mortar stores, the Retail Council of Canada which represents 45,000 stores including some giants like Walmart, Best Buy and Lowe’s. Lighthizer dropped hints on other priorities, without committing himself. — Pharma: A U.S. drug company, Eli Lilly, has just lost a major lawsuit it launched against the Canadian government and been ordered by a NAFTA tribunal to pay millions in court costs. A lawmaker urged Lighthizer to demand stronger patent protections, which have been repeatedly invalidated in Canada. He replied that intellectual property was a high priority. Wine: Asked about restricted access to Canadian grocery shelves, which has already prompted U.S. action, Lighthizer said he would address unfair barriers to U.S. exports. Dispute settlement: A lawmaker complained that the dispute settlement process in NAFTA’s Chapter 19 had been used to weaken punitive actions against the dumping of Canadian softwood lumber. Lighthizer said he would work with Congress and industry on Chapter 19. Supply management: Several lawmakers have asked about Canadian controls over dairy and poultry imports. Lighthizer promised, without getting specific, to enhance export opportunities. Before opening NAFTA talks, the Trump administration must consult with Congress for at least 90 days. The president has said he’s eager to start. Donald Trump wants to turn to an economic agenda of tax cuts and trade, after a bruising few weeks marked by scraps over health care, Russian hacking, and partisan delays to nominations like Lighthizer’s. It’s unclear whether the White House can even start the 90-day NAFTA consultation without Lighthizer in place. It’s his legal role to consult with Congress. But his nomination is being held up in a round of intra-party horse-trading that could take weeks to resolve. The finance committee chair said Tuesday he could start NAFTA now: “We’re ready to roll,” Orrin Hatch said. He added, however, that it would be easier if Lighthizer was in place: ”It’s gonna be hard to do it without him.” Hatch is tied up with other issues. He’s among the senators considering the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and said, “That’s where my mind is right now.” He would also have a role in health-care reform, if a controversial health bill gets approved by the House of Representatives. MORE: Why Canada—and its economy—has plenty to fear from Trump He’s got issues with the health bill: ”The whole thing gives me heartburn,” he joked. A nailbiter of a vote is coming up in the U.S. capital on Thursday, with potential consequences on the Trump agenda. It appears votes for health reform might fall short, and the president made a trip to Capitol Hill to plead his case Tuesday. Donald Trump has warned lawmakers that if health reforms fall apart, that could affect tax and trade reforms. In a closed-door speech to Republicans, he personally singled out some of the conservatives threatening to stall the health bill. Trump made a joke that some interpreted as a threat — to launch 2018 primaries against lawmakers who block him. Some were unswayed. ”I have a conservative district,” said Walter Jones of North Carolina. ”My calls (from constituents) are running 10 to 1 against this bill.” In a few weeks, lawmakers could get their chance to confirm Lighthizer with a short-term spending bill up for review. It appears destined to become an omnibus negotiation. A West Virginia Democrat hopes to advance a personal priority — a bill involving coal miners’ pensions. Lighthizer is a bargaining chit. ”I have nothing personally (against him) whatsoever,” said Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat. ”Bottom line is — he’s the only vehicle I have (to get a pension deal).” Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Filed under: Donald Trump NAFTA trade Advertisement Advertisement    Post navigation Previous The Canada150 Quiz Countdown trivia test: Day 51!

Jessica Hill/AP | Caption Loading... Weston Williams Staff | @westonwolf359 March 21, 2017 —It's been a banner year for women billionaires. At least, that's the message from Forbes' list of richest people in the world, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. According to the list, the number of women billionaires has increased to a record 227 women – up from 202 women from last year. Many of the new listees are "self-made" and joining the rankings for the first time, particularly new entrepreneurs from Asia. The women have made their fortunes on a range of ventures, some of which include smartphones, pizza, roofing, real estate, and fashion retail. But celebration could be a little premature – at least, as far as women in general are concerned. While the number of women billionaires has inched up, they still only make up 11 percent of the 2,043-person list. And while the number of successful super-wealthy businesswomen indicates some signs of progress, it does little to solve setbacks at a more basic economic level, such as equal pay between the sexes, says Charlice Hurst, a professor at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. "I don't find this increase terribly exciting," Dr. Hurst tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. "Self-made female billionaires now make up 2.7 percent of the list versus 2.3 percent last year. That doesn't seem like grounds for claiming systemic change, particularly not for women at all levels of the economic ladder and of all races and ethnicities." And there's another caveat to the Forbes list: Most of the wealthiest women in the world are not self-made businesswomen, but actually heiresses who rely on vast family wealth to maintain their spots on the billionaires list. For instance, France's Liliane Bettencourt, the wealthiest woman in the world with a net worth of $39.5 billion, is heir to the L'Oreal cosmetics fortune. Similarly, the No. 2 spot belongs to Alice Walton ($33.8 billion), the only daughter of Sam Walton, who founded Wal-Mart. What is your social class? Take our quiz to find out! The number of self-made women billionaires, however, is still on the rise, with a record 56 self-made women claiming a net worth in the billions, compared to 42 women last year. This was also the first year in the history of the list that these self-made billionaires broke a collective net worth of $100 billion, clocking in at an impressive $129.1 billion. But while that's great news for these particular women, Hurst doubts that their example will cause a dramatic or positive change for most working women. "It is well-known that income inequality has become severe – and is rising – in the United States," she says. "Even if more women are able to climb into the rarefied world of the super-rich, this will likely not positively impact the fortunes of the vast majority of women." A closer look at the Forbes list also reveals an uneven global representation. For instance, most of the new self-made women billionaires this year come from Asia. "The number of Asian women billionaires is increasing because the number of Asian billionaires is increasing, and because building wealth in Asia often is about family power – more so than in many parts of the world," Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, tells the Monitor in an email. "An Asian woman from a powerful family has a good chance of leveraging that power into a billion dollars, or of inheriting it. Family ties matter in the US and Europe, but not as much." But it's hardly a sign of "systematic chance in large corporations," Professor Gordon adds. According to the United Nations, women are paid an average of 23 percent less than men around the world. Some of that is because women are concentrated in different jobs than men, like teaching or health care, which often go underpaid in many parts of the world. But even for men and women in the same fields, women still tend to have lower pay than their male counterparts, partly because of gender bias, lack of equal pay legislation, and other factors, says Hurst.

Sign Up × Partly to blame, she adds, are women's disproportionate shares of parenting and household responsibilities, and workplaces "still mostly designed around the patterns and needs of traditional families." One potential remedy, she says: paid leave, and top-notch early childhood education. Programs like these "would enable women to maintain employment during their children's early years without losing as much wealth as they do when they have to take unpaid leave, slow down their careers, take jobs that are less well-paid but have more flexibility, or leave the workforce altogether."

GamboneFor the Star Crafty folks here in the High Desert have been at the heart of Kreative Klutter’s ever-expanding business since it opened in 2007. In fact, the store has grown so quickly, owner Debbie Ragains had to move her space in 2014 from the Village shopping area in Apple Valley to a 2,500-square-foot space located at 11938 Hesperia Road in Hesperia. Ragains said she not only carries the area’s largest collection of Tole painting supplies, but also a vast array of collectibles and other home decor items not found anywhere else in the area. “To my knowledge, nobody here in the High Desert carries the variety of things that I do,” said Ragains, a former postal carrier. “I have all kinds of gifts for everybody, from your aunt and uncle to your son and brother. I even started bringing in things for nurses and caregivers, which you normally wouldn’t find at your local Wal-Mart or Target.” Along with the items for sale at Kreative Klutter, the store also offers a variety of craft and Tole painting classes. Ragains said she is very excited to announce several new classes in both Tole painting and jewelry making. “There’s been a real high demand for the Tole painting classes,” said Ragains. “And we have quite a few days and times to choose from in order to accommodate people’s schedules. “The jewelry classes are brand new and we decided to offer them because we had so many requests. We are always listening to our customer’s feedback.” According to Ragains, classes range from $25 to $65 and supplies are included. “We have everything from stencils to brushes to pattern packs,” said Ragains. “We really are the area’s only one-stop shop for all your crafting needs.” Before opening Kreative Klutter, Ragains admits she never imagined she’d own her own craft store one day. She says she couldn’t be more grateful to her loyal clientele, who have done a terrific job of spreading the word about her business. “When I started, it was truly on a wing and a prayer,” said Ragains. “I had never owned my own store but I was always into Tole painting so I thought I would give it a try. When I think about being in business for 10 years already, I feel very blessed. Many stores in the area did not survive the recession, but Kreative Klutter has continued to grow.” Kreative Klutter is open 10 a.m to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and closed on Sunday.

Photo: Bob Joseph/WNBF News (file) Authorities say the theft of items from the store on Gannett Drive occurred around 12:30 a.m. on Sunday. Investigators say 26-year-old Daniel Santacroce and 25-year-old Chase Tiffany of Binghamton were charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, a felony. According to Johnson City police, the night manager reported the incident. He told officers he had seen two men pushing shopping carts loaded with merchandise out of the store without paying for the goods. The manager said he observed the men push the carts a short distance into the city of Binghamton and transfer the items into a sport utility vehicle. Binghamton police pulled over the suspect vehicle moments later on Clinton Street in the First Ward. Detectives say Santacroce and Tiffany were in the SUV, along with the stolen merchandise. Both men were ordered to appear in Johnson City village court on April 12. For breaking news and updates on developing stories, follow @BinghamtonNow on Twitter.

Witnesses said the fully-grown doe walked into the Lexington store Sunday night and was seen running in the pharmacy section of the store before ending up in a back aisle. Shopper Rebecca Patterson said she and another shopper cornered the deer. "I don't think the manager really believed it at first, but he did take charge of the situation," Patterson told WLEX-TV. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officers responded to the store and photos show them holding the deer next to an aisle of kitchen supplies. The officers were able to safely release the uninjured deer back into the woods. "That's the most fun I have had at Walmart ever, but it was stressful," Patterson said. Walmart employees said there was no damage to the store or its merchandise during the incident.

That means making their product less a commodity and more a consumer friendly, ready-to-eat staple to provide more stable earnings, according to Leif Eriksrod, head of equities at Alfred Berg Kapitalforvaltning AS in Oslo. “There have been very good years, so it’s fully priced in the short horizon,” Eriksrod said in an interview at his office in Oslo on Friday. “We still like the sector but the levels are so high that we have to wait for the next rise to start.” Related Book: The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain’s Journey by Linda Greenlaw After surging 400 percent over the past five years, propelled by rising salmon demand and higher prices on a global market, the Oslo Seafood Index has slid 12 percent this year. Besides packaging and marketing, the companies are also bumping up against stalled production growth in Norway, the world’s largest exporter of salmon. But some of the bigger companies such as Marine Harvest ASA and Leroy Seafood ASA are already well on their way in reaching out more directly to consumers in the U.S. and Europe. Marine Harvest, part-owned by billionaire John Fredriksen, is making headway in the U.S. through Wal-Mart Inc., while Leroy is big in Europe and cracking into the German market, according to Alfred Berg. Keeping the smallest customers in mind, is also key, Eriksrod said. “If they find a bone in a fish they won’t eat fish for six months,” he said. “It’s important for them. Kids love salmon fillets as long as there aren’t any bones. That has a lot to say about the traction you can get in the market.” Eriksrod’s Alfred Berg Gambak has an average annual return of 19 percent in the past five years, which makes it the top-performing Norway equity fund, according to Morningstar. It has been overweight fish stocks while staying away from energy related stocks amid a plunge in oil prices. The bet against oil-related stocks has now been pared down to a more neutral position, snapping up “asset-light” companies and those with strong balance sheets, including Subsea 7 SA, Aker Solutions ASA and TGS-Nopec Geophysical Co. ASA Aker Solutions is also a good bet given the merger speculation swirling around the company. Its main owner, Aker ASA, has weighed a sale of the company, with recent reports naming Halliburton Co. as a potential buyer. “There are some companies that are missing the subsea division of Aker,” said Petter Tusvik, who helps oversee the funds with Eriksrod. “Halliburton was in the paper, but you could also see GE. We think there’s something in there.” Alfred Berg is betting again on the finance sector, with most banks now having met up to the stricter regulations and capital controls. “The banking sector is where it’s easiest to see some upside left,” said Eriksrod. “Because there’s relatively low pricing. And they have met their capital requirements. And dividends are going to increase.” ©2017 Bloomberg News Filed Under: finance Tagged With: commercial fishing, John Fredriksen gCaptain   Featured Ship Photos – 1,000 Vessels Through the Expanded Panama Canal Drillship Walkthrough: See What It’s Like Inside an Ultra-Deepwater Drill Rig [VIDEO] U.S. Shipyards Point Out Major Flaw in Trump’s 350-Ship Navy Plan   Video Drillship Walkthrough: See What It’s Like Inside an Ultra-Deepwater Drill Rig [VIDEO] WATCH: How To Find A Message In A Bottle At Sea WATCH: How To Pilot A Hovercraft   Latest News A Sea of Trouble Testing BP’s Mettle Draws $10 Billion ONGC Bet Maersk Reaches Key North Sea Tax Deal with Denmark Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale Yields $274 Million in High Bids   Subscribe Click HERE for gCaptain’s free daily newsletter.

The two allegedly used the bills to make small purchases at businesses such as Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Meijer, PetSmart, Staples and Walmart. Dajauvon Johneea Williams and Alen Marsalle Harris have been named in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court alleging they passed counterfeit U.S. currency, records showed. They made initial appearances before Magistrate Judge Phillip Green in Grand Rapids on Tuesday, March 21. Green ordered them locked up pending detention hearings. He granted requests by both for court-appointed attorneys. The investigation began on Feb. 12 when Family Fare workers reported two counterfeit $100 bills had been used to buy two boxes of chocolates. Surveillance video showed that the bills were passed at about the same time by two men who arrived and departed in a small gray car. Traverse City police Detective Matthew Verschaeve put out a broadcast to police to be on the lookout for the suspects, whose photos were shared from store surveillance cameras. Later that day, Grand Traverse County sheriff's Deputy Matt Holliday spotted a vehicle that fit the description outside of a Courtyard by Marriott hotel. The suspects were wearing clothes that appeared identical to those worn by the alleged counterfeiters. He and Verschaeve, who showed up as one of the men started to walk away, arrested Harris and Williams, David Dobb, a special agent for the U.S. Secret Service, wrote in the complaint. He said Williams possessed $2,809 in legitimate currency. Police looked inside a 2016 gray Nissan Versa - Harris had the keys - and saw two boxes of chocolates. Police also saw what appeared to be a large amount of $100 bills in the driver-side door pocket. Police had the car towed and obtained a search warrant. The 51 bills found in the door pocket were counterfeit, police said. They also found a counterfeit detection pen. "I have examined a sample of the $100 (Federal Reserve Notes) recovered in this matter; they appear at a glance to be genuine, but upon examination, I confirmed that they are counterfeit," Dobb said. Police also found receipts from Traverse City-area stores showing the two had made small purchases to obtain change in legitimate cash, Dobb said. During police interviews, Harris said he knew the bills were counterfeit and that Williams paid him to make the trip. Williams also admitted to passing counterfeit bills but said Harris was more culpable, Dobb said.

If you live outside San Juan, why not take the train to the parade? Metrolink or Amtrak. The downtown is easily walkable. Free shuttle: Try parking at Fluidmaster, 30800 Rancho Viejo Road, or at Capistrano Business Plaza, 30240 Rancho Viejo Road taking a free shuttle to downtown between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on parade day. SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO – Swallows have begun to arrive in the Capistrano Valley on their annual spring fling. For humans, that means it’s party time. Mission San Juan Capistrano opened the week’s festivities with its annual celebration of St. Joseph’s Day on March 19. Legend has it that is the day that tiny migratory birds are supposed to arrive at the mission after flying in from Argentina. Other Fiesta de las Golondrinas (Swallows festival) events will take place on Friday, March 24 and on Saturday, March 25, including the Swallow’s Day Parade. An estimated 3,500 people were on hand to celebrate a Sunday of music, dance, native cultural demos, children’s activities and swallows education. “It was reported to me that folks saw swallows,” said Mechelle Lawrence Adams, executive director at the mission. She didn’t personally, she said, but one of the mission’s docents reported having occupied swallows nests at her home, as did a board member with the fiesta association. In San Clemente, shoppers at Walmart reported seeing swallows reoccupying nests there. The mission has installed plaster nests to offer birds a ready-made home and encourage bigger numbers. Dr. Charles Brown, a swallows expert and professor of biological sciences at the University of Tulsa, is assisting in the experiment. Lawrence Adams said she hopes businesses around San Juan Capistrano will do likewise and help repopulate the town known for its swallows. There are no set dates or places for swallows to arrive, but generally they are said to nest through the summer, departing in October to fly south for the South American spring. Mark Bodenhamer, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, said one place to look for swallows near downtown is the El Horno Street undercrossing of I-5, especially in early morning or evening. “You’ve just got to look up,” he said. “They kind of zig zag.” Other places, he said, include San Juan Creek past San Juan Hills Golf Club and San Juan’s northwest open space near the dog park. “There should be tons of them,” Bodenhamer said. The birds use mud to make their nests, he said, and the last few years have been a drought, but not this year. “With all of the rains,” he said, “we actually have lots of mud.” Some human activities this week: Frog jumping contest: 4 p.m. Friday, March 24, at Mission Grill, featuring music, frogs and prizes. Just stop by. Hoos’ Gow Day: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday, March 24, in downtown San Juan, where friendly deputies in traditional western attire will seek out city slickers not dressed for the occasion and maybe, just maybe, dress them up with a noose or send them to “jail,” where bail is the purchase of a Fiesta Association souvenir, with proceeds benefiting the Swallows Day Parade. Swallows Day Parade: 11 a.m. Saturday, March 25 - The Fiesta de las Golondrinas Parade is said to be one of the biggest non-motorized parades in the USA. Bring your camera. The Juaneno Band of Mission Indians, Acjachemen Nation, will introduce the parade with tribal prayers at 10:30 a.m. at El Camino Real and Ortega Highway, also performing at other locations along the route. The Mercado: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, Saturday, March 25 - The Mercado Street Faire in Historic Town Center Park, with live music, vendors, a play zone for children and presentation of awards after the parade. Musical mission: After the March 25 parade, Mariachi Nuevo Capistrano, winner of the 2016 Battle of the Mariachis Festival, will perform from 2-3 p.m. in the mission’s front courtyard.

Magazine 21 Mar 2017 at 15:44 ET                    Donald Trump removes his hat to show that his hair is real during a political rally at Ladd-Peebles Stadium on August 21, 2015 in Mobile, Alabama (AFP Photo/Mark Wallheiser) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory The little town of Marks, Mississippi, had a moment in the spotlight when Martin Luther King Jr. launched the Poor People’s Campaign from there in 1968. The story of what happened next tells us a lot about the stubbornness of poverty in America—and how the federal government’s anti-poverty programs get results. It also shows why Americans must refuse to accept the Trump administration’s proposed budget, which eliminates many of these programs. After the Poor People’s Campaign was over, poverty hung on for decades in Marks, where investment dollars are almost nonexistent. Life went on without things most Americans take for granted. For example, despite being surrounded by farmland, Marks residents had to drive 20 miles to the nearest Wal-Mart just to get fresh vegetables. But Shreveport Federal Credit Union changed all that by organizing local farmers into a worker-owned cooperative, renovating a building, and creating what became the Delta Muletrain Farmers Market. The place was off-season but still bustling when I visited in November 2015. This work was done by a tiny credit union based in Shreveport, Louisiana, with crucial help from the federal government. Over the past 10 years, the credit union has received $4.5 million from a little-known program that supports Community Development Financial Institutions. The idea is to reward lenders who do the not-very-profitable work of investing in low-income America. The Trump budget proposes not just cutting the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, but eliminating it entirely. Today, there are 1,075 CDFIs across the United States, concentrated in the places where Americans are struggling, places where a campaigning Trump made promises in exchange for votes. “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” he said in his inauguration speech. But on Wednesday, the administration took a different one. “There’s a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence, and that’s where we zeroed in,” budget director Mick Mulvaney said. Other agencies listed for elimination include the Appalachian Regional Commission, begun in 1960, and the Delta Regional Authority, in 1990. These organizations aren’t the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or the National Endowment for the Arts, so they aren’t part of the national outrage on news shows and social media. But they are tested and proven winners when it comes to the challenging task of bringing wealth to neglected corners of the United States. The Appalachian Regional Commission estimates that its programs have created or retained almost 24,000 jobs in that troubled region, while the Delta Regional Authority’s corresponding figure is 17,000 jobs. To maximize the efficiency with which they spend taxpayer dollars, both agencies focus on seeding investment, rather than making grants, to help private businesses get started. They also support democratic decision-making, by involving local residents in the investments they make. When you put it all together, these and other cuts in the proposed budget represent an abandonment of America’s hardest-hit areas. They would vaporize the government’s most successful work to date in supporting an economy that works for everybody. Thomas Hanna, who researches economic development at the nonprofit Democracy Collaborative, is deeply concerned. He anticipates that the Trump administration, if it’s successful in cutting these agencies, will move to replace them with programs that benefit private developers. Those developers would then build infrastructure projects for profit, like new highways with expensive tolls. “For regions such as Appalachia and the Delta, which are already suffering economically, such an infrastructure plan is likely to significantly add to the people’s woes, rather than alleviate them.” Some predict these cuts are unlikely to get past Congress. Something similar happened in 2013, when President Barack Obama tried to privatize the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal agency that provides affordable electricity and other resources to a broad swath of the South. Republican legislators from the area fought the proposal tooth and nail, and saved the agency. Today, the ball is back in representatives’ court again. If we’re lucky, elected officials whose constituents benefit from these programs will fight for them this time, too. The forgotten men and women of our country are depending on them. Here are the 19 agencies that Trump wants to eliminate: The African Development Foundation The Appalachian Regional Commission The Chemical Safety Board The Corporation for National and Community Service The Corporation for Public Broadcasting The Delta Regional Authority The Denali Commission The Institute of Museum and Library Services The Inter-American Foundation The U.S. Trade and Development Agency The Legal Services Corporation The National Endowment for the Arts The National Endowment for the Humanities The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation The Northern Border Regional Commission The Overseas Private Investment Corporation The United States Institute of Peace The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars   James Trimarco wrote this article for YES!

The seventh child - a baby boy - was rescued from a freezing lake by a 'hero' paramedic less than an hour after the house fire . The kids' dad, Justin Campbell, had been allegedly shot and killed at the property before it was set ablaze in the early hours of the morning. At the time, the six older children, aged between four and 14, were still inside the home, according to police and local media. Fortunately, the youngsters managed to flee the fire, with some sprinting to a nearby Wal-Mart to call the emergency services. Mum-of-seven Cristy Campbell's body was recovered from the lake in Illinois, US, on Thursday morning (Photo: Illinois State Police) Firefighters later discovered the body of their 37-year-old father inside the property. He had been shot in the head, Fox 2 Now reports. Officials were alerted to the horror blaze at the family's home in Glen Carbon, Illinois, US, at around 5.15am last Thursday. Twenty five minutes earlier, surveillance video allegedly captured an SUV's headlights switching on in the property's driveway.

Within three minutes of it leaving, there were visible flames inside the blazing home, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch . At around 5.30am, authorities received a report that a vehicle had driven into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away. The Campbells' children, some circled, were filmed fleeing to a nearby Wal-Mart to call the emergency services (Photo: Handout) It is alleged that the children's mum, Cristy Campbell, 32, crashed her SUV into the water. Her body was later pulled from the lake. A gun was reportedly found in her vehicle. Cristy's three-month-old baby son survived after a paramedic risked his own life to jump into the lake and rescue the infant. Todd Zobrist spotted the headlights of the submerged SUV and instinctively knew there must be someone inside. Read More Baby on the bus murder trial told 'mum calmly sat texting while medics tried to save her child' After realising he didn't have time to wait for the emergency responders to arrive, he stripped off his shirt, socks and boots. He then leaped into the below-freezing water, swimming 75 feet to the car. Looking inside the vehicle, Todd saw something in the back seat which he initially thought was a doll, but turned out to be the baby boy. The "lifeless" child, born in December, was reportedly "floating" in the vehicle, with just six to eight inches of airspace. Paramedic Todd Zobrist bravely rescued the youngest child - a baby boy - from the freezing lake (Photo: Facebook) Todd, who is now being hailed a hero, performed CPR on the baby on the roof of the vehicle until he coughed up water. He then swam back to shore with one arm, carrying the boy in the other. "When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, 'This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble," Todd said at a news conference Friday. "At that point, though, I was committed. "I was already wet, I was already cold." He told People : “I don’t know how much longer that baby could have been floating on top of that water before he no longer could have been revived." The paramedic, who works for the Highland Fire Department, has two sons of his own. He was taken to hospital to be treated for hypothermia but insisted he wasn't a hero, saying "It was just right place, right time." He was helped in his rescue mission by 35-year-old paramedic, Ty Barr. The baby boy is expected to make a full recovery. His six older siblings were not physically harmed in the house blaze.

Their mum's body was found in the lake at around 11.15am. She is thought to have died from 'environmental exposure and drowning', ABC reports . Cristy and Justin were formerly husband and wife. Although they divorced four years ago, they were apparently still living together at the time of their deaths. Online posts suggest Justin was the baby boy's father. It is reported that the ex-spouses had a tumultuous marriage. According to Fox 2 Now, their deaths appear to be a 'murder-suicide', although this remains unconfirmed by officials. Their children are now in the care of extended family members. An investigation is ongoing.

News Public Safety Suspect in East County armed robberies turns self in for arrest robbery suspect Crime Stoppers This man is suspected of threatening an employee with a hatchet and shooting others with a pellet gun in three East County robberies. This man is suspected of threatening an employee with a hatchet and shooting others with a pellet gun in three East County robberies. (Crime Stoppers) Lyndsay WinkleyContact Reporter Hours after sheriff’s investigators on Tuesday released photos of a man suspected of robbing East County businesses, a man turned himself in as the suspect in the case, authorities said. Randall Lee, 22, of Lakeside, went to the Santee sheriff’s station to surrender about 3 p.m., Sgt. William Amavisca said. Lee was booked on charges of robbery, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and brandishing a replica gun. Investigators say he threatened an employee with a hatchet and shot others with a pellet rifle. The crimes were committed on Feb. 28 and March 12. The February robbery was committed at the Best Buy on Fletcher Parkway in La Mesa about 12:40 p.m. The robber tried to shoplift a camera. Officials said when he was confronted by a loss prevention officer, he said, “Want to get hit with a hatchet?” He then fled the store and sped away in a brown, four-door Buick, witnesses told officers. The March robberies occurred hours apart at two Walmart stores. In the first, the man took several items from the store on Camino Canada in the Lakeside area shortly after midnight, officials said. As he left, he pointed what appeared to be a black handgun at a manager and said, “Do you want to do this the hard way or the easy way?” He fired the weapon, which turned out to be a pellet gun, at the manager as he ran from the store. He was seen driving off in an older, silver, Buick-type vehicle. Later that night, about 11 p.m., he walked into a store on Town Center Parkway in Santee. When an assistant manager confronted him, he took out a pellet gun and fired multiple times. The pellets missed the manager, but hit another employee in the shoulder. The thief was seen fleeing in a brown sedan, but left behind a wallet that was apparently stolen. Cards from the wallet were later used at three businesses in San Diego, officials said. Authorities released the details to the media on Tuesday morning and asked that anyone with information call investigators or Crime Stoppers. After making the arrest, sheriff’s officials issued a statement thanking the public and media for assistance in the case.

McIntyre March 21, 2017 6:15 am EDT Print Email Tweet Retailer shares have been unable to fully stabilize after sell-offs that accompanied their earnings for the 2016 holiday period. Some retailers shuttered stores. Others gave pessimistic guidance. The slide began in earnest again, as retail stocks got punished on Monday. Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS), Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M), Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) and Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWM) were among the largest losers in the S&P 500. The drop came as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced it would open a retail operation in Silicon Valley to ponder its future. No other retailer has a project that rivals this in scope of ambition. Additionally, the drops came just days after J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) closed 138 stores. Shares in the ancient retailer dropped to a 52-week low of $5.77, down 30% so far this year. The concern about these retailers has turned from store count and revenue attrition to balance sheets. J.C. Penney has $4.5 billion in long-term debt. Granted, some is not due for a decade, but the concern is that the retailer will not exist to make the principle payments. And several hundred million of the J.C. Penney obligations must be paid between now and the end of 2020. Next year, $265 million in senior notes come due, for example. As a description of what has gone wrong in the industry, Bespoke’s experts wrote: Finally, we would note that what is going on right now in retail is a fantastic example of Schumpeter’s “creative destruction.” In pursuit of profits, the new model of online commerce is winning because it’s flat-out more efficient. As it succeeds, the older, less efficient ways of selling goods to consumers are losing market share and crumbling. Over time, it’s this iterative process across industries that drives productivity, the ultimate source of higher standards of living. In a period when aggregate output per worker hour (labor productivity) has been cratering, we think the retail industry is a great example that there’s more going on beneath the surface than the headline labor productivity stats alone. In other words, the industry is not only in great trouble, so are a number of people who work in it. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Lewandowski’s firm signs new clients By Theodoric Meyer 03/21/17 02:00 PM EDT With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver LEWANDOWSKI’S FIRM SIGNS MORE CLIENTS: Avenue Strategies, the lobbying firm started last year by Donald Trump’s ousted first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and Barry Bennett, has signed three more clients: Big Cat Rescue, Community Choice Financial Inc. and Red Horse Corporation. All three are represented by Jason Osborne, another Trump campaign veteran who recently joined the firm. Osborne had previously represented Big Cat Rescue, a sanctuary for tigers and other big cats in Florida. He’ll lobby on “Treasury and financial regulations” for Community Choice Financial and “Status as Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern” for Red Horse. Story Continued Below FORMER TRUMP ADVISER EXPANDS FIRM: RightVoter, the consulting firm co-founded by Mike Biundo, a former senior adviser on Donald Trump’s campaign, is starting a new arm to help companies navigate Trump’s Washington. The new arm, 50/50 Strategic, is being managed by Derek Dufresne, a RightVoter partner. Biundo, a New Hampshire political operative who worked for Rand Paul’s and John Kasich’s presidential campaigns last year before signing on with Trump, worked Trump’s inaugural committee but declined an offer to join the White House. "There’s not a lot of people out there right now with good relationships across all agencies of the federal governments, as well as the current administration, so we’re definitely to bring that to the table,” Biundo said in a statement. JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK SIGNS ANOTHER LOBBYIST: Judicial Crisis Network, the conservative group spending millions to back Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation as the next Supreme Court justice, hired a second lobbyist last month to help with the effort, according to a new disclosure filing. The group has hired Martin Gold, a partner with Capitol Counsel, on Feb. 13. Judicial Crisis Network disclosed last week that it had brought on former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who’s now a lobbyist at Covington & Burling. It’s the first time the group has hired lobbyists to help with a Supreme Court confirmation. RETAILERS FLY IN TO FIGHT BORDER-ADJUSTMENT TAX: The fight over the GOP health care bill may be dominated Washington right now, but some of the country’s biggest retailers remain focused on derailing another priority of House Speaker Paul Ryan: the proposed border-adjustment tax. Members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association are flying in this week for meetings on the Hill, with a focus on Senate Republicans. They’ll include executives from 7-Eleven, Best Buy, DSW, Lowe’s, Meijer, Rite Aid, Target and Wal-Mart.

HOLLAND & KNIGHT POACHES STAVINSKY: Meital Stavinsky is heading to Holland & Knight, where she’ll be a partner and the co-chairwoman of the firm’s Israel practice. She was previously a founding member of Greenberg Traurig’s Israel practice. She’ll be based in Miami and Washington and will also be a member of Holland & Knight’s public policy and regulation practice. No word on whether her Greenberg Traurig lobbying clients — which include Netafirm USA, Mobileye Inc. and the Israeli-American Coalition for Action — will be following her to Holland & Knight. TRUMP TAPS SWONGER TO HEAD SENATE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS TEAM: “The White House is set to announce as early as Tuesday that it has appointed Amy Swonger, a longtime lobbyist, to head up its Senate legislative affairs team, a senior administration official confirmed on Monday,” The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Ballhaus reports. “Ms. Swonger, a former congressional aide who once worked for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has worked as a lobbyist at Heather Podesta + Partners since 2015, working on behalf of clients including Marathon Oil, Cigna Corp. and Swiss Reinsurance. In her previous post, at Ernst & Young, she lobbied on behalf of a number of health-care companies, including Aetna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.” Full story. — Swonger’s departure means that Heather Podesta + Partners is losing one of its most prominent Republicans at a time when the mostly Democratic firm is looking to add GOP firepower. Heather Podesta last month hired Sean Joyce, who had been chief of staff to Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). The firm’s other Republicans include Robert Hoffman, Annie Palisi and Kelli Ripp. ** A Message from WeWork: The way we work is changing.

Bush.” Full story. FORMER LOBBYIST QUITS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: “Taylor Hansen, a former lobbyist for the for-profit college industry, is no longer an adviser to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a department spokesman confirmed today,” POLITICO’s Michael Stratford reports. “‘Mr. Hansen has resigned from the beachhead team and is no longer an employee of the Department of Education,' Jim Bradshaw, a department spokesman, said in email. ‘He served ably and without conflict and decided his service had run its course. We’re grateful for his contributions and have no further comment at this time.’” — “Hansen’s resignation, which was made effective on Friday and first reported by Bloomberg, came amid criticism that his role at the department presented a conflict of interest. Hansen previously directed legislative and regulatory affairs at the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities (which is now called Career Education Colleges and Universities) for nearly three years and was also a Republican staffer on the House education committee.” Full story. MORE ADS: The Club for Growth is running TV ads urging 10 House Republicans, many of whom represent relatively moderate districts, to vote against the GOP health care bill this week. American Action Network, meanwhile, is out with new radio ads urging House Freedom Caucus members to support the bill. Watch the Club ad targeting Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) here. Listen to the American Action Network ad targeting Dave Brat (R-Va.) here. HOW IVANKA’S HANDLING HER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: POLITICO’s Annie Karni has the details: “‘The one thing I would like to be clear on: We don’t believe it eliminates conflicts in every way,’ [Jamie Gorelick, a lawyer for Ivanka Trump, told POLITICO]. ‘She has the conflicts that derive from the ownership of this brand. We’re trying to minimize those to the extent possible.’ Gorelick argued that the area is murky because outstanding contracts with third party vendors mean that Ivanka Trump cannot simply close her business — those vendors could continue using her brand. She also can’t sell the business, her attorney argued, because the buyer would have the right to license her name and potentially create other ethical issues.” — “Instead, Trump will be distancing herself, as much as possible, from the day-to-day operations of the Ivanka Trump brand and convey her interests to a trust. The trust, Gorelick said, will be controlled by her brother-in-law, Josh Kushner, and her sister-in-law, Nicole Meyer, who will be prohibited from entering the brand into any agreements with foreign countries or agencies.” Full story. READ THE LATEST FROM CGCN: From a memo the firm sent to clients this morning: “If the president wins Thursday, there will still be plenty of drama over in the Senate, where his detractors seem far more committed to blocking his signature bills (though Leader McConnell seems to get the Republican Conference unified time and time again). But a win in the House would still send a powerful message that Trump can override the concerns of many in his party, dramatically improving the prospects for tax reform, an infrastructure bill and just about any other big-ticket item that seemingly face Republican resistance.” Here’s the full memo. AN FTTH BY ANY OTHER NAME: FTTH Council Americas, which describes itself as the “only association for ultra high-speed broadband,” has rebranded as the Fiber Broadband Association. MEANWHILE, IN CHICAGO: Chicago “Mayor Rahm Emanuel's personal email accounts have served as a private avenue of influence where executives and investors sought favorable action from City Hall, raising questions about whether some of the messages crossed the line into lobbying and violated the city's ethics law, the Chicago Tribune has found,” The Chicago Tribune’s Bill Ruthhart and Hal Dardick report. Email released the emails late last year under pressure from open-records lawsuits. “Woven throughout the 2,696 pages of emails are another possible 26 instances where lobbyists, corporate executives and longtime Emanuel associates and campaign donors sought action from — or access to — the mayor or city officials but did not register as a lobbyist or report their contact to the ethics board, the Tribune has found.” Full story. JOB MOVES: — Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group backed by Michael Bloomberg, is adding George Holman as congressional relations director. He previously spent more than a decade working for former Sen. Harry Reid, most recently as a senior policy adviser. — “Harold Hancock, the top tax counsel to the House Ways & Means Committee, has joined law and lobby firm McGuireWoods,” The Hill’s Megan Wilson reports. — America’s Health Insurance Plans has hired Adam Beck as vice president for employer health policy and initiatives. He was previously an assistant professor of health insurance at the American College of Financial Services and is also a veteran of both Obama campaigns. — Noah Walker is joining the Moak Group as a communications strategist.

UPS tests delivery drone from atop package car Now, no one panic! This isn’t the beginning of an ode to that 1971 classic movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the oddest of its characters, the Oompa-Loompas. No, “Oompa-Loompa” imagery in this case is being used by David Ross, managing director of the transportation & logistics research group at Stifel Capital Markets, to highlight the importance of the “little things” going on in the trucking industry these days. [And let it be known that Mr. Ross is becoming quite the comedian in freight transportation circles of late, following the popularity of the truck jokes he made at the expense of YRC Freight.] In actuality, though these “little things” actually contain a lot of big ramifications for motor carriers large and small, such as: whether self-driving trucks will be deployed before self-driving cars; whether the current activity by the Teamsters indicates a revival of union fortunes in trucking or not; the ongoing trend towards more consolidation in freight transportation; and whether the recent uptick in truck equipment orders is indicative of an industry on the rebound. [By the by, I’ll admit I got more than a little wigged out when I first saw these orange creatures with the green hairdos parading across my television screen, let me tell you.] That’s a lot to digest, so let’s provide a few highlights. A glimpse inside LTL segment dynamics: While most readers of this blog are not operating in the LTL space, Ross provided some very interesting analysis in terms of how to determine if market conditions are helping or hurting the bottom line of LTL operators. Here are a few: Average length of haul (LOH): an increase in average length of haul increases revenue per hundredweight, as more compensation is required for the longer distance traveled. Not all of the LTL carriers disclose their LOH numbers, but among those that do, Ross said the average year-over-year increase is about 1.4%. That’s a good sign for freight. Average weight per shipment: Here’s an ironic twist to this metric; a decrease in average weight per shipment tends to increase average revenue per hundredweight (that’s a good thing) as heavier shipments typically fall into lower freight classes. Of the publicly-traded LTL carriers Stifel tracks, weight per shipment decreased, on average, 1.9% year-over-year last year in the third quarter. So the trend line is good there as well. Average freight commodity class: Essentially, greater freight density means lower average classification, and thus results in a lower-billed-revenue per hundredweight figure. Yet since LTL carriers do not report this metric, it can be hard to calculate, Ross noted. He assumes it’s been flat of late; however, a shipper classification known as “FAK” or “Freight All Kinds” can skew that data and impact revenues and profits. “For example, the parties might agree to an FAK of 77.5, but if the carrier were to monitor what is being shipped, it may find the average to be closer to 100 or even 150, which would mean the carrier is getting underpaid,” he stressed. Do LTL carriers make or lose money on fuel surcharges? Again, while Ross addressed this from an LTL perspective, it’s interesting food for thought for all trucking companies. As for LTLs and fuel, Ross explained that the better the density (which means when fuel prices are rising) the more money they can make on fuel surcharges. "The better the fuel economy of their equipment, the more money they make by saving on fuel expenses," he added. "The better their purchasing, the more money they make on fuel. The fewer “fuel caps” they have in contract, the more money they make on fuel. The fewer alternative surcharge tables (for example, Walmart has its own fuel surcharge tables the carriers use) the more money they make on fuel. The more favorable their regional fuel costs versus national highway diesel average, the more money they make on fuel." Popular Now FMCSA to withdraw safety fitness rule Transfix launches fully digital job booking system for carriers WABCO opens new U.S. air brake manufacturing plant Of course, Ross stressed that fuel price declines create to opposite impact; indeed, YRC Freight recently told him that fuel is now a slight tailwind in 2017. But based on what he is seeing now, though, fuel surcharges should begin to help LTL carrier results in 2017 after being a headwind the last couple of years. What’s up with the strong Class 8 orders? One would think the surge of Class 8 orders over the last few months would indicate improving fortunes for trucking, but Michael Baudendistel, vice president of Stifel’s transportation & logistics research group, that even though he’s boosted his truck equipment forecast for 2017 and 2018 what we’re experiencing is actually a return to more “normal” season order patterns. “Last year, and even more so the year before, when backlogs were still extended, there was more incentive to get orders in early in the order season, which led to very strong October-December numbers and then steeper drop-off as we got into January and beyond,” he explained. “This year, with backlogs normalized – and also with some delay in orders in October and November due to uncertainty around the election and the general freight economy – orders returned to more normal seasonal patterns. So, while fourth quarter 2016 orders in aggregate were steeply negative, January and February were sharply positive,” Baudendistel emphasized. “A lot of that is just timing. But, there also has been some definite strengthening, as you would normally expect orders to decline in February from January," he added. "Since that did not happen this year, confidence appears to still be growing.” Consolidation will continue in transportation: Brad Jacobs, the CEO of XPO Logistics, noted in a recent speech that there is “only more consolidation ahead” in freight transportation, especially in the ocean shipping industry, though XPO won't be buying any steamship lines any time soon. Mergers are difficult but “worth it” in his opinion though they need to be done quickly and accurately to work properly, which is easier said than done and “which is why most fail to achieve desired results.” Jacobs added, however, that “merging cultures” is the more difficult part, with a need to really understand the culture and not expect to change it. [Editorial note: more on the topic iof  "trucking culture" to come in a future post.] “It’s kind of like marriage; you don’t really know who you got until six to 12 months after the honeymoon,” he said. Are the Teamsters reviving unionization in trucking? Ross doesn’t think so and uses the Teamsters’ recent organizing activity against XPO as an example. Out of 300-plus terminals at XPO Freight, the Teamsters have managed to organize three – Miami Lakes, FL; Laredo, TX, and Vernon, CA , which is South Los Angeles – and that’s from back when it was Con-way Freight. Since the acquisition, the Teamsters have organized a couple more XPO warehouses, but that still represents only a small fraction of XPO’s total workforce and facilities. “XPO is certainly a target now due to its scale as the Teamsters have been going after Wal-Mart and FedEx for years, with virtually no success,” Ross said. “But they [the Teamsters] like to chase deep pockets, which is a main reason Amazon is doing everything it can to maximize use of independent contracts and third party usage, in our view, as it grows its transportation footprint,” he added. “Yet these unionization efforts are not new and therefore [are] known risks. Moreover, unionization is not an easy task [as] drivers and workers are not always keen to pay dues. Even in California, there were three terminal votes, and only the Vernon facility went union by a narrow margin.” How soon will robot trucks start rolling on our roads? Stifel’s John Larkin believe freight transportation “will be among the last industries [to be] automated, given the complexity of hauling freight on mixed-use guideways,” he said. “This will make capacity even scarcer, as companies will struggle even more to find incremental drivers to pilot incremental vehicles to handle the incremental demand from the re-shoring of manufacturing that is economically enabled by automation/robotics. The best drivers will shift to the energy and construction industries, if the above scenario fully plays out." What isn’t fully developed yet is whether self-driving trucks are deployed onto U.S. roads first, ahead of self-driving cars, or the reverse occurs. One Stifel expert believes fully autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is five years away from practical introduction, with self-driving cars hitting the road in 10 years and 15 or more years before it reaches commercial trucks. Yet another expert thinks trucks may beat out autos as dedicated linehaul could be the “best first” opportunity, relatively speaking, for self-driving vehicle. “They offer predictable, repeatable routes, lots of easy highway driving, and they stay out of congested city centers and away from pedestrians,” this expert noted. “Plus, commercial operators will be more willing to look at the economic analysis pragmatically than consumers, whereas the consumer benefit is more convenience and accessibility.” Wow. That’s quite a data dump from the “Oompa-Loompa” files if you ask me. We’ll return to those files later to see how these observations may be altered as we head into the springtime flow of freight.

The company has been offering fewer discounts on products such as Progresso soups and Pillsbury dough to cut costs, while rivals have been slashing prices to compete for retailers' shelves. The price gap with its competitors was one of General Mills' "biggest challenges" so far this year, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Harmening told analysts on a post-earnings call. "We haven't had the promotion mix right and we haven't been as competitive in pricing as we could have been," Harmening said. General Mills said it was still cutting back on discounting in the current quarter, but at a slower rate than it has so far done. Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores, Target and Amazon.com are currently embroiled in a price war that has made it crucial for them to stock cheaper products. "2017 does seem to be developing into a 'tug-of-war' between the retailers and food manufacturers, where pressure is mounting on retailers to become sharper on price points," Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said on Monday. The company's net sales fell 5.2 percent to $3.79 billion in the third quarter ended Feb. 26, hurt by weak demand for its yogurt and baking products. Sales fell short of analysts' average estimate of $3.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. General Mills, like its competitors ConAgra Brands and Campbell Soup, has also faced lackluster demand for processed foods as consumer tastes shift toward fresh foods and items seen as healthier. The company stood by its forecast for organic sales to fall about 4 percent in the year ending May. See how St. Louis stocks are faring See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Who's hired?

Net income attributable to General Mills fell to $357.8 million or 61 cents per share, from $361.7 million or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share, beating the average analyst expectation by a cent. Minneapolis-based General Mills' shares were down 1 percent at $59.99 in morning trading. They had fallen about 2 percent this year.

Avatar: Author: Karina Hoshikawa Publish date: Mar 21, 2017 Social count: 110 Plus, British Prime Minister Theresa May talks Brexit and Donald Trump in a hotly anticipated "Vogue" editorial. 110 SHARES These are the stories making headlines in fashion on Tuesday. Watch Selena Gomez answer Vogue's "73 Questions" The actress and singer, who fronts the April 2017 issue of Vogue, is the latest subject of the magazine's rapid-fire "73 Questions" video series. Watch her speak Spanish, share her favorite childhood movie and bust out her go-to dance move in the clip above. {YouTube}  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to open tech incubator in Silicon Valley The retail chain is creating a startup incubator in Silicon Valley to help align itself with the current landscape of technology retail, which has ballooned to include advances in virtual reality, self-driving vehicles, drone delivery and personalized shopping. The incubator will be called Store No. 8, which refers to a previous Walmart location where the company experimented with new store layouts. {Bloomberg} Theresa May on post-Brexit Britain, Donald Trump News broke last January that the British Prime Minister was photographed and interviewed for an upcoming feature in the April 2017 issue of Vogue, and three months later, the story is finally out. In the interview, May discusses everything from meeting Donald Trump to how she hopes to lead the country. "It's not a popularity stakes, being prime minister," said May. "I think what's important is for people to feel that I'm delivering for them. But it's a great honor to do this job. A huge privilege." {Vogue} Happy 20th, Colette! In March 1997, Sarah Andelman opened what would become one of Paris' premier shopping destinations with her mother, Colette Roussaux. Two decades later, in a new interview with AnOther Magazine, Andelman reflects on the legacy of Colette and how she plans to stay relevant in a fashion retail landscape that is increasingly favoring digital. {AnOther} Hermès launches second collection of Apple Watch bands Already bored with your Hermès feu-colored leather wristband from last spring? Worry not: The French luxury house just released another drop of Apple Watch bands that reimagine previous designs like the wraparound double tour in bold blue leather and the double buckle cuff in burnt orange Barenia leather. "Apple and Hermès make very different products" Apple's chief design officer Jonathan Ive told Vogue UK. "But they reflect the deep appreciation of quality design. Both companies are motivated by a sincere pursuit of excellence and the desire to create something that is not compromised." The bands are currently available for purchase via the Apple and Hermès websites, with prices ranging from £1,199 to £1,549. {Vogue UK} Instagram expands in-app shopping feature The social media app started testing shoppable tags in posts with select fashion and beauty brands including J.Crew and Kate Spade, and have just announced plans to expand the feature to thousands of businesses. It's a natural step for the app, which after months of initial testing, have found that the more users are exposed to shopping posts, the more they engage in-app, which also leads to them directly to the brand's site at a greater frequency. {Fashionista inbox} L'Oréal Paris launches customer loyalty program The global beauty giant is debuting "Worth It Rewards," a customer loyalty program that will be offered across the brand's four main product categories – cosmetics, hair color, hair care and skin care. Here's how it works: Members earn five points for every dollar spent on L'Oreal Paris products, plus enjoy benefits including a welcome package, birthday gift and members-only access to promotions and coupons. While it's a largely untapped move for a mass beauty brand, it's also unique in that users can donate rewards points to various charities of the brand's Women of Worth honorees. {Fashionista inbox} Anna Wintour's daughter is engaged to Franca Sozzani's son In a match made in Vogue heaven, Bee Shaffer, daughter of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, is now engaged to Francesco Carrozzini, son of the late editor of Vogue Italia Franca Sozzani. Though the couple doesn't work in fashion themselves — Shaffer is a segment producer at "Late Night with Seth Meyers" and Corrozzini is a film director and photographer — there's no doubt that their wedding will be a thoroughly fashion-forward affair. {People}   Never miss the latest fashion industry news.

Zlati Meyer , USA TODAY , KPNX 8:25 AM. MST March 21, 2017 Costco Wholesale (Photo: SAUL LOEB) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST A delivery service announced Tuesday that it will start making runs to Costco to pick up orders for customers, another move toward a world in which traditional retailers compete side-by-side with online sellers to move goods directly to homes. The service, Shipt, says it is launching its Costco service in Tampa and plans to expand to 50 markets and more than 30 million households by the end of the year. Grocery delivery is the latest way retailers in a thin-margin industry compete for customers. Kroger has teamed with Uber. Wal-Mart has been conducting test runs with Uber and Lyft since last June. Instacart got a huge infusion of funding earlier this month. Other delivery services include Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Google Express and FreshDirect. Shipt says it is already working with Whole Foods Market and regional grocery chains like H-E-B and Harris Teeter. Earlier this month, another supermarket chain, Meijer, announced that due to a successful trial run in southeastern Michigan, it'll start offering Shipt delivery across six Midwestern states. By 2025, as much as 20% of grocery shopping -- or $100 billion in annual consumer sales -- could be online, according to the Food Marketing Institute, which calls the shift "seismic." More than 70% of shoppers believe they'll shop for groceries online within the next decade, if not sooner. "Everyone’s looking to save time and get more out of less time. With Shipt in particular, people love the service and the quality of the experience," said Shipt CEO Bill Smith. While consumers have long since become used to the idea of ordering everything from books to furniture to clothing online, perishables requiring refrigeration offers a unique logistical challenge. Shipt says it is looking to deliver mostly three to four miles from stores, not from far-flung warehouses. "If you order ice cream from us, we’ll deliver it directly to you," Smith explained. Personal-care items, like toiletries, have a higher potential for online delivery than perishables like groceries, but as consumers get more comfortable buying online, they'll move into more categories, said Rupesh Parikh. Oppenheimer senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products "Consumers are demanding the convenience of home delivery," he said. "Right now, there’s no easy answer to how to be able to meet the rapidly evolving consumer demands. I don’t think right now there's a magic bullet. Consumers win with all this innovation out there." Stacy Miletti of Troy, Mich., started using Shipt at Meijer about a year ago and spends about $90 every two weeks on items like breakfast cereal, milk and laundry detergent. "The big motivation for me is it saves time. I don't have to walk up and down the aisles. I can log in at 2 or 3 in the morning and do the shopping when it works for me," the 48-year-old realtor estate broker said. "I love it, but it’s not perfect. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to be home when it’s delivered." She has yet to buy fruits and vegetables online out of concerns about quality, but by buying her staples online, it still makes her in-person shopping easier. "I don't want to buy a bad apple. I'd rather spend the time and pick out my own produce. It saves me time. I can get my bananas, apples and pears at the fruit stand up the street and I’m in and out in two seconds," she said. © 2017 KPNX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Livestream 4 Anti-Trump billboard artist gets death threats Deadly fake oxy pills being sold in Arizona Giraffe Birth Facts Child shot and killed - what happened?

An estimated 187 million Americans (58%) are on at least one prescription drug. (Source: Network for Excellence in Health Innovation [NEIH]). 110 million prescriptions a year are never even picked up. (Source: CVS Pharmacies based on 2008 data.) Up to 50% of us don’t take our medicines as prescribed (wrong times, wrong amounts, wrong meds), according to NEIH. And roughly 125,000 Americans die every year as a result. (Source: Research cited by the then-US surgeon general in 2012.) They’re dying of what doctors call non-adherence—basically, not following instructions. And you don’t have to be old and feeble to have trouble. When I was recovering from a kidney stone last year, my doctor told me to take ibuprofen, two pills, four times a day; phenazopyridine, one pill, three times a day; ciprofloxacin, two pills twice a day; docusate sodium, one capsule, three times a day; and solifenacin succinate, one pill, once a day. Seriously? You’d need a spreadsheet. Now imagine that you’re on 10 prescriptions. Or 20. The point is: There should be an app that reminds you of what to take when, and records your adherence. In fact, there is an app like that—at least 47 of them, actually. I know, because I bought, installed, and tested every single one, on a quest for the best. View photos An app that tracks your meds through the day. Is that so hard?More Here’s the complete list of apps I tried. (I originally located 75 of these apps but eliminated apps that are over three years old, since they’re usually pretty creaky. Many apps have identical names, so I’ve included the full title as it appears on the app store. They’re free unless noted.)

Got it? Apparently, a pill reminder is what every coder attempts as My Very First App, because most of them are terrible. Some are just bare-bones, but others are aggressively bad. Plenty of them crash on opening. Lots are full of typos and broken English. Many of them make it extremely awkward to enter the pill information. Almost all of them should instantly go into the Great App Trash Bin in the Sky. Fortunately, there’s one shining exception. What we want in a pill-reminder app Dive into a few of these apps, and it rapidly becomes apparent that eight features separate the good stuff from the junk: Easy to enter the med’s name. In bad apps (most of them), you have to type out the name of the medicine with your finger, carefully glancing back to the drugstore bottle. In better apps, you can type the first few letters and then tap Search—and choose from a list of matches. In the best apps, you get real-time autocomplete: A list of matches appears as you type. Pictures of the pills. The worst apps don’t even attempt graphics. Better ones let you take a photo of your pills, or choose from a palette of pill shapes and colors. The best ones already know what the meds look like, because they’re plugged into online medicine databases. Compliance is much more likely if the reminders, instead of just saying phenazopyridine, also show a couple of maroon round pills. Easy to enter the times. The worst apps make you set reminder times manually. If you’re supposed to take a pill 3 times a day, for example, you might input 10 a.m., 6 p.m., and 2 a.m. The better ones let you enter “3x daily,” and the app proposes three evenly spaced times. The best ones do that but also intelligently reset the timer if you’re late taking a pill at one of the three times. Drug warnings. The worst apps don’t have any actual knowledge of the drugs you’ve listed; it doesn’t know “ibuprofen” from “I love Lucy.” The better apps show you a page of information about each prescription. And the best apps automatically warn you if you’ve entered two drugs that shouldn’t be taken together. Family monitoring. The worst apps track only your meds. The better ones let you track other family members’ meds on your phone, so that you can also remember when it’s time to dose up your kid or your parent. The best ones also let you know remotely when a loved one has missed a dose. For example, if your grandfather doesn’t tap “Done” when he gets his 6 p.m. reminder to take his heart medicine, your phone lets you know, so you can call him up and bug him. To Do list. The worst apps just pop up reminders when it’s time to take a medicine. The better ones also show you a tidy timeline of upcoming pills you’ll have to take today. The best apps also keep a history—a handy report of your past pill-taking record—that you can send to, say, your doctor. Smart rescheduling. The worst apps just remind you when it’s time to take a dose. The better ones let you indicate either Taken or Missed for each reminder. The best ones also offer options to Skip or Postpone a dose. (For example, if you’re on hardcore pain medicine that you’re supposed to take no more often than every four hours, the reminder that pops up says, in effect, “You may take a pill now.” But if you don’t need it, you can hit Skip.) Lock-screen dismissal. All apps make an alert appear on your iPhone or Android phone’s Lock screen. Usually, in order to indicate that you’ve taken that pill, you have to swipe that alert to open the app. The best ones offer Taken or Skipped buttons right there on the Lock screen, for less disruption and fewer steps. As it turns out, only one app delivers all of those features. It’s so much more complete than its rivals, with so much more polish, that the others should slink back to the app store in shame. To make matters even better, this app is free. This  winner, by a wide margin, is called Medisafe. Medisafe As you can see by the video above, Medisafe wins you over right at the top, by auto-completing your drug names as you enter them and showing you what they look like. It autocompletes both prescription and over-the-counter drug names. Read More If you get your prescriptions from CVS, Walgreens, RiteAid, or WalMart, the app can even import your complete meds list directly from those drugstore accounts, so you do no data entry at all. It’s got drug-interaction warnings, and even—get this—videos that offer drug and dosage information. “This is Tamsulosin,” a doctor-looking guy says in one, “and you should take your dose 30 minutes after a meal. You should swallow the capsule whole, and don’t crush or chew it.” He goes on to describe what it’s for and what the side effects can be. (The videos cover the drugs representing 85% of all prescriptions.) View photos MediSafe is smart, simple, complete, and free.More This app makes it incredibly easy to specify when and how many you’re supposed to take. It reminds you to refill your prescription, too. The app shows your drug regimen as four “pill boxes,” representing morning, afternoon, and so on. To say you’ve taken your dose, you just swipe across the medicine’s name, or (if you take several at once) hit Take All. You can indicate that you’re skipping a dose, or postponing it. There’s a To Do list, a History report, an Apple Watch app, a built-in tutorial, and notifications if a loved one has missed a dose. So if Medisafe is free, how does it make money? Kind of clever: Its company makes money from drug companies, health plans, and doctors. Each has a vested interest in your sticking to your prescription routine: health insurers, because keeping you healthy costs them less; doctors, because (a) they want you healthy and (b) sometimes the insurance companies won’t pay them if you get re-admitted for the same ailment within 30 days; and pharma companies, because if you take your meds on time, you’ll have to buy refills from them sooner! Handy, no? If you or someone you love could use a free, lovely, complete pill-reminder app, go download Medisafe. The runners-up Here are a few other apps worth mentioning. Care4Today. This beautifully simple app is a close second place. It offers a quick visual way to check off doses as you take them, color-coded by urgency (below, left). Offers drug info, interaction warnings, autocomplete, and automatic pill pictures. Better yet, few apps go as far as this one to encourage adherence. For example, it shows weekly graphs of your adherence, including your running percentage score. And get this: For each day that you maintain 100% adherence, the company donates 25 cents to a charity (you can choose from a set of 9). View photos Care4Today is beautiful and rich, complete with autocomplete (center) and charitable donations for each day you master your meds.More Pill Reminder—All in One, Medication Reminders. Very clean, very attractive, easy to use. Type a few letters, then tap “Search U.S. FDA Database” to autocomplete (although it doesn’t list everything). You can specify either “3 times a day” or specify three exact times. Options to reschedule; auto-snooze. If you have more than two meds, you have to buy the $2 Pro version. View photos “Pill Reminder – All in One…” looks great and shows simple pill graphics.More Pill Reminder—Drugs.com. Superb, clean layout; the To Do list is also a calendar, so you can look ahead or back to other days. Autocomplete for drug names, option to photograph your pills. Tracks your refills; offers a password for privacy. View photos “Pill Reminder – Drugs.com” is pretty great. (There are 4 other apps called Pill Reminder, though–don’t get confused.)More Pillboxie. Really simple app, heavy on clear, attractive graphics. For example, you schedule your dose times by dragging a picture of the pill into a time-labeled pill-box on the screen. Lots of help screens. To Do list, History, fun reminder sounds. View photos Pillboxie’s text and graphics are big and clear enough to see without glasses.More Round Health—Medicine Reminder and Pill Tracker. Shows a round daily graph of your progress; offers a unique but somewhat confusing “time window” system of reminder prompts. Great autocomplete that includes standard pill strengths—alas, no pictures. If you create an account, you can save your med history and sync data between multiple devices. View photos Round Health shows your progress as a round graph (left). It also has autocomplete (right).More RX2—Meds and Pill Reminder. Super efficient to schedule your doses: If you tap “3x a day,” the app proposes the actual time slots (you can adjust the defaults in Settings, or on the spot). When the time comes, you can tap Take, Skip, or Reschedule. Clear, big design. View by day, week, month. Autocomplete (although doesn’t know all med names). No pill pictures, though. View photos RX2 has a bold, clear design and a choice of Day, Week, or Month views.More Happy pill taking! I’ve identified seven extraordinary, well designed apps that remind you to take your meds, and track your adherence; MediSafe and Care4Today, in particular, are spectacular. Now, technically, I can appreciate that a tech column is more exciting when it covers hybrid tablets or automated drones. But this time, I thought maybe the most exciting product is one that can save your life.

Courtesy of Rockwell Group By Regan Hofmann Posted March 21, 2017 The restaurant and hotel empire is about to get a new NYC flagship, Nobu Downtown. This Saturday, Nobu Tribeca will serve its last meal. It's a bittersweet moment for the owners of the 23-year-old institution that paved the way for a generation of Japanese restaurants in the U.S., but when this door closes, a massive new one is already set to open: A door to the new Nobu flagship at 195 Broadway. There, in the landmarked former AT&T headquarters in the Financial District, is the two-floor, 12,000-square-foot future of Nobu. The David Rockwell-designed restaurant will have a massive bar and lounge on the ground floor, subterranean seating for 187 and a private sake table for the high rollers who have been flocking to the original restaurant since it opened in 1994. © Evan Sung Moving (further) downtown isn't the only big step the Nobu group is taking these days. In 2013, the first Nobu hotel opened in the Caesars Palace complex in Las Vegas, followed swiftly by similar projects in Manila and Miami. In the next 18 months, they plan to add six more hotels, in locations as far-ranging as London, Bahrain, and Cabo San Lucas, to that list. A New York hotel is on the horizon, too. It's a massive expansion for a brand that started life as a Japanese restaurant in an obscure Manhattan neighborhood, but for Nobu, somehow it's just not that shocking. Nobu's origin story is the stuff of restaurant legend: While dining at chef Nobu Matsuhisa's eponymous L.A. restaurant, Matsuhisa, in the early '90s, Robert De Niro and his friend, producer Meir Teper, were so enamored of the food that they approached the chef to ask if he'd open a spot in New York City. When he agreed, De Niro, a tireless booster for his Tribeca neighborhood, brought on restaurateur Drew Nieporent, another local who was, at the time, running Tribeca Grill and Montrachet nearby. Throw in an audacious design by Rockwell, one of his first major restaurant commissions along with Matsuhisa's South American-inflected Japanese cuisine, and a mega-hit was born. Courtesy of Rockwell Group Twenty-three years and 32 locations later, it's inspired imitators by the dozen—Sushisamba, whose clubby atmosphere and Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese cuisine were immortalized as a thing of the mid-oughts by an appearance on Sex and the City; London's aggressively named Sexy Fish, opened in 2015; "Every time you turn around you read about some 'Son of Nobu' restaurant with a chef that says he used to work at Nobu, but I don't remember the guy," says Nieporent. "A lot of these companies, when they have an opportunity, they try to pinch the staff. I've had to make a few phone calls over the years." If the mark of culinary immortality is mainstream ubiquity, there are a small handful of chefs who have achieved it. The molten chocolate cake that Jean-Georges Vongerichten made famous at JoJo in 1987 can now be found in the frozen foods aisle at Wal-Mart and on the menu at Applebee's. Chez Panisse pizza chef Ed LaDou's BBQ chicken pizza is one of the "grownup" offerings on Chuck E. Cheese's menu. And Nobu's yellowtail-jalapeño, at the time a peculiar hallmark of his time spent serving sushi in Peru before he came to the U.S., is a common combination from Nobu-style imitators to grab-and-go grocery store sushi. With that achievement under his belt, Matsuhisa has taken an unusual approach to his cuisine—consistency. Today, there are two basic paths for a chef looking to expand his empire: innovate, or go casual. The former is embodied by David Chang's Momofuku, which counts six different restaurants in New York, individual restaurants in Toronto, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, and Sydney, plus the Milk Bar and Fuku chains as well as the Ando delivery service under its umbrella. The latter model is Shake Shack, the budget burger concept from Danny Meyer that has grown from a seasonal cart in Madison Square Park to 119 locations as far away as Dubai, South Korea, and Moscow. © Henry Hargreaves Even the high-profile chefs of Matsuhisa's generation have felt the need to diversify. Wolfgang Puck, who made his name in the early '90s with his version of California cuisine, is now opening steakhouses. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, where his Mediterranean-inflected Southwestern style was born in 1991, closed its flagship in 2013; the Flay brand is now thriving in 19 locations of an upscale burger restaurant called Bobby's Burger Palace. But Matsuhisa says, "Our customers know my philosophy. It makes us happy that the dishes we created when we first opened Nobu are still among the most popular dishes today." Nobu did stand at those crossroads once, early on—in 1998, when, to answer the high demand for tables, they acquired the space next door and, for a moment, considered making it a late-night ramen shop tentatively called Nobu's Noodles. As the partners went back and forth on the details, Nieporent remembers, "It dawned on me, like, 'Here we are trying to conceptualize an annexed space to do a different concept when there's a demand for people who want the Nobu menu.'" They scrapped the ramen idea and opened Nobu Next Door, with most of the same menu. Courtesy of Rockwell Group So, where are they growing creatively? Hotels. As Teper puts it, "We saw that our restaurants in other brands' hotels were helping the hotels do better business, making the hotel more visible." It was De Niro who first suggested, eight years ago, that they could keep that business for themselves. It's the opposite of what many restaurateurs are doing these days; they see hotel groups as desirable partners because it means someone else shoulders the big costs of opening a new restaurant—real estate and buildout, often offering cut rates on rent and utilities—while also offering a built-in clientele. Instead, Nobu has chosen to wade directly into that morass of unknowns and operational costs in the name of control. They're basically in uncharted territory. In London's Chinatown, Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver opened the St. John Hotel in 2011, expanding Henderson's groundbreaking reclamation of British cuisine into a boutique, minimalist space with a restaurant anchor on the main floor, a bar/tea room for guests to enjoy Henderson's beloved elevenses, and a room tier cheekily named "Post Supper." Though it was awarded a Michelin star in 2013, the project went into administration a month later and was sold to a Singaporean hotel group, with Ferguson and Gulliver exiting the financially fraught business. Related Nobu by the Numbers Nobu Matsuhisa Unveils a Stunning Tableware Collection How Nobu Transforms Scraps Into an Ultimate Umami Marinade All of the Nobu partners are measured as they talk about the hotel expansion, as unassuming in their description of the project as its rapid growth is ambitious. "I don't think we invented anything new," says Teper. "There are many good hotels with good service around the world, but they don't have the food and beverage that we can provide." Matsuhisa concurs, while highlighting the hotels' prime locations: "To enjoy them, you need a simple, comfortable room with excellent service. And room service from Nobu is always good, too!" It's much the same for the new Nobu Downtown: same experience, flashier digs. When it opens just a few weeks after Tribeca closes its doors for good, it'll bring over the entire Tribeca staff, including chef Ricky Estrellado, who has been with the restaurant since it opened. "The day that it becomes ritualistic, like a Benihana or something like that, we're in trouble," says Nieporent. Until then, Nobu's world will keep expanding.

What makes the shooting odd is that the two men who allegedly started the violence arrived at the scene with two .40 caliber handguns, and a Walmart bag filled with loose bullets. According to police, Traekwuan Steele, 20, drove Sidiamond Stills and Mario Burke to a neighborhood not far from where the new Atlanta Mercedes-Benz Stadium is being built. The trio then pulled up on a group of men, one of whom is suspected of being a gang member in the crime-plagued Atlanta neighborhood known as “The Bluff.”  The group started fighting and gunfire soon erupted. Steele was shot twice in the back and crashed his car into a house as he tried to flee. The group soon dispersed but Steele was critically injured, Stills and Burke hid their weapons and a bag of bullets and then went back to check on their friend. They were later arrested when police arrived on the scene. Steele is recovering at Atlanta’s Grady Hospital and tragically may be paralyzed because the bullets went through his spine. Stills was in the Fulton County jail on a charge of aggravated assault. His bond is set at $25,000. Burke was released from jail March 12 on a bond of $26K. He was charged with carrying a weapon without a license and aggravated assault. The area was made famous by the independent film, Snow on Tha Bluff. Filmmaker Curtis Snow described the community to rolling out, “The Bluff is a neighborhood where everyone is one-track-minded. It’s right around the corner from downtown Atlanta, Georgia Dome, and Centennial Olympic Park. The people there are surviving and barely making it. The B.L.U.F.F stands for you ‘Better Leave, U [you] F—ing Fool.’ If you’re coming to get something, just get it and go.”   Share this: Tweet More Email Print More on rollingout.com 2K fans line up at SXSW for The Migos to perform trap anthem ‘Bad and Boujee’ Was the ATLOrgy party a scam?

Quotes in the article Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▲ 167.68 +0.90 +0.54% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.25 +0.35 +0.50% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 848.02 +4.81 +0.57% Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 29.92 +0.09 +0.30% The service, Shipt, says it is launching its Costco service in Tampa and plans to expand to 50 markets and more than 30 million households by the end of the year. Grocery delivery is the latest way retailers in a thin-margin industry compete for customers. Kroger has teamed with Uber. Wal-Mart has been conducting test runs with Uber and Lyft since last June. Instacart got a huge infusion of funding earlier this month. Other delivery services include Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Google Express and FreshDirect.  Shipt says it is already working with Whole Foods Market and regional grocery chains like H-E-B and Harris Teeter. Earlier this month, another supermarket chain, Meijer, announced that due to a successful trial run in southeastern Michigan, it'll start offering Shipt delivery across six Midwestern states. Shipt members pay a $99 annual fee for unlimited grocery deliveries. Customers have a one-hour window when the merchandise is dropped off. By 2025, as much as 20% of grocery shopping -- or $100 billion in annual consumer sales -- could be online, according to the Food Marketing Institute, which calls the shift "seismic." More than 70% of shoppers believe they'll shop for groceries online within the next decade, if not sooner. "Everyone’s looking to save time and get more out of less time. With Shipt in particular, people love the service and the quality of the experience," said Shipt CEO Bill Smith.

Shipt says it is looking to deliver mostly three to four miles from stores, not from far-flung warehouses. "If you order ice cream from us, we’ll deliver it directly to you," Smith explained. Personal-care items, like toiletries, have a higher potential for online delivery than perishables like groceries, but as consumers get more comfortable buying online, they'll move into more categories, said Rupesh Parikh. Oppenheimer senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products "Consumers are demanding the convenience of home delivery," he said. "Right now, there’s no easy answer to how to be able to meet the rapidly evolving consumer demands. I don’t think right now there's a magic bullet. Consumers win with all this innovation out there." Stacy Miletti of Troy, Mich., started using Shipt at Meijer about a year ago and spends about $90 every two weeks on items like breakfast cereal, milk and laundry detergent. "The big motivation for me is it saves time. I don't have to walk up and down the aisles. I can log in at 2 or 3 in the morning and do the shopping when it works for me," the 48-year-old realtor estate broker said. "I love it, but it’s not perfect. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to be home when it’s delivered." She has yet to buy fruits and vegetables online out of concerns about quality, but by buying her staples online, it still makes her in-person shopping easier. "I don't want to buy a bad apple. I'd rather spend the time and pick out my own produce. It saves me time. I can get my bananas, apples and pears at the fruit stand up the street and I’m in and out in two seconds," she said.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next If you have an iPhone, you've probably seen pop-up ads promising you either a chance at money or a store gift card -- or perhaps even a free iPhone.  It seems to be worse if you use Facebook on an iPhone, as the message often looks like a new Facebook page, with a blue bar. Who's behind these, and what happens if you click? Watch for the word 'Congratulations' It typically happens when you are on Facebook on your phone, and suddenly something pops up telling you "Congratulations, today is your lucky day!"  Uh no, it's not. It may claim you have just won a chance at a Best Buy or Walmart gift card, an iPhone 7, or something similar. It may even have a countdown clock, saying you have just two minutes to click, or you will lose the deal. Darci Pearl got hit by one last year. "They said, 'you won a thousand dollars,'" Pearl said. But she didn't know what she should do next. What happens if you click Sometimes a click takes you to posts from people claiming they got their freebie. Other times it takes you to a survey page. But resist the urge to click. MacWorld.com says these are all either marketing tricks or outright scams, and you may be giving the scammers access to your Facebook page. The most benign versions are "like harvesting" schemes, where they get you to give out personal info by liking a page, then taking a survey, where they can then target you with more junk. The most dangerous are phishing scams, where clicking through can give the scammers access your Facebook friends list, and they could soon receive bogus messages purporting to be from you. If that happens to you, you'll say "doesn't that stink?" What to do, and not do If you get a pop-up claiming you have won something: 1. Close it. 3. Don't "like" it, don't open it, and don't share. 3. If these are hitting your phone more and more, Apple suggests starting by clearing your phone's history, where these pages sometimes reside, then pop back up. 4. Check Apple support forums. Apple has more detailed advice on how to block these pop-up ads in its support pages. 5.  Add a Safari popup blocker, according to a report in MacWorld. 6. A report in Malware Tips offers even more good advice. 7. If it is happening on a laptop or desktop PC, download Malwarebytes, which will remove any malware causing it. Remember: Facebook is not giving away money, and no, you didn't win a free iPhone 7 at random. Sorry, it is not your lucky day. So resist the urge to click, so you don't waste your money. _____________________ “Don't Waste Your Money” is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc. (“Scripps”).

The new layout was unveiled by CEO Brian Cornell in Las Vegas Monday. It will feature a separate entrance and 10-minute parking for shoppers looking to pick up an online order or some essentials. New center aisles will be curved rather than squared off, to inspire people to explore, says Mark Schindele, senior vice president of Target Properties. LED track lighting will replace fluorescent fixtures, and brand boutiques meant to replicate a specialty-store feel will showcase rotating looks. The first of the redesigned stores will open in suburban Houston this fall. About 40 more stores will get the remodel treatment by October, using the Houston prototype as a template. More than 600 of Target’s 1,800 total locations are scheduled for updates over the next three years. It expects the remodeled stores to see a 2 percent to 4 percent sales bump. Play Video Health - Wednesday How retailers are tracking you and undermining your privacy Department stores, supermarkets and other brick-and-mortar merchants are using technology to track our buying behaviors. But are they basically s... “We wanted the design to be flexible because that’s what shopping is all about,” Schindele told The Associated Press. The remodeling is a key part of Target’s strategy to win back shoppers and rev up sales. Unlike rival Walmart (WMT), which has drawn more customers and notched higher sales at established stores, Target has seen three straight quarters of declines for that sales measure, and fewer shoppers in its stores. Investing in stores is an acknowledgement that the in-person experience remains important, even as Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers draw shoppers away from traditional retailers. At an investor meeting last month, Target executives spoke bluntly about the shabbiness of many of the chain’s stores. It pledged to spend $7 billion on the remodeling plan and to accelerate its expansion of small-format stores, bolster its online operations and launch new brands. “We’ve got to reimagine that store experience,” Cornell said then. “Today’s millennial shopper doesn’t enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that hasn’t been touched in 10 years.” Target has also tested new store designs in Dallas and Los Angeles, but Houston’s is the most ambitious store redesign to date. Last fall, Target launched an initiative in 25 stores in Los Angeles where it tested an updated grocery presentation with new lighting and foods to prepare single meals displayed together. The new grocery presentation was later rolled out in 16 Dallas stores. Cornell said shopper feedback in Dallas and Los Angeles has been good. The Houston prototype’s separate entrances for shoppers in a hurry and those who aren’t is among its biggest novelties. The entrance on the right will have a dedicated pickup counter for online orders. Shoppers will also have the option of having their order brought to their car. Groceries, wine and liquor will be located here, rather than in the back where they’re usually found. Seasonal essentials, like school supplies in the fall, will also be found nearby. Shoppers using the “inspiration” entrance on the left will see the brand name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion. Beauty, jewelry and accessories departments will be nearby. There will also be seating outside of Starbucks (SBUX). An area to hold store events will be located between the two entrances. Target will tweak the format based on shoppers’ responses. “This represents our current thinking,” Schindele said, “but we are going to learn a lot.” © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

CDT March 21, 2017 (Photo: Woody Fields, Facebook) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON – People not from Texas sometimes believe everyone from Texas has a horse, but that’s not the case. Nor do we typically go grocery shopping on horseback. But a video making the rounds on Facebook may have outsiders believing otherwise. Woody Fields uploaded the video Sunday. It shows Woody and two of his friends casually riding their horses through a Houston Walmart store. Woody gave KHOU 11 permission to share the video, titled “Walmart on a horse grocery shopping.” (Warning: the Facebook video has language some may find offensive.) The video shows other customers stepping back in disbelief. It was mostly a calm scene, although Woody notes a few of the patrons looked scared. In an interview posted to his Facebook page, Woody says he was a little scared because of the wax floor. He knew this was a new experience for his horse, and he didn’t want her to fall or leave a mess. In the end, he says he just wanted to make people smile. The three men make their way around a good portion of the store and after a couple minutes went back out the front, but not before one of them apparently got an earful from security. © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Don't be alarmed by snakes on the beach Sexual assault on trial ride leads to lawsuit Normangee Police Chief arrested in standoff Houston teen battling cancer meets Beyoncé Perry blasts A&M student government president 3 men go through Houston Walmart on horseback Former middle school worker charged with sex crime 'White Lives Matter' fliers found in Alvin Houstonians on vacation in London react to attack Suspect prostitution ring involved students More Stories PM: London attacker was British-born, known to intelligence Mar 23, 2017, 5:07 a.m. HCSO: 3 arrested, drugs and weapons seized in raid Mar 23, 2017, 4:58 a.m. Houstonians, local British community react to terror… Mar 22, 2017, 6:39 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Felix Antonio Tejeda, 35, of Hanover Township, waived a preliminary hearing on the charges earlier this month. He is facing a long list of felony theft and fraud charges. According to Rush Township Police, Tejeda posed as a legal aide and convinced senior citizens in Nebraska, Michigan and North Carolina that he was assisting a young relative who had been in a car wreck in Pennsylvania. He then allegedly convinced the victims to wire money to Walmart locations in Pennsylvania, including one in Rush Township. In some cases, the victims wired him as much as $5,000, believing it was going to an relative for bail money. Police said that the alleged crashes never occurred. At least one of the victims was in the mid-70s. age range. Police learned of the scam after one couple contacted the Hometown Wal-Mart in an effort to recover $2,500 that they had wired there. But it had already been picked up. Two weeks later, on Jan. 26, the same person who picked up the $2,500 returned to pick up $2,500 that had been wired by a 75-year-old woman from North Carolina. In both cases, the man used ID cards with different names. Police identified the man as Tejeda. On Jan. 31, Walmart employees advised police that the man was in the store. They took him into custody. Tejeda was allegedly carrying another fake ID with the name of Sammy Porter. He was arrested and charged with a felony counts of theft, theft by deception, and identity theft. He is currently locked up at Schuylkill County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bail.

Stock market maverick R K Damani-led Avenue Supermarts, commonly known as D-Mart, made a rocking debut on the bourses today with whopping 100% listing gains, which made stock market analysts bullish on the market as well as the stock. “We can certainly describe today as “D-Day”. This listing will certainly qualify as the biggest listing of recent times in subscription and listing gains terms,” said Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities. According to market experts, more than anything else, this is a tribute to its promoter Radhakishan Damini. “While the industry went through a turbulent time with various big and high-profile players like Reliance, Future Group and Walmart struggling to retain their turf and burning cash, the low-profile RK Damani made silent but huge strides with his maiden retail venture. Not only is his enterprise profitable, it has grown and prospered without any of the noise and rhetoric surrounding other retail ventures. Even at these lofty valuations, the buzz on the street is that there is still significant upside to this scrip. A classic case of wealth creation for not only the promoter, but also institutions and millions of small investors,” said Ashish Kapur, CEO, Invest Shoppe India Ltd. You may also watch: From the market point of view, this is certainly positive as this establishes that well-planned and executed businesses continue to attract big capital. Also, retail interest in stocks does get traction when there are mammoth and sustainable listing gains in large IPOs. “Sectoral-wise this is also likely to rerate the entire retail and consumer space. At a market capitalisation of around 37 K crore, this is certainly a great success story from an extremely humble and remarkably successful entrepreneur,” said Kapur. Thus, it can be concluded after looking at the facts of this IPO that broader trend of the market is very much intact and more northwards, and investors are ready to pay premium for quality. “As we know after drought of IPOs, Wonderala Holidays was the first entrant and after that many companies made their presence on Dalal Street. In a way, it’s not a very good sign for equity investors as IPOs suck liquidity out of secondary markets. However, we’re in a firm structural bull market and it will last for some more years. So investors need not worry much,” said Modi. Modi, however, suggests that medium and short-term investors/ traders should at least book partial profits as in the medium term the D-Mart stock can underperform given its stretched valuations and also the market is consolidating after making a fresh high. Long-term portfolio investors are advised to held on to their positions. You may also watch: It may be noted that D-Mart is a very well-run retail store chain with 118 outlets on pan-India basis with a PAT growth of nearly 50%. Many investors piled on to it and its Rs 1,870-crore IPO issue got subscribed 104 times. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Tarik D. Dean, 36, took the last-minute deal, pleading no contest a felony charge of transporting narcotics for sale, as dozens of potential jurors waited nearby for the start of his jury trial. Authorities have said Vacaville and Fairfield police stopped Dean’s car as he drove out of the Walmart parking lot on North Texas Street on the night of Aug. 12, 2016. Authorities said when they searched Dean, they found 241 oxycodone pills, many of them falling out of a plastic bag stuffed in his pants, and cash totaling $19,886. The judge agreed to a request by Dean’s lawyer to let Dean remain out of custody on $55,000 bail until he is sentenced May 3. It was arrest number 17 for Dean since 1999. Most of his arrests have either ended with prosecutors dismissing his case, or with him being placed on probation. Dean’s troubles with the law include a 1999 arrest, when he was 18, for his alleged connection to a shooting that left a Fairfield man with a gunshot wound to the knee. Dean, then 23, was twice arrested in 2005 on a suspicion of possessing narcotics for sale. Reach Jess Sullivan at 427-6919 or [email protected] . Follow him on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jsullivandr.

The Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community has rallied to support the seven Campbell children who were orphaned and lost their home early Thursday morning. Elizabeth Donald/BND 1 of 6 i By Elizabeth Donald edonald@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Friday night lights behind Edwardsville High School illuminated a line of cars that stretched across the campus to the road on the far side of the school. The cars were bringing donations to the Edwardsville Little Tigers’ collection effort for the Campbell children. The outpouring of donations and support has been “overwhelming,” according to the organizers with the children’s football club. All but the two youngest Campbell children participated in Little Tigers either as football players or cheerleaders, according to Little Tigers president Eddie Lowry. “We know the kids,” Lowry said. “We’re a part of these kids’ lives, and we want to teach them that we’re behind them.” So when word spread about the tragedy that had befallen the seven Campbell children — their father shot in their home, their mother dead in a nearby lake, the youngest sibling nearly drowned, their house burned and all their belongings gone — the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community swung into gear. “We had a lot of tears as people were coming up, but we had a lot of people who were thankful to be able to help these kids,” Lowry said. On Friday night, the line of cars waiting to donate toys, clothing, housewares and more was daunting. The student football players ran up and down the line, collecting the donations from each car in carts in order to keep the line moving, Lowry said. “The generosity has been overwhelming,” Lowry said. “The message to the community is, ‘Thank you.’ It’s been amazing how generous they are, and the family is so appreciative. They’re a little overwhelmed right now, but they are so appreciative.” Metro-East Mini Storage offered three storage units for donations, Lowry said. As of Saturday afternoon, they are full, as well as another storage unit they had acquired. A 22-foot box trailer loaned to the effort was expected to be full by the end of Saturday’s collection, he said. And that doesn’t include the large bins at the Glen Carbon Wal-Mart, located at each entrance. Co-manager Courtnie Howes said that when the bins fill up, they line up shopping carts in the aisle to hold the extra. As many as 10 shopping carts were filled at one point, Howes said, with more bins and carts filling up Saturday afternoon. “We have a lot of stuff,” Lowry said. “All of it is being shown and offered to the caregivers so the kids have what they need.” And the Little Tigers aren’t the only ones collecting: ▪ The Country Meadows Homeowners Association and Edwardsville Wrestling Club have been collecting items and donations for the family and coordinating their efforts with the Little Tigers. A Campbell family fundraiser will take place at Edison’s Entertainment Complex 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. March 25, with $16 unlimited bowling, laser tag and arcade to benefit the family, according to Facebook posts on the homeowners’ association page. ▪ The Edwardsville Orchestra Boosters learned that one of the children was involved in orchestra, and had lost her viola to the fire. Within hours, two violas were donated, as well as a music stand and other equipment to ensure she could continue playing in the orchestra. ▪ Edwardsville District 7 schools are coordinating donations through the director of student services, with what Superintendent Lynda Andre described in a parent letter as “numerous donations … of clothing and shoes, school supplies, bedding and other hygiene items.” ▪ Kids Club Child Development Center will be collecting gift card donations through March 24 for the Campbell family. ▪ At least three GoFundMe campaigns were set up, but the one sanctioned by the family is being coordinated by David Fellows, a retired police officer who served with the Fairview Heights Police Department for 26 years and currently works for Illinois Law Enforcement Alarm System. Fellows said he knew the family through a cousin, and offered his assistance in running a GoFundMe campaign that had raised nearly $6,000 by Saturday evening. “It looks like it’s starting to get some traction,” Fellows said. Fellows said the children’s grandmother will be the one to access the account, and it will all go to the children. Of the two other campaigns, Fellows said one has already shut down and combined its proceeds with his; the other has not replied to questions from the family as yet. Donations haven’t just been clothing, games and stuffed animals, Lowry said. Everything from dental care to counseling services have been offered free to the children, to help them through their tragedy. Lowry said they have already taken a first round of donations to the children. Each child has received a bicycle and tablet, he said. Someone has donated new bunk beds to the family, so the children have sufficient beds and bedding, as well as clothes, toys, shoes, backpacks and more. “We didn’t want to overwhelm the caregivers,” Lowry said. “There’s a lot to sort through, and we’re doing it right now.” In fact, there’s been so much donated that the organizers are calling for a change of focus. “They don’t need any more things now,” Lowry said. “I think what they’re most concerned about is the ongoing needs of the kids, so probably financial contributions are better at this point.” The Little Tigers has set up its own collection fund, which Lowry said would not be subject to any fees and 100 percent will go directly to the kids. He did not have an exact figure as of Saturday, because money keeps coming in, he said. But it is already into the “tens of thousands,” he said. They have not set a donation goal, Lowry said, because all the money collected will be put into a trust fund for the children to help fund their care and future college educations. Lowry said he was both surprised and not surprised by the reaction of the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community. “The community has just come together for these kids, and it’s just amazing,” he said. “I wish I could say I was really surprised, because I’m not — this is a great place to be. And people have just kicked in like you can’t believe … Is it overwhelming for us? Sure, it’s overwhelming, but it’s a great overwhelming.” At this point, there has been much more collected than the children or their caregivers could possibly take, Lowry said. What will happen to the rest? “We haven’t decided yet,” Lowry said, laughing. “We will obviously do something so the family can benefit from that, but we haven’t figured out what that will be yet.” Nothing will be thrown away, he said, but they will find a solution that further benefits the Campbell children. Meanwhile, the children are doing as well as can be expected, while the caregivers are a bit overwhelmed, Lowry said. He has not discussed the tragedy with the children, but instead he said they are focusing on the future — and on their new belongings for their new life, he said. On Saturday, Lowry brought over the bicycles and the children leaped to them, riding around in the cool sunshine. “They came running out of the place where they are staying and went riding around the cul-de-sac, and it was just awesome, because they were able to get some energy out and focus on something else,” Lowry said. In the meantime, volunteers continue to sort the massive donations at the Tigers’ clubhouse, and Lowry said the Little Tigers “family” will continue to work as long as the kids need help.

By Anne D’Innocenzio Associated Press NEW YORK — In a move to bring shoppers back to its stores, Target is embarking on an ambitious redesign aimed at helping people who need to dash in for milk to get out quickly while encouraging those who want to wander the aisles to linger. The new layout was unveiled by CEO Brian Cornell in Las Vegas Monday. It will feature a separate entrance and 10-minute parking for shoppers looking to pick up an online order or some essentials. New center aisles will be curved rather than squared off, to inspire people to explore, says Mark Schindele, senior vice president of Target Properties. LED track lighting will replace fluorescent fixtures, and brand boutiques meant to replicate a specialty-store feel will showcase rotating looks. The first of the redesigned stores will open in suburban Houston this fall. About 40 more stores will get the remodel treatment by October, using the Houston prototype as a template. More than 600 of Target’s 1,800 total locations are scheduled for updates over the next three years. It expects the remodeled stores to see a 2 percent to 4 percent sales bump. “We wanted the design to be flexible because that is what shopping is all about,” Schindele told The Associated Press. The remodeling is a key part of Target Corp.’s strategy to win back shoppers and rev up sales. Unlike rival Wal-Mart, which has drawn more customers and notched higher sales at established stores, Target has seen three straight quarters of declines for that sales measure, and fewer shoppers in its stores. Investing in stores is an acknowledgement that the in-person experience remains important, even as Amazon and other online retailers draw shoppers away from traditional retailers. At an investor meeting last month Target executives spoke bluntly about the shabbiness of many of the chain’s stores. It pledged to spend $7 billion on the remodeling plan and to accelerate its expansion of small-format stores, bolster its online operations, and launch new brands. “We’ve got to reimagine that store experience,” Cornell said then. “Today’s millennial shopper doesn’t enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that hasn’t been touched in 10 years.” Target has also tested new store designs in Dallas and Los Angeles, but Houston’s is the most ambitious store redesign to date. Last fall, Target launched an initiative in 25 stores in Los Angeles where it tested an updated grocery presentation with new lighting and foods to prepare single meal displayed together. The new grocery presentation was later rolled out in 16 Dallas stores. Cornell said shopper feedback in Dallas and Los Angeles has been good. The Houston prototype’s separate entrances for shoppers in a hurry and those who aren’t is among its biggest novelties. The entrance on the right will have a dedicated pickup counter for online orders. Shoppers will also have the option of having their order brought to their car. Groceries, wine and liquor will be located here, rather than in the back where they’re usually found. Seasonal essentials, like school supplies in the fall, will also be found nearby. Shoppers using the “inspiration” entrance on the left will see the brand name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion. Beauty, jewelry and accessories departments will be nearby. There will also be seating outside of Starbucks. An area to hold store events will be located between the two entrances. Target will tweak the format based on shoppers’ responses. “This represents our current thinking,” Schindele said, “but we are going to learn a lot.”   Most Read Most expensive home in county ‘takes your breath away’ It looks like something plucked out of a European countryside and dropped… Mar 22nd, 2017 by Jim Davis Sheriff peeved by federal shaming over immigration policy EVERETT — A new federal report calls out the Snohomish County Sheriff’s… Mar 22nd, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield Commissioners reprimanded for racially insensitive remarks EVERETT — Jokes about race, even those made in private, serve to… Mar 22nd, 2017 by Rikki King Man in Snohomish dies after police use Taser during arrest SNOHOMISH — A man died in police custody overnight after an electronic… Mar 22nd, 2017 by Herald Staff Program for developmentally disabled adults looks to expand MARYSVILLE — A group of adults with developmental disabilities, plus a handful… Mar 22nd, 2017 by Chris Winters © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Credit: Summer Cartwright | Senior Lantern Reporter Students from the Ohio State Student/Farmworker Alliance will cut more than just Wendy’s out of their diet this week. On Monday, members began a weeklong fast coupled with a daily presence outside of Bricker Hall in protest of OSU’s contract with Wendy’s. Members of the Student/Farmworker Alliance said the purpose is to intensify pressure on the university to end its current contract with Wendy’s. The Student/Farmworker Alliance is demanding Wendy’s join the Fair Food Program and adhere to its standards for tomato pickers. The program has added 14 major corporations to its program, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle and Wal-Mart, but it hasn’t convinced Wendy’s to join. The Fair Food Program, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a workers’ rights organization — and the Alliance for Fair Food work together to ensure the protection of rights and wages for farmers and farmworkers in Immokalee, Florida, according to their websites. Unlike McDonald’s and Burger King, for example, which buy tomatoes from farms in Florida that are protected by the Fair Food Program’s code of conduct, Wendy’s gets its tomatoes from Mexico. “We are fasting to prove to the administration that our demands have not yet been met, and that means they must end the contract,” Alex Hoey, a second-year in geography and member of the Student/Farmworker Alliance, said in an email referring to OSU’s contract with Wendy’s. OSU spokesman Ben Johnson said the university remains committed to continuing its work on this issue, but emphasised “the university does not support any potentially harmful actions that could jeopardize the health and well-being” of students. OSU’s contract with Wendy’s, which leases a location at the Wexner Medical Center, states the school will work to find “a resolution of the concerns of the Student Farmworkers Alliance regarding the procurement of tomatoes for the operation of Tenant’s business at the Premise that is satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.” Previously, the university set up a meeting between Wendy’s and the Student Farmworkers Alliance, but the group declined to meet, citing a message posted to Wendy’s website dating from 2013. In the statement, which has since been updated and changed, Wendy’s said it was being targeted by CIW and that the restaurant should only have to negotiate directly with the supplier, not a third-party organization like CIW. The group plans to meet outside Bricker Hall at 8:30 a.m. every day this week and hold open meetings at 4 p.m., where administration members are invited to join the discussion. Group member Ben Wibking, a graduate student in astronomy, said the meetings are designed to foster “meaningful conversation” with the administration, but ultimately to get OSU to end its contract with Wendy’s as soon as possible. “We want (University President Michael Drake) to come and explain that if they can end their Wendy’s contract now, why aren’t they doing that,” Wibking said. The weeklong fast outside of Bricker Hall will be paired with daily protests outside of the Wendy’s headquarters in nearby Dublin, Ohio, demanding that Wendy’s join the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and the Fair Food Program, according to a press release from the CIW. The CIW is hosting a march through Columbus on Sunday to mark one year of its campaign to boycott Wendy’s. Laura Kington, an OSU alumna and member of Ohio Fair Food, said the fast was in solidarity with the farmworkers who the group says Wendy’s is exploiting. “Wendy’s has the fundamental responsibility to listen to the farmworkers who make their profits possible, and to listen to their own neighbors here in Columbus,” Kington said in a press release. Wendy’s recently updated code of conduct states that all suppliers are expected to comply with the respective labor laws accepted in that country. For farmworkers in Mexico, tomato suppliers must comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization, and Wendy’s encourages suppliers to respect human rights. The update also stated that Wendy’s might meet with third-party groups and governmental organizations “with the intent of furthering our responsibility commitments and sustainability stewardship.” However, no third-party groups were mentioned by name in the update.

(KTRK) AP Monday, March 20, 2017 09:52PM HOUSTON, Texas -- In a move to bring shoppers back to its stores, Target is embarking on an ambitious redesign aimed at helping people who need to dash in for milk to get out quickly while encouraging those who want to wander the aisles to linger. The new layout was unveiled by CEO Brian Cornell in Las Vegas Monday. It will feature a separate entrance and 10-minute parking for shoppers looking to pick up an online order or some essentials. New center aisles will be curved rather than squared off, to inspire people to explore, says Mark Schindele, senior vice president of Target Properties. LED track lighting will replace fluorescent fixtures, and brand boutiques meant to replicate a specialty-store feel will showcase rotating looks. RELATED: Walmart builds new high-tech store in Tomball The first of the redesigned stores will open in suburban Houston this fall.

Owens Senior Editor Leave a comment As part of an ongoing occasional series on some of the mayoral candidates who will be challenging Mayor Mike Duggan later this year, the Michigan Chronicle recently interviewed Bill Noakes. What follows is a partial transcript of the interview. According to the biography he provided, Noakes is the Founder and Principal of Noakes & Associates, a consulting firm that advises on ethics and leadership.  Before starting Noakes & Associates, he was Executive Vice President of Meijer, Incwhere he led its legal, IT, real estate, construction, and procurement operations. Doakes has served as Senior Associate Independent Counsel, where he was prosecutor and press spokesperson in the case, United States of America v. Michael Espy, the corruption trial of the former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. As a lawyer in private practice, he has represented companies such as General Motors, Smith & Wesson, and Wal-Mart in state and Federal courts. He has been an attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission, an Assistant General Counsel with the General Motors Corporation, Deputy Wayne County Corporation Counsel, and an Air Force judge advocate. He has been a legal commentator for Court TV and Channel 4 News (Detroit). Mr. Noakes has taught at the University of Chicago Law School, Grand Valley State University’s Seidman College of Business, Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business, and the University of Michigan – Dearborn, where he currently teaches corporate social responsibility. He received his BA from the University of Notre Dame and the M.A. and J.D. degrees from the University of Chicago. Answering the call to preach, he studied theology at Southern Methodist University’s Perkins School of Theology and is an Assistant Minister at the Greater Christ Baptist Church on Detroit’s eastside.    Why are you running? Because I believe I’m the only candidate who can truly transform the nature of this city. The word ‘transformation’ is easy to use, but it’s very difficult to do for if you’ve never done it. And where I’m coming from, I don’t understand how they (Mayor Mike Duggan and WCE Warren Evans) can truly be transformative when they are simply an extension of what’s always been. Both Duggan and Evans come from the line of Ed McNamara. But really what I’m talking about is looking at the experiences I’ve had over the years that have [resulted in] transformation. I was executive vice president of Meijer in Grand Rapids. By 2003 we faced a crisis. The company seriously had the possibility of going out of business. Because the competition from WalMart and others was so severe. And we went through what was called a transformation effort, which meant we looked at everything we did, we looked at every operation, we looked at how people worked together, and ultimately we put together a team of people from across the entire company. …And one of the first things we had to do was figure out how we were going to reduce our cost basis. And it turned out we were one of the higher cost retailers in the district… and going at that pace we couldn’t compete with Walmart. We’d be out of business in perhaps three years? Four years? [they had to reduce their costs dramatically over a three-year period]   What is it going to take?  How do you address the people [issue]. Because that’s the real big issue here in the City of Detroit, people are talking about, well, we’re building new buildings and we’re getting new development, but ultimately nobody’s talking about how do we change the mindset of people and about people. Because I can give somebody who doesn’t have the right mindset a brand new house, and I dare you to tell me that house will be maintained if they’ve never had a house. So the question is how do we change the mindset of the people who appear to be left behind and change the mindset of those who are coming in and are running things about the people who are not them. And so part of what I’m talking about is investing in people. I mean, nobody’s going to come here because of a new stadium. You might get some investment from local folks, but you’re not going to get a significant investment. No company is going to come from Silicon Valley, or someplace similar to that, here, unless they see that 1) there’s a viable workforce, a viable well-trained workforce and 2) that it’s a safe environment, and 3) it’s a place that people find interesting to be in. But the main thing is how do you invest in people? How do you inspire them?   So how do you do that?  Well the first thing is you talk to them. Not at them, not talk around them, not talk about them, but actually be with them. One of the things I’ve learned over the years is to sit and listen to folks and hear what they have to say, and find out what’s on their minds. They aren’t going to listen to your plan unless they know that you are listening to them. So many politicians do a great job of talking and making promises that pretty much go unkept. But they don’t really listen to the people. I’m not the most powerful orator, and I clearly won’t be the best-financed candidate, but I will be the one that will listen. Perhaps better than anybody else. Because that’s where the message is.   When you talk to people during your campaign, what are you hearing?  The great part of the city has been ignored. The second part that I hear, largely from fellow ministers is that they can’t understand the drainage fees that are suddenly being charged . Someone who was once paying $750 per acre is now paying 10 times that. And they’re talking about the real issue of whether or not the churches will have to leave the city. Because they won’t be able to pay the drainage fees. And their concern is we gave away the water. We gave away control of the water, which Detroit had for many years. Another concern is crime, and more than anything else it’s the homicide rate. Yes, certain crimes are down, but the crime that concerns people the most is homicide. Detroit had more than 300 homicides in the year 2016. New York City, which is maybe 10 times the size of Detroit or more? They had 332 homicides. Now, that’s quite a comparison. Now they can talk about how they are solving crime, but that’s the stat that matters the most. Now somebody gets killed in Midtown, and they go all out, and the people that live in Midtown are calling into the police and making complaints and the police are responding with increased policing. Not too long ago, three people were killed on the east side. It barely was noticed.   How do you address that?  Well the first thing you want do is to look at what resources we have and how do we allocate those resources. And one of the best ways to allocate resources is to begin with how do we use predictive policing through technology? Many bigger cities, they can predict where crime is going to occur, and then they allocate resources according to where the hot spots are. The other way is to actually have police live in the city. That’s been a concern, and there’s been a court case saying you can’t make police officers live in the city. But what if we incentivized officers to live in the city? What if we said we will pay you a slightly higher rate if you lived in the city? There may be a problem with that, I don’t know. But what if we explored that?

(Target Corp. via AP) By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK — In a move to bring shoppers back to its stores, Target is embarking on an ambitious redesign aimed at helping people who need to dash in for milk to get out quickly while encouraging those who want to wander the aisles to linger. The new layout was unveiled by CEO Brian Cornell in Las Vegas Monday. It will feature a separate entrance and 10-minute parking for shoppers looking to pick up an online order or some essentials. New center aisles will be curved rather than squared off, to inspire people to explore, says Mark Schindele, senior vice president of Target Properties. LED track lighting will replace fluorescent fixtures, and brand boutiques meant to replicate a specialty-store feel will showcase rotating looks. The first of the redesigned stores will open in suburban Houston this fall. About 40 more stores will get the remodel treatment by October, using the Houston prototype as a template. More than 600 of Target’s 1,800 total locations are scheduled for updates over the next three years. It expects the remodeled stores to see a 2 percent to 4 percent sales bump. “We wanted the design to be flexible because that is what shopping is all about,” Schindele told The Associated Press. The remodeling is a key part of Target Corp.’s strategy to win back shoppers and rev up sales. Unlike rival Wal-Mart, which has drawn more customers and notched higher sales at established stores, Target has seen three straight quarters of declines for that sales measure, and fewer shoppers in its stores. Investing in stores is an acknowledgement that the in-person experience remains important, even as Amazon and other online retailers draw shoppers away from traditional retailers. At an investor meeting last month Target executives spoke bluntly about the shabbiness of many of the chain’s stores. It pledged to spend $7 billion on the remodeling plan and to accelerate its expansion of small-format stores, bolster its online operations, and launch new brands. “We’ve got to reimagine that store experience,” Cornell said then. “Today’s millennial shopper doesn’t enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that hasn’t been touched in 10 years.” Target has also tested new store designs in Dallas and Los Angeles, but Houston’s is the most ambitious store redesign to date. Last fall, Target launched an initiative in 25 stores in Los Angeles where it tested an updated grocery presentation with new lighting and foods to prepare single meal displayed together. The new grocery presentation was later rolled out in 16 Dallas stores. Cornell said shopper feedback in Dallas and Los Angeles has been good. The Houston prototype’s separate entrances for shoppers in a hurry and those who aren’t is among its biggest novelties. The entrance on the right will have a dedicated pickup counter for online orders. Shoppers will also have the option of having their order brought to their car. Groceries, wine and liquor will be located here, rather than in the back where they’re usually found. Seasonal essentials, like school supplies in the fall, will also be found nearby. Shoppers using the “inspiration” entrance on the left will see the brand name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion. Beauty, jewelry and accessories departments will be nearby. There will also be seating outside of Starbucks. An area to hold store events will be located between the two entrances. Target will tweak the format based on shoppers’ responses. “This represents our current thinking,” Schindele said, “but we are going to learn a lot.” SpeedVegas driving...Galaxy Theatres expects to...   Submit a News Tip Most Popular Javier Righetti sentenced to death for rape and murder of 15-year-old Alyssa Otremba SpeedVegas driving instructor sues to close Las Vegas track Sandoval’s first veto of 2017 session rejects voter registration initiative Las Vegas police say incident at Summerlin Hospital was ‘false alarm’ Henderson police arrest middle school teacher on suspicion of indecency toward minors Columnists Features Victor Joecks 3 things to watch for on Legislative Session Day 46   Wayne Allyn Root COMMENTARY: Renaming McCarran International Airport after Harry Reid would be a branding disaster   Victor Joecks 3 things to watch for on Legislative Session Day 45   Steve Sebelius When it comes to Nevada’s public records, the press just needs to show a little more trust   More Columnists NFL Team Bar Directory Here is the Review-Journal's 2016 directory of NFL team bars in the Las Vegas area.   Electric Daisy Carnival The world’s largest dance music event   Hockey in Vegas A look at NHL expansion news in the Silver State.   Neon Rebirth The post-recession American Dream in Las Vegas   More Features   CALENDAR THU 23 FRI 24 SAT 25 SUN 26 MON 27 TUE 28 WED 29 A All Week   Loading...

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Sturbridge selectman apologizes for 'no-fly list' remark Monday Mar 20, 2017 at 8:01 PM Mar 20, 2017 at 8:01 PM Craig S. Semon Telegram & Gazette Staff @CraigSemon STURBRIDGE – A selectman made a formal apology Monday for an offhand remark he made two weeks earlier to a businessman during a board meeting.  On March 6, Ritesh Patel of Northbridge went before selectmen seeking a new common victualler license for the Subway shop inside Wal-Mart at 100 Charlton Road.  Selectman Craig A. Moran asked if Mr. Patel completed his Training for Intervention Procedures certification, which is a state requirement for sellers and servers of alcohol, when he should have asked if he completed his ServSafe training, meaning Massachusetts Food Protection Manager Training certification.  When a selectman playfully asked Mr. Moran what Subway does he go to that serves alcohol, Mr. Patel said alcohol is served at a sandwich shop at Logan Airport in boston. Mr. Moran made a joke that Mr. Patel would know this because he probably spends a lot of time sitting around airport lounges and the reason why he probably has so much time is because he’s on the “no-fly list.” Although Mr. Moran didn't continue, the "no-fly list" is a small subset of the U.S. government Terrorist Screening Database (also known as the terrorist watchlist) that contains information on known or suspected terrorists.  Monday, Mr. Moran didn't address that comment directly. He said his comment had been taken out of context and there was no malice intended, and Mr. Moran apologized and acknowledged that his comment could be taken in a different way than he intended.  “I wish to apologize for a comment I made at the last Board of Selectmen’s meeting where Mr. Patel came before the board seeking a transfer of a license for a local business,” Mr. Moran said. “I used a phrase in our talks during the meeting … which could have been taken, in hindsight, in a different light than in the context that I used it. Therefore, I must apologize to Mr. Patel and to the board, town residents and anyone else who may be offended by this comment. It was not used with any malice or ill intentions on my part.”  Selectman Priscilla C. Gimas, who was chairing the meeting and brought the matter to the newspaper, thanked Mr. Moran for his statement. Previously, she said, she received seven complaints about Mr. Moran’s comments. She would not name those who complained. Selectman Mary B. Dowling, who was also at the previous meeting but had no comment for the newspaper last week, thanked Mr. Moran for his apology and went on to say, “Personally, in my interactions with Craig on the board, he has always treated everybody very evenhandedly, fairly, regardless of a person’s race, ethnicity, gender.”  Initially, Mr. Patel, who is from India and is Hindu, said he missed the comment that Mr. Moran made. But, being made aware of it, and after watching a tape of the meeting online, Mr. Patel said he understands how people could be offended, especially with the current climate in the United States.  After a newspaper representative read Mr. Moran’s apology to Mr. Patel over the phone Monday night, Mr. Patel, who was driving to New York at the time, said he has to think about whether he is satisfied with Mr. Moran’s apology and whether the apology was enough.

Forbes calculated Adelson’s net worth at $30.4 billion, a $1.4 billion decline from the value that placed him No. 14 on Forbes’ list of 400 richest Americans in 2016. The 83-year-old CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., the largest casino company in America, has the highest net worth among rivals in the casino business. The next-highest, Lui Che Woo of Macau casino-operator Galaxy Entertainment, is at at No. 109 with $12.1 billion. Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas developer behind The Mirage,Treasure Island,Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas, ranked No. 814 with $2.5 billion. The 75-year-old opened Wynn Palace in Macau in August and broke ground that month on the $2.4 billion Wynn Boston Harbor. Despite those accomplishments, his net worth is the lowest showing on the list since 2013. He peaked on the 2014 list with $3.8 billion. Wynn Resorts co-founder Elaine Wynn, the ex-wife of Steve Wynn, ranked No. 1,161 with $1.8 billion. Elaine Wynn, 74, saw a peak net worth in 2014 with $2.7 billion, according to Forbes. Adelson and Wynn casino rival Phillip Ruffin tied Steve Wynn in rank and net worth. Ruffin, 82, co-owns Trump International in Las Vegas and doubled the value of Treasure Island after he bought it in 2009. PROFITING FROM SALE Brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III saw a boost in net worth from the sale of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Lorenzo, 48, and Frank, 55, bought the mixed martial arts promoter in 2001 for $2 million and sold it for $4 billion in 2016. They tied at No. 1,030 on the list with $2 billion in net worth. On last year’s list, Forbes reported their net worth at $1.4 billion. The brothers are also known for Red Rock Resorts. The brothers were bested by their cousin Tilman Fertitta, who ranked No. 693 with $2.9 billion. The Texas-based billionaire owns Golden Nugget Casinos as well as restaurants Landry’s Seafood and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and has a show on CNBC. Las Vegans and Panda Express owners Andrew and Peggy Cherng ranked No. 630 with $3.1 billion in net worth, a peak value since Forbes reported their net worth as $2 billion in 2013. Henderson resident Nancy Walton Laurie, whose father founded Wal-Mart with her uncle Sam Walton, ranked No. 402 with $4.3 billion. The 65-year-old’s cousin, Wal-Mart board member Rob Walton, ranked No. 15 with $34.1 billion. The company has a couple of projects under construction in the valley, including a new store in the southwest valley and a return center west of Nellis Air Force Base. The richest man on the list? Microsoft founder Bill Gates, 61, with $86 billion, a high from when Forbes reported he had $79.2 billion in 2015. The Review-Journal is owned by the family of Las Vegas Sands Corp.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Site Archive log in weather Hanover Mall owner, selectmen talk tax incentives Tuesday Mar 21, 2017 at 8:41 PM Mar 21, 2017 at 8:43 PM Adam Silva adsilva@wickedlocal.com @AdamSMariner HANOVER – Selectmen want to make sure that the new owner of the Hanover Mall is in it for the long haul. Representatives from PECO Real Estate Partners made another trip east from Parma, Ohio, to discuss tax incentives during the selectmen’s meeting Monday night. The tax-increment financing agreement the two sides are working on would allow PECO to pay reduced taxes on the property. The company would commit to putting $40 million into the property. Town residents will vote on the agreement in the annual town election May 6. What the tax rate would be and the length of the agreement have not been determined. “It’s the basis of the negotiation,” Town Manager Troy Clarkson said. “As with any negotiation, it’s our attempt to get to that sweet spot that is beneficial to the developer and protects the financial interests of the town. We’re trying to get to that point where they can monetize enough money that makes the agreement worthwhile and where the town also realizes some tax benefit from the property.” Selectmen Vice Chairwoman Susan Setterland said, “There’s still a lot more negotiating that needs to take place before this can go forward and gets accepted, but it looks like it’s a positive, and more of the residents need to be educated on what the positives are for both sides. It has to be explained, and it has to be realistic for all of us.” A specific timeline as to when changes will be made – or made public – is not available yet. Its’s something residents asked about during the “meet the new mall owners” party held Feb. 28 at Quan’s Kitchen. PECO chief development officer Mark Wilhoite said in January that the company is looking at a variety of options, all of which would probably require some or most of the mall to be torn down. The mall's anchor stores – Macy’s, Walmart and Sears – could stay put, but nothing is definite, meaning any store in the mall could change or close, Wilhoite said. PECO purchased the Hanover Mall for $39.5 million from CW Capital Asset Management of Needham in November 2016. CW Capital bought the property at foreclosure in 2010 for $36.7 million. The mall was built in 1971 and last renovated in 2004. Until the redevelopment plans are finalized, the mall will stay as it is, with the current mall management intact, PECO has said.

Hyperledger Fabric, which has been the fastest growing Linux Foundation open-source project, has moved from incubator status and has now released on the IBM cloud as version 1.0, and is making its way through the standardising process. The first instance of this network will run on IBM's High Security Business Network, which allows companies to exploit the technology while benefiting from IBM hardware acceleration, scalability and data protection tools. The blockchain network service will help companies wishing to develop their own blockchain networks, which can then be hosted and managed on the IBM Cloud. As the service operates with an assurance certification level of EAL5+, this makes the technology ready for use in highly regulated industries such as government departments, financial services and healthcare. The service is also built on the Hyperledger project, a scheme that aims to establish some standards and rules for the construction of blockchain networks.  "We think for a blockchain network, which is really about a community and ecosystem, that it has to be open," said IBM Blockchain general manager, Marie Wieck. "It has to be open from a standards face, it has to be open source, but most importantly it has to be about the community. The more participants you have around a blockchain network, the more value, the more insights, the more transactional capability you derive from that ecosystem." "We also firmly believe it has to be a trusted network model," added Wieck. "We are not heavily invested or pursuing cryptocurrency related approaches, but we believe that there is value from that business and enterprise interaction. That whole notion of trusted exchange, secure transaction, protection of your data, we also think is fundamentally important." "We believe the important aspect right now is that it is ready for business, that we're really focused on enterprise use cases in terms of how that gets deployed." Blockchain use cases IBM has had over 400 engagements with clients globally across a number of industries, including healthcare, government, financial services, and supply chains. IBM is currently working alongside Walmart to help bring blockchain services to its supply chain, specifically in improving the traceability of pork being shipped from China to the US. IBM Blockchain has also been applied to the US Food and Drug Administration, helping to create a trusted network for the sharing of information relating to pharmaceutical trials while maintaining the anonymity of patients. The news appeared alongside a host of partnership announcements, one of the first being a deal with SecureKey, a Canadian based company specialising in social data, which has worked with the Bank of Canada in creating shareable citizen data stored in blockchains. "We ran a network for the bank of Canada, where we had millions of Canadians who would log in to see their taxes and unemployment benefits using their trusted bank login as a way to make it simpler," said Greg Wolfond, founder and CEO of SecureKey. "The problem we set out to solve is when a person is asked to prove who they are, there is still tons of friction and tons of questions they can't answer." The idea is for the technology to replace endless form filling and the need to prove your identity when applying for loans or renting accommodation, with the ability for users to grant access to specific data stored within IBM's Blockchain network. The deal will expand on this work to apply the model to broader blockchain networks and use cases. IBM Blockchain for Hyperledger Fabric is now available through a beta program on IBM's Bluemix platform. See related  What is blockchain?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 22 March 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Inside Amazon’s battle to break into the US$800bil grocery market Ambitious: Amazon's goal is to become a Top Five grocery retailer by 2025. — Bloomberg “Very wasteful” isn’t a phrase usually associated with Amazon.com Inc., which is so cost-conscious it once removed the light bulbs from its cafeteria’s vending machines. But after spending several months analysing the online retailer’s grocery-shipping hubs back in 2014, that’s exactly how a mechanical engineering student described its approach to selling bananas. Workers at Amazon Fresh, the company’s grocery-delivery business, threw away about a third of the bananas it purchased because the service only sold the fruit in bunches of five, the student concluded. Employees trimmed each bunch down to size and chucked the excess. The research paper by Vrajesh Modi, who now works for Boston Consulting Group, highlighted other problems: Poorly trained employees often stood around with nothing to do. Moldy strawberries were frequently returned by disappointed customers. Amazon’s inspectors believed their corporate bosses didn’t care much about the quality of the food. Such challenges linger for Amazon. Despite several attempts to break into the US$800bil (RM3.5tril) grocery industry and almost a decade in the business, the company has struggled to entice shoppers en masse to buy eggs, steaks and berries online the same way they’ve flocked to buy books, tablets and toys. “Online grocery is failing,” said Kurt Jetta, chief executive officer of TABS Analytics, a consumer products research firm. Only 4.5% of shoppers made frequent online grocery purchases in 2016, up just slightly from 4.2% four years earlier despite big investments from companies such as Amazon, according to the firm’s annual surveys. “There’s just not a lot of demand there. The whole premise is that you’re saving people a trip to the store, but people actually like going to the store to buy groceries.” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos now seems to understand that he can’t win the grocery game with websites, warehouses and trucks alone. The world’s biggest online retailer sees brick-and-mortar stores playing a key role in a renewed grocery push, documents reviewed by Bloomberg show. And like it did with Amazon Fresh, the company is launching its newest projects in Seattle, its home town. Last Tuesday, men in cherry pickers worked through driving rain to affix “Amazon Fresh” signs to a drive-in grocery location in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood, where shoppers can stop and have online orders loaded into their cars. Crews were busy on a similar site south of downtown, readying canopies over parking spaces to protect customers from the elements as they pick up their shopping bags. The secretive company has yet to announce the projects, and crews have covered the Amazon signs in black fabric and paper. Late last year, Amazon purchased supply-chain software from LLamasoft Inc.â“ a major departure for a company known for its logistics prowess, and defying an internal mantra of “we don’t buy, we build.” And it more recently restructured how various grocery teams were managed to narrow their focus and set clear priorities, according to people familiar with the company’s business. These changes come as Amazon breaks from its standard formula of shipping products in boxes out of jam-packed warehouses. Instead, it will invite shoppers inside its own grocery stores to smell the oranges, see the tomatoes and tap the watermelons. Ahead of a national rollout next year, Amazon is testing three brick-and-mortar grocery formats in Seattle - convenience stores called Amazon Go, the drive-in grocery kiosks, and a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. The company may open as many as 2,000 stores, according to internal documents. The company has said little about its grocery-store plans, aside from a video about Amazon Go’s no-checkout format that has racked up more than 8.7 million views on YouTube. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. Reports on its moves have dribbled out over the past several months, prompting occasional denials and retorts from the company. Seattle technology site Geekwire in August uncovered Amazon’s mysterious drive-in grocery kiosk in Ballard. The New York Post in February said Amazon aimed to create “robot-run supermarkets” that would operate with only a few people. Bezos responded by tweeting to the Post: “Whoever your anonymous sources are on this story – they’ve mixed up their meds!” Amazon’s goal is to become a Top Five grocery retailer by 2025, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would require more than US$30bil (RM132.8bil) in annual food and beverage spending through its sites, up from US$8.7bil (RM38.5bil) – including Amazon Fresh and all other food and drink sales – in 2016, according to Cowen &amp; Co. Reaching that milestone would require a new wave of store and warehouse investments around the country, costing billions of dollars. That’s an existential change for Amazon, which initially stayed away from perishable goods and has mostly avoided the overhead of physical stores since it started in 1994. “A bunch of smart people at Amazon have been thinking about re-imagining the next phase of physical retail,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon executive who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. “They want more share of the wallet, and habitual, frequent use of Amazon for groceries is the ultimate goal.” For Amazon shoppers interested in buying groceries online, the company’s current offerings can be confusing. Amazon Fresh is available in about 20 US cities for those paying US$14.99 (RM66.50) a month. Amazon Pantry lets shoppers buy crackers, cookies, chips, coffee and other non-perishables for a delivery fee of US$5.99 (RM26.50) per box. Amazon’s speedy drop-off service, Prime Now, offers items from local grocers in some cities, but no major chains. Its stick-on Dash Buttons let people order many household products - including some groceries, but not fresh food - with a finger tap. And Subscribe &amp; Save offers discounts to Amazon customers who sign up for periodic delivery of laundry detergent, toothpaste, diapers, paper towels and other items frequently purchased in grocery stores. The various initiatives have been a source of increasing internal tension as employees on different projects compete to sell the same things, according to a person familiar with the matter. One problem saddling Amazon Fresh is the high cost of losses caused by food going bad, an issue it’s never faced with books and toys. For conventional grocery sellers, browning bananas can be sold at a discount to smoothie-makers and bread bakers. Chicken breasts nearing their expiration dates can be marked down. With Amazon Fresh, such items must be discarded or are returned by frustrated customers, according to a person familiar with the matter. That has meant Amazon Fresh has lost money from spoilage at more than double the rate for a typical supermarket, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal operations. The main reason Amazon began delivering groceries through Prime Now was to hand that risk back to the local grocers to lower Amazon’s costs. The company didn’t originally anticipate the scope or difficulty of these problems because so few people working on its grocery push have experience in the industry. “Grocery is the most alluring and treacherous category,” said Nadia Shouraboura, a former Amazon executive whose company, Hointer, has been working on redefining in-store grocery shopping for the past 18 months. “It lures inventors and retailers with shopping volume and frequency, and then sinks them with low margin.” Beyond grocery, Amazon executives have also discussed opening consumer electronics stores to showcase its gadgets and better compete with Best Buy Co., according to three people familiar with the plan. For years, Amazon executives have discussed the downside of an online-only strategy, mostly with regard to a lack of places for shoppers to try out Kindle electronic readers, the voice-activated Echo speaker and its defunct Fire smartphone. Amazon considered holding events similar to Tupperware parties when it introduced its first Kindle in 2007, fearing the products would languish unseen, Jacobson said. The handful of bookstores Amazon has opened around the country double as gadget showrooms, similar to the Apple Store. Long term, a stronger grocery business could position Amazon to become a wholesale food-distribution business serving supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, hotels, hospitals and schools. But first the company has to find a way to get more people to think of Amazon when stocking their refrigerators and pantries. A group of Amazon executives met late last year to discuss the disadvantage Amazon faced compared with grocery competitors such as Wal-Mart and Kroger because of its lack of physical stores and customer apprehension about buying fresh foods online. They decided they needed something more to jump-start Amazon’s grocery push beyond plans already under way for the Amazon Go convenience store, modeled for urban areas, and drive-in grocery pick-up stations suited for the suburbs. They worked out plans for a third approach: grocery stores closer in size to a Trader Joe’s than a Wal-Mart to offer easy access to milk, eggs and produce.  Other items like paper towels, cereal, canned goods and dish detergent would be stocked on-site in a warehouse where they could be easily packed and delivered to shoppers at the location, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. It would also serve as a delivery hub for online orders. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who joined Amazon in 2015 and most recently worked on its Amazon Fresh and Pantry expansions, wrote about such a store prior to joining Amazon in an academic paper called A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths. Ladd envisioned two-story buildings where shoppers browse produce, bread and other fresh items on the ground level while their orders for paper towels, canned goods and cereal are packed in a warehouse above. “The stores will have the capability to fulfill online orders placed by customers within a specific radius of the store,” he wrote. “Amazon drivers and/or contractors will be assigned to deliver groceries.” The executives decided such a store would be worth pursuing for Amazon Fresh and ordered further research about ideal locations, how to integrate the stores with grocery delivery, and the use of automation to reduce overhead. Site selection for this store’s first model is happening now in Seattle, according to a person familiar with the plan. Meanwhile, the first wave of its new grocery experiment, Amazon Go, was unveiled in December and for now is only open to employees while the systems are tested. Cameras and sensors monitor shoppers who scan their smartphones upon entering, allowing them to grab items like sandwiches, yogurt, drinks and snacks and automatically pay for them without a checkout kiosk. Products are embedded with tracking devices that pair with customers’ phones to charge their accounts. Weight-sensitive shelves tell Amazon when to restock. A patent filed by Amazon in 2014 suggests it could use facial-recognition technology to identify and then automatically charge in-store shoppers. In its video touting Amazon Go, the company said it was aiming to open the site to the public in “early 2017,” and it hasn’t provided an update to that timing. But the technology has been crashing in tests when the store gets too crowded and requires human quality control, people watching video images to make sure customers are charged for the right things, according to a person familiar with the plan. Beyond letting customers skip lines, the technology gives Amazon valuable data, said Guru Hariharan, founder of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Even if customers don’t purchase everything they touch, there’s value in understanding what shoppers consider but don’t ultimately buy, he said. That makes it worthwhile for Amazon to work through the kinks in the technology. “It takes a lot of time and experimentation to work through unpredictable scenarios like a child picking up an item or a person wearing sunglasses or a face muffler,” he said. At the same time, recent work and construction permits indicate the new drive-in grocery kiosk in Ballard could open any day. “Amazon wants to be the first thing any consumer thinks of when they need to buy anything,” said Jim Hertel, a senior vice president at marketing technology company Inmar Inc. “Food is the largest retail category. They can’t do what they want to do without grocery and they’re definitely not going to give up.” —  Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Three ways to protect social media accounts from pirates and hackers Geely pulls out of buying Malaysia’s Proton, as its profits surge by 126% Maybank and CIMB to enable Alipay mobile wallet in Malaysia Doctors no different from soldiers Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Mark Lennihan/AP | Caption Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen March 21, 2017 —Whether you are in a pinch for time or have time to kill, Target wants to have a store entrance for you. The big-box retailer plans to redesign 600 stores to offer two separate entrances, beginning this fall, it announced at an e-commerce conference in Las Vegas on Monday. One entrance will have the time-crunched customer in mind, with groceries, self-checkout aisles, and a counter for online orders all near the front. The other entrance will be built for the browser, with curved center aisles filled with home, apparel, and beauty products. The billions of dollars Target plans to spend on this ambitious redesign is part of a trend among brick-and-mortar giants to try to keep pace with consumer demands in the age of online shopping. These retailers were slow to adapt during the dot-com era, say analysts. But as they play catch up, they are discovering the customer wants it both ways: in-store pickup when they want a product fast or don’t want to pay extra for shipping, and in-store shopping when they want to linger down aisles in their spare time. “The future of retail is digital. And people will also be shopping in stores for a long, long time,” Target board chairman and chief executive Brian Cornell said in his keynote speech on Monday at the Shoptalk conference, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Today, roughly 30 million people stop in a Target store each week, the Star-Tribune reports – but that could quickly change. Can you handle adulthood? Take our domestic survival quiz! "Whatever it's going to go be, it's still going to be a really big number. So that means we need to keep investing in our stores to give guests every possible reason to shop," Mr. Cornell said. The first new Target to feature this redesign will be in the Houston suburb of Richmond, scheduled to open in October, according to a press release. Also scheduled for October is the renovation of 40 additional stores. The idea is to offer customers the best of both worlds when time permits. Those short on time or just wishing to get in and out would be able to use one entrance specifically for them. These shoppers can park in a 10-minute space, find groceries and other essentials at the front of the store, and pay either in self-checkout aisles or ahead of time online.   Customers in the mood to linger can use the second “inspiration” entrance. Filling the curved aisles will be brand-name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion, as well as beauty, jewelry, and accessories departments nearby, according to the Associated Press.  “We wanted the design to be flexible because that is what shopping is all about," Mark Schindele, the senior vice president of Target Properties, told the Associated Press. Target expects this redesign to bump sales 2 to 4 percent. The corporation struggled through parts of 2016, at the time blaming its missed sales targets on a decline in Apple iPhone demands and grocery business, along with management shakeups, according to The New York Times. But in an investor meeting last month, executives were candid about the shabbiness of many of Target’s stores. Ryan McDevitt, an economics professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, sees Target’s plan as an attempt to recapture the ground it lost over the past decade to variety and convenience stores, as well as Amazon.   “Consumers used to feel there was value at Target. It was sophisticated, and had pretty high-quality items at a low price,” Dr. McDevitt tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview on Tuesday. “For the new generation of shoppers, they don’t see that value any longer. The stores are worn out, and haven’t been updated for a long time. If they want a quick item, they go to a Dollar or convenience store. They’re not going to trek out to this big-box store retailer.” McDevitt says it may be too late for Target to lure back customers in cities with Amazon’s two-hour Prime Now delivery service or high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. But suburban areas without such services may stand a chance, he adds. Consumer habits have been changing rapidly since everything from books, to pet food, to flat-screen TVs became available online during the dot-com era. While the burst of that bubble shook the e-commerce landscape, that industry has since settled into a hybrid, in which consumers want the option to buy online when they need to, wander when time permits, and click and pickup purchases when they don’t want to wait for shipping or want to see the product in person. Target, Walmart, and other traditional retailers were slow to catch on to this "omnichannel" trend, wrote Darrell Rigby, a partner at Bain & Company who heads the firm's Global Retail practice, in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review. At that time, wrote Mr. Rigby, online revenue accounted for less than 2 percent of revenue at Target and Walmart. In the first quarter of 2016, retail sales accounted for 3.5 percent of Target’s sales, according to The Washington Post. This increase follows Target investing $1 billion in 2015 to bolster its e-commerce offerings, which includes everything from grocery delivery, to ship from store, and click and collect, according to CNBC. With this redesign announced Monday, it appears Target is looking to especially take advantage of in-store pickup. Click and collect allows customers to order online and pick up in stores, combining the best of both worlds: speed, quick comparisons, and the chance to reconsider an item in person. Retailers like it because they are finding customers don’t leave their wallets in their pockets when they go to the pickup counter. During the 2015 holiday season, for instance, 69 percent of shoppers who used click and collect purchased additional items while picking it up in store, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers’ Holiday Consumer Purchasing Trends, as CNBC reported. While 41 percent of retailers offered in-store pickup in 2015, 78 percent planned then to implement it within the next three years, according to a survey by Boston Retail Partners. But Target’s redesign also seeks to take advantage of Americans' shifting attitudes about how to spend their money.   Data released by the Commerce Department in 2015 showed American consumers are spending their extra money on restaurants, upgrading their cars or houses, sports gear, health, and beauty, according to The New York Times. “The religion of consumption has proven to be unfulfilling. The ‘pile it high and watch it fly’ mentality at department stores no longer works,” Richard Jaffe, a retailing analyst at investment firm Stifel Nicolaus, told the Times. “It’s becoming more and more about the experience – whether it’s going to a festival or sharing a car ride or going to a new city.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

While this may be where the garment was finally sewn together, it has already been to several other countries. In fact, it's quite possible this piece of clothing is better travelled than you. If it was human, it would have certainly journeyed far enough to have earned itself some decent air miles. The material used to create it came from lyocell - a sustainable alternative to cotton. The trees used to make this fibre come mainly from Europe, according to Lenzing, the Austrian supplier that Zara-owner Inditex uses. These fibres were shipped to Egypt, where they were spun into yarn. This yarn was then sent to China where it was woven into a fabric. This fabric was then sent to Spain where it was dyed, in this case pink. The fabric was then shipped to Morocco to be cut into the various parts of the dress and then sewn together. After this, it was sent back to Spain where it was packaged and then sent to the UK, the US or any one of the 93 countries where Inditex has shops. From dresses to t-shirts and trousers, most items of clothing sold around the world will have had similarly complicated journeys. In fact, they're likely to be even more convoluted. Inditex around the world 6,298 factories 1,725 suppliers 7,000+ shops 93 countries 60% of clothes are made in or close to its Spanish HQ Source: Inditex Getty Images Most Inditex garments are made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. This is what helps the firm achieve its famously fast reaction times to new trends. Most of its rivals' supply chains are far less local. Regardless of where they're based, most factories are not owned by the fashion brands that use them. Instead, they're selected as official suppliers. Often these suppliers subcontract work to other factories for certain tasks, or in order to meet tight deadlines. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Your cotton top may well have started out in a field in Texas before criss-crossing the globe This system can make tracking the specific origins of a single item difficult. I contacted several big clothing brands including H&M, Marks and Spencer, Gap and Arcadia Group last week to give me a sample example of the journey of a t-shirt in their basic range from seed to finished product. Only Inditex was able to respond in time to meet the deadline for this article. "I imagine companies don't want to respond because they have no clue where the materials they buy come from," says Tim Hunt, a researcher at Ethical Consumer, which researches the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of firms. The difficulties were highlighted devastatingly by the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster where more than 1,100 people were killed and 2,500 injured when the Bangladesh garment factory collapsed. In some cases, brands weren't even aware their clothes were being produced there. Image copyright Fashion revolution Image caption The #whomademyclothes campaign encourages customers to put pressure on fashion firms to be more open about their suppliers According to the "Behind the Barcode" report by Christian Aid and development organisation Baptist World Aid Australia, only 16% of the 87 biggest fashion brands publish a full list of the factories where their clothes are sewn, and less than a fifth of brands know where all of their zips, buttons, thread and fabric come from. Non-profit group Fashion Revolution, formed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse, is leading a campaign to try to force firms to be more transparent about their supply chains. Every year, around the time of the disaster it runs a #whomademyclothes campaign encouraging customers to push firms on this issue. Fashion Revolution co-founder and creative director Orsola de Castro says the mass production demands of the fashion industry and the tight timescales required to get products from the catwalks on to the shelves as quickly as possible means the manufacturing processes have become "very, very chaotic". "The amount of manpower which goes into the production of a t-shirt - even at the sewing level, it goes through so many different hands. On their standard products most brands wouldn't know the journey from seed to store," she says. While newer and smaller fashion brands are creating products with 100% traceability, she says it's a lot harder for the established giants. "It's a big and complex issue to turn around and would require a massive shift in attitude." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pietra Rivoli travelled from the US to China and Africa to track the journey of a single $6 t-shirt Yet just over a decade ago, Pietra Rivoli had no problems tracking the journey of a single $6 cotton t-shirt she'd picked out of a sale bin in a Walmart in Florida. Starting with the tag at the back of the t-shirt, she tracked its journey backwards from the US "step by step along the supply chain". "A shoe leather project," is how Prof Rivoli describes her journey, which resulted in a book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy. As a teacher of finance and international business at Georgetown University in Washington, Prof Rivoli wanted to investigate her assumption that free trade benefited all countries. Image copyright Pietra Rivoli Image caption Pietra Rivoli says the current backlash against global trade is linked to political interference Her travels took her from the cotton-growing region of Lubbock in Texas to China, where the t-shirt was sewn together. Eventually, she ended up in Tanzania on the east coast of Africa, which has a thriving second-hand clothing market. Her assumption was that the complicated supply chain was driven by cost and market forces. She concluded that a lot of brands' decisions about where to buy supplies and make their clothing was actually driven by politics. She cites US agricultural subsidies for cotton growers and China's migration policies encouraging workers to move from the countryside as examples. "Rather than a story of how people were competing - how do I make a faster T-shirt, a better T-shirt, a cheaper T-shirt - what I found is that the story of the T-shirt and why its life turned out the way it did was really about how people were using political power," she says. The current backlash against global trade is a direct result of this kind of political interference, she believes. This kind of consumer anger could eventually drive change among fashion firms, she says. Prof Rivoli notes that many firms now list all their direct suppliers and she says there is a move towards developing fewer, longer term supplier relationships. "There might be a little less hopping around," she laughs.

The company first announced in February plans to shutter 130 to 140 stores, joining other major department store chains whose operations have been affected by changing shopping patterns and online competition. The Medford store in the Rogue Valley Mall was not on the list. Sarah Holland, a spokesperson at the company's corporate headquarters in Plano, Texas, said about 25 employees will be affected at the Grants Pass location. The Grants Pass Shopping Center store joins locations in Astoria, La Grande, Pendleton and The Dalles as ones marked for closure in Oregon, as the company takes steps to advance sustainable growth and long-term profitability. The liquidation process is scheduled to begin April 17, with closures occurring in mid-June. Sharon Armstrong, a shopper at the Grants Pass store Friday, said she heard the news earlier in the day and wasn't too happy about it. She doesn't like to shop at Wal-Mart, and likes the quality of Penney's better than Fred Meyer. "Do I want Penney's to leave — no I don't," Armstrong said. "I also didn't want to see Gottschalks leave." Will she make the trip to Medford to shop at Penney's? "I probably will," said Armstrong. "The drive wouldn't be as annoying as driving the same distance in San Francisco." Shopper Alice Romick of Grants Pass said she was sad to hear the news and sad that the shopping center continues to lose stores. "Penney's is one of the only places in town to shop for someone my age," said Romick, who said she was in her 50s. In addition to 138 retail outlets, the company will close a supply facility in Lakeland, Florida, and relocate one in Buena Park, California. JCPenney reports it is in the process of identifying relocation opportunities within the company for "esteemed leaders," and will provide outplacement support services for employees effectively out of a job. In January, the retailer sold its corporate headquarters in Plano, a suburb of Dallas, for $353 million in an effort to reduce its debt load.

Deputies found his body in a driveway, Peterson said. Investigators arrested Edward Earl Dubose, 22, early Tuesday morning on a murder charge. “We know they were familiar with one another,” Peterson said. Peterson said witnesses told investigators Dubose and Johnson had argued, which led to the shooting. What the two reportedly argued over, he said, is being withheld pending further investigation. Dubose, of Freemont Street, is held at the county jail on a $2 million bond set by Justice Court Judge Diane Ladner. His initial court appearance is pending. He shot the teenager several times as they argued in the 13000 block of Hopewell Lane, Peterson said. Both streets are in Crown Hill off Three Rivers Road. Peterson said a 911 caller reported shots fired in the subdivision about 11:30 p.m. Monday. It wasn’t immediately clear if Johnson also lived in Crown Hill. Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove released Johnson’s name Tuesday, saying the teen had died of a gunshot wound. Gulfport police found Dubose at the Wal-Mart Supercenter on U.S. 49 in Gulfport about 1 a.m. Tuesday and took him into custody, the sheriff said. “We believe there are other people who witnessed the shooting and we want to talk to them,” Peterson said. Investigators were following leads to try to identify other witnesses, he said, but he is encouraging witnesses to to call the Harrison County Sheriff’s Department at 228-865-7060. The fatal shooting is the second reported in Crown Hill in a little more than a year. A shooting on Robindale Road killed Richard Doby, 23, and wounded another man Feb. 27, 2016. It was the county’s only homicide last year.

(Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg News) March 21 MARKETS Stocks sink to biggest losses this year U.S. stocks had their biggest drop this year on Tuesday, led by declines in banks. Financial companies, which soared in the months since the presidential election, fell sharply. Bank of America sank 5.8 percent, while JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo each lost about 3 percent. A drop in bond yields helped push financial stocks lower. Industrial companies and transportation stocks also fell. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 29.45 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2344.02. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 237.85 points, or 1.1 percent, to 20,668.01. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 107.70 points, or 1.8 percent, to 5793.83. — Associated Press RESTAURANTS CKE names CEO to replace Andy Puzder The parent company of the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains on Tuesday named a new chief executive to replace Andy Puzder, who last month withdrew his nomination to be labor secretary under President Trump. CKE Restaurants said Puzder will be replaced in April by Jason Marker, who most recently was president of Yum Brands’s Kentucky Fried Chicken in the United States. Puzder withdrew his nomination to be labor secretary in February after Senate Republicans became troubled about his acknowledgment that he belatedly paid taxes on a former housekeeper who was not authorized to work in the United States. Puzder’s opposition to significant minimum-wage hikes and what he called “overregulation” also rankled labor groups and Democrats, who questioned his ability to oversee the agency in charge of protecting workers’ rights. His past comments on automation in the restaurant industry also became a point of contention. In a phone interview Tuesday, Puzder, who has been CEO of CKE since 2000, said the nomination process was not a factor in his stepping down as chief executive of CKE. He also said he told the company he wanted to retire when his four-year contract was up at the end of this year. — Associated Press TECHNOLOGY Twitter cracks down on violent speech Twitter said Tuesday that it had stepped up efforts to rid its social network of posts from users advocating for political or religious violence, and was increasingly using software to find them rather than relying on user or government reports. U.S. and European governments have been pressuring social-media companies to crack down harder on online radicalization, particularly by Islamist groups that advocate violent activity. In its semiannual “transparency report,” Twitter said it suspended about 377,000 accounts in the final six months of 2016 for “violations related to promotion of terrorism,” a rate of about 63,000 a month. That is up from about 24,000 a month for a comparable period a year ago. For the first time, Twitter noted how many government requests the company receives to take down messages posted by journalists and news outlets. The data showed Turkey was by far the most active in seeking takedown of media reports. During the final six months of 2016, Twitter said, it received 88 court orders and other legal requests from around the world directing it to remove content posted by verified journalists and news outlets. About 77 of them were from Turkey. — Reuters Also in Business ● Wells Fargo plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs next week to allow customers to access their funds using their cellphones instead of traditional bank cards.

Mark Lennihan/AP | Caption Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen March 21, 2017 —Whether you are in a pinch for time or have time to kill, Target wants to have a store entrance for you. The big-box retailer plans to redesign 600 stores to offer two separate entrances, beginning this fall, it announced at an e-commerce conference in Las Vegas on Monday. One entrance will have the time-crunched customer in mind, with groceries, self-checkout aisles, and a counter for online orders all near the front. The other entrance will be built for the browser, with curved center aisles filled with home, apparel, and beauty products. The billions of dollars Target plans to spend on this ambitious redesign is part of a trend among brick-and-mortar giants to try to keep pace with consumer demands in the age of online shopping. These retailers were slow to adapt during the dot-com era, say analysts. But as they play catch up, they are discovering the customer wants it both ways: in-store pickup when they want a product fast or don’t want to pay extra for shipping, and in-store shopping when they want to linger down aisles in their spare time. “The future of retail is digital. And people will also be shopping in stores for a long, long time,” Target board chairman and chief executive Brian Cornell said in his keynote speech on Monday at the Shoptalk conference, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Today, roughly 30 million people stop in a Target store each week, the Star-Tribune reports – but that could quickly change. Can you handle adulthood? Take our domestic survival quiz! "Whatever it's going to go be, it's still going to be a really big number. So that means we need to keep investing in our stores to give guests every possible reason to shop," Mr. Cornell said. The first new Target to feature this redesign will be in the Houston suburb of Richmond, scheduled to open in October, according to a press release. Also scheduled for October is the renovation of 40 additional stores. The idea is to offer customers the best of both worlds when time permits. Those short on time or just wishing to get in and out would be able to use one entrance specifically for them. These shoppers can park in a 10-minute space, find groceries and other essentials at the front of the store, and pay either in self-checkout aisles or ahead of time online.   Customers in the mood to linger can use the second “inspiration” entrance. Filling the curved aisles will be brand-name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion, as well as beauty, jewelry, and accessories departments nearby, according to the Associated Press.  “We wanted the design to be flexible because that is what shopping is all about," Mark Schindele, the senior vice president of Target Properties, told the Associated Press. Target expects this redesign to bump sales 2 to 4 percent. The corporation struggled through parts of 2016, at the time blaming its missed sales targets on a decline in Apple iPhone demands and grocery business, along with management shakeups, according to The New York Times. But in an investor meeting last month, executives were candid about the shabbiness of many of Target’s stores. Ryan McDevitt, an economics professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, sees Target’s plan as an attempt to recapture the ground it lost over the past decade to variety and convenience stores, as well as Amazon.   “Consumers used to feel there was value at Target. It was sophisticated, and had pretty high-quality items at a low price,” Dr. McDevitt tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview on Tuesday. “For the new generation of shoppers, they don’t see that value any longer. The stores are worn out, and haven’t been updated for a long time. If they want a quick item, they go to a Dollar or convenience store. They’re not going to trek out to this big-box store retailer.” McDevitt says it may be too late for Target to lure back customers in cities with Amazon’s two-hour Prime Now delivery service or high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. But suburban areas without such services may stand a chance, he adds. Consumer habits have been changing rapidly since everything from books, to pet food, to flat-screen TVs became available online during the dot-com era. While the burst of that bubble shook the e-commerce landscape, that industry has since settled into a hybrid, in which consumers want the option to buy online when they need to, wander when time permits, and click and pickup purchases when they don’t want to wait for shipping or want to see the product in person. Target, Walmart, and other traditional retailers were slow to catch on to this "omnichannel" trend, wrote Darrell Rigby, a partner at Bain & Company who heads the firm's Global Retail practice, in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review. At that time, wrote Mr. Rigby, online revenue accounted for less than 2 percent of revenue at Target and Walmart. In the first quarter of 2016, retail sales accounted for 3.5 percent of Target’s sales, according to The Washington Post. This increase follows Target investing $1 billion in 2015 to bolster its e-commerce offerings, which includes everything from grocery delivery, to ship from store, and click and collect, according to CNBC. With this redesign announced Monday, it appears Target is looking to especially take advantage of in-store pickup. Click and collect allows customers to order online and pick up in stores, combining the best of both worlds: speed, quick comparisons, and the chance to reconsider an item in person. Retailers like it because they are finding customers don’t leave their wallets in their pockets when they go to the pickup counter. During the 2015 holiday season, for instance, 69 percent of shoppers who used click and collect purchased additional items while picking it up in store, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers’ Holiday Consumer Purchasing Trends, as CNBC reported. While 41 percent of retailers offered in-store pickup in 2015, 78 percent planned then to implement it within the next three years, according to a survey by Boston Retail Partners. But Target’s redesign also seeks to take advantage of Americans' shifting attitudes about how to spend their money.   Data released by the Commerce Department in 2015 showed American consumers are spending their extra money on restaurants, upgrading their cars or houses, sports gear, health, and beauty, according to The New York Times. “The religion of consumption has proven to be unfulfilling. The ‘pile it high and watch it fly’ mentality at department stores no longer works,” Richard Jaffe, a retailing analyst at investment firm Stifel Nicolaus, told the Times. “It’s becoming more and more about the experience – whether it’s going to a festival or sharing a car ride or going to a new city.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Sauter March 21, 2017 6:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet This March, for the second time in just over two years, RadioShack filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company has already made plans to close more than 500 stores nationwide. It has yet to announce what it would do with its remaining 1,000 locations. During the 2015 bankruptcy, about 2,000 RadioShack stores closed. RadioShack’s bankruptcy announcement is the latest in what has been a disastrous year for retailers. Many of the nation’s largest retailers have closed or are in the process of shutting down operations. These retailers are shuttering a varying number of locations. Including the RadioShack announcement, just a few of the major retailers alone that are going bankrupt or restructuring plan on closing well over 2,500 stores nationwide, often at some of the biggest malls in the country. American Apparel, The Limited, and others have declared bankruptcy and will be gone by the end of the year. Big names such as Kmart, Macy’s, J.C. Penney, and others will each close dozens of stores as they attempt to respond to the changing shopping habits of Americans, who more and more consumers choose to shop online. These are the 18 retailers closing the most stores in 2017. Click here to see the retailers closing the most stores. Many of the companies on this list have long fought an uphill battle — and many would say a losing one — against surging e-commerce companies such as Amazon. Amazon’s revenue reached $136 billion in fiscal 2016, about nine times its revenue a decade ago. It is now, according to the National Retail Federation, the eighth-largest U.S. retailer based on annual sales. As Amazon and other e-retailers thrive, major, primarily brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled and have been forced to shut down dozens, if not hundreds, of stores each year. In some cases, the closures are part of a major retailer’s restructuring, as many eliminate less profitable locations and work on focusing their operations. Wal-Mart closed over 150 U.S. locations last year, but the company was and remains one of the largest and most profitable retailers in the world. For other retailers, however, this year’s closings are likely to be evidence of a dying business. Sears Holdings Corporation, which owns two brands that are closing stores this year — Sears and Kmart — reported net losses in each of its last five fiscal years. J.C. Penney, which will close 140 of its roughly 1,000 U.S. locations in 2017 — with some analysts anticipating more closures announced by the end of the year — has reported net losses in its last seven fiscal years One of the most foreboding signs of the changing American retail landscape is the fact that mall development in the United States has ground to a halt. Currently, only two shopping malls are being built in the United States, and dozens have closed in recent years. J.C. Penney and Macy’s frequently serve as cornerstone stores — the major department stores that drive foot traffic to American malls. As these stores go out of business, they cause a chain reaction, severely cutting down traffic to the smaller stores commonly found at malls. In its most recent annual report, Abercrombie & Fitch, which will close 60 locations this year, stated, “We cannot control the loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store … if the popularity of mall shopping continues to decline generally among our customers, our sales may decline, which would impact our gross profits and net income.” Over the past three years, A&F’s revenue has fallen by more than $1 billion, and net income declined by almost 85%. Some of the retailers closing the most stores this year are not downsizing but shuttering their businesses entirely. The four companies at the top of this list have all filed for bankruptcy and, with the exception of RadioShack, have announced plans to close all of their stores. To identify the companies closing the most stores, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed major U.S. retailers that have announced store closings for 2017. All listed store closings are based on company announcements that will either take place primarily, entirely, or will have started in 2017. Total store counts are based on company annual reports, when available, or corporate websites, and are U.S. store closures only, unless otherwise specified.

The risks include organ damage, cancer, and cardiac arrest. The severity of these threats often depends on such factors as pre-existing medical conditions as well as the quantity of the ingredient taken and the length of time a person has been exposed to the substance. Many of the ingredients on this list also have the potential to interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications, such as cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-thinning drugs like aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin and generic). Moreover, our experts agree that none of these supplement ingredients provide sufficient health benefits to justify the risk. Even so, we found all 15 ingredients in products available online or in major stores such as GNC, Costco, CVS, Walmart, and Whole Foods.

X UK retailers axe employees over minimum wage increase At least 3,700 shop workers have been made redundant from leading UKchains Tue, Mar 21, 2017, 18:01 At least 3,700 shop workers have been made redundant from leading UK store chains this year.         Britain’s low-wage workers are due a pay rise next month but not all of them are celebrating. As the new minimum wage takes effect, the country’s biggest retailers are finding inventive ways of making do with fewer employees, in what economists call a sign of the potential pitfalls of the UK’s attempt – mirrored in many US cities – to favour the working poor. At least 3,700 shop workers have been made redundant from leading UK store chains this year, although some companies are adding jobs in frontline roles even as layers of management are peeled away. Publicly, at least, the retailers insist the cuts are geared towards serving customers better, rather than saving cash. At John Lewis, the UK department store, and its upmarket supermarket chain, cafeterias will soon serve pre-prepared meals trucked in from central kitchens rather than made on-site. The group says the change will better “meet the dietary requirements of customers” – but will also contribute to the loss of 387 jobs. At J Sainsbury, one of the UK’s biggest grocers, “price controllers” will no longer patrol the aisles in search of misplaced product labels, the kind of mishap that executives say is rarer now they rely less on weekly promotions. Rival supermarket Tesco is abolishing the position of deputy manager in its smaller stores, asking lower-paid staff to pick up the slack. Tracey Clements, managing director of the chain’s convenience business, told colleagues the change would help “run . . . stores more simply, while also improving our customers’ experience”. Increases But in private, retail executives concede that sharp increases in the minimum wage have lent urgency to their efforts to use workers more efficiently, by investing in technology that makes many low-skilled jobs obsolete. “On a personal level, we all want to pay our workers more,” said a top executive at one large retailer that has recently announced redundancies. “But there’s going to be unintended consequences from what the government is doing. Automation that used to be too expensive is now cheaper than the people it can replace.” ADVERTISEMENT Beginning next month, over-25s in the UK must be paid £7.50 an hour. That is 12 per cent more than the lowest-paid received in 2015, when then-chancellor George Osborne announced a series of increases to lift the hourly rate to £9 in 2020. Retailers will bear the brunt. British shops employ about 1.7 million people on wages close to the legal minimum, according to the British Retail Consortium, an industry lobby group; most are succumbing to the pressure to pay more. At Tesco’s UK arm, a 12 per cent increase in the £4 billion salary bill would have all but wiped out last year’s £505 million operating profit at the country’s biggest private-sector employer. The higher wage costs come at a time when UK retailers are also contending with an increase in property taxes and import costs that are rising as sterling falls. “A lot of the firms are absorbing the cost at the moment by lowering their profits or maybe increasing prices,” said Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank that focuses on low-wage work. “They don’t have to make an immediate knee jerk reaction in the way that you would in a downturn. But over time they’ll think a bit more about their structure and their business model. If you look at [the government’s projections], there is an expectation that employment does fall.” When Britain introduced a minimum wage in 1999, it charged the Low Pay Commission with setting the floor as high as possible without causing jobs to disappear. Mr Osborne set the commissioners a different brief. “The government is saying, ‘There are jobs that are too low paid for us to want them in our economy’ “, explains Mr Whittaker. “It’s a deliberate policy. You have to assume they’re comfortable with it.” Challenge The challenge facing British retailers sounds familiar to Jacob Vigdor, an economist in Seattle, one of several big US cities to vote through big minimum wage increases. The mandatory pay rise goes beyond moves by Walmart and other large chains to lift their pay rates nationwide. “You can see people finding ways to get by with less staffing,” he said, recalling the long queues that appeared at his favourite tea shop last year, when the minimum wage increased to $13, compared with just over $9 in 2014, and one of the two counter assistants was fired. Across the city, Mr Vigdor reckons the number of jobs fell 2 per cent in the first year of the experiment with a higher minimum wage, although more workers may now be paid off the books. The wage floor has since been lifted again, to $15 (a little over £12) for the largest employers. Retailers across the developed world have been culling their workforces through in-store innovations, such as self-checkout machines and “display-ready” boxes that alleviate the tedium of stacking shelves. Amazon is taking that idea to extremes in a town centre concept store that has no queues and no checkouts but automatically tracks customers’ purchases as they carry them out of the door. More traditional shops are cutting costs wherever they can. Many are moving more staff into centralised facilities that are easier to automate and benefit from economies of scale. Greggs, a UK town centre bakery chain, is closing some of its smaller bakeries and turning those that remain into high-tech plants adapted to particular products, such as doughnuts or sausage rolls. At John Lewis, which has centralised its call centres as well as its kitchens, “profound changes are coming down the track”, Charlie Mayfield, chairman, said. “There are 3,000 fewer partners [than] this time last year, [and ]probably we’ll see a continual gradual decline. The [remaining] jobs will be better ones.” ADVERTISEMENT For now, at least, internet shopping is creating jobs in warehouses and delivery services, even as it threatens the livelihoods of people who work in traditional stores. But much of the work falls to “contractors”, who are paid piece rates under carefully drafted legal arrangements that put them beyond the reach of minimum wage laws. Retail executives say the effect on their hiring plans will ultimately depend on whether consumers are willing to bear the cost of increased wage rates, or whether they take their custom to cheaper operators that make do with fewer staff. “It doesn’t necessarily feed through to a business like ours because if you’re successful you will employ more people,” said Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s. Others are less fortunate. Mr Vigdor started buying loose-leaf tea online when the queues at his local store became too long. “And then a few months later I did go back,” he said. “But the shop had closed.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Amazon Sainsbury's Tesco WalMart Read More Why Dublin may be heaven for bankers after Brexit Lucy Kellaway: Workplace and toddlers will never mix Council fires lifeguard for throwing boy (8) into deep end Four ways to beat short-termism Why businesses must focus on employee engagement Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times UK retailers axe employees over minimum wage increase Why Dublin may be heaven for bankers after Brexit Lucy Kellaway: Workplace and toddlers will never mix Council fires lifeguard for throwing boy (8) into deep end Sponsored Our trip North: ‘I couldn’t believe how much it had changed’ Who are the ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’?

When Lidl makes its move into the US this year, expect three states—Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina—to see fierce competition between the German-owned discounter and Ahold Delhaize, Ingles Markets and The Fresh Market. Photo: FoxysGraphic/iStock/Thinkstock; Illustration: SN/Anna Kang The report cited Ahold Delhaize, Ingles Markets and The Fresh Market as having the highest exposure to Lidl’s anticipated rollout in terms of the percentage of their total store base in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Ahold Delhaize has about 52.7% of its stores in those three states — predominantly the Food Lion banner — while Ingles has 49.3% of its stores in those states and The Fresh Market has 24%. Other supermarket operators that have “meaningful overlap” include Southeastern Grocers — parent of the Bi-Lo and Winn-Dixie banners — with 16% of its store base and Kroger with 10.1%. Dollar-store chains Dollar General and Family Dollar also both have more than 11% of their store base in the three states where Lidl is expected to debut. Many of the supermarket chains in the markets where Lidl plans to grow have relatively unproductive stores in terms of sales per square foot, which Barclays argues could leave them vulnerable to the aggressive pricing anticipated from Lidl. The report cites Ingles, Weis Markets — which operates at the Northern end of Lidl’s anticipated geographic reach — and Southeastern Grocers as among the large chains that have relatively low sales per square foot in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.  As previously reported, Lidl is expected to operate larger stores in the U.S. than it typically operates in Europe. Its U.S. locations are expected to have about 21,000 square feet of selling space to accommodate a broader product mix. Private label is expected to account for about 70% of sales, Barclays said. The companies with the top-three market shares in each area where Lidl expands will likely be better able to withstand the threat, as will those companies that have experience competing against Lidl overseas, according to the Barclays report.  Walmart, Ahold Delhaize and Aldi all have been competing against Lidl in other countries for several years, which may give them some ideas about strategies to best compete against Lidl. Ahold Delhaize, for example, competes against discounters in the Netherlands and Belgium by offering high-quality, entry-level SKUs, differentiating with innovative products and concepts, investing in price in overlapping product areas and investing in service departments. Citing data from financial reports filed in the U.K., Barclays argues that Lidl’s relatively low labor costs and merchandise margins could make it a formidable competitor. Lidl’s wages as a percent of sales in 2015 were 7.4%, compared with 9% at nonunion food retailers in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic and 10% to 12% at union retailers, according to Barclays’ estimates. Unionized operators in particular could face difficulties competing against Lidl “if competitive intensity increases,” Barclays said.  “This gives Lidl flexibility to invest in price or to operate at a higher operating margin and use the resulting cash flow to open new stores,” Barclays said in the report. Barclays projected that Lidl will open about 100 stores per year. The retailer is planning distribution centers in Fredericksburg, Va., Mebane, N.C., and Cecil County, Md. The report anticipates that Lidl will likely see the most opportunity to gain market share in areas where the top three food retailers hold the lowest percentage of total share. Of the 28 TV markets in the eight states where Lidl has been seeking store locations, the markets most ripe for Lidl to take share are Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., with 59%, 58% and 52% of their market share “up for grabs,” respectively, according to Barclays’ analysis of Metro Market Studies market-share data.  However, one real estate expert, who asked not to be identified, said that Lidl can still be expected to face tough competition in those markets from operators such as Ahold Delhaize, Safeway and Wakefern Food Corp.’s ShopRite banner. In addition, he noted, it remains to be seen how much pushback from unions Lidl will receive in those more heavily unionized markets. While Lidl previously had been seeking to buy and own real estate sites for its initial locations in the U.S., it has over the past several months become open to long-term leasing opportunities, the real estate expert said. That shift should make it easier for the company to find sites in more heavily developed urban areas. However, at the same time, the company has not been flexible in terms of the size and layout of its stores, which could limit its opportunities going forward. One potential danger for Lidl is spreading itself too thin to capture distribution efficiencies, the real estate expert pointed out.  “Anyone can have low prices in the short term,” he said. “In the long term, it depends on how long you are willing to subsidize those prices and your efficiencies. As they look to spread themselves very thin, there is a question in my mind about the efficiencies they will have relative to the entrenched competition that they face.” 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

More >> Channel 4 is learning more about a former teacher who is accused of kidnapping a 15-year-old student from Columbia.More >> NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - It's been eight days since 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas went missing. She is believed to have been kidnapped by her former high school teacher, Tad Cummins. Officials with the Maury County School District are acknowledging the alleged inappropriate relationship between the student and teacher in a new timeline. Below is the list of events, all confirmed by school officials: Jan. 24: School officials say they were first notified by another student that Cummins and Thomas were kissing in the classroom. Both of them denied the accusation. Cummins allegedly told students he's a father figure to Thomas and that they had both suffered from an abusive home life. Jan. 25: The next day, an investigation begins within the school system. Jan. 26-30: School officials interview students, staff and administrators about the kissing incident. Jan. 27: Thomas is removed from Cummins' class. Jan. 31: Maury County Schools learns Cummins is under criminal investigation. They turn over all information they have on him to police. Feb. 3: Maury County school officials receive a tip that Cummins and Elizabeth were back in the classroom together even after he was told to stay away. Feb. 6: Cummins is suspended from teaching at Culleoka Unit School. March 13: Both Thomas and Cummins disappear. Cummins is fired by the school district. March 14: Termination documents are finalized by the school district. This new timeline contradicts school officials' original response when they said they suspended Cummins when they found out about the allegations. Anthony Thomas, Elizabeth Thomas' father, said Cummins had everyone fooled, even school officials. He said after his daughter went missing, he told the school he thought she might be with Cummins. “When I suggested that to him, he looked at me like I was crazy, like they’ve known him all their life, but I knew," said Anthony Thomas. Anthony Thomas said before Elizabeth Thomas went missing, things just didn't seem right. “Things had been a little bit funny, but I couldn’t put my finger on it enough. Something just seemed amiss," he said. On Monday, Elizabeth Thomas' brother told Channel 4 that she told their sister to call police if she was not home by 6 p.m. The day before the pair went missing, an Instagram account for a person named Tad Cummins posted a picture reading, "It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight #strong #unbreakable #love." The last post on March 13 says, "It's a beautiful day to start #love." Click here to read more. "She was vulnerable, and he took advantage of that," said Anthony Thomas. The latest photos from the TBI show Cummins looking at hair dye at the Walmart in Columbia. The TBI said Tuesday that the hair dye was not part of his alleged plan for Elizabeth Thomas. According to the TBI, Cummins did online research about his Nissan Rogue and whether it could be tracked on March 10, three days before he and Elizabeth Thomas disappeared. Investigators also said that on March 5, he did online searches related to teen marriage. "I'm afraid he has married her," Anthony Thomas said. He had a message for Cummins. "I know you don't have the guts to face the music, so you need to leave her somewhere safe and make arrangements for her to be picked up," said Anthony Thomas. An Amber Alert has been issued for Elizabeth Thomas. Cummins is listed on the TBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list. Anyone with information about their whereabouts is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately.

More Sections Distractions Video Blogs Home Opinion Dentists and drunken stupors: my St. Patrick’s Day experience Opinion Dentists and drunken stupors: my St. Patrick’s Day experience By Daniella Ferlaino - March 21, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter My St. Patrick’s Day experience was quite eventful, as I’m sure it was for everyone else out on Ezra. My friends and I intended to devote the entire day to drinking, napping, and undoubtedly more drinking. But our plan was swiftly ruined thanks to this girl right here. The night prior to the big day, my friends and I planned to wake up at 9 a.m. to begin our binge episode, reach Ezra by 10:30 a.m., and eventually nap before drinking some more later that night. Leave it up to me, already labelled as the ‘flaky friend,’ to bail on my friends and screw up the entire plan—but it was not done intentionally, nor was it my fault. On the morning of the big day, I woke up at 8:30 a.m. to half my face feeling like it had been hit by a train, and sure enough, it had swelled up like a balloon. I took a peek in the mirror, saw a small white tooth protruding from the very back of my gums, and instantly knew why I was in pain; but did not want to face it knowing I would ruin the day. Half an hour before I was supposed to begin binge-drinking with my friends, the pain was too much for me to handle, so I called the dentist, explained my situation, and was told it was mandatory that I went in for an appointment within the hour. The only two things racing through my mind were: “my friends are going to kill me” and “it’s St. Patrick’s Day.” I showed up to the dentist wearing all my St. Patrick’s Day attire, looking as if a leprechaun vomited on me. I was not surprised when the dentist told me that my wisdom teeth needed to come out in a few days time, however, I was too busy forming unrealistic mental images in my head of the dentist yanking out my wisdom teeth with pliers. Nonetheless, after leaving the dentist, my friends and I began our quest for inebriation a little later than planned, and I waited for the alcohol to kick in and numb the persistent pain in my mouth. When we approached Ezra, I was instantly reminded that it was St. Patrick’s Day as I looked off into the distance and saw at least 10,000 people covered in green. It was almost as if someone from above had coated the entire street with a green highlighter. As my friends and I continued to travel into the crowd, there were people hanging from rooftops, jumping off balconies, and trekking through mud in Wal-Mart shopping carts. It was impossible to get through the crowd without shoving into someone or without inadvertently inhaling the fumes of our old friend Mary Jane. The whole ambience of the street felt like a scene taken directly out of Superbad — drunken teenagers looking for any opportunity to do some reckless shit. I was also reminded that it was St. Patrick’s Day when a total stranger tried to kiss me while my friends left me to invent their own bathroom stalls on the side of a house. I cringe at the thought of how awkward it was when the security guard told my butt-naked friends that we could be fined for public urination, not to mention peeing on someone else’s home. As we were leaving Ezra, I came to realize that perhaps the day was only amusing to me because I watched all the shenanigans happen right in front of me, rather than engaging in them myself; and I’m still not exactly sure which one is more exhilarating. Maybe funnelling beer from a fourth-floor balcony could’ve been fun, or maybe that kiss from the stranger would’ve been great, but hey, there’s always next year.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Opinion Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Opinion Home Todd Starnes Dana Perino Greg Gutfeld Karl Rove Gregg Jarrett Andrew Napolitano Health care For GOP, a domino effect on health and taxes By Juan Williams Published March 21, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.   Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House Democratic leader, reduces the many problems with the GOP health care plan to this: “They have no idea how to explain stealing $600 billion from working families’ health care to give more tax breaks to the richest people in our country.” Conservative political observers are also connecting the troubled GOP health care proposal to the Republicans’ longstanding promise to act on tax reform. Once again, the most important tweet last week in conservative politics did not come from President @realDonaldTrump. It came from Matt Drudge, the proprietor of the Drudge Report. “Republicans lied about wanting tax cuts,” he tweeted. “Can we get our votes back?” Drudge is looking ahead on the political horizon and seeing that ObamaCare replacement and tax reform can’t be separated. Without a health care plan that cuts federal spending, there is no chance for tax reform. President Trump stunned a lot of people with his honesty when he recently blurted out that he’d discovered that health care is “an unbelievably complex subject.” He added that he remained determined on health care for one reason: “And for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do health care before we do the tax cut,” he explained. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged as much to my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo last week, while begging for his House caucus to support the problem-filled GOP health care proposal. “It makes tax reform a lot harder, it makes it more difficult…” without a new, low-cost health care plan, Ryan noted. In fact, Ryan built the House health care plan on the bedrock promise that it contains “massive tax relief.” But now with the GOP majority’s mash-up of an effort to replace ObamaCare, the tax reform plan looks like it is headed for the graveyard. The only hope for the GOP is to demand party loyalty to the ObamaCare replacement plan in the service of reviving the tax cuts. Ryan and Trump are twisting arms by telling GOP lawmakers that if they don’t pass tax reform, angry Republican voters will punish them in the 2018 midterms. But high pressure tactics to produce tax cuts can’t hide the GOP’s health reform implosion. After seven years of campaigning against ObamaCare, including numerous repeal votes and acts of open sabotage, congressional Republicans have failed to come up with a better plan. They don’t even have an inferior plan they can agree on. Voters have noticed. A Fox News poll showed 54 percent disapproval of the Republican plan. About two-thirds of those who dislike the proposal say their complaint is about “too many changes to ObamaCare.” To save political face, Ryan is reversing course. He is signaling an openness to changing the failed GOP plan to buy votes from members of his caucus who are walking away from the fiasco. Even with that SOS call, the speaker’s problem is that the Tea Party’s Freedom Caucus wants more cuts to ObamaCare programs for seniors and the poor. That kind of fix will not arrest the decline in public support. Meanwhile, Republicans and their allies in the business community are having anxiety attacks at the prospect of tax reform disappearing. They are divided over tax reform proposals, too. The biggest problem the Republicans face is the so-called “border adjustment tax.” Big manufacturers like Boeing support it, while big retailers like Walmart oppose it. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R- Utah) is not upbeat about the border adjustment tax: “I don’t think it’s going to pass over here. There’s not a lot of enthusiasm for it. We’re already working on what we’d like to do.” Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, raised the bar even higher when he told CNBC recently that any tax cut plan will be “deficit neutral over a 10-year period.” To make matters worse, other fault lines in the tax debate are emerging amongst Republicans. “The fight over a border-adjustment tax isn’t the only challenge for Republicans in their push for tax reform,” The Hill reported last week. “Notably, some business groups have criticized the proposal to do away with the deduction for businesses’ net interest expenses.” As The Hill also notes, conservative interest groups are pressing House Republicans to oppose Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate the carried interest tax break. It’s not like Trump and Republicans lack political cover to go bold on taxes. The problem is that the congressional GOP is unable to reach consensus within its ranks on even its most basic principles. It is worth remembering that back in 2014, then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, put forward a reasonable tax reform proposal. It was revenue neutral and lowered rates on 99 percent of Americans. His fellow Republicans ignored him. They were busy demonizing ObamaCare. In their talking points, congressional Republicans like to remind people that the nation has not seen comprehensive tax reform since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic speaker, Tip O’Neill. Republicans are learning there is a reason why it hasn’t happened in more than three decades. Perhaps they should have listened to Camp when they had the chance. When it comes to a health care plan and tax reform, the GOP might as well echo the famous words of the comic-strip character Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.”   Juan Williams is a co-host of FNC's "The Five," where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 21, 2017 Hello from the other side. (Reuters/Mario Anzuoni) Share Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 21, 2017 Spotify is increasingly owning up to its power. At the Advertising Week Europe conference yesterday, the company’s VP of “global partner solutions,” Danielle Lee, spoke to a number of brands about the emerging marketing opportunities coming out of audio data. “On social, you curate your social-media feed to create a picture of yourself, but music is about participating in your most vulnerable moments,” Lee said. She revealed just how closely Spotify tracks its users: In general, the service studies each consumer’s listening habits for a broader understanding of his or her mood, tastes, values, and mindset. Spotify’s playlists act as consumer segmentation. Advertisers aren’t just able to target exercise playlists, for example—they can also now track when a user stops exercising and play ads specifically geared toward a dormant fitness enthusiast. Spotify has developed a “real-time moments” advertising tool that lets brands connect with listeners depending on what they’re most likely doing at that moment, such as partying, having dinner, or working out. While it’s quite the norm for digital music services to keep tabs on their users’ listening habits, Spotify differs from its competitors Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Tidal in that it isn’t a subscription-only service: most of its users are actually listening to music on its free, advertising-supported tier. That means Spotify has a financial incentive to pry more deeply into users’ listening habits and sell ads aligned with their specific lifestyles. Last year, Spotify announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with ad-tech companies to deliver automated advertising based on user background; from Lee’s comments, the company seems dedicated to diving even deeper. Of course, Spotify’s meticulous data-crunching is part of what makes its signature personalization features like Discover Weekly so great. It’s also what makes Spotify the most similar—out of all the streaming services—to big-box retailers like Walmart or Amazon. The level of detail runs a certain risk of creepiness. Last year, the music-streaming platform plastered data about its users onto massive physical billboards as part of a tongue-in-cheek advertising campaign showing off its users’ quirky listening habits, which included publicizing individual playlist names and Valentine’s Day song picks—and revealing the extent of its data-collecting prowess, as well. So we know, for example, that on the day of the UK’s Brexit vote last year, 3,749 people streamed R.E.M.’s deadpan rock hit “It’s the End of the World As We Know It” on Spotify. And Spotify’s advertising partners know that too, and much, much more.

The program is sponsored by the Kansas Department of Commerce and provides tax rebates for home improvements or construction. City Attorney Bob Suelter was asked to try to include most of the city with two targeted areas. Mayor Mike Allison and Suelter said most of the city is now under the plan outside of areas assisted with Rural Housing Incentive Districts. Mike Allison & Bob Suelter Audio https://www.greatbendpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/allison-plan.mp3 Three areas excluded from the Neighborhood Revitalization Plan that are currently under RHIDs include: north and west of 24th & Main Street at the Fairways of StoneRidge, the area by Walmart for The Reserves at Trail Ridge apartments, and lots on the west end of Amber Meadows. The first draft of the plan left out the section of town west of Patton Road, but Suelter included the area in the second targeted zone. According to the Barton County Appraiser’s Office, the year 2016 existing appraised valuation on all parcels of real estate in the proposed Neighborhood Revitalization area is over $261 million in the Primary Target Area and above $471 million in the Secondary Target Area. The Primary Target will hold a 10-year rebate program while the Second Target will have a 5-year rebate. A map outlining the Neighborhood Revitalization Area is on file at the City Administrative Offices at 1209 Williams.

The suspects were in a white van. Text size share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Noxious emissions of chemicals from inside a suspect van sickened four Blaine police officers after a Tuesday morning chase into Lino Lakes, authorities said. The officers were taken to Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids, and “we are happy to say our officers have all been released,” Blaine Police Lt. Dan Pelkey said early Tuesday afternoon. The driver of the van also was briefly treated at the hospital, while a passenger in the vehicle did not require medical attention. Hazardous materials personnel spent hours at the scene investigating what made the officers fall ill, Pelkey said. “The source appears to have been a combination of a leaking propane tank and a number of used spray-paint cans that were in the vehicle,” Pelkey said. Inhaling propane or aerosol propellants “can often create symptoms such as the officers were reporting,” the lieutenant added, “difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness.” Police also seized a loaded gun from the van, Pelkey said. The driver was arrested, while the passenger was questioned and released. The rolling drama began shortly after 8:15 a.m. near the Wal-Mart on Ball Road, where an officer tried to stop a van “for suspicious activity,” the lieutenant said. The suspects fled, and the officers gave chase heading north for more than 3 miles until police bumped the van to a halt at Lake Drive and Town Center Parkway in Lino Lakes in what is called a PIT maneuver, Pelkey continued. As the officers neared the vehicle, they had difficulty breathing from something emanating from inside the van, Pelkey said. Two more officers arrived and also fell ill. Authorities have yet to release the identities of the suspects, nor have they said what the two were doing to attract police attention.   pwalsh@startribune.com 612-673-4482 walshpj More from Star Tribune Bob Dylan talks a lot about Minnesota in rare straight-forward interview Steak, steak and steak: Manny's restaurant stays in top form over decades Police officer, 3 others killed in Wisconsin shootings Spying claim by House intel chair renews fight over Russia probe Ex-Viking Boyd doubts concussion settlement will make up for shattered life GOP health bill on the brink hours from House vote More From Local Local 12 minutes ago Officer, 3 others fatally shot in Wisconsin domestic dispute Four people including a police officer are dead and a suspect is in custody after shootings at a bank and a law firm in northern Wisconsin, followed by a standoff at an apartment complex that ended in a volley of gunfire.

Two volunteers tightened red headgear snug around his chin. Jordan Price hadn't planned to fight. The 18-year-old and his older brother had signed up as a joke. But it was too late to back out now. Price insisted to friends that he wasn't nervous, but he sounded as though he were convincing himself. He hadn't even trained, a choice his anxious eyes indicated he'd now begun to regret at least a little. Then a shout of encouragement broke his concentration. "Tear em up, Price!" Bill Price, two years older, cried out, enthusiastically smacking the black boxing gloves now fastened to his brother's fists. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The bell rang. Time to brawl. One weekend every March, almost every resident in this town crowds the tan-and-gray bleachers of the local armory to watch their friends and neighbors beat each other bloody. The boxing-brawling event — known as "The Rough N Rowdy" — draws more than 2,000 spectators a night in a 3,000-person city nestled so deep in the mountains that your cellphone won't ring. The winners leave with a trophy, a jacket and a check for $1,000 — the same take-home as a few weeks of soot-covered work in the local mines. "People love violence. You've got a bunch of people down here who just want to show they're a badass," said Breyer Morgan, 21, who has been coming to the fights since he was a little boy and has worked the bell at the event for the past three years. "They see that $1,000, and you've got people coming out of the woodwork. There is nothing else to do out here . . . and that $1,000, that's a whole lot of beer, man." McDowell County was once the largest coal-exporting county in the United States. At its peak in the 1950s, when the county had 100,000 residents, Welch was a bustling downtown that housed the state's first multilevel parking garage and was surrounded by a smattering of vibrant villages planted in "the howlers" — the valleys that lay beneath the winding highways that cut through the surrounding Appalachian Mountains. It wasn't long after its height that the mines began to close, the beginning of a half-century of economic collapse that would rob McDowell of its jobs. The prospect of prosperity went with them. Welch is now a graveyard of shuttered storefronts sitting in the shadow of empty hillsides. Four out of every 5 people moved away as the coal industry faltered. Local shops closed. Even the local Walmart closed last year. McDowell is the state's poorest county, home to one of the shortest life expectancies in the nation. The people who coal left behind here have a movie theater, a dollar store, a liquor shop and a few fast food joints. On weekends, and many weeknights, people gather around 30-packs of beer in their garages; there's no bar and the nearest watering hole is nearly an hour's drive. But every March, when the first blades of grass break through the melting snow, they still have the Rough N Rowdy. - — — The Price brothers first attended this tournament as boys, traveling the 30 minutes from their home in War — a small town on West Virginia's southern rim — to stare in wonderment as their older cousins and uncles stepped into the ring to be pummeled. Now it was Jordan's turn. Much of his family — his father, stepmother, a sister and a brother-in-law — settled in the front row, some wearing custom-designed T-shirts declaring their allegiance to "Team Price." The rules of the brawl are simple: Anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 can sign up so long as they haven't boxed professionally. After passing a physical, they enter a single-elimination tournament to compete in refereed boxing matches with three one-minute rounds. Though a few serious fighters lurk in the field, most are untrained, taking to the worn ring to see if their playground prowess will yield a few moments of glory. Most have little chance of fighting more than once. The annual bouts happen during the first weekend of the month, just after many here have received their government assistance checks. That means fighters are more likely to have the $10 buy-in and their family cheering sections have cash for the $3 hot dogs drenched in warm chili. There's no beer sold inside, so small groups dot the parking lot, tailgates gathered around coolers of Bud Light. » Next page... 2 3 4 Single page   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Advocacy groups ask feds to investigate Mormon church for allegedly procuring 'favors' from foreign Jazz's 20-year reunion brings NBA Finals season to life Utah Jazz: Rudy Gobert's career night powers 108-101 win over Knicks BYU football: Riley Burt is back and ready to roll for Cougs after redshirt season San Juan County, home of new Bears Ears monument, No. 1 for U.S. population growth ELEVATE 2017’s top six tax questions answered   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   When to get professional tax help and when to do your own taxes   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Both are eager to tap into the growing consumer demand for fresh and natural foods, according to analysts. Quotes in the article Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 29.92 +0.09 +0.30% Sprouts Farmers Market Inc SFM ▲ 22.77 +0.31 +1.38% Oppenheimer Holdings Inc OPY ▼ 16.15 -0.35 -2.12% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 848.02 +4.81 +0.57% Kroger, the largest conventional grocery operator, competes with Sprouts in a number of markets including California, Arizona and Texas, according to Rupesh Parikh, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. The chain also working to expand its footprint with smaller-format stores after making a significant investment last year in Colorado-based organic grocer Lucky’s Markets. Kroger also launched its Main and Vine concept focusing on fresh, local food. If Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons nabs Sprouts, it may add the organic grocer to its lineup of chains, which already includes Safeway, Vons and Acme, or it could take the Phoenix-based company private, according to Bloomberg News.  Grocers have been expanding their organic offerings in recent years in response to growing demand from consumers. And that’s likely behind Albertsons potentially acquiring Sprouts. “You’re seeing more and more growth in the natural and organic arena and the fresh side of the business,” Parikh said. “Typically, that’s where these larger conventional players have less exposure.” Spokespeople for Albertsons and Sprouts declined to comment for this story as did private equity firm Cerberus Capital, which took Albertsons predecessor, Safeway, private for $9.2 billion in 2014 and delayed a 2015 public offering because of poor market conditions. A spokeswoman for Whole Foods couldn’t immediately be reached. Sprouts is heading into a potential bidding war from a position of strength. Wall Street analysts forecast that the company’s revenue will surge more than 12 percent to $4.3 billion in 2017. That’s more than double the expected growth rate for Kroger, whose sales are forecast to rise 4.9 percent to $120.9 billion. Competition in the grocery market also is intensifying as larger players such as Amazon, Walmart and Target continue to invest in it. “They are one of the best performing grocers out there,” said Parikh, referring to Sprouts, adding that shareholders will demand “a pretty significant premium.” He rates Sprouts shares as “perform” and Kroger and Whole Foods as “outperform.” Sprouts was the only grocery chain with positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter. However, it isn’t immune from the industry’s growing competitive pressures. The chain recently decided to slow the rate of new store openings over the next few years so that it can focus on its existing locations and prevent sites from stealing sales from one another. Plus, like other grocers, Sprouts has been hurt by declining food prices. “You have got an extended period of food deflation and that typically crushes all industry participants,” Parikh said. Rising competition has hurt the bottom line of Whole Foods, which has been hobbled financially by six straight quarterly sales declines at existing locations, a key retail metric. As a result, it could be difficult for Whole Foods to compete in a bidding war for Sprouts. The upscale grocer reported disappointing results in its most recent quarter and gave downbeat financial guidance. As Parikh noted: “They have a lot going on.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Shoppers are shirking the center aisles of the grocery store as they shift in ever-growing numbers to fresh meats, dairy and produce. The trend toward healthier grub, which is being helped by falling prices for these fresher foods, is bad news for food makers General Mills, J.M. Smucker, Kellogg, Campbell Soup and ConAgra Brands, all of which were downgraded late Monday by Bernstein to underperform from"market perform. Recent sales data from vendors such as Nielsen showed steep declines, which prompted concerns that something was wrong with the information. But after consulting with Nielsen and the companies themselves, "the downturn is indeed a reflection of ongoing consumer behavior favoring fresher foods in the perimeter of the store," Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said in a research note Monday. With deteriorating revenue, the likelihood for buyouts in the food sector at a lofty premium is diminishing, swinging "the risk/reward profile of investing in these names to the negative," Howard said. "Takeover premiums are unlikely to be particularly high, and activist investors are unlikely to step in while valuations remain at these elevated levels," she said. Making matters worse, the food retailers like Wal-Mart will be exerting pressure to keep prices sharp, and cost cutting by manufacturers is unlikely to provide enough relief. "Walmart has spoken about plans to reinvest in price this year for the past 18 months, and now that the moment is finally upon us, this dynamics is likely to make for a very tough year as they and other retailers try to share the pain with their suppliers," Howard wrote. General Mills declined to comment. CNBC has reached out to the other food manufacturers, but none of the companies have responded.

Share this story But it's a wave that's not sweeping up all shoppers in quite the same way. According to new data, the rise of online shopping across the United States is rather uneven, with more affluent states marching more quickly toward a lifestyle in which buying happens on a screen instead of at the mall. Adobe, whose software runs under many retail websites, analyzes data on billions of website visits to create its Digital Price Index, a real-time snapshot of online consumer spending. Analysts there studied digital shopping patterns over a one-year period that ended in February 2017. Their measurements included state-by-state breakdowns of growth in total e-commerce spending, as well as online spending per person. The Adobe research revealed substantial choppiness in year-over-year growth rates in total spending. For example, states near the coasts such as New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey and California saw some of the strongest surges in online shopping. (Big pickups weren't limited to the eastern and western seaboards; Texas and Mississippi also posted robust e-commerce growth.) Maryland saw an 8 percent increase in spending, and Virginia saw a 7 percent uptick. Read also: Shopping online: Should you take the plunge? Meanwhile, online spending retreated or held steady in a handful of states, including Idaho and South Dakota. But things get especially interesting when per-person online spending is plotted against the most recent Census Bureau figures for state-level median income. A noticeable correlation in the data suggests that affluent consumers are adapting to online shopping especially quickly. Luiz Maykot, a data analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said that a number of factors could be shaping the difference, including that low-income shoppers are less likely to have credit cards, which are table stakes to participating in online shopping. The data illuminate other interesting lessons, too. For example, Alaska and Hawaii are affluent states that don't fit the pattern of having strong per-person online spending. Maykot said such a result probably reflects the fact that shipping to those states can be pricey and relatively slow – factors that make online shopping less attractive. The research also offers hints that perhaps relative affluence is not the only factor that informs people's disparate adoption of online shopping. For an example here, turn to Washington, D.C. It's a city, and its growth and spending look much different from any of the 50 states' figures. Variances The District's per-person online spending grew 38 percent over the one-year period. The next-largest growth rate, recorded in New Hampshire, was just 20 percent. Furthermore, consumers in the District spent a whopping $3 353 per person online. That is dramatically higher than the per-person figure in any state. (New Jersey was the highest, at $1 736.) So perhaps the gap suggests that urbanites, in general, have migrated to online shopping much faster than their counterparts in less densely populated areas. Maykot said that while he can't say for sure, as Adobe doesn't yet perform city-level analyses, this is a "credible hypothesis" for why the District is an outlier. After all, there are unique pain points to brick-and-mortar shopping in cities: Checkout lines at high-traffic stores can be excruciatingly long. Nabbing an on-street parking spot can feel like a miracle. Many city residents don't own a car, and it can be hard to lug purchases on public transit or on foot. All these factors may be pushing city dwellers to adopt online shopping more quickly than people in smaller towns. Taken together, the data help provide valuable context for how to think about the business strategies of some of the biggest names in retail. For example, Amazon.com's same-day delivery service is largely concentrated in affluent cities. Sure, that's in part because the economics are better when customers are clustered close together. But this information also suggests that Amazon is first trying to make this a habit among the kinds of shoppers who are already the most dependent on e-commerce. (Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Similarly, people sometimes ask how Walmart could possibly sustain its more than 4,000 U.S. stores in the digital era. This research helps explain that: That tower of Amazon boxes outside a big-city condo building each evening may not be a good proxy for how people are shopping in, say, rural Tennessee. Even if some people are doing less of it these days, there is still enormous appetite for shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. Yet Adobe's findings suggest there are ways to attract different kinds of shoppers – including low-income ones – to the digital channel. Take, for example, what Adobe observed during the holiday season when it came to purchasing TVs. Researchers looked at how many televisions were bought online during November and December in each state, and then looked at what share of those purchases were made during the week of Black Friday – the period when discounts ran highest. States with lower median incomes tended to see a larger share of TVs bought in that period, suggesting that value pricing was important in getting those consumers to fill their digital shopping carts. "If retailers want to bring more low-income people into the online space, that week is very important for you," Maykot said.

Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com i By Mark Price msprice@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A community fund established at United Way last fall in response to the civil unrest in uptown Charlotte has begun giving out money to charity programs that are dealing with the community’s social and financial ills. United Way of Central Carolinas and Foundation For The Carolinas announced $481,517 in Unite Charlotte grants for 20 local nonprofits and neighborhood organizations today. Led by initial grants from Wells Fargo and Duke Energy, the fund supports programs and organizations focused on community healing, rebuilding trust and creating opportunities in Mecklenburg County. Grants ranged from $2,500 to $25,000, and were focus on programs in such areas as: job creation and entrepreneurial training for formerly incarcerated individuals; addressing gentrification of minority neighborhoods; and building trust between communities and police and justice systems. “After listening to people affected by Charlotte's lack of opportunity, Unite Charlotte is investing in ideas (that) address the community's issues in innovative ways,” said a statement from Sean Garrett, United Way's executive director. “Our region's challenges go back generations, so there is no quick fix, but it's a path forward in creating new solutions.” Grant requests were submitted by 226 organizations, officials said. The applications were evaluated by a 12-member committee consisting of leaders from the faith, education and business communities, as well as community-based organizations and donors. "Dealing with the issues of September forced us outside the box," said a statement from committee member Brandon Neal, a senior counsel for Wells Fargo. "We're planting seeds in neighborhoods that may have been overlooked in the past. We're also encouraging the grant recipients to collaborate strategically for a larger impact than they could achieve on their own." Unite Charlotte’s financial backers include Wells Fargo ($250,000), Knight Foundation ($150,000), Duke Energy ($100,000), Walmart Foundation ($50,000), Elevation Church ($25,000), Foundation For The Carolinas ($25,000), Charlotte WILL ($10,000) and Clariant ($10,000). "We saw it as a strategic investment to help...address critical social and economic challenges in our community,” said Jay Everette, Wells Fargo's senior community relations manager. “True social change takes time, but investments like these can be a great catalyst for driving meaningful first steps to address underlying and systemic issues like racism, access, equity and inclusion." One outcome of United Way's community outreach around the Unite Charlotte fund was a request by 10 organizations to participate in a workshop called Dismantling Racism, facilitated by Race Matters for Juvenile Justice. The intensive two-day training helps participants understand and address systemic racism. Unite Charlotte was conceived at the same time as Charlotte's Statement of Commitment, which publicly acknowledged racism's role in September's unrest. Given that, the 12-member committee agreed the workshop gets to the core of why the fund was created. The committee voted to invest $195,270 for a Dismantling Racism workshop for 630 participants, a racial equity impact analysis and two, 2-day Resist Racism workshops for 80 local high school and college students. Additional Unite Charlotte grants are expected to be deployed after second-round applications open this summer. In the interim, United Way and Foundation For The Carolinas will work with applicants from the first round who had promising ideas but didn't meet all the grant requirements. Among the group’s that received money: Camino Community Development Corp., $25,000 City Start-Up Labs, $25,000 CrossRoads Corporation, $25,000 Greater Charlotte LOC, $5,000 Janelle Dunlap, $2,500 Justice Initiatives, $10,000 Mecklenburg County Youth Coalition, $18,137 North End Community Coalition, $10,000 North End Partners, $2,500 Profound Gentlemen, $15,000 Refugee Support Services, $13,310 Roots in the Community Market Foundation, $2,500 Southside Rides Foundation, $25,000 The Light Factory, $13,300 The Third Place, $24,000 Transcend Charlotte, $5,000 West Boulevard Neighborhood Coalition, $25,000 West Side Community Land Trust, $15,000 Young Black Males Leadership Alliance, $25,000 Race Matters for Juvenile Justice, $195,270 Mark Price: 704-358-5245, @markprice_obs Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Local Suggested for you Comments Videos Local Icy spectacle captured as mini-avalanche falls near Chimney Rock A year later, HB2 has cost North Carolina millions.

When I was growing up in Ireland, we had to take what was called the Beep Test in physical education. We'd start at one end of the gymnasium and have to run to the other end before the beep rang out. After 10 rounds the beep got faster and faster. People who were unfit would drop off. It became a competition among the best athletes, who would eventually get picked for the skilled sports. I did anything I could to avoid the Beep Test. As a teen, I was overweight and unfit. I was the kid you'd find sitting in the bleachers writing songs instead of playing football. Eventually, I got tired of the humiliation. I realized I had to pay attention to life's feedback. I started eating better and exercising more. I saw that building my physical stamina would not only help me make it through the Beep Test but perform better on stage, too. I now work out with a personal trainer. When he put me through an aerobic test recently, I aced it. My experience with the Beep Test, dreadful as it was, shaped the approach I take to my career as a musician. Recently, I have signed a publishing deal with multi-Grammy Award-winning producer Robert Cutarella, and I've released singles like "Say Something," which made it to the top 20 on the Billboard charts. I've realized I can't focus only on my music, much as I would love to do that. I've got to perform in other areas of my life — and running my business as a creative professional is an important one. For me, thriving in a hugely competitive creative field requires me to use a three-pronged approach. It's one that I believe will help many independent creative professionals succeed as entrepreneurs. Here is what it takes. 1. Think like an executive Today's creative artists are expected to master many things beyond their music, from social media to online event management. Instead of trying to handle it all on my own, I've recruited experienced executives to help me. For instance, as my music caught on, I hired Phil Q, a music manager who has held executive positions at Virgin Records, Warner Bros. Records and EMI. He has been involved in the careers of recording artists ranging from Linkin Park and U2 to Josh Groban and the Spice Girls. My manager has advised me that for every marketing dollar we spend, we need to see a return of $3 and create a brand that will be relevant for years to come. Most artists don't think along those lines naturally. I don't, either. At the end of the day, however, I've learned I need to think like a business person to sustain my career for the long term. As a result, the challenge he set out really excites me — and I'm working just as hard to meet it as I did to pass the aerobic test.

Diversify your social circles One thing that has helped me think like an entrepreneur is becoming good friends with a number of CEOs that I've met through my professional endeavors. I believe life is one big networking event and feel it is exceptionally important to surround myself with people in all fields — not just my own — who inspire me and encourage me to pursue my vision. I've made it a habit to ask for their insights on building my creative business. I don't mind being the dumbest person in the room. One CEO gave me powerful advice that has helped me tremendously in my career: Ski with your knees bent, so when you hit the bumps, you won't fall over. "You're always going to have setbacks," he told me. The key was bracing myself with nerves of steel, intuition and honesty, he said. That advice has helped me throughout many creative false starts, failed launches, financial losses and so many broken promises I've lost count. The knocks still hurt, but now I frame them in my mind as an endurance test, and it helps me keep going. 3. Create a safe space In any creative field, you'll encounter detractors. There can be valuable lessons in their sometimes painful feedback. Nonetheless, I found that when I work in a nurturing environment, it is easier to put my ego aside, listen to what the world is telling me and use it to get better. To create a sheltered setting, I enlisted my sister, who has a background in professional management, to start Believe Management, an incubator for me to grow as an artist. It has gradually morphed into a full-service agency that includes other artists who share a similar artistic vision. "One CEO gave me powerful advice that has helped me tremendously in my career: Ski with your knees bent, so when you hit the bumps, you won't fall over." Working from the incubator doesn't shield me from every Beep Test in life — nor would I want it to. Still, it gives me the distance I need to recognize the situations when I need to act on the feedback I'm getting and when it's better to do nothing at all. Like most creative professionals, I want to leave my mark on the world in a positive way. That will only happen if I stay focused on what's really important: making the best music I can and creating a business that sustains it.

Related ABC Will Head to Court for Referring to Beef Products As “Pink Slime” Beef Sirloin with Piquillo Peppers and Capers A Dairy Company Might Lose This Court Case Because of a Missing Oxford Comma That's because these food disparagement laws, as they’re more officially known, don't just protect produce; they shield a whole host of other perishable foods (including milk, meat, and poultry) from unflattering statements that might ultimately damage the manufacturer's reputation or cause sales to decline. While the legalities vary in each state, the laws essentially make it easy for food manufacturers or farmers to sue people who slander their food products. And they critically heighten the risk involved with simply raising concerns about food products. In some cases, the laws even give these manufacturers the legal right to seek extra damages — as is the case with the currently-pending Beef Products Inc v. ABC Broadcasting case. (More on that later.) As of 2017, food libel laws have been passed in thirteen U.S. states. Which it is not so easy to be a food safety critic — even an amateur one — in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, or Texas. In what might be the most famous court case involving a “veggie hate crime” law, a group of cattle ranchers in Texas sued Oprah Winfrey for a whopping $10.3 million in 1998. Speaking with a guest on her show two years earlier in 1996 about the disturbing realities of mad cow disease, she had declared that she might never eat another hamburger, causing beef prices to plummet for weeks. When the jury cleared Winfrey and her team of the libel charges, she told reporters, "Free speech not only lives, it rocks.” More recently, one of these laws came into play again. A lawyer for Beef Products Inc. alleged that scripted comments by ABC Broadcasting’s Diane Sawyer, in which she'd called his South Dakota based client's meat product "pink slime," had cost BPI billions in damages and many lost jobs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has stated that BPI's product is safe, but after ABC's reports, several retailers including Wal-Mart stopped the sale of ground beef products with which Beef Products Inc. is associated. The lawyer argued that ABC Broadcasting had therefore "engaged in a disinformation campaign against a company that produces safe and nutritious beef.” Unlucky for ABC, “veggie hate crime” laws are not only in full effect in South Dakota, where BPI is headquartered; they're doubly strict. If BPI can prove that their product was unjustly slandered, they could receive up to three times the initial damages sought, meaning ABC could have to pay up to $6 billion. The jury trial is scheduled for June 5. There is, of course, some basis for these laws. But it seems it’s only a matter of time before food safety advocates demand that they be restructured — or even go so far as to formally question their constitutionality.
