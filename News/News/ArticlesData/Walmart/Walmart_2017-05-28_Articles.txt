Alongside Albertson’s/Safeway, Publix, and Walmart, these massive grocers failed when it came to selling antibiotic-free chicken to the public. All five retailers fell short in a survey conducted by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), reported OrganicAuthority.com. Each one received a grade of “D” when it came to their lack of progress on the promotion of antibiotic practices, and their inability to provide antibiotic-free chicken offerings. For their survey, the NRDC looked at the retailers’ branches in Charlotte, Chicago, Houston, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. The NRDC selected these cities to represent the country’s four census regions. These locations were then graded according to the following categories: policy (20 points), consumer education at point of purchase (five points), brand score antibiotic use (20 points), and brand score certification (10 points). The raw total of these categories was 55 points, and each grocer scored as such: Walmart received 20.9 points (38 percent), Albertson’s/Safeway received 21.5 points (39 percent), Publix received 21 points (38 percent), Kroger received 18.4 points (33 percent), and Costco received 22 points (40 percent). Sans Costco, all other retailers scored poorly in policy, which was defined as “Commitment to phase out routine use of antibiotics described on major retailer website” and “Timeline to phase out routine use of antibiotics described on major retailer website.” This was especially notable, as large chicken producers like Tyson and Perdue have moved away from or pledged to move away from the use of antibiotics. Walmart was noted as the biggest offender in this regard. Not only does the company have the most number of suppliers with antibiotic-free chicken products, but Walmart has called for greater transparency from producers. Moreover, the NRDC discovered that the retailers’ own private-label chicken brands were sourced from producers with questionable antibiotic-free practices. (Related: Perdue announces that its chicken products are now 95 percent antibiotic-free) As for helping consumers in making informed choices, only Publix had the necessary signage in all of their stores. All of their branches had displays that informed consumers of producers with responsible antibiotic policies. However, this did not include producers who were still in the process of phasing out antibiotics from their products. Though all the retailers offered United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-certified  chicken or Raised Without Antibiotics (RWA) chicken, there were no indications that these poultry products had been certified by third parties. Whole Foods may not have included in the survey, but the NRDC lauded it as the sole grocer to “have earned top score in all categories.” Their policy to sell antibiotic-free livestock products goes beyond chicken and covers beef, pork, and turkey. Whole Foods also made it easier for consumers to understand their purchases better, something that all the other retailers failed to do. The NRDC concluded their survey by asking for retailers to commit themselves to the elimination of antibiotic-laden products from their chains, and for consumers to “vote with their wallets” by purchasing RWA and USDA-certified chicken. Carmen Cordova, a staff scientist under the Food and Agriculture Program of the NRDC, said this about the results of the survey: “The top five grocery store chains in the country feed millions of Americans, so their actions have a big impact on public health — for better or worse. Supermarkets can either continue to ignore the spread of drug-resistant infections, or they can answer their customers’ call to be a part of the solution.” Rather than curing diseases among chickens, antibiotics are more often used to promote quicker growth in the animals and to prevent them from getting sick. According to OrganicAuthority.com, this practice allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive, which in turn is extremely harmful to humans and animals alike.

Wal-Mart employees wi... Marc Lore was in the crowd last June when Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Officer Doug Mc-Millon told shareholders and employees gathered in Northwest Arkansas that the company was embarking on a journey to “re-imagine retail.” It wasn’t known publicly at that time, but two months after Wal-Mart’s annual shareholders meeting, the company revealed that Lore would become one of the cornerstones of the plan. Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com for the hefty price of $3.3 billion last August and, with it, placed Lore — the online retailer’s co-founder and a former Amazon.com executive — in charge of jolting the company’s underperforming e-commerce business. The task moves Lore from the crowd last year to center stage this year as Wal-Mart prepares for its annual shareholders meeting Friday in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus. The star-studded celebration, which blends business with entertainment, caps a week filled with festivities. “I got a chance to see and experience it last year, and it was fascinating,” Lore said last week. “I really look forward to being a part of it this year.” Lore is playing an integral role in a transformative period for Wal-Mart, which is trying to make inroads against dominant online retailer Amazon.com. With the longtime New Jersey resident on board, McMillon, U.S. stores chief Greg Foran and other executives have been acting on an aggressive plan aimed at reshaping the business through initiatives, acquisitions and staff restructuring they believe will position Wal-Mart for the future of retail. Wal-Mart wants to blur the lines between its online offerings and vast network of U.S. stores, creating a seamless experience for customers to purchase any item, anytime and in any way of their choosing — all while maintaining the company’s low-cost, low-price foundation. It’s still the early stages of the multilayered plan, but first-quarter results announced earlier this month produced plenty of optimism about Wal-Mart’s progress. Wal-Mart reported a 63 percent surge in U.S. e-commerce sales during the quarter, while revealing a 1.4 percent increase in same-store sales and a 1.5 percent increase in traffic. The retailer also stressed that much of the e-commerce sales growth was “organic,” coming from Walmart.com instead of just a sales boost from recent acquisitions of online retailers ShoeBuy, Moosejaw and ModCloth. The results impressed Wall Street, as Wal-Mart’s stock subsequently reached a 52-week high. Concerns remain regarding long-term profitability growth — Wal-Mart’s net income fell 1.3 percent compared with last year — but the efforts are noticed. “In the past Wal-Mart was always reacting to what Amazon was doing, but now you’re starting to see the tide turn a little bit,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst with Edward Jones. “I think Marc Lore, and everything he’s doing there, it’s definitely turning heads. I think people are recognizing they’re back on the offense again after years of playing defense.” Plenty of groundwork took place before Lore joined the company. Wal-Mart invested billions in cleaning up its stores, increasing wages for employees and training workers to make its physical locations more appealing for customers. The effort has led to 11 straight quarters of same-store sales growth and 10 straight of traffic increases, which have largely come during a period in which traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to draw customers into their stores. At the same time, Wal-mart continued losing e-commerce ground to Amazon, struggling to create a thriving online business to operate alongside its store success. Global e-commerce sales sputtered through eight-straight quarters of deceleration before the company announced the Jet.com acquisition last year. “The path they were on was not a path that was fundamentally transforming the company in a way that it needs to transform,” said Steve Dennis, founder of SageBerry Consulting. McMillon said in August that the Jet.com acquisition was a clear indication Wal-Mart was even more committed to “winning in e-commerce.” He added that Lore’s experience was “attractive.” It’s clear that Wal-Mart is making a big bet he will succeed. Lore received $244 million in total compensation last year, most of it stemming from shares of Jet.com stock as part of the acquisition. Retail analysts believe it’s a hefty price, especially with no guarantee of quick and significant returns. But it’s also the type of move some see as needed by Wal-Mart if it is to gain online traction. Sucharita Mulpuru, an independent retail analyst, said Wal-Mart had tried plenty of tactics but was continuing to lose ground against “the most formidable competitor they’ve faced.” “One of the next levels of an experiment that you can try is to hire a sort of superstar who has a reputation for disrupting industries and was a former Amazon executive himself,” Mulpuru said. “He seemingly has a playbook that could, if anything, be a viable competitor.” While there have been adjustments to the new role, Lore said, stepping into a chief executive position at a massive retailer has been relatively smooth. No longer does he have to spend a large chunk of time raising capital to fuel Jet.com. Instead, his focus is solely on implementing ways for Wal-Mart to capitalize on its “incredible advantages,” including a network of 4,700 physical locations and logistical infrastructure. “We are moving extremely fast, faster than I thought would’ve been possible inside a company the size of Wal-Mart,” Lore said. “We’ve made a lot of changes, and we’ll continue to. Doug McMillon and the board have done a great job of setting me and the whole e-commerce team up for success.” So far, Wal-Mart has introduced initiatives like two-day free shipping without a membership fee for purchases totaling $35 or more. It was a direct shot at Amazon and its Prime program, which offers free shipping for a yearly subscription fee. Amazon has since lowered the threshold for free shipping for its non-Prime customers from $50 to $25. More recently, Lore has introduced ideas to integrate the stores and online channels, like pickup discount. The service gives customers a chance to purchase online-only products for a cheaper price if they’re willing to pick them up at a store and, as Lore said, “hopefully buy other stuff” while there. Another new service, Easy Reorder, tracks products purchased with a credit car in a Wal-Mart store and automatically files them to a customer’s online account. They can be reordered with one click. “Some advice I had gotten early on and proved to be extremely helpful was to make sure you work very closely with Greg Foran,” Lore said regarding the CEO of the Wal-Mart U.S. division. “If you want to give customers a truly integrated, omnichannel experience, it was important that we were kind of working together to make it happen, both the ecomm and the stores organizations. I think we got off on the right foot.” Laura Kennedy, director of retail insights for Kantar Retail, said initiatives like free two-day shipping and pickup discount are effective. But she believes that the most significant changes may have taken place behind the scenes with personnel moves aimed at integrating the digital and store sides. Two key examples: Chief marketing officer Tony Rogers now leads a unified marketing organization that includes Walmart.com, Jet.com and Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores. Jeremy King was promoted to chief technology officer and now reports to Lore and Foran, bringing together Wal-Mart’s U.S. retail and ecommerce technology teams. “In theory, they’re bringing those two groups together and trying to break down some of that silo,” Kennedy said about the divide that existed between Wal-Mart’s in-store and online operations. Lore integrated Walmart.com and Jet.com executives into his leadership team, and acquisitions have further injected Wal-Mart with talent. Leadership teams at ShoeBuy, Moosejaw and ModCloth continue to operate those sites as stand-alone businesses and also oversee their specific categories — shoes and apparel, outdoor, women’s fashion — across Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations. The acquisitions are designed to improve assortment and give Wal-Mart expertise in higher-margin categories, according to McMillon. But he stressed that the company is not simply trying to buy its way to e-commerce success. Instead, McMillon said, it will help “speed some things up.” Retail analyst Mulpuru said: “I think they’ve probably got a lot of critics already because it is a risky strategy. It’s the opposite of the conservative approach Sam Walton espoused from day one. It’s buying companies that aren’t profitable. It is kind of just attempting to gobble up market share. It’s doing really, really aggressive things. But the times are different now because Amazon has forced them to be different.” The first-quarter results are promising, but questions remain about Wal-Mart’s chances of long-term success and Lore’s ability to build a profitable, sustainable e-commerce business. SageBerry Consulting’s Dennis said it’s especially hard to predict the latter considering Quidsi — the e-commerce company Lore sold to Amazon in 2010 — was shut down earlier this year after Amazon said it was unprofitable. Jet.com wasn’t profitable, either, when Wal-Mart made its move last summer. “He’s got a particular set of skills. If those set of skills are ultimately really helpful to Wal-Mart, I don’t know,” Dennis said. “But I think if you bring him in, if you believe he’s sort of your messiah and you’re really looking to swing for the fences and be aggressive and very transformative, I do think you’ve got to give the guy a fair amount of latitude.” Other analysts agree that Wal-Mart must continue to give Lore the freedom to experiment, but suspect that the window won’t be open too long if there aren’t significant results. Several agreed the timeline could span about 18 months. Lore isn’t focused on potential deadlines. Instead, he applauded Wal-Mart’s willingness to give him the freedom and backing to innovate and build the online business. “Being empowered to move fast and make the decisions necessary to take the Wal-Mart ecommerce business to the next level is everything,” Lore said. More acquisitions could be on the horizon with the company reportedly working on a deal to acquire men’s fashion retailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart will continue to emphasize groceries, with pickup locations expected to expand from about 600 to 1,100 stores this year. The company’s online assortment, which has expanded to more than 50 million items, will continue to grow as well. Lore also said he’s challenging his team to meet five ecommerce fundamentals: have products, help customers find them easily, display them well, price them right and deliver them quickly and efficiently. If Wal-Mart can accomplish it, Lore is confident e-commerce growth will continue. “A lot of the building blocks have been put in place, but there’s so much more to be done,” Lore said. “We’re just getting started.” Wal-Mart transformation timeline CEO Doug McMillon said Wal-Mart had an opportunity to “reimagine retail again” during last year’s annual shareholders meeting. Below is a timeline of key events that have occurred as the company continues its transformation under McMillon: JUNE 20 — Wal-Mart sells Yihaodian, its Chinese e-commerce business, to JD.com for a 5 percent stake in the company and forms a strategic partnership. Wal-Mart now holds a 12 percent stake in JD.com. JULY 6 — Wal-Mart completes the rollout of its mobile payment service — Wal-Mart Pay — to all of its U.S. stores. Work began in December 2015. AUG. 8 — The company acquires Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares of company stock. Marc Lore is named the retailer’s U.S. ecommerce chief. SEPT. 1 — Wal-Mart eliminates 7,000 back-office positions to improve efficiency. The cuts cover mostly accounting and invoicing workers. OCT. 6 — Wal-Mart investors are told that new U.S. store openings will slow down and the focus will shift to investments in e-commerce, technology and remodeling existing stores. JAN. 5 — Wal-Mart acquires ShoeBuy for $70 million and will operate it as a stand-alone site. The company starts an acquisition spree that includes outdoor retailer Moosejaw and women’s clothing site Modcloth. JAN. 6 — Rosalind Brewer announces her retirement as Sam’s Club CEO after leading the warehouse business for five years. John Furner, chief merchandising officer, is elevated to CEO. JAN. 20 — The company begins a round of corporate layoffs, cutting about 1,000 positions before Jan. 31. The layoffs include 511 workers at its headquarters. JAN. 30 — Wal-Mart introduces free two-day shipping without a membership fee on more than 2 million items. It is Lore’s first significant e-commerce initiative. MARCH 22 — Wal-Mart opens Store No 8, a Silicon Valley innovation hub, to identify, invent and invest in ideas that will “transform the future of commerce” such as virtual reality and machine learning. APRIL 5 — Another round of corporate layoffs affect about 300 positions in the information systems division. Positions also were eliminated at Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart International. APRIL 11 — The retailer introduces Pickup Discount, a discount for purchasing selected items online and picking them up in one of 4,700 U.S. stores. MAY 19 — Wal-Mart announces U.S. online sales surged 63 percent in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Samestore sales growth of 1.4 percent also helps the stock reach a new 52-week high.

According to a KTLA report, Castillo, a 39-year-old mother of two, drove to the local Walmart with her children on Thursday, May 25, 2017; parked the car in the parking lot; and then allegedly locked her kids aged 2 and 5 inside the trunk of the car and walked into Walmart to complete her shopping trip. However, Tori’s alleged act caught the attention of a bystander who decided to call 911 — who then informed the local police department about the rather disturbing incident. According to Lieutenant Casey Warren from the Riverdale Police Department, after they received the call from the good Samaritan, officers reached the parking lot within minutes and rescued the children. According to Lt. Warren, by the time responding officers reached there, the children had started making noises and were moving frantically inside the trunk in a bid to escape. The kids were reportedly desperately trying to get out of the trunk, and their repeated movements caused the vehicle to shake violently. A small crowd had gathered at the parking lot by then. With the help of several bystanders, the cops asked the 5-year-old kid inside the trunk not to panic and directed her to use the emergency latch inside the trunk to open it from the inside. The elder child was then able to successfully open the trunk much to everyone’s relief. Tori Castillo, who was still inside Walmart the entire time, was arrested a few minutes later when she came back outside following her shopping trip. Tori was also interrogated by the officers in the parking lot. Following Tori’s arrest, Officers from the Riverdale Police Department called the Child and Family Services who then took both the children under their care. Currently, both the children are under the care of a responsible party. Following a lengthy interrogation, Tori was booked into Weber County Jail and an investigation has been launched. Tori is likely to face multiple child abuse charges. However, authorities are also likely to evaluate her mental health condition before she is tried and eventually convicted for her actions. While several cases of parents and caretakers forgetting their kids inside hot cars, often leading to injuries and death, have been reported in the past, cases of parents who deliberately put their children at risk are less common. As of now, it is still not known whether Tori had deliberately forced her kids into the trunk of the car or if her actions were the result of some form of mental illness. Officers are still investigating all possible angles so that they can come to a believable conclusion.

Huff, Pool/AP Images] Hot car deaths in the U.S. have been on the rise since the past few years. According to statistics from Jan Null, CCM, Department of Meteorology and Climate Science, San Jose State University, in 2017 alone there have been 11 deaths of children who were left inside cars. In 2016, 39 children died of the same cause. In fact, since the year 1998 — the year from which agencies started to collect data from heatstroke deaths of children left in hot cars — an astounding 709 children have died inside hot cars. On average, 37 kids in the U.S. die of heatstroke, many of them inside hot cars. In the most recent incident, two children from Texas, a 2-year-old and a 16-month-old, were found dead inside a car.

The children were identified as Juliet and Cavanaugh Ramirez. An investigation into the incident is still underway.

But this week, his plan backfired big time. Andrea Noel 05.29.17 12:00 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily MEXICO CITY—Amir Mirza Hekmati was arrested in 2012 while visiting his sick grandmother in Iran. Terrified and tortured, the former U.S. Marine—fluent in both Persian and Arabic as well as English—confessed under duress to being a CIA spy and was sentenced to death. After secret talks during the Obama administration, which negotiated the prisoner swap that led to clemency for seven Iranians incarcerated in the U.S. in exchange for the release of four prisoners—including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, an incarcerated Christian pastor, and Hekmati—the former Marine, was finally returned to the United States in early 2016. Two years earlier, 60-year-old former talk-show host Montel Williams, seated in a boat on a lake in Tennessee, had sent a video message to Hekmati. “Hey Amir, my friend,” said Montel, “Everywhere I go in this country people stop me all the time and ask me how you’re doing, and ask me when you’re coming home. So, I thought maybe, today, I’d give you a little taste of what home is—what you fought for, what you defended. “You’re coming home, my friend. I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my heart. You’re coming home really soon,” Montel promised. “Every single person in this country owes you a debt, my friend. And I’m not going to stop until they pay it.” Montel repeatedly made forceful, and at times tearful, public pleas on Hekmati’s behalf on national television, demanding action from the U.S. government and support from the American people to #FreeAmir and donate to a fund set up to aid his legal defense. By all accounts, Montel’s was a noble and successful mission. And this January, a year after his release, Hekmati thanked him for his role in fighting for the former Marine’s freedom. But this was not the only time Montel took up the cause of incarcerated Marines, and not all of his efforts have led to such a happy ending. *** Tyler James Yeager, a 39-year-old former U.S. Marine Corps Sniper, was arrested across the border from San Diego in Tijuana on April 23. He was taken into custody that Sunday afternoon, after a string of home burglaries made him public enemy number one among local American expats living in the sleepy beachside communities that dot the Baja coastline. Along the scenic route between Tijuana and Rosarito—a town known mostly as a feasting place, with famous lobster dinners and Spring Break beer binges—Yeager had made himself an absolute nuisance. Over the course of several weeks this spring, multiple homes inside the partially gated communities here—many of whose residents are semi-retired Americans, part-time real-estate vendors, and the like—were broken into. These expats often spend hours on end gossiping with neighbors and drinking at the local watering hole—aptly called Plan B. There’s not much going on here—no Plan A, as it were. So, when word got out that there was a petty criminal on the loose, local residents with plenty of spare time on their hands and little in the way of external stimulation, found the hunt that ensued quite thrilling. By sheer small-world, wild coincidence, I happened to be staying in one of these seaside communities and saw as neighbors who had never before spoken to each other came together for a common single-minded purpose: Get Yeager.

Dozens of people from the surrounding communities mocked up Wanted posters featuring Yeager’s tweaked-out face. Sadly, the decorated Marine had become addicted to methamphetamine and severed contact with several family members before allegedly resorting to thievery for a fix. “BEWARE!” read the posters, “James Tyler Yeager continues to break into our homes. “Call ‘The Guards’”—it read—“if you see him.” It was mid-April when the hunt began. And the local expats wanted Yeager behind bars. Immediately. Before he could strike again. But strike again he would. Repeatedly. And now, they fear, he’s returned once more to vandalize their homes. They blame Montel Williams, the 1990s talk show host, of all people. *** Nine days before Yeager’s arrest in Mexico, the expats created a Facebook group—To Catch a Thief. There, they posted surveillance photos of Yeager’s multiple run-ins with the law, shared information about recent sightings, and posted tips on his presumed whereabouts. “We need to work together to stop him,” said the group’s creator in an early post. “I have only seen him physically one time over six months ago,” said one local resident. “I thought I saw him at [the only local] Walmart but wasn’t sure… I would look for a sleeve tattoo, meaning a tattoo down his arm, and bandage on one of his hands… will check on the facial hair and get back to you.” It was a neighborhood watch, on steroids. But the residents would be repeatedly thwarted by Yeager, the highly skilled Marine, whose tattoos—the words “U.S. Marine” and “Sniper” inked into his left arm—showed his pride for the job he once performed dutifully. “I think I saw him yesterday in front of my next door neighbor’s house,” said one local, in the group, seven days before his arrest. “I cannot be sure the guy who was hanging around my neighbor’s front door was him or not. He was evasive and took off with another guy when I asked what he was doing.” He added, “My neighbor is a little strange and we don’t talk much.” The sightings would continue, as would the string of break-ins, but Yeager would continue to get away.“Last night when we got home, the guards were chasing him. Apparently he had broken into some woman’s home while she was there and scared her half to death,” one woman wrote. “Many neighbors, including my son, were in on the chase but the thief escaped.” This would be just one of multiple failed on-foot pursuits. It would also be the first time there was mention of a gun. He had, apparently, pointed a shotgun at one of the community guards. I’d noticed the posters and some of the posts online. And across several Facebook groups about Baja that I belong to—occasionally useful sources of information on unreported homicides—there was discussion of Yeager. Three days before the arrest, a few local Americans were patrolling the cobblestone streets with their dogs. They were on the hunt once more, but apparently Yeager had just managed to evade the guards yet again. He “broke into another home in plain daylight,” and this time was “no longer alone,” locals said.   “My neighbor told me they left drug paraphernalia behind in the home,” one woman wrote. “Yep, police came. I heard about it,” another confirmed. “I had a call... from a friend that seen 2 people chasing someone… He was seen running away today.” Later, he was spotted at the beach. “There was only James by himself around 11 a.m. when we chased him around the community, police came and he just weaved his way through several properties to get away,” a neighbor added. “Damn James!!! He needs to go!!!” replied another. “We will need to celebrate when they catch him!!” “I was there for the morning chase,” said another neighbor. “The guards and police did their best but he really knows the angles here.” Then the lawyer for another adjacent community’s homeowners association posted in one of the groups: “On the evening of Thursday, 4/20/2017… at approx. 11:15pm, he was spotted and a foot pursuit took place to apprehend him. He fled over the south end fence injuring himself on the barb wire. “Waiting for confirmation of his arrest,” he said. But that confirmation didn’t come. And by April 22, the panic had grown wilder. “They just posted on another page how he almost killed a man in San Miguel (the area in the entrance to Ensenada) a bit over a month ago,” one resident posted. That same day, in the early afternoon, locals said Yeager was being actively chased up cobblestone streets through two of the communities, but they were unable to catch him. “CONVICTED THIEF STILL AT LARGE!!!” a resident posted, sharing mugshots from previous incidents that occurred stateside. “He’s a confirmed convict—sexual assault, DUI, and possibly drugs. BEWARE EVERYONE.” “It keeps getting worse and scarier!!!” one wrote. By then, reports of previous burglaries were also becoming bolder. “He is a desperate ruthless SOB! He broke into my house on Easter evening that is super well lit and has security cameras. Cut the phone line and broke thru the wall in the back side of the house and wreaked havoc!” After a chase, they said, the residents were once again thwarted. “The other day we spotted him, he dumped his bike and went to the beach... He ran… He disappeared, we looked everywhere,” one man said. “I believe he lives in several homes and has places to duck all over.” The tally of crimes for which Yeager supposedly was responsible had begun to quickly balloon: “25+ HOUSES ROBBED. Cars stolen.” But he was also now locally suspected of murder: “Remember The Crime that has not been solved here... for all we know this guy is responsible... or at least capable of it!!” Within the groups, suspicions were high, and locals were also sharing anecdotes about how to thwart other criminals. One shared post screamed in all caps: “If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield, do not stop to check your car, do not operate the wipers and do not spray any water because eggs mixed with water become milky, and block your vision up to 92.5%, and you are then forced to stop beside the road and become a victim of these criminals […] These are desperate times and these are unsavory individuals who will take desperate measures to get what they want.” Then finally, just as the neighborhood watch had reached the peak of panic—“We just notified the FBI,” one wrote—the most active member of the group broke the good news. “He was apprehended today by [Mexican] Federal Police!!” she wrote—adding the clapping hands, thumbs up, okie dokie, and hallelujah emojis. “We were all afraid to leave our homes and also afraid to return at night and maybe find him or anyone else in the home... it was scary!!! … We are so blessed that this convict was finally caught.” “We did it everyone,” said a neighbor, sharing a photo of the regional newspaper El Mexicano, which featured a picture of a stoned-looking Yeager, under the subheading: “He Murdered Two Little Old Grannies.” *** Despite accusations he had participated in dozens of crimes, including a few murders, and the dozens of local expats wildly speculating, commenting, and sharing information across multiple Facebook groups, when it came time to file police reports only one local expat showed up. Mariah Metter’s home was broken into twice in the span of one week. “I came home after the first time, and apparently he had made himself at home and was cooking and eating,” she told me. “There were not a lot of damages, other than a broken window. “The second time there was a lot more damage,” she said, adding that he’d ransacked the whole house, took a shower, and left wearing her husband’s clothes. He showed cunning, despite his seemingly crippling addiction. “He put large screws through all the doors to stop anybody from opening them from the outside,” which gave him enough time to escape through a window in the back of the house, she said. He also left behind a few personal belongings, including meth-related drug paraphernalia. After his arrest, he was photographed next to a shotgun, allegedly the gun he carried during the burglaries—a claim his lawyer denies. *** A week after his arrest, as the locals were still patting each other on the back, the first bad news broke. “This thief broke into our homes and terrorized our community,” one local wrote. “He was arrested and Montel Williams, allegedly, paid for his defense and got him out of jail.” The expats were outraged, and all had an opinion. They spammed Montel’s Facebook page with criticism—posts that were later deleted by his team.“We have no choice than to arm ourselves,” one wrote. “Hopefully the law will be applied in the same manner if the police catch you with a gun.” Another said, “I feel terrible he didn’t TRIP AND FALL OFF THE FUCKING CLIFF!!” Montel’s role in this case was to reach out to Tijuana attorney Fernando Benitez, who then agreed to take Yeager’s case. “When Yeager’s statement was being taken, there was no translator available. So they picked a prison guard at random who used to work at a swap meet somewhere and spoke decent English,” Benitez explained over the phone. “But he isn’t trained in any real capacity to provide this service. His English is maybe good enough to order dinner at a restaurant, but he wouldn’t be able to go into technical details and explain important legal points to Yeager. “Furthermore, he is inherently on the prosecutor’s side, so in no way would his assistance have been objective,” Benitez said. “The procedure that’s in place should be followed by the authorities. The rule is to first seek out a trained expert. If none is available, they must request one from one of the public universities. If one isn’t available, they can seek out someone from a private university. Again, if one isn’t available, there are plenty of bilingual lawyers who can do the job. This is a border city, after all.” According to Benitez, the authorities claimed that they were short on time, and in a hurry. “When Americans are arrested in Mexico, the first thing they usually imagine is something like [the film] Midnight Express—they think they’ll be tortured, raped, that something horrible will happen. The thought isn’t completely justified, but it also isn’t entirely implausible,” he said. “He was vulnerable, and this isn’t his country.” Benitez said the authorities are likely to look at Yeager and see only “an undesirable—a drug addict” and invoke the “reverse Trump discourse,” referring to the president’s comments about Mexico “not sending their best.” President Donald Trump, while on the campaign trail claimed Mexicans who enter the U.S. are “rapists” and “murderers,” if you’ll recall. Locals had already begun accusing Yeager of committing both sordid crimes, in addition to the robberies. Yeager alleged that he was beaten by Mexican police, after his arrest. Images show Yeager had blood in his hair, but officially the police say he cut his head while ducking under a barbed wire fence, which is in keeping with his previous behavior of outrunning his pursuers. “The Mexican justice system is in it’s infancy, and we are just beginning to switch from an archaic, near-feudal system,” Benitez said. “Part of my job is often based in exploiting the procedural failings that our authorities commit for the sake of wrapping things up quickly.” On April 30, the judge was forced to throw Yeager’s case out because he hadn’t been provided with an adequate translator. His release was ordered as a result of this technicality, which for Benitez amounts to yet another success. “If the [authorities] continue to make mistakes, and are uninterested in following the strict procedures that are in place, the prosecutors’ cases will continue to fall apart whenever capable attorneys intervene,” he said. “It’s their choice, whether or not to commit to doing things correctly.” “Damn,” an expat wrote in To Catch a Thief. “So much for all the effort that went into catching him. Now what? Does anyone have any ideas? Are we just supposed to wait to see and see if he comes back here to start all over again?” “Unbelievable,” said another. “This guy will be back by Tuesday smoking ice and doing whatever he wants. Shameful.” But Yeager was not immediately released. He was transferred from Tijuana’s horrific La Mesa prison, to an immigration detention center where he sat for more than a week—nine days after his freedom was ordered, his lawyer and Montel’s team said. Montel’s tiny team was monitoring the transfer, and claimed Yeager was supposed to be delivered to U.S. officials at the border. But, things didn’t go according to plan. *** Benitez is a rather high-profile attorney in Tijuana. He represented the so-called Affluenza Teen, Ethan Couch, who disappeared into Mexico more than a year ago, after killing four people in a drunken car crash. His lawyer in the U.S. argued he was “too rich” to know any better. Benitez said, “I know nobody likes Ethan, but no matter how repugnant one thinks his argument or actions were, those deemed odious deserve legal counsel, too. I don’t have the luxury of participating in a popularity contest. If someone needs my help they get it. “At the end of the day, [Couch] desisted from his appeal in Mexico and offered himself back to the U.S. to serve his time,” Benitez said. “People may not like it, but we’ve got to be fair.” *** Benitez first met Montel, and his PR man-turned-political director Jonathan Franks, in 2014. This was the first and only other time Montel intervened in the case of a U.S. Marine jailed in Mexico. Reserve Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi was arrested that March for driving from San Diego into Tijuana with a truck full of improperly stored and loaded high-power weapons, along with a stockpile of ammo—a big no-no in Mexico, but also a violation of California law. His case, too, was a tricky one that drew intense criticism locally, among both nationals and local expats—even sparking a debate about national sovereignty as Montel and other high-profile figures like then-Secretary of State John Kerry began demanding his return.   Tahmooressi was broadly accused and suspected of gunrunning—bringing arms into Mexico to sell to nationals. But his family and his lawyer, Benitez, told me at the time that Tahmooressi was confused, recently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and had entered the country “accidentally” after making a wrong turn at the border. “He absolutely, emphatically, would never have sold his weapons,” his mother, Jill, told me back in 2014. “He needed those weapons. Those were his self-defense. He had documented hyper-vigilance. “We observed escalating symptoms of PTSD,” she said, which is why he ended up in San Diego, seeking treatment at the local Veterans Affairs hospital. “We told him, ‘You’ve got to get professional help, you don’t have this under control,’” and he was diagnosed with PTSD at the local VA, two weeks before entering Mexico with a truck full of guns. According to his mother, he had been “having hunter-prey syndrome—he was the prey.” I listened to our phone calls this week, once more, and compared the similarities—and differences—between Tahmooressi and Yeager, who is accused of robbing more than a dozen homes in Baja, armed with a busted shotgun. “He was a combat infantry Marine,” Tahmooressi’s mother said. He had served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. “When you’re a Marine, if you carry your gun that’s no different than a secretary who carries a pen or a carpenter who carries a hammer. It’s what made him feel secure, so to me it was justified. I understood it.” While locked in the La Mesa penitentiary, the same prison where Yeager was imprisoned earlier this month, Tahmooressi’s sanity was questioned when he attempted to slash his throat with a broken lightbulb. “I considered it a highly intellectual, strategic move to get into an even safer part of the jail,” Jill said. “His instinct was to just stay alive. He was placed in the general populace in La Mesa, and seemingly was going to be raped, tortured and executed by the hitmen that were in the cell with him that night. “He did what any Marine would do,” she said: “Improvise, adapt, and overcome.” This perceived suicide attempt landed him in the infirmary, away from his cellmates. It was thanks to Montel that the Tahmooressi family was put in touch with Benitez who successfully argued for his release, so he could return to the U.S. to continue treatment for PTSD. Montel tearfully testified before a congressional subcommittee in the weeks before the Marine’s release, seated alongside Tahmooressi’s mother, Jill. “Thirty-thousand new cases of traumatic brain injury occur every year in our services,” Montel testified. “We currently have over 600,000 veterans suffering from residual symptoms. “I have scars on my brain that are synonymous with concussive brain injury,” he said, listing symptoms like “emotional debility, sometimes depression, sometimes hyper-vigilance.” “I can walk in this hallway in Congress where I’m most protected and be afraid to walk in that bathroom. This is what these young men live through,” he said. “Bring him home and let’s treat him appropriately.” While butchering Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s last name, Montel demanded then-President Barack Obama “Pick up the phone!” and “Make the call!” to the Mexican government, to order the Marine’s release. By the time he regained his freedom on Halloween 2014, seven months after he was first jailed, Tahmooressi had been through a torturous ordeal, and his mental health seemingly deteriorated further. Sources close to the family said that, upon release, he was paranoid and confused by a set of wireless headphones that he briefly suspected were some sort of alien communication device. A year after his arrest in Mexico, he was arrested once more in Georgia, for a reckless DUI. Last year, he was arrested, yet again, this time for pot possession in Indiana, where he was handed a month-long sentence in a county jail. *** “I still represent the Tahmooressis,” said Montel’s representative, Jonathan Franks, when we talked on the phone Thursday night. “We are glad that all of his arrests in the U.S. since then have been nickel-and-dime pot charges, basically... But we got lucky with Andrew [Tahmooressi],” he said. “We had resources then, and pressure on the American side helped us drive him out.” This was three years ago, but now semi-retired Montel’s resources are finite, and it’s essentially just him and Franks, who said he does this advocacy work largely without compensation. So, this conversation over the phone with Franks just before midnight on Thursday had an air of panic about it. What the hell happened to Yeager and where is he? Yeager’s sister insists that he is back in Mexico. “Whenever we intervene we usually try to keep it pretty quiet, but in this particular situation quiet isn’t called for,” Franks said. “We don’t want to get a phone call in the middle of the night, which is why we are putting out the alert.” Just as the furious American expats who Yeager terrorized for weeks feared, Yeager is back on the streets here in Mexico and free to continue his crime spree. “Nobody ever thought it was a good idea to say, ‘Hey Mexico, release him and put him back on the street,’” says Franks. “The whole idea was to have him confined in the United States, and to have him put back on his medication to treat his PTSD, at which point he is not a threat to anyone.” Though, when pressed, he conceded, “Yes, he’s a drug addict as well.” “What’s interesting is that this time around we knew the system much better and really thought we had it better planned,” Franks explained. “There’s a fairly high impunity rate in the Mexican justice system, so even if he had been convicted, apparently, he could bail until he could pay his way out, so the thought was, let’s get him back, let’s get him sane, and have him face the warrant he already has in the American justice system.” Yeager has an outstanding warrant in Montana stemming from court fines related to a sexual assault charge from a few years back. Franks explained the “sexual” part of the charge came as a result of “a drunken shoving match with his significant other, in which she lands on the ground, and it happens to be sexual assault because of where specifically he pushed her—in the chest.” That domestic disturbance landed Yeager “in jail for two days” but, Franks said, “It wasn’t a rape or anything like that.” Franks received word from Yeager’s sister Tracy on Thursday afternoon, hours before our mile-a-minute phone call. She said Yeager was now back in Mexico. Although she also claimed, weeks ago on May 9, that Yeager had returned to San Diego. “I have to think about what I just did to my brother,” Tracy told me late Thursday night, referring to sounding the alarm on his whereabouts. “This is tough for me. I can’t stand what my brother has done. I love him, I just don’t like what he is doing. “I sent him money and I could hear the panic in his voice,” she said. Those funds were picked up at a Mexican Walmart, confirming that indeed Yeager is in Mexico. “I will not send him any more money. I did it so maybe he won’t rob people and I told him that.” Franks, sounding worried, explained that “that wasn’t part of the deal.” He said Yeager was contacted on Thursday afternoon, confirmed he back was in Mexico, and sounded “delusionally logical.” According to Franks, consulate employees had also confirmed on May 9 that Mexican immigration officials had delivered Yeager to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol at the local point of entry. “We had asked CBP to please hold on to him, and have an ambulance take him to the VA, since his family didn’t have the resources to get down there. And he made it through border patrol, but it was a good six or seven hours until we found him,” Franks said, explaining that Yeager’s sister had visually confirmed he was back in the U.S. after an online conversation. “We called CBP literally every 15 minutes to makes sure everything went smoothly. “In no way do I want to disparage individual officers of the CBP, but it really would have been super helpful if they had detained him,” he said. “Unfortunately, they didn’t hold up their end of the bargain. I’m sure they did their best, but you would think a guy in prison garb, delivered by the Mexicans in handcuffs, carrying no ID would trigger some sort of inspection.” Franks called it “incomprehensible that he was not detained.” A fellow veteran had volunteered to wait for him on the U.S. side of the border, Benitez added, “But, apparently, Yeager slipped past him.” “I began to suspect one of two things,” he said. “Either he had planned to return to the streets in the U.S.—he is quite skilled at vagrancy—or he had reentered Mexico, which is exactly what I advised him he should not do. Because the case against him in Mexico is fairly solid.” “I wish we could have hired two ex-Marines to sit on the checkpoint and grab him the second he came out,” Franks lamented. “But we’re a real small operation. There is no show, it’s just Montel [and me] and it’s his personal finances in all of this. I wish we had unlimited resources but we don’t. The second that we realized something was wrong, we started alerting people which is why I’m talking to you. We took a second to figure out what to do, how to do it, and now we’re doing it.” *** “Sounds like Mexico might need a wall to keep dirtball Americans out,” one Baja expat joked. But, actually, for Mexicans it’s not very funny. It’s become one of the most tired movie tropes ever—think: The Shawshank Redemption or The Fugitive. Foreign criminals love Mexico, a country where it’s far too easy to assume a new identity, make a fresh start, and live peacefully for years or even decades. Such was the case of the fugitive biker gang leader Randy Mark Yager, who was wanted in the U.S. on several charges including murder and explosives possession. And his girlfriend, Margie Jelovcic, a woman whose mother told me back in 2014 she’d “been thinking and praying for 17 years” she would one day see again. But that day never came. That fugitive Yager from Gary, Indiana was finally arrested by U.S. Marshals three years ago, less than 10 minutes up the road from where this latest Yeager was arrested last month. Yager’s longtime girlfriend was killed during the chaotic arrest, just in front of the Walmart in Rosarito where this Yeager has just picked up funds. Bizarrely, a few months later the biker gang leader’s brother’s corpse was discovered—hands cuffed and throat slashed—inside a burning home in Indiana, after family members alleged that he’d been receiving death threats from the imprisoned Randy Yager, who was well-liked among expats in Mexico and had, until his arrest, led a tranquil life south of the border for nearly two decades until his identity was finally revealed. To locals and friends, the couple seemed just like your typical retirees. They were just “Steve and Margie,” a couple of retired lovebirds who didn’t stand out in the slightest. But, that’s not saying much. Americans in Mexico, especially in Baja, tend to be oddballs. And nine out of 10 times—according to official figures—they are living in Mexico illegally without a problem. Such is the case of this latest Yeager, now. He’s just another undesirable foreigner in Mexico. *** On Friday afternoon, after several exchanges with CBP, I contacted Franks and Benitez for clarification. Customs and Border Patrol denies Yeager ever left Mexico. Consulate employees were unable to comment. And Mexican authorities had no idea. “I would assume that that never happened,” said Angelica Decima, a spokesperson for the San Diego CBP, referring to the transfer that allegedly took place weeks ago. “There’s just no way.” “There is no recent entry log for that person,” the CBP spokesperson explained. “When something like this happens, [Mexican authorities] deliver people in person directly to us, but we have no record of that. “We deal with deportations and transfers often. It’s not at all unique, but we always keep a record,” she said. “We would have run his fingerprints, in the very least, so it just isn’t possible.” On Friday afternoon, just as CBP was confirming that he had not reentered the U.S., Yeager’s sister said, “He told me he’s back in the States.” She then refused to comment further. But, it was she who first confirmed to Montel’s team that Yeager had entered the U.S. to begin with. And now it seems implausible that he ever did. So, the question of what became of Yeager, and whose version to believe is still just anyone’s guess. But people typically don’t just slip past border patrol without leaving an entry log—especially if they are undocumented, unwashed, newly released from jail, and exhibiting signs of drug withdrawal. “We were confident that he was in San Diego and in treatment, until we realized that he wasn’t,” Franks said. Yeager’s lawyer Benitez confirmed that his “work ended when the judge ordered his liberation on April 30.” He said he received “no confirmation” that Yeager had entered the U.S., nor that he had entered a rehab or VA facility. So, in light of the confusion, I asked Franks to reevaluate his and Montel’s intervention. Given the circumstances—not understanding local procedure, politics, customs, the language, nor having the resources to put people on the ground who can guarantee that unstable prisoners they help regain freedom in Mexico can’t slip past their grip—I asked if Montel’s team would interfere in the case of Marines locked up for crimes committed on Mexican soil again in the future. “We aren’t going to apologize to anybody for helping the family of a former Marine. It’s like asking, ‘How’s the view from the cheap seats?’ Most of the critics haven’t served,” Franks said. “The idea was sound. [U.S.] border patrol said they had it under control, we had a way to get him to the VA hospital [in San Diego]. It was a good plan.” But the plan kept changing. First, he said, the consulate informed him that Yeager would be flown back to Montana, then “all of a sudden” the plan was that he would be released that afternoon. He’d like to see this situation resolved, he said: “I don’t know how we’re going to do it, but we’re not going to have the same mistake happen twice.” Though lamenting the confusing outcome, he had no regrets about intervening in these criminal procedures in a country that is not his own, whose laws he is not trained to understand. “This is what happens when you fight a bunch of wars and you’re under-resourced [as a country] to take care of people,” Franks said. “It’s not an excuse for bad behaviour but it’s certainly an explanation. “The irony is that the only reason he was caught was because he burglarized fellow Americans in Mexico,” he said. “He was likely going to walk anyway, all we did was accelerate the process. “This was a messy case from day one,” Franks added. “Now, we’re really hoping that the Mexicans will arrest him—for Yeager’s safety and that of the public.” Benitez said he doesn’t regret taking on the case, if for no other reason than to continue to prove a point about the broken Mexican justice system, and demand that they strive to do better. “I didn’t have anything worse to do,” Benitez joked. *** Though the turn Yeager’s case has taken is both unfortunate and rather unbelievable, it’s clear Montel had nothing but the best intentions. For him this cause is both personal and noble. A fresh out of high school, teenage Montel Williams enlisted in 1974. He became the first black marine to be accepted and to complete the academy’s prep school, and then did the same at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. He rose to the post of lieutenant commander, and served for over two decades, before then becoming the first black man to have his own daytime talk show. Montel’s mother passed away last Sunday, and—although busy with funeral arrangements—he took a moment to explain his motivations to The Daily Beast. “I’ve never really taken my uniform off,” he said. “I wear it figuratively every day. “One of the greatest blessings of my success is that I have the ability to help current and retired service members,” he said. “With respect to Marines who find themselves detained abroad, often times service-related mental illness causes them to be in trouble in the first place. Other times they have become attractive hostages for hostile governments because of their past service,” he said, referring to Hekmati. Without “quibbling over whether I should help Marines in trouble,” he said, when asked about the pair he has advocated for in Mexico, “their service-related mental illness directly contributed to the situations they each found themselves in. That doesn’t excuse breaking the law, but it provides an explanation and a potential solution in terms of treatment.”   According to a 2014 government study, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder for Marines returning from Iraq and Afghanistan is among the highest of any other service group. More than one in 10 marines who come home from these wars are expected to suffer from PTSD. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, more than one in five veterans who return from either war suffering from PTSD will also suffer from substance abuse problems, likely “in response to bad memories of combat trauma.” “We ask a few of the best of us to go to very dangerous places in the world, and many of them come back broken,” Montel said. “There are thousands upon thousands of Andrew [Tahmooressi]s and Tyler [Yeager]s we don’t know about, and we need to be having a conversation as a country.” “The conversation needs to be about how we take care of those who risked their lives for ALL of us when they come home.” Franks said about the same: “If we break somebody, it’s our obligation as a country to try to fix them.” Yeager has not been sighted. But, in a few Baja beach communities, his face remains printed on Wanted posters near the homes that he’s been inviting himself into.

The bizarre incident with a fortunate ending stands out among many similar cases where parents often “forget” their children and lock them inside their cars, but never deliberately put them in the trunk. Besides being a criminal offense in some states, locking children in cars is potentially fatal, as they can suffocate or die of heat stroke if the vehicle is left in the sun. Metro Atlanta residents saw this tragedy play out when a father, Justin Ross Harris, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after deliberately locking his 22-month-old son, Cooper, in the family SUV while he worked all day. Cooper Harris died quickly in the 95-degree summer heat (which rose to well over 100 degrees in the locked vehicle). The small boy’s decomposing body was “discovered” by the father as he was driving home. The stench was so bad inside the car that it nearly caused the responding officer to regurgitate.

Gov.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman May chain store sales to be released June 1 Shutterstock photo What’s Happening Mega retailer Wal-Mart ( WMT ) has traded sharply higher over the last three months, and an upbeat May chain store sales report on June 1 could drive shares even higher. WMT has appreciated 13.6% on the year. Technical Analysis WMT was recently trading at $77.99, down $1.45 from its 12-month high and $12.71 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for WMT are bullish and the stock is in a strong upwards trend. The stock has recent support above $74.95 and has recent resistance below $79.50. Of the 22 analysts who cover the stock, nine rate it a „strong buy”, 11 rate it a „hold”, and two rate it a „strong sell”. The stock receives S&P Capital IQ’s 5 STARS „Strong Buy” ranking. Analyst’s Thoughts The recent earnings season was mixed for the retail sector, but the stocks that really got hit the hardest are those that have failed to keep pace in the digital age. Brick and mortar retailers that have failed to boost their online sales suffered, as Amazon.com ( AMZN ) continues to shake up the sector and punish traditional retailers. While there were plenty of disappointments, the overall retail picture remains upbeat. Chain store sales represent around 10% of overall retail sales, so they do paint a picture of the overall retail sector. A wide range of retailers will release their May sales numbers, and Wall Street will use these reports to gauge the health of the overall sector as we head into the summer months. Given Wal-Mart’s recent strength and its ability to boost online sales, the stock should continue moving higher as long as there are no significantly negative news in this month’s reports. Stock Only Trade If you’re looking to establish a long stock position in WMT, consider buying the stock under $78.00. Sell if it falls below $70.25 or take profits if it gets to $89.75. Bullish Trade If you want a bullish hedged trade on the stock, consider an August 70/72.50 bull-put credit spread for a 25-cent credit. That’s a potential 11.1% return (48.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 6.7% to cause a problem. Bearish Trade If you are looking for a bearish hedged option trade on WMT, consider an August 82.50/85 bear-call credit spread for a 20-cent credit. That’s a potential 8.7% return (37.8% annualized*) and the stock would have to climb 6.0% to cause a problem. Covered Call Trade To purchase the stock with a lower cost basis, consider a September $80.00 covered call. Buy WMT shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the September $80.00 call for a debit of $76.50 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 4.5%, and a target annualized return of 14.9% (for comparison purposes only).

I discovered that two purchases over the last year were deducted from my checking account without my knowledge. For the last purchase, either I or a cashier at Walmart in North Olmsted chose the debit card option for a sale of $14.23 on March 4, 2017. I never entered a PIN. I still have the receipt. I was unaware of this transaction until I went on the KeyBank website and saw the purchase listed as a checking account transaction. I absolutely do not want a debit card of any sort or any credit card linked to my checking account.  I want to unlink this card from my checking account, and I would like to know how to do so.   T.R., North Olmsted   A: We'll put this in the category of You Learn Something New Every Day.   And it's a rather disturbing realization. It appears you were able to use your ATM-only card without your PIN and without a signature for small transactions. I'm a bit stunned. To be clear, an ATM-only card doesn't have a MasterCard or Visa logo, and shouldn't be ale to used without a PIN. After much back and forth with KeyBank, the bank was unclear whether you were using an ATM card, or debit card, or credit card. A credit card would not be linked to your checking account. A debit card would, but you don't have one. Your ATM card would, but would require a PIN.   You insist it was an ATM card that you used without your PIN.   Key spokeswoman Drez Jennings said people who use KeyBank ATM cards -- not a debit card with the MasterCard logo -- can indeed use those cards for point-of-sale transactions totaling up to $500 per day. Normally, consumers would have to enter their PIN, however.   But Jennings added that it's up to merchants -- not the bank -- whether to require a PIN on small point-of-sale transactions, meaning those of $50 or less. This is important.   So in theory, someone could take your ATM-only card or, worse yet, my ATM-only card, and use it at a merchant for small purchases without the PIN and of course without a signature. Just swipe and go.   You said a KeyBank representative also told you your ATM-only card could be used at the point-of-sale for purchases up to $500, with a PIN.   But how about those under $50 transactions? That was a bit of a head-scratcher.   You conducted an experiment. You went to Walmart and made a small purchase using your ATM-only card, without the PIN. "A few days later, the purchase showed up as a debit transaction from my KeyBank online checking account history. I did not need to enter a PIN during the transaction," you said.   I have long known that ATM-only cards could be used at just about any point-of-sale location where there's a PIN pad, so the four-digit PIN can be entered. But it appears that in some cases, an ATM card can be used for small purchases without the PIN, if the merchant doesn't require it for small dollar amounts. This is bad. You said you've stopped carrying your ATM-only card around in your wallet because you're concerned that, if you lose it, anyone who finds it could tap your checking account for bunches of small purchases.   I'm interested in whether anyone else has experienced this, whether you're a customer of Key or another bank: Have you been able to use an ATM-only card (one without a Visa or MasterCard log) for a small purchase without a PIN? Please let me know by emailing me at tmurray@plaind.com or text me at 216-316-7064.   Q: I wanted to give you a heads-up on a new scam. This was passed along by someone else. Here's the story: Wednesday a week ago, I had a phone call from someone saying that he was from some outfit called: "Express Couriers,"(The name could be any courier company) He asked if I was going to be home because there was a package for me that required a signature. The caller said that the delivery would arrive at my home in roughly an hour. Sure enough, about an hour later, a uniformed delivery man turned up with a beautiful basket of flowers and a bottle of wine. I was very surprised since there was no special occasion or holiday, and I certainly didn't expect anything like it. Intrigued, I inquired as to who the sender was. The courier replied, "I don't know, I'm only delivering the package." Apparently, a card was being sent separately... (the card has never arrived!) There was also a consignment note with the gift.   He then went on to explain that because the gift contained alcohol, there was a $3.50 "delivery/ verification charge," providing proof that he had actually delivered the package to an adult (of legal drinking age), and not just left it on the doorstep where it could be stolen or taken by anyone, especially a minor.   This sounded logical and I offered to pay him cash. He then said that the delivery company required payment to be by credit or debit card only, so that everything is properly accounted for, and this would help in keeping a legal record of the transaction.   He added couriers don't carry cash to avoid loss or likely targets for robbery.   My husband, who by this time was standing beside me, pulled out his debit card, and the "delivery man" asked him to swipe the card on a small mobile card machine with a small screen and keypad. My husband was asked to enter his PIN number and a receipt was printed out. He was given a copy of the transaction.  The guy said everything was in order, and wished us good day. To our horrible surprise, between Thursday and the following Monday,  $4,000 had been charged/withdrawn from our account at various ATM machines.  Apparently the "mobile credit card machine," which the deliveryman carried had all the info necessary to create a "dummy" card with all our card details including the PIN number.   Upon finding out about the illegal transactions on our card, we immediately notified the bank, which issued us a new card. We also went to the police, where it was confirmed that it is definitely a scam because several households had been similarly hit. Tim Dimoff, SACS Consulting & Investigative Services, Akron A: I almost thought this was an urban legend or old wives' tale, just because I couldn't imagine someone providing this type of information to a stranger, to pay for a shipment that hadn't been ordered and the sender was unknown.   But lo and behold, a little research indicates this scam surfaced about 10 years ago, and apparently it's back. Ugh. So, don't accept surprise shipments or gifts, especially if you're expected to pay something for them. And don't give out financial information to strangers.

President Donald Trump is proposing a roughly 30 percent reduction in the federal budget for the program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. His overall budget proposal met a chilly reception from lawmakers, and is unlikely to be passed as is. But it suggests increasing work requirements for SNAP recipients, and says states should both share in the cost of the program and determine the level of benefits they provide. That would lead to fewer people in the program, or could reduce how much help they get. Last year, more than 44 million people received an average of about $125 a month in SNAP benefits, totaling about $66.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. How any cuts would play out across industries would depend on how people adjust to pay for food, how reliant a retailer is on SNAP spending and other factors. SNAP households are already on extremely tight budgets. To qualify, a family of four’s take-home pay can be no more than $2,025 a month, while a two-person household can earn no more than $1,335. More than 260,000 locations were authorized to accept SNAP credits last year. Superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target got 52 percent of redemptions, supermarkets like Kroger got 30 percent, and convenience stores got about 6 percent, according to the USDA . The rest was split among other kinds of stores. The USDA doesn’t specify how much is spent at specific retailers. But in 2013, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. told the Wall Street Journal that it gets about 18 percent of total SNAP benefits. That would have been about $13.43 billion in 2012. Since food is a fixed cost, retailers have said that people used money intended for other purposes to pay for groceries after a recent pullback in the program. “They’re paying cash or on a credit card if they didn’t have the food stamps. And then they will give up on something else,” Kroger’s CEO at the time, Dave Dillon, said in December 2013. That was after the SNAP benefits that were expanded during the recession returned to their previous levels. Last year, the SNAP program also underwent cuts when 22 states reinstated a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults who aren’t disabled or raising children and don’t meet certain work requirements. That limitation had been waived by some states during the recession. A report by the USDA in 2010 said boosting SNAP benefits during economic downturns starts a “multiplier process” in transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79 billion.

Instead, both iTunes and VUDU are individual rental movie services, where you only pay for what you want to watch and in what quality you want to watch it in. You also have the option to purchase the movie, but you’re not going to be forking over one-flat fee for all sorts of content, making these two services quite costly if you love to watch movies all the time. But for those who are habitual users and only want to pay for what they want to see, read on to see how they stack up against each other. Background Wal-Mart Stores bought video-streaming service Vudu.com a while back and it’s a service that allows you to stream directly to your compatible device via the Internet. The account is free and you only pay for whatever movies you watch since it’s an on-demand service. Many who are familiar with iOS and Apple’s Macs already know that iTunes is the place to get all your music downloads, store your MP3s and movies, and get apps and more. It’s the one-stop shop for your iOS devices basically. User Friendly Signing up with both VUDU and iTunes is free. Like all other services, you go through a signup process, where you pick out a username and password that allows you to access your account. Both allow you to browse around before even signing up so that you can easily check out the selection. Once you create an account, you can browse around on any of the compatible devices listed for both below. Winner: Tie Compatible Devices Since iTunes is iOS based, it’s limited in devices you can use to watch movies. So you have any iOS-based device (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches and, of course Mac computers (and PCs if you download iTunes for it). Oh, and there’s Apple TV, too, which requires you to either buy or rent the movies via iTunes. Once you’ve done this on the Apple TV interface, you can download the movie to your computer running iTunes, too. VUDU works on a lot more devices than iTunes. So in addition to your iOS-based devices mentioned above, it’s available on PC computers, gaming consoles like PS3 and Xbox 360 (only if you have a LIVE Gold membership), in addition to a lot of other Internet-connected Blu-ray players and HDTVS. That basically means almost any device with Internet access really. Just go on the site and under the “Devices” tab, you can easily check out all the models that it works on (way too many to list). Winner: VUDU is compatible with more devices Titles According to VUDU, they have more than 20,000 titles to choose from, with more and more being added all the time. A good thing about it is that a lot of the releases include newer titles that have just been released on DVD and Blu-ray (many even the same day of release). They have a lot of HD movie options, too. iTunes say they have more than 75,000 digital downloads, with about 3,000 of those available in HD (and that’s including both movies and TV shows). VUDU also has TV show options available, but iTunes has the most current episode to date while VUDU has older seasons. Winner: VUDU has a lot of titles, but iTunes takes the cake with their whopping 75,000 digital downloads. Membership Perks Since both services don’t require a monthly membership and are more of movie-a-la-carte services, both offer various advantages to their service. VUDU provides an instant $5 credit for new members and provides movies that are in HDX quality that will totally enhance your viewing experience as if you were in the theatre (but probably with a way smaller screen). The streaming movie service can stream in 1080p and has rich Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound if you have the right home entertainment theatre system to support such massive audio. And because it’s a streaming service, the content starts right away. Also, you can watch the first 10 minutes of some movies for free to see if you’re down with it or not so that you don’t have to waste your cash if doesn’t catch your attention within the first couple of minutes (newer titles usually go up to two minutes plus they have the trailers, too). VUDU also offers a cool Collections tab that has more sub-tabs, with one being “Showcases” that shows you sale, reduced price and other discounted content you can watch without having to pay full price. Then when you refer a friend, you get a $3.99 credit! So even though it’s a pay-per-watch service, you can really save some cash on certain titles. And you can buy the movies (in most cases) if you want to keep them. VUDU also just started offering its Disc to Digital program that works with Walmart where you convert your old discs (some titles are not included) into digital copies on your VUDU account, even allowing you to upgrade old discs into HDX copies for a small fee at various Walmart location. iTunes is more of a download service and doesn’t allow you to stream. Movies are purchased or rented, with many HD options available. If you like shows, you can easily buy the entire season, even the most current one with new episodes automatically added to your account after they air. You can watch rentals for a certain time period and when it expires, the downloaded content is gone. And with AirPlay you can play content on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on your HDTV via Apple TV. iTunes also offers lots of movie trailers so you can see what’s coming out in theaters soon. Sometimes it the main site for movies and shows on iTunes will provide discounted items. You can’t test out the movies like VUDU, but you can watch the movie’s trailer. You also have the option to pre-order movies that are coming out soon. Winner: VUDU offers WAY more advantages. Content Both are pretty even on this level. iTunes has a movie catalogue that features movies and stuff from the likes of many big studios, including 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. Walt Disney Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures and Universal Studios. They also work with lots of TV channels to offer the latest episodes on many of your favorite shows. Then again, VUDU also has all the big movie deals given they release content as soon as it hits DVD. Winner: Tie since both offer a wide array of content, which is why they have so many titles each Speed of Service VUDU streams movies, so you can watch instantly, while you have to download it from iTunes, which can take a while depending on your Internet service, your phone service for mobile devices, etc. BUT< you don’t have to wait for the download to completely finish before watching the movie.You can also watch some of the movie on your Mac, then halfway through, transfer to your iPod or iPhone and pick up watching where you last left off. VUDU’s minimum speed requirements for its services is: 480p: 1 Mbps for SD; 720p: 2.25 Mbs for HD; and 1080p: 4.5 Mbps for HDX.  Winner: VUDU streams faster with less delays Quality It’s pretty even here, too, since both offer HD quality movies and TV shows in 720p and 1080p. VUDU has some 3D titles (but you need 3D devices to watch them in 3D obviously). But VUDU does offer that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound providing a slight edge over iTunes. Winner: VUDU has 3D movies and that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 Limitations So iTunes used to offer TV show rentals, but they got rid of that option in August 2011 and VUDU offers that still. With iTunes Apple TV, movies rented on the device aren’t allowed to be transferred to other devices so that’s not good. For those who don’t have Apple TV, they have to buy other special cables so they can watch from their computer or another device on your TV. VUDU doesn’t offer an Android-based app, so that sucks. For VUDU, people who want to download the moves to their iPhones or iPads can stream movies but can’t keep them on their device. Winner: VUDU has less limitations Price Both offer content-on-demand services with options to rent or buy so you pay for what you want to watch and/or buy. For iTunes, newer releases will run you about $3.99 for SD and $4.99 for HD options. Usually older movies are cheaper like about $2.99. If you to actually buy the content, you’ll going to pay anywhere between $10.99-$14.99 for SD versions, with HD ones going up to $19.99 and up. TV shows are usually more to buy since they include a lot of episodes. VUDU prices vary a bit and can cheaper than iTunes, especially with discounted ones on that special VUDU page. Some titles cost $2 to rent for two nights, others are about $5, with HDX options the most expensive ones. For newer SD movies, you’ll pay $3.99 and HD titles go for $4.99, but you even have the choice to go with HDX for $5.99. Owning them is about the same as iTunes. Winner: Tie since both offer around the same prices for the majority of content Overall Winner Despite both being a buy-want-you-want movie service, VUDU offers a bit more for your buck, making it the winner in our comparison. Since you’re only going to pay for what you want, you might as well get the most out of the experience and VUDU has multiple options in terms of quality, offers 3D movies and that Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 is pretty nice. The fact that you can test out movies before you buy is also a good thing and all those discounts on the site always make watching movies you wouldn’t usually want to rent at its regular price totally worth the try!

I am returning from flying overseas . When you land in another country, Vudu kicks you out and you can not sign into your account. All your downloads “expire” until you return to the US. In Tahiti I downloaded and watched “John Wick II” from iTunes. Bottom line : Vudu won’t work on return flights once you have left and the US. iTunes will. Reply Fee on I have all Apple products and love them. I enjoy iTunes but I find myself going more toward VUDU when it comes to looking, buying, renting movies. I guess it is because it is very user friendly, there are good deals and freebies. I have both a BluRay player with VUDU on it as well as an AppleTV, MacBook, and Apple iPhone. So if you have both ways to utilize iTunes and VUDU you really can’t lose out on what they both offer. Neat to have “Blockbuster” in your home so to speak, ya know? => Reply Denz on VUDU all the way. Nice big boobs Kristie.. Reply Brady Gorman on I actually use both. With iTunes, the picture quality is slightly higher with an Apple TV and some even offer the same bonus features as their Blu-ray/DVD counterparts, but I can get better quality digital copies with Vudu (for a little extra). Also, one just may have a movie that the other doesn’t. Since they’re both free in terms of membership, I’d say you wouldn’t go wrong using both. Reply Michael tristan on Inherently flawed reasearch and especially flawed writing EXAMPLE: “Winner: VUDU has a lot of titles, but iTunes takes the cake with their whopping 75,000 digital downloads.” iTunes wins this but either poor writing or a clear bias makes Vudu appear to win this… This is so ridiculous, ill stop here.. A technologically advanced back end will never overcome a lack of content. Reply Graydon Patterson on one detail you left out, VUDO wont work in Canada, itunes will Reply David on I have used itunes to purchase movies and redeem digital copies for years and I prefer vudu by a long shot now. For starters if you buy a blu ray disk that includes a digital copy shouldn’t that digital copy also be in HD? Well most of the itunes digital copies are SD with no option to upgrade to HD. I alzo love the disk to digital service offered by uv/vudu. For renting movies I love it because most new titles are available the they are released on dvd and they are all available in HD. I wish i could transfer all of my itunes purchases to uv/vudu. Reply James on Kristie.. Great article! Are those real? Reply Long time movie watcher on Wow, I have both and while your article is extensive it is heavily biased. The title should be renamed to why you like VUDU. As an example of proof, you list VUDU as being compatible with more devices but don’t go into to many details then towards the end you mention it’s not compatible with Android. Seems kinda left out of your scoring. Also I didn’t notice any mention that VUDU really doesn’t work well on iOS devices. Checkout the reviews of their app for yourself. That being said I own more on iTunes I own more yet I’ve watched more rentals on VUDU. They are almost apples and oranges but I still prefer buying Blu-rays and renting from Blockbuster. Reply CJ on I have both and will be using VUDU for all of my future purchases since I am able to watch directly from my blu-ray player, TV and gaming console. When she says VUDU works on more devices she is talking about the VUDU app which is native on most blu-ray players, gaming consoles and TVs. Reply Jacko on Thanks Kristie. Trying to work thru the maze of offerings is tough. This was pretty darn good. You are soft on the eyes and thats only a plus. Appreciate your commentary and homework.

But when two men did exactly that on a Portland train, they were stabbed to death. So what is a bystander to do? Should you confront the attacker and try to de-escalate the situation? Or should you avoid getting involved? "This is a profound dilemma for the general public," said Andrew J. Scott, a retired police chief and president of AJS Consulting. There is no easy answer for every situation. But here are how a few recent cases have turned out, and what Scott recommends you consider if you do decide to intervene: Read More The triple stabbing in Portland Rick Best, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Micah Fletcher saw two women being berated on a Portland light rail train. They didn't sit still. These 3 men stood up to hate in Portland A man was confronting the two women -- including one who was wearing a hijab -- and started spouting "hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions," Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson said. But when the trio of men tried to calm the suspect, all three were stabbed. Best and Meche died; Fletcher was stabbed 1 millimeter away from his jugular. Scott said it's likely difficult, if not impossible, for those good Samaritans to have predicted the the assailant would try to kill them. "In this society, we're raised to not allow bullies to engage in racist behavior and to intervene verbally," Scott said. "Bullies tend to back down when verbally challenged." But with the Portland incident, "Clearly this is not the case," Scott said. "(The assailant) is a sociopath or a psychopath, and it's not the norm." The more peaceful endings There are many more cases that don't end in violence. What to make of these viral racist tirades? On May 22, a woman at an Arkansas Walmart told another customer to "go back to Mexico." When a black customer told the woman to stop being ignorant, the woman started calling her the N-word. Walmart later asked the woman to stop shopping at its stores. What to make of these viral racist tirades? Sometimes, the interventions lead to praise and reward. In March, Tracey Tong confronted a woman on a New York subway who was berating another passenger she believed was Muslim. "Why are you here? Why are you in this country?" the woman asked. "You're not with us." Tong fired back at the instigator. "Don't start attacking an innocent woman," she said. "... I'm not telling you to be quiet. I'm asking you to please respect her." The video was shared on Facebook more than 20,000 times, and Tong was invited on "The Ellen Degeneres" show, where she received a $10,000 reward. So what should you do? Scott, who worked in law enforcement for three decades, said ultimately the decision on whether to intervene is a highly personal one. How to stand up against hate But if you do want to act, Scott suggests considering the following: -- Is the perpetrator much larger than you? -- Does he or she appear to be intoxicated or mentally unstable? -- If things get ugly, is there an easy escape route? Or are you stuck in a confined area? If you still decide to intervene, "Understand it's a fluid situation that can go from bad to worse," Scott said. "That's another dilemma that the public faces to help their fellow man or person ... these are the types of things that are occurring in a split second, and people have to make split-second decisions." CNN's Darran Simon and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.

When traveling through highway work zones, use caution and be alert to changes in traffic patterns and slow-moving or stopped traffic.   To help motorists take the guesswork out of travel plans, call VDOT’s 511 or visit http://www.511Virginia.org/ for real-time traffic information.   Underlined entries with asterisks (***) indicate the listing is new or the status of the project has changed since last week’s traffic alert.     INTERSTATE PROJECTS ***Interstate 81 – Exit 14:  Work is underway to reconstruct Interstate 81 exit 14 to better accommodate traffic volumes and to replace the north and southbound interstate 81 bridges at exit 14. During the week of May 8, be alert to flagging and heavy equipment along Old Jonesboro Road and Dennison due to bridge and grading work.  (Completion: fall 2018) ***I-81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road: Replacement of the Interstate 81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road near exit 10 in Washington County is underway. The week of May 8, be aware of grading and drainage work in the median, and to haul truck traffic entering and exiting the median. I-81 travel lanes may be narrowed through the work zone. Due to safety concerns, Route 808 (Halls Bottom Road) is closed underneath the interstate bridges. Only emergency-response vehicles will have access; all other vehicle traffic will be required to detour. (Completion: Fall 2018) ***Interstate 77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel: Due to tunnel maintenance at I-77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel, anticipate southbound right lane closures from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. nightly Sunday through Thursday nights.   Interstate 81 Exit 17 bridge repairs: Motorists should anticipate periodic nighttime lane closures on I-81 at exit 17 northbound and southbound due to bridge repairs. Because much of the access for the repairs will be from underneath the bridge, flaggers will be used while working underneath the bridge to ensure pedestrian safety along the Creeper Trail.  (Completion: June 2017)   Interstate 81 bridge repairs at mile marker 45 over Matson Drive: Due to repairs to the Interstate 81 bridges over Matson Drive and their proximity to the southbound exit 45 on-ramp, the southbound on-ramp is closed.

By Nicole Rojas May 29, 2017 00:39 BST A Utah mother left her two children locked in the trunk of her car outside a Wal-MartReuters A woman from Utah, identified as 39-year-old Tori Lee Castillo, has been arrested for allegedly locking her two children in the back of a vehicle while she shopped at Wal-Mart. The children began making noises and moving, causing the vehicle to shake and alerting people. "Several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children," Riverdale police Lt Casey Warren told Deseret News. Witnesses helped the children, aged two and five, escape from the trunk before their mother returned, police said, after getting the older child to pull the emergency latch. One woman called Heidi who helped the children told Fox13 Salt Lake City that she and her friend were unloading groceries when she heard noises coming from the trunk. "I could hear some kids crying," she said. "I turned to my friend and I'm like 'There's people in this trunk. There's kids in this trunk!" She and three other women began helping the older girl who was screaming in the trunk. "She was [yelling], 'Mom, let me out! Let me out! Mom! Help!' She was screaming, crying," Heidi said. The women then guided the girl to open the trunk with the emergency latch. "Both kids just came out...they just jumped out at us," Heidi said. "It was kind of heartbreaking to see that somebody could do something so cruel," she said. Castillo was arrested by authorities when she returned to her car. According to CBS News, she faces four counts of child abuse with physical injury and one charge of theft.

Posted: Sunday, May 28, 2017 7:10 PM EDT Updated: Sunday, May 28, 2017 7:10 PM EDT By Holly Yan CNN (CNN) -- It's an instinct that comes naturally to good Samaritans: When you see one stranger attacking another with racist or religious epithets, you try to protect the victim. But when two men did exactly that on a Portland train, they were stabbed to death. So what is a bystander to do? Should you confront the attacker and try to de-escalate the situation? Or should you avoid getting involved? "This is a profound dilemma for the general public," said Andrew J. Scott, a retired police chief and president of AJS Consulting. There is no easy answer for every situation. But here are how a few recent cases have turned out, and what Scott recommends you consider if you do decide to intervene: The triple stabbing in Portland Rick Best, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Micah Fletcher saw two women being berated on a Portland light rail train. They didn't sit still. A man was confronting the two women -- including one who was wearing a hijab -- and started spouting "hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions," Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson said. But when the trio of men tried to calm the suspect, all three were stabbed. Best and Meche died; Fletcher was stabbed 1 millimeter away from his jugular. Scott said it's likely difficult, if not impossible, for those good Samaritans to have predicted the the assailant would try to kill them. "In this society, we're raised to not allow bullies to engage in racist behavior and to intervene verbally," Scott said. "Bullies tend to back down when verbally challenged." But with the Portland incident, "Clearly this is not the case," Scott said. "(The assailant) is a sociopath or a psychopath, and it's not the norm." The more peaceful endings There are many more cases that don't end in violence. On May 22, a woman at an Arkansas Walmart told another customer to "go back to Mexico." When a black customer told the woman to stop being ignorant, the woman started calling her the N-word. Walmart later asked the woman to stop shopping at its stores. Sometimes, the interventions lead to praise and reward. In March, Tracey Tong confronted a woman on a New York subway who was berating another passenger she believed was Muslim. "Why are you here? Why are you in this country?" the woman asked. "You're not with us." Tong fired back at the instigator. "Don't start attacking an innocent woman," she said. "... I'm not telling you to be quiet. I'm asking you to please respect her." The video was shared on Facebook more than 20,000 times, and Tong was invited on "The Ellen Degeneres" show, where she received a $10,000 reward. So what should you do? Scott, who worked in law enforcement for three decades, said ultimately the decision on whether to intervene is a highly personal one. But if you do want to act, Scott suggests considering the following: -- Is the perpetrator much larger than you? -- Does he or she appear to be intoxicated or mentally unstable? -- If things get ugly, is there an easy escape route? Or are you stuck in a confined area? If you still decide to intervene, "Understand it's a fluid situation that can go from bad to worse," Scott said. "That's another dilemma that the public faces to help their fellow man or person ... these are the types of things that are occurring in a split second, and people have to make split-second decisions."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: How Restaurants and Technology Are Coming Together Tech is changing the nature of service at restaurants across the country. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) May 28, 2017 at 6:25PM Technology has become a major competitive advantage for some of the companies winning in the restaurant industry. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, the team discusses where the employment of things like mobile ordering and automated kiosks makes the most sense. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) aim to serve more customers, while a chain like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) gives us a glimpse of the future. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 16, 2017. Vincent Shen: Moving on to our main topic, we have restaurants. Specifically within this space, the role of technology. For any Fools who have been following this sector, you've seen in headlines recently that restaurants have struggled with some low traffic, declining same-store sales from a period of overexpansion, but I was thinking about this in relation to these other industries that I've talked about today, with you and earlier in the studio with Adam, the fact that department stores, on the one hand, and cable companies, they face some existential threats. You have e-commerce on one hand, you have various streaming internet alternatives on the other for cable companies. I think the restaurant industry is interesting because fast-casual might take share from quick service, the broad industry might see weakness due to excessive expansion, like in this case. But in the end, people have to eat, they love eating out. And as a result, I think execution becomes a really clear differentiator between different chains, and there's not as much of an industry boogeyman that you can pin your problems to. But on the flip side, you have the success stories, and some of the big trends I get excited for the restaurant industry include loyalty programs, restaurants trying to source ingredients locally, and also, there's technology. That's where we will focus. I think previously, we spoke about how robots, for example, eliminate the need for human employees all together. But a lot of the technology initiatives that we'll talk about today seem to be previews of how that might work. Dan Kline: I think if you look at some of the technology we're talking about, what you're really focusing on is, restaurant sales overall are down a little bit, 1% or 2%. It's not anywhere near the retail drop. So you're looking here and saying, I'm Chipotle, or McDonald's, or whatever the chain is -- how do I maximize my business? What's worked, and it's worked for Starbucks and Panera, and we've talked about this before, is mobile ordering. I think mobile ordering at Chipotle makes a ton of sense and will be a game changer. When I say game changer, I mean a 2% to 3% net sales gain. It's not suddenly going to explode their business. But if you walk into a Chipotle -- and we've both done this -- and there's 10 people in line ahead of you, you might leave, because it's slow. So what a lot of Chipotles have done is set up a second production line in the store, and if you order from the app, your food will be ready when you get there. And they're having all the same execution problems Starbucks had. The people at the front don't know where the order is, have you paid, how do you handle it, do you pick it up. But all that will get sorted out, that's just growing pains and retail training, which is not an easy thing to do. So I think at your higher-end places like Chipotle that have lines, that's actually going to allow them to serve more customers during peak hours.  At a place like McDonald's, I think ultimately, there's a gain in taking workers out of the equation. But in the short-term, maybe there's some drive-thru benefit to being able to order and pick up, not going through the line. But in a McDonald's, I don't see as big a benefit when most things are not made to order, and it's sort of a production line, of even if you want a pretty special order, it's coming out quickly. So there's not really a major need to cut that. So McDonald's will gain eventually from technology, but in the short-term, I think you're going to see some of your higher-volume fast casual places like Chipotle, as you've seen with Panera, really benefit from this technology. Shen: Yeah. And we're definitely still, I think, in the early stages of the launch and the testing phases for a lot of the companies that are dipping toes into this. There are companies like Domino's, which are turning this into an art for themselves, and really juicing their quarterly results, seeing tons of growth with the technology and how they implemented it really well. With Chipotle, you mentioned the second make line, I think they call it, they're calling it "smarter pickup times". They've been able to quantify some of the benefits in that this better management of their digital orders, they give them more accurate estimates of when orders will be ready. In some of their testing, they mentioned that digital order wait times decreased as much as 50%. Restaurant staff have better tools to essentially manage this channel, like you mentioned, during peak business times. If they have a bottleneck, in terms of those peak hours and how many people they can serve, this can alleviate some of that, then that does flow through to their top and bottom line. Kline: And there's a major customer service benefit. If you call Domino's -- back in the old days when you called Domino's. I'm sure your generation now is Snapchatting Domino's and then paying via Venmo. Shen: Exactly. Kline: But back when you used to call Domino's, if they told you your pizza was going to be an hour, you went, "OK, my pizza will be an hour." If in an hour, your pizza showed up, you were satisfied. So I was talking with you earlier. I use the Pei Wei app. The Pei Wei app is pretty innovative in that you can completely customize any order. If you want sweet and sour chicken with no sweet and sour sauce, hold the chicken, you can do that. And you can put in what time you want to pick it up. I was picking up, it was maybe 5:20, so I put in 5:40, that was the distance from my house. And the app came back and said, "Your time has been adjusted to 5:50." And I went, OK, no problem, I'll leave 10 minutes later versus if I had been at the store, waited in line, placed my order, I would have been there for 30 minutes. So it was an absolute benefit of my time, better customer service, and it will make me much more likely to go back. And I think that's where you're starting to see some of the value in these. Pei Wei is a higher end fast casual concept that can take quite a while in a line. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Terry Branstad (from left) and his wife, Chris Branstad, recite the Pledge of Allegiance during the swearing in ceremony for Kim Reynolds to become the 43rd Governor of Iowa at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines on Wednesday, May. 24, 2017. (Stephen Mally/The Gazette) Erin Jordan The Gazette More stories from Erin May 28, 2017 at 6:00 am | Print View Former Gov. Terry Branstad reported at least $1 million in assets — and possibly as much as $3.3 million — as part of a federal financial disclosure report required for his application to be U.S. ambassador to China. Branstad stepped down as Iowa’s longest-serving governor Wednesday before taking the oath as U.S. ambassador. Included among more than 50 companies in which Branstad owns stock are 14 he says he will divest to avoid a potential conflict of interest in China. “I am committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct for government officials,” Branstad wrote in a March 23 letter to the U.S. State Department. The two-page letter with the subject line “Ethics Undertakings” was one of two documents The Gazette obtained last week through the federal Freedom of Information Act (find both at the bottom of this article). The other was Branstad’s Public Financial Disclosure Report, filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which outlines the former governor’s assets, including investments, savings accounts, real estate holdings and liabilities. The disclosure is required of people seeking senior level positions in the U.S. government. “You can’t be in a position to benefit from your ambassadorship,” said Ron McMullen, a career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Eritrea from 2007 to 2010. McMullen is now the University of Iowa’s ambassador in residence, teaching courses on comparative politics, diplomacy and international politics. “The rule of thumb is an ambassador can’t actively be managing investments that happen to deal with the country to which he or she is ambassador to,” he said. “So if an asset is doing business with China or investing in China, and you’re ambassador to China, you can’t actively manage that, so it has to be put in a trust or you have to divest in it.” Avoiding conflict of interest Branstad’s promise to sell stock in 14 companies, including Apple, PayPal, Deere and Co. and Wal-Mart, within 90 days of confirmation came because those companies “have been deemed to present a significant risk of a conflict of interest,” according to a State Department response to The Gazette. “The assets that Ambassador Branstad is retaining have either been deemed not to present a significant risk of a conflict of interest at this time, or are currently subject to a de minimus exemption under the ethics regulations,” the agency reported, referring to exemptions for small investments. Deere and Co., based in Moline, Ill., has extensive manufacturing operations in China as well as other countries. Ken Golden, global public relations director for the company, said in March he was pleased to see Branstad considered as ambassador because Branstad knows agriculture and has been an advocate for international trade. Branstad says in the March 23 letter he will have a “covered relationship” with the state of Iowa for one year, which means he’ll need to seek specific permission to participate in any matters involving Iowa and China. The State Department said this is “standard language” for someone who has previously served as a state governor. “Ambassador Branstad will receive ongoing guidance about the matters that federal ethics law permit him to participate in,” the agency said. Financial disclosure Branstad’s financial disclosure report, at eight pages, is significantly less complicated than the 104-page report filed by Donald Trump last year when he was running for president. The reports provide some idea of a senior government official’s assets — but because each asset is listed with a value range, the grand total also has a wide range. For example, the value of Branstad’s stock in Casey’s General Stores, headquartered in Ankeny, is listed as $15,001 to $50,000. His total assets are valued at as little as $1.08 million and as much as $3.33 million, according to the report. Branstad lists 55 companies in which he owns stock, with the total value of those investments between $114,000 and $885,000. The companies include automotive (Axalta Coating Systems and Advance Auto Parts), medical (Diplomat Pharmacy, GlaxoSmithKline and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions), energy (Whiting Petroleum, TransCanada and Kinder Morgan) and financial (Wells Fargo and Co., West Bancorporation and Comerica Inc.). Chris Branstad, Branstad’s wife, has investments in Berkshire Hathaway ($1,001 to $15,000) and Diplomat Pharmacy ($1,001 to $15,000), the report states. Real estate While Trump’s real estate holdings include Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan and Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Palm Beach, Fla., Branstad’s commercial real estate is in places such as Lake Mills, a northern Iowa town of 2,000 where Branstad operated a law office and served as state representative before becoming lieutenant governor in 1979, and Joice, near Lake Mills. Branstad also owns parcels in Bode, Dunlap, Exira, Guttenberg, Lake Park, LeClaire, Lohrville, Manly, North English, Olin, Packwood, Seymour and Sibley, all sites of those towns’ post offices. The total worth of this land or property is $960,015 to $2.35 million, the report states. Also listed among Branstad’s assets is an annual salary of $150,000. Branstad’s official salary as governor was $130,000 in fiscal 2016, but it’s possible he was including travel and subsistence — an additional $14,282 last year. He doesn’t give the value of his state of Iowa defined benefit plan, but said it yields about $2,900 per month in retirement payments. For liabilities, Branstad listed two mortgages, one for a personal residence valued at $100,001 to $250,000 and one for a rental property valued at $50,001 to $100,000. ‘Very lengthy process’ The Gazette requested from the State Department and the Office of Government Ethics all of Branstad’s application materials. The OGE responded March 23 saying it was withholding 53 pages of notes and emails between the office and the State Department as “predecisional deliberative process material,” which is exempt from FOIA. “The disclosure ... would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the OGE said in the letter. McMullen, a Northwood, Iowa, native who has lived in, worked in or traveled to 105 countries, remembers filling out his financial disclosure report to be considered as a foreign ambassador. “It’s a very lengthy process,” he said. “It’s like filing a tax return and having it audited twice.” l Comments: (319) 339-3157; erin.jordan@thegazette.com State Department letter:    Branstad State Department ethics letter by Source Media Group News on Scribd By the numbers Branstad's listed assets Amount Assets/Investments $114,000 - $885,000 Bank accounts $6,006 - $90,000 Real estate $960,000 - $2,350,000 Liabilities $150,000 - $350,000 Public Financial Disclosure Report (Office of Government Ethics Form 278e) Financial Disclosure Report:    Branstad Terry Final278 by Source Media Group News on Scribd Your next Government articles Branstad reports financial assets as par ...

According to a report from WalletHub, more than 41 percent of Americans are likely to take advantage of Memorial Day deals — and brands and retailers are rewarding shoppers both online and in stores with massive savings. As International Business Times reported in past years, shoppers can expect to save big in-store at department stores like Kohl's, Nordstrom, Macy’s, J. C. Penney and big box retailers like Walmart and Target. According to a ChargeItSpot study published Wednesday, 76 percent of shoppers at malls across the country who planned to shop on the holiday said they’d opt for brick-and-mortar locations over online shopping.  Read: Memorial Day NYC Events 2017: 6 Fun Things To Do In New York City But online retailers are offering up some excellent deals as well, so shoppers who’re looking to avoid the masses are just as likely to save more than a few bucks. Apparel brands like Ralph Lauren and Eddie Bauer are offering 30 and 40 percent savings, respectively, while tech retailers like Dell and Best Buy will reward customers looking to invest in new gadgets. As Forbes noted Friday, Aritzia, Steven Alan, Uniqlo and Net-A-Porter are all offering weekend discounts as well. Below IBT has rounded up savings from DealsPlus, Coupons.com and a select few others from across the web. But savvy shoppers who know exactly what they’re in the market for should also check their favorite brands and retailers for last-minute for otherwise unadvertised savings online. Below, see some of the best savings for both in-store and online shopping: Amazon : Up to 70 percent off across categories American Eagle : 30 percent off sitewide; extra 60 percent off clearance Art.com : Up to 50 percent off sitewide Bloomingdale’s : Up to 60 percent off; extra 20 percent off most sale items Calvin Klein : 40 percent off sitewide Bed Bath and Beyond : Savings on mattresses and more; 50 percent off fashion bedding; free shipping on orders over $29 Best Buy : Up to 40 percent off appliances; free delivery on major appliances over $399 Dell : $300 off PCs; up to 50 percent off electronics and accessories eBay : 20 percent off $50 or more with code P20MEMDAY through 5/29 Eddie Bauer : 40 percent off everything with code HONOR through 5/30 GAP : 40 percent off purchases and free 2-3 day shipping with code WKND H&M: Deals from $5; up to 60 percent off and free shipping Kate Spade : Extra 25 percent off sale styles with code REFRESH Macy's : In-store sales and 20 percent off online with code SUNNY; or $10 off $25 with code SUNNY25 through 5/29 Michael Kors : Extra 25 percent off Memorial Day Sale on handbags, wallets and more through 5/29 Nordstrom : Up to 40 percent off “on-trend” clothing, shoes, accessories and more during its “Half-Yearly Sale” Ralph Lauren: Extra 30 percent off Memorial Day Sale with code MEMDAY through 5/30 Tory Burch : Up to 50 percent off handbags, wallets, shoes and more Urban Outfitters : Up to 50 percent off during “Long Weekend” sale Memorial Day sales will be big on Monday, May 29, 2017.

Both have posted gains for seven consecutive sessions, matching seven-day win streaks for each that ran through Feb. 15. The Nasdaq last had an eight-day win streak in February 2015, while the S&P's most recent eight-day win streak happened in July 2013. Kourtney Gibson, president of Loop Capital Markets, told CNBC's "On The Money" this week that "I think the market is somewhat desensitized a little bit from some of these things. I think the good news is that we are actually focused on economic data and actually focused on the earnings that we are seeing coming out of the market right now" Recent earnings winners included Wal-Mart and Home Depot, signs of life in the dismal retail sector. Last week, HP, Medtronic and Best Buy all posted better-than-expected earnings. On the data front, a fresh reading on gross domestic product showed a better number than the first estimate. Manufacturing PMI for May also saw better-than-expected numbers with new orders at their best level of the year and employment improving. Looking ahead to next month's two-day Federal Reserve meeting, where a rate rise is expected, Gibson says a hike could ultimately be good news for savers. "For the average American raised interest rates obviously mean higher mortgage rates potentially on the long end of course, auto loan rates will go up. Hopefully we will begin to see some of those savings rates increase for the consumer," Gibson said. "I'd love to see some of the larger bulge-bracket investment banks and commercial banks begin to raise the savings rates for the average consumer as well." Gibson warns this week's big market headlines shouldn't throw a monkey wrench into your investment strategy. Just stay the course. "Hopefully you are investing for the long term and your financial advisor or whoever is helping you with determining your asset allocation is positioning you for the time horizon which you currently have, in which you'll actually need the money," she said. "So, changing something based just on this week is probably not advisable for most." Meanwhile, all three major indexes posted gains for the week, breaking two-week losing streaks for the Dow and S&P 500.

On Friday, the Save-A-Lot supermarket at 210 S. Western Ave. is to close for good. The store was underperforming financially, according to a statement a Save-A-Lot spokeswoman issued last week. Considering how briefly Save-A-Lot has been open, the store must have been underperforming pretty severely. The grocery in a space once occupied by an Aldi supermarket has been in business slightly more than 11 months. Aldi's departure in January 2014 left South Peoria bereft of a consistent place to purchase fresh vegetables and meats, among other things. Local officials, led by 1st District City Councilwoman Denise Moore, decried the "food desert" the area had become. They sought an Aldi replacement. Securing a commitment from Save-A-Lot appeared to be quite the coup at the time. But it's possible the most important people in the equation — potential customers — might not have been all that impressed. South Peoria residents must be going somewhere to purchase groceries. The most logical assumption is many shoppers have migrated to the closest full-service supermarket, the Kroger outlet at Madison Park Shopping Center in adjacent Limestone Township. But some shoppers must be venturing above the bluff in Peoria, or across the bridges into East Peoria. Moore said one constituent told her Save-A-Lot groceries were more expensive than those found at Walmart. Other South Peoria retailers that as a sideline offer a limited number of groceries also might have cut into Save-A-Lot's business, Moore suggested. Just up and across Western Avenue from Save-A-Lot is a Dollar General store. That wasn't there when Aldi was open. There also are two Family Dollar outlets located along that stretch of Western. Considering there was almost a 2½-year gap between the Aldi closing and the Save-A-Lot opening, area shoppers might have found other supermarkets to patronize. And nothing about Save-A-Lot might have been compelling enough for them to switch. Moore said she and others will attempt to lure another grocer to South Peoria, but it won't be easy. For Save-A-Lot to locate there took a fair amount of cajoling, it appears. "We tried every grocer out there," Moore said. "We'll go back to those grocers that we talked to, and maybe one of them will see a way they can come in and get profitable. "It's going to take a community effort to keep whoever comes in here in here." The beauty of the American system in this respect is the market, not the government, decides which businesses survive and which don't. In this case, maybe the community already has decided — with its feet, and with its wallets. (N.V.) Looking back at Bruce One thing readers should know about reporters: Most of us are pack rats. We'll keep notes in digital or printed form for years from interviews that we think might be interesting or important. Sometimes that merely means piles of things on our desks that grow to the point of teetering. Other times it pays off, like when your shorter columnist found his notes from his first telephone interview with a venture capitalist and philanthropist named Bruce Rauner who, in the spring of 2013, was mulling a run for governor. He'd take the plunge and announce about a month and a half after our April interview. Some of the rhetoric is the same as his current stump speech — "I never want to have to leave the state. I want my children to have good lives here, I want my grandchildren to have it good" and "I'm a hard worker, a workaholic by nature." He listed three priorities: • Changing the business climate — "We are a bad place to do business from a regulatory point of view." • Transforming state government and its operations — "Our government is wasteful, inefficient, self-dealing." • Improving education — "We used to be among the best states in the country for our education and we’re deteriorating." He also called for Illinois to "invest aggressively" in state universities — something that no doubt has people in Normal, Macomb, Charleston, DeKalb, Urbana, Springfield, Carbondale, Edwardsville and Chicago laughing ruefully. Rauner likewise wanted more money set aside for veterans' job retraining, early childhood education and K-12 education. On the latter, more has been budgeted, if one ignores the dollars that were promised but are caught up in the bill backlog and uncertain to ever be delivered. The first part of this statement from Rauner is unquestionably true: "I won’t worry about which special interest groups I alienate. ... I’m just on a mission to deliver results for our business climate and our taxpayers." Some things, it's up to the voters to decide if he's been successful: "I will never back down, and I will propose creative, doable solutions." "The governorship is very powerful. You can do a lot with executive orders." (C.K.)  Chris Kaergard (C.K.) covers politics and government. He can be reached at ckaergard@pjstar.com or 686-3255. Follow him on Twitter @ChrisKaergard.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 E3 Memorial Day Deals     Nintendo Switch Stock Tracking Report For May 28 Posted: May 28 2017, 1:44pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking report for online and in store availability for Memorial Day weekend. On Sunday, May 28, the only option to buy a Nintendo Switch online is at gamestop.com. The video game retailer offers two new Nintendo Switch bundles priced for under $400.  Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 Walmart for the first time in the past two months has not sold the Nintendo Switch online in a bundle on Friday at 5pm ET. The retailer finally reacts to the over selling problem. Our Nintendo Switch order from last Friday got put on backorder days after the order was placed. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android. Further below this report features the latest on the in-store availability of the Nintendo Switch.  The weak rumor that Best Buy will have the $299.99 Nintendo Switch in stock today could not be confirmed yet. There is no other hint at a retailer restocking the Nintendo Switch on Memorial Day Weekend. Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores GameStop offers two new Nintendo Switch bundles priced for under $400. Both bundles feature the Switch with Neon Joy-Con. One bundle is around Zeld and the other comes with Mario Kart game and gear.  GameStop also runs a big video game accessories sale, including discounts of 20% on select Switch accessories. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch the last time 10 days ago. Only Prime members got access to the Nintendo Switch stock. When the next Switch sale on Amazon takes place is not known. Use our new Tracker app to get notified when the Switch is in stock at Amazon. To get an notification when the Nintendo Switch is avaialble online again try our new Tracker app. At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $88 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $95 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores Best Buy stores had the Nintendo Switch in stock this morning. We prepared our readers for this Switch event before it was official. The Nintendo Switch is also available in 820 Walmart stores, 100 Target stores, 29 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (2:45pm ET).  About 200 more Walmart stores are flagged to have the Nintendo Switch in stock today. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon.  This week two new Switch games are released. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%.

Carmen Ponder, Miss Black Texas of 2016, alleges she was unlawfully arrested after an encounter with an off-duty police officer and Chief Kerry Crews, the Dallas Morning News reports. While driving to a local Walmart in Commerce Texas, Ponder was cut off by a sporadic driver. "I thought it was a drunk driver so I [drove] around them," she said in a statement posted on Twitter. According to Ponder, after passing the vehicle, and pulling into the store’s parking lot, the car followed her. Upon exiting her vehicle, the 23-year-old Ponder was allegedly approached by the passenger. The man was apparently teaching his 14-year-old daughter how to drive and was incensed that Ponder would do such a thing. Advertisement “He continued yelling and cussing me out, and I finally turned around and said, 'It's illegal,' when he kept saying that it was a 14-year-old driving," she shared on Twitter. "That's when he screamed, 'Oh, whatever, you black bitch!'" @MeritLaw pic.twitter.com/LeHyS9JwHM— Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 Ponder brushed the encounter off and headed inside Walmart to shop. According to a statement from Ponder’s attorney, Lee Merritt, that was posted on The Root, that’s when the encounter took a turn. “A plain clothes unidentified officer wielding a badge informed her highness that the man she had pissed off was the chief of police and she had better apologize! She declined and continued graciously toward her vehicle,” Merritt explained. “The cop grabbed her and shouted you’re not going anywhere, you’re being detained. Carmen complied and used her cell phone to call the police. When they arrived (of course) they spoke with the other officers and was told Carmen was evading arrest (no idea for what) and she was handcuffed and taken into custody. Miss Black Texas spent the night in jail. Her only crime ... the color of her skin.” Advertisement The encounter caused some confusion. Ponder initially identified the man in the vehicle who confronted her was Crews, but that is in dispute. The City of Commerce issued a statement that the passenger in the car was not Crews, but that he became involved in the incident after being approached by a customer. Crews was not on duty at the time, according to the statement. "Since the incident there have been a number of statements made about the details of the incident, and many of these details do not align with the statements provided by Chief Crews and the responding officer. As such, the City is engaging an outside entity to conduct an investigation into the incident to objectively review and determine the facts," the City of Commerce statement reads. Crews has been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of the investigation. The city calls this action "in keeping with common practice." They also note it's not an admission of wrongdoing on Crews' part, nor a disciplinary action. Ponder has set up a crowdfunding page to assist with legal costs. "I will be using these funds for help with attorney's fees and city charges. I am not being charged for Civil Rights representation, but the city is pursuing criminal charges which will require a separate fee," she said in a statement on the page. "The money will be used to fight my unlawful charge of Evading Arrest/Detention. I refuse to take a plea deal and more than willing to go to trial, but that takes time and money." Plea bargains often work against many black and brown defendants, according to a study cited on NPR.

They may look pretty, but they ruin your garden. (Pexels) It had been five years since I graduated from high school, and I was living what I call the good life. I was working as an administrator for a fairly large church in the Central Texas area and was also a full-time musician for my local church. I thought I was doing everything God wanted me to do. However, one morning as I was preparing to head to the office, a voice invaded the restroom of my home, and all I heard was, "Huston-Tillotson University."  I was alarmed by the sound of the voice because I was home alone. After peeping around the corner and searching a few rooms, I realized that it was the voice of the Lord that spoke to me. Boy, was I in denial about what I heard. I didn't have any intentions on pursuing a college degree. God was obviously speaking to the wrong person. About three days later, after leaving the church office, I made a quick stop to Wal-Mart to pick up a few things before heading home. I had brushed off my encounter with the Lord. Although it was interesting to have heard His audible voice for the first time, I was not going to college. After selecting a few items in the store, I headed towards the checkout lines. I was 10 feet away from the cashier when a gentleman stopped me and asked me if he could tell me what the Lord was speaking to him concerning me. Of course, I raised an eyebrow and maybe rolled my eyes, but I let him speak. "Yes, the Lord says go to school. I see where you are gifted in music, but the Lord says to pursue business, and you will do extremely well." I was tempted to throw the ketchup that was in my hand at him and run straightway to my car. I was dumbfounded by the word but impressed at God's way of getting my attention in regard to His purposes for my life. Several days later, I submitted my application to the university online and was immediately accepted. I was nervous but extremely excited about this next chapter. The university was only an hour away from my hometown, so I would make frequent trips home. One weekend, I was at a church service with a family member who was the head pastor of a small ministry. Before the service ended, she called on certain people in the congregation to come forward for prayer and prophecy. She eventually motioned for me, and oh, was I thrilled to be one of the chosen ones. I was confident that God was going to give me an amazing word concerning my future. Midway through the prayer, she began to give directives as they related to my education. At the time, I was in my junior year of college and on track for graduation. This family member began to release some very disturbing words about how the Lord wanted me to leave the school was attending and move back to my hometown to attend a community college. I politely whispered in her ear, "I'm sorry, that is not the word of the Lord."  After all, God had given me clear instructions years before. Surely He wouldn't just have me waste three years of my life only to move back home. When I finished my remark, she politely whispered back, "I think that was a witch talking to me."  She eventually blamed the error of her so-called prophecy on one of the members in the congregation. I was very disturbed and left the premises of the church immediately after the benediction. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=969939466" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=969939466" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement I've heard it said many times that three of the most manipulating words used in the church are: " The Lord said." Prophecy is a one of the most powerful gifts given by God to man for edification, exhortation and comfort (1 Cor. 14:3). However, prophecy can become extremely dangerous when it is man- initiated and not heaven-activated. Although this vocal gift is expressed through the mouth of a man or woman, all utterances should come from one source, the Holy Ghost (2 Pet. 1:21). There is a story in 1 Kings 13 about a young prophet whom the Lord instructed to go to Bethel and cry out against Israel's sin. Upon completion of this assignment, the prophet was told to immediately return to Judah, but from a different way than he came (1 Kin. 13:17). An older prophet in Bethel sought out the young prophet and proclaimed that an angel of the Lord had given him a different command and that the younger prophet was to go to the older prophet's home and dine with him. But the older prophet was lying (1 K.13:18). The young prophet hearkened to the word of the older prophet and didn't make it back to Judah alive because of his disobedience (1 Kin. 13:24). Friends, when God instructs you to do something, be wise and follow through. Don't allow false prophetic voices to cause you to forfeit your destiny. It is better to obey God than man (Acts 5:29). Because I decided to ignore the false word and stick with what I knew was God, I ended up graduating with honors (magna cum laude) and ranking No. 2 in the business administration degree program.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Tips for buying a used smartphone Tips for buying a used smartphone By Simon Hill — Updated May 26, 2017 11:43 am Subscribe Share Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The best smartphones pack tempting features into stylish bodies, but they don’t come cheap. You can easily spend upwards of $600 on a new smartphone — the Samsung Galaxy S8 starts at $750, for instance — but you don’t have to clean out your bank account to nab a snazzy smartphone. Buying a used device is a tried-and-true method of saving cash on a purchase. In this guide, we’re going to lay out your options and run through some tips for buying a used smartphone, helping ensure you don’t get ripped off. Not all second-hand smartphones are created equal, so let’s break this down by category. Buying refurbished smartphones The best kind of used smartphone to go for is a refurbished phone. These are phones that were returned to the manufacturer for one reason or another. They are fully tested, factory reset, and certified. They also usually come with some kind of warranty. When you buy a refurbished phone, it should be close to the experience of buying a new phone. If you buy a refurbished iPhone from Apple, for example, it will have a new battery, a pristine outer shell, and a box with all the necessary accessories. It will also come with a one-year warranty, but that won’t be the case if you buy elsewhere. Standards vary, so always check the details carefully. Whenever possible, buy directly from manufacturers, as they have the greatest incentive to ensure the refurbished phones they sell are problem-free. Before you get too excited about refurbished smartphones, however, it’s worth noting that they’re the most expensive kind of used smartphone around. You can often reap significant savings with little risk, but real bargain hunters will be unimpressed. If you want to shop for refurbished phones, then check out these stores: Amazon Apple Best Buy Samsung Walmart Buying certified pre-owned smartphones One step down from refurbished phones, you’ll find the certified pre-owned category. Once again, these phones have undergone some kind of testing, been factory reset, and should come with a limited warranty. They’ll be a bit cheaper than refurbished phones, too, though they probably won’t be in as good condition. Certified pre-owned phones have been tested to make sure that they work properly, but they’re not like-new — these are used smartphones and may have cosmetic damage or internal wear and tear. They also won’t necessarily be re-boxed or presented as new phones, and could be missing some accessories. Always check the details before you buy, because there may be differences when it comes to the definition of certified pre-owned from retailer to retailer. There will also be differences in the warranty they offer.. If you want to shop for certified pre-owned phones, then check out these stores: Amazon AT&T Best Buy Target Verizon Buying used smartphones The biggest bargains are to be found in the used smartphone category, but there are also greater risks in buying a used smartphone. You might be able to secure last year’s flagship with extra accessories at a knock-down price, but you could also end up with a dud and no way to get a refund. You need to check the seller’s description carefully, only consider listings with photos, and ask questions before you buy. Try to deal with sellers who have positive ratings, if possible. Some services offer listing verification and payment protection in the event something goes wrong, while others don’t. You should look for a return policy and use a service like PayPal, so you have some possibility of getting a refund if your new phone turns out to be damaged or stolen. If you’re going to meet in-person to buy a phone, always take someone with you and choose a well-lit public place to meet. Make it clear to the seller that you want to test the phone before you buy, and that you’ll be bringing a SIM card to do just that. This will discourage scammers. Some of the best places to buy used smartphones are: eBay Craigslist Glyde Swappa The price is right You should do some research to get an idea of how much you need to spend. Swappa is particularly helpful for this, because it shows a chart of the average selling prices for each smartphone over time. You can also search the “sold listings” on eBay, if you want to see what the going rate for your desired phone is. Remember that prices for older smartphone models — like the iPhone 5, or Samsung Galaxy S6 — will always fall when a new one is released, as people tend to sell their older devices in order to raise cash for a new one. When you settle on a target price, be patient. If you’re trying to get a better-than-average bargain, then you need avoid being drawn into a bidding war. There’s a ton of variance on sites like eBay, so it can be smart to wait to bid on items until the last moment. Choose listings that end mid-week, because they won’t attract as many buyers as listings that end on Saturday or Sunday. Important things to consider There are several things you need to keep in mind when buying a used smartphone, so here’s a checklist to run through. If any of these things aren’t clear in the listing, then you need to ask the seller before you buy. Is the phone on your network or unlocked? Smartphones that are locked to a carrier tend to be a bit cheaper, so if you’re happy on Verizon, for example, go for a device that’s locked to Verizon. Unlocked smartphones, on the other hand, can be used on any network. Does the phone come with any accessories? Find out if it comes in the original box, with the charger and cable that it shipped with. You need to know if there any extras being thrown in, such as cases or headphones. The original box is a good sign that the phone is not stolen and a case suggests the previous owner has been taking care of the device. Has it been factory reset? You want a phone that has been wiped clean. Make sure the previous owner has removed all personal accounts and watch out for Factory Reset Protection (FRP). It’s a safety feature that Google recently added to Android to discourage would-be thieves. If FRP is not disabled before the phone is sold, then, even after a factory reset, you’ll be prompted to enter the username and password for the last Google account that was registered with the device before you can use it. Is there any physical damage? Ideally, you’ll be able to review a good mix of photos before you buy, but it’s worth checking whether there’s any damage that isn’t obvious from the supplied photos. You may also want to ask about water damage before you make your purchase. Test your phone When your new phone arrives, make sure you test it immediately and thoroughly. Put your SIM in and make sure it works, insert your MicroSD card (if it accommodates one), try charging the phone, and test the headphone port. You should also watch out for battery problems, especially with older phones. After all, batteries deteriorate over time and may eventually struggle to hold a charge. You may also want to try a diagnostic app or use service codes. You can find them for most phones with a quick online search, and they’ll allow you to test the battery, screen, and a few other bits and pieces. If you’re going to find a problem, it’s better to isolate it sooner rather than later. If you have a warranty, then you can quickly make a claim. If not, you can try to return your phone or claim a refund via PayPal. If you’re meeting in person and paying cash, then go to the meeting equipped with a SIM card, cable, laptop, and headphones and perform the tests before making your purchase.

US media report that Tori Castillo, 39, is facing child abuse charges and the children are now with their father. Onlookers in the car park instructed the five-year-old on how to open the boot from the inside, reports say. Passersby had noticed the car shaking and noise coming from inside where it was parked outside a Walmart. The incident happened on Thursday in Riverdale, Utah. It is not clear how long the children were in the boot. Local police officer Casey Warren told KTVX : "It's never right to lock a child inside of a vehicle, let alone a trunk of a vehicle. "Obviously there's a lot of things that could go wrong." He praised the "good Samaritans" who helped the children get out. Under Utah state law, leaving a child under the age of nine unattended in a vehicle is punishable by a fine or jail time. The law was enacted in 2011 after repeated cases of children dying unattended in hot cars.  Add comment   Prev Next   Do you have a story for publication?

Pacific Cycle to showcase 2018 Mongoose models and Madison to an international audience BARRY ADAMS badams@madison.com 14 hrs ago 0 Buy Now BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL Brain Baldis, director of product development for Mongoose, shows off a three-pound aluminum frame that will be used in BMX bikes in 2018 at Pacific Cycle's Madison headquarters. The company is preparing for an event next month unveiling the 2018 line of Mongoose bikes for dealers, distributors and an international contingent of mountain and BMX bike media.   When the newest line of Mongoose bicycles is unveiled next month by Madison-based Pacific Cycle, it won’t happen in a trade show in a tricked-out convention hall in California, Utah or Germany. Instead, global retailers and distributors, niche media and some of the world-class athletes who ride the brand will converge on Madison for a taste of the culture that plays a role in the design and development of the dirt-focused line of bikes. There will be group rides on the winding and undulating trails at Blue Mound State Park, spins around the Madtown BMX Track in DeForest and guided rides on one of the best public bike trail systems in the country. Attendees will explore the city, the region’s dining and craft beer scene and take tours of Pacific Cycle’s Hammersley Road headquarters, adjacent to the Southwest Commuter Path’s bridge over the Beltline. +5  Buy Now Brian Baldis, director of product development for Mongoose, walks past a mural in the Pacific Cycle's headquarters on Hammersley Road in Madison.  BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL In other words, a fully immersive Madison experience. “We have an opportunity to bring the focus back to Mongoose, hold it here in the building, showcase what Pacific Cycle brings to the development of the products that our customers are buying and bring the media in,” said Brian Baldis, director of product development for Mongoose. “They can really tie it back to the essence and the emotion of the brand once they come here.’” International exposure Pacific Cycle’s Mongoose line ranges from $79 children’s bikes that can be purchased at Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us to high-end models that sell at specialized bike shops and online for more than $3,000. In fact, the company has nearly 200 models with 100 more variations. The brand and sales showcase event, from June 8 to 10, will focus on bikes that range from $150 and up. Industry media invited to the event include representatives from Mountain Bike Magazine, BikeRumor.com, SingleTracks.com, PinkBike.com, BMX News and Montenbaik.com, a Chilean based website. “They have a lot of reach to Argentina, Mexico and Spain as well, as far as their site traffic is concerned,” said Steve Wilcox, sports marketing manager for Mongoose. “The majority of these are mountain-focused, which is amazing, really, because it’s a sub-segment of bicycling. It’s very specific, very particular.” Pacific Cycle is a house of brands that also includes Schwinn, purchased out of bankruptcy in 2001; InStep, a bicycle trailer company; and Kid Trax, a line of battery-powered ride-on toys for young children. +5  Buy Now A line of Mongoose helmets are displayed at Pacific Cycle in Madison, which acquired the Mongoose brand in 2000. BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL Mongoose was founded in 1974 in Simi Valley, California, and is one of the staples at Pacific Cycle, which acquired the Mongoose brand in 2000 with the purchase of Brunswick’s bicycle division. Pacific Cycle was founded in 1977 by Chris Hornung in a small space at Felland and Burke roads just east of High Crossing Boulevard on Madison’s Far East Side. The company later moved to McFarland and by 1999 had 24 employees and gross revenues topping $100 million. The company moved to its current home in 2000 and soon spent $2.2 million expanding and renovating the former television and radio studio space. In early 2004, the company, then with more than $325 million in annual sales, was sold to Dorel Industries, a Canadian company that sells baby strollers, car seats, furniture and other products. The Dorel sports division includes the Pacific Cycle brands plus Caloi, one of the largest bicycle brands in Latin America; and the GT and Cannondale bike lines. +5  Buy Now Dave Duecker, vice president of product for Madison-based Pacific Cycle, shows off the 2018 version of the Mongoose Boot'r. Improvements to the bike this year include a revamped dual suspension system and lighter components. The 2017 version retails for about $2,900. BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL Mongoose bikes are manufactured on contract in Asia, primarily in China. Pacific Cycle has 450 employees, about 100 of those at its Madison headquarters. The remainder work at four distribution centers — in Illinois, Georgia and two in California. “What makes Mongoose so unique is that we’re an extremely accessible brand and we make a really good bike at a number of price points,” said Dave Duecker, Pacific Cycle’s vice president of product. “If we can catch them young and catch them early and they have a great experience, we have a whole line of products that they can grow with.” The dirt experience Key changes to the 2018 Mongoose line include revamping the company’s dual-suspension bikes with lighter components, designs to improve performance and a new look with revised graphics. The BMX race category has been expanded from four to eight models thanks to more exposure from its debut in the 2008 Olympics and an increase of more organized racing leagues and events for youth. “The sport has taken to how parents like to put their kids in those kind of formatted sports, versus freestyle, which is still the bulk of the BMX marketplace,” Baldis said. “Racing is seeing some uptick because it has a time, location, adult supervision and feels very much like Little League in that way. It’s been great for youths getting back on bikes in that way.” +5  Buy Now The Mongoose Boot'r features a dual suspension and a single front sprocket for simplicity and less weight. BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL During a tour of the Pacific Cycle headquarters, Baldis showed off a new race frame for 2018 that uses hydro-formed aluminum and weighs about three pounds. The frame is used on BMX bikes that sell for between $230 and $250. The facility also includes a fitness studio, indoor employee bike racks, a locker room with showers and a tech center where bikes are fine-tuned. Table tennis in the warehouse is popular during breaks, while some employees head out for lunch-hour rides. Madison design hub In the company’s design and development center, an open-style office is filled with vintage bikes and prototypes, and developers and graphic designers using computers to come up with the next and best new products. Electric bikes are not part of the company’s portfolio, at least not yet. “We believe it’s a growing category and we are looking into that category and trying to determine the best routes in how to get into it. It’s a market that’s out there and growing throughout the U.S.,” Duecker said. “I think it’s in the future for every company out there.” +5  Buy Now Matt Prest, a senior product manager for Mongoose, gives a final review of 2018 bike designs at Pacific Cycle in Madison. The company, which also owns the Schwinn brand, employs about 100 people in Madison and 350 others at four distribution centers around the country.  BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL Matt Prest, a senior product manager for Mongoose, has been designing bikes for 15 years, six of those at Trek in Waterloo. Last week he was putting the finishing touches on 2018 designs for a downhill bike and a cross country bike, thinking about 2019 and contemplating his work out to 2025. When he first got into the industry, there was more physical construction in developing designs, but now much of it is contained to a computer until the latter stages. “You did a lot more prototypes, a lot more welding, which increased the lead time,” Prest said. “We’ve really reduced the amount of lead time and mistakes, and that helps us get a better product faster.” Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Heart ™ Menu The Anonymous Manifesto™ The Nobel Prize Aww..{A memoir} {Fiction} {Poetry} {Essays} {Reviews} {Travel} Heart™ The Anonymous Manifesto™ The Nobel Prize Aww..{A memoir} {Fiction} {Poetry} {Essays} {Reviews} {Travel} Heart™ May 28, 2017 / 0 comments The Anonymous Manifesto™ – Ep. 4 – The Indian Math teacher from Albany, Georgia * * * SG, 50 is from India and teaches high school Math in Albany, Georgia, population 70,000. He tells me about life in small town USA, his passion for a mentally stressful job like teaching and the respect he gets and the prejudices he faces from people he interacts with on a daily basis. Here’s the transcript of my face to face interview with him.  * Heart: How did you come to the States as a teacher? SG: Its a company called GTRR for which I work. Now its called KRG (Knowledge Resource Group). I was interviewed in Hyderabad (India) for this role. We have other centers around India like in Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata where they screen for candidates. I went through a consultancy called RK Consultancy for my first round of interviews. And then RK forwarded my resume to GTRR and they did a second round of interview. * Heart: So, where all do these teachers from India get placed? Just the States or World wide? SG: I’m not exactly sure of the entire list, but, our teachers have gone to Philippines and Australia too. * Heart: What’s the subject you teach? SG: I’m a math teacher in a high school. There’s a great need for Math, Science and Special education teachers in America. These are the three categories of teachers that come here. * Heart: How long have you guys been here? SG: 10 years since 2007. We came here when our older one was 5 years old. Now he’s 15, rising 11th (grader). * Heart: What’s the demographic makeup of Albany, Georgia? Do you have any Indians? SG: There are a lot of African Americans where we live. We have a small Indian community. We have 15 teachers who came like me. * Heart: How’s the poverty rate? SG: Not much. The place is not small at the same time its not that big. One of the town’s biggest employers is Miller Coors, a beer brewing company. P&G is another one. * Heart: How’s life in Albany? SG: Running. (sic) We’re always busy, just like everyone else. But our life is not that complicated. We don’t have an Indian grocery store or anything. The rating of our school was great and so we accepted the offer to come here. * Heart: Have you experienced racism? SG: I guess the place is just like anywhere else. They accept us, they’re helpful generally when you run into them. * Heart: Its really interesting to talk to a teacher from the Indian community. Most of my friends and people I meet are business men, or doctors and for the most part work in Information technology. SG: That’s what I hear. They ask, “Oh, so even teachers come from India to teach kids here?” That’s a big question mark for them. * Heart: What visa are you guys on? SG: H1. * Heart: Do they fast track your Green card processing? SG: No, actually, its very slow. Although we’re eligible for EB2 processing for Greencards, our consulting companies don’t prefer doing that. By the way, are you guys Brahmins (One of the social classes in India)? * Heart: Yes, we are. SG: I could tell. (Laughs) * Heart: How do you do your Indian grocery (lentils and other dry goods) shopping? SG: Atlanta is 180 miles from Albany and Tallahassee is 80 miles south. But we prefer Atlanta because we can come to the temple here. There is no Indian temple in Tallahassee. Two birds at one shot. (Laughs) * Heart: Tell me anything. SG: Teaching is great. There’s a lot of respect to those of us in it. Because we (Indians) are so hardworking, the kids also show us a lot of respect. Atleast a lot of them. * Heart: Does your wife work? SG: She’s a medical records analyst in a hospital. * Heart: Was she trained here or did she come to the US as a trained person? SG: No, mam. It’s a long story. She came here on the dependant visa, H4. She worked at a gas station for a very long time. And thanks to Obama, when he gave EADs (Employment Authorization Card) to all the H4 visa holders, she started applying to different places. She was interviewed at this hospital, 3 or 4 rounds before she finally got the job. She is an MBA from India. By the way which county do you guys live in? * Heart: Fulton. SG: Until two years ago, Fulton county was taking teachers from India. Now, they don’t anymore. * Heart: Interesting. We see a couple of Indian teachers in special education. so where are all the other 14 of your teacher friends work at? SG: They are in different schools. Middle and high, both. We know a few doctors too. We know a couple of IT specialists, but they don’t hang out with us often. And their work is contract based and so its difficult to form long term friendships with them. There are a lot of IT needs for companies like P&G, the Marine Base and the Airforce and the Airport. And when we meet these IT guys in Walmart or somewhere else, we try to make friends with them, but 4 months later they’re gone. We have 15 teachers and 15 doctors in our social group. We gather every Saturday and chant Vishnu Sahasra Naamam at someone’s house. That’s an occasion to meet. * Heart: That’s great for having a sense of community. So do you do any private tutoring? SG: We don’t have the time to do anything after school. Especially for us Indian teachers. The job itself is mentally very stressful. * Heart: How do you grade kids? SG: You show me your work and your get your grades accordingly. You have to submit on time, otherwise even if its perfect, you only get a 70 from me. That’s it, those are my rules. There was a guy from our teacher’s group called Vinod and his Principal had demanded him to give a passing grade to one of Vinod’s students. And he quit the job because he didn’t want to do the wrong thing and left for India. * Heart: Oh wow. Were you a teacher back in India? SG: I was a lecturer in a Degree (Undergrad) college. And I used to have my own college. Its Gitanjali women’s college in Warangal. You can even Google it. Of course, we had to come out of it because it was difficult to juggle both India and the States. Being a sleeping partner is not that easy and its high risk. But, its doing very well now. That was my dream, you know. * Heart: Who knows you might establish a university here in the States? So, do you have any plans to go back to India? SG: (Laughs) Not yet. Our younger one is in 2nd grade. And the problem is not with us. My kids can’t be good students in India. They might initially struggle with the lifestyle, but eventually they might adapt. But education is totally a different thing. The Indian education system is very different. You might be able to come here from India and settled down well into the education system. But if you go there, you’ll be a zero. * Heart: What’s the biggest difference in education system from India and America? SG: There’s a lot of exposure for kids to many different things in America, which is missing in India. They get exposed to so many different aspects of real life and scholastics, its good for the child. They are not afraid of asking questions, think for themselves and have an individualistic approach to problems. If they don’t like something, they can say no. Even if you are the teacher, they tell you they don’t want to do this assignment. They never shy from expressing they opinions. But, in India, we learn a lot of content. We learn a subject really deeply. But here, if we work on a problem, we also have to think of the application of the solution instead of just finding a solution. For example, if you’re given a topic, you’ve to write two or three pages about it, you get some depth on the subject. But in India, parents, teachers and society, hide the actual knowledge and understanding of the student. We only have a standard answer for any given question instead of allowing the student to answer it in his own understanding. If you want your child to be an Engineer, you’ll only expose him to Math and Science. There’s a downside to that. If lets say, you want your child to become a doctor, his initial foundation is going to be in subjects related to that and if he doesn’t get a good score to get into Medical school, the child is stuck, because he hasn’t been exposed to any other area of education early on. Here, everyone does all the courses even through Under Grad and they can go into masters in an area which they want to specialize in. Whenever you decide to change the course of your career, you take the credits in the subject related to that. That’s why our government of Telangana (a southern state in India) is planning to revamp the educational system into what they call a credit system. You can accumulate all the credits you want based on the subject you choose. If you take a math course, you get a credit. You are not stuck in a course where for 3 or 4 years, you only study Math or Science. If you finish 24 credits, you can graduate from High school. If you finish 36 credits, you are done with your Under grad school, 4 years of college. So, take my example. I did my masters, and my specialization was in Math. But if you want to be a computer engineer in India, you’ve to complete your Master of Science or Master of Computer Applications. But, here, all you have to do is take credits related to computers from the University and you can get a job working with computers. In India, even before the child is actually born, parents think of what they want their children to be. He will be an engineer or she will be a doctor. (Laughs) * Heart: Your son is a rising 11th grader. How do you guys handle the pressures of his life? SG: There’s a program called “Move On Ready” which allows students starting from 10th to take classes in a college near you. His entire semester course happens online. So, he has already finished a semester. And he has started his second semester. If you get a good score in SAT, you can even attend classes in a good school. He was mad at us for forcing him to come to Atlanta for visiting the temple today. He wants to go to the game tomorrow at the school, and he has a ton of homework and we made him sit for 3 hours to get here early Saturday morning. (Laughs) But we forced him to come with us because visiting the temple is equally important. You know. * Heart: Does he like Math? SG: Oh yeah. (Laughs) * Heart: Can I ask you how much you get paid? SG: Sure, a little over 60,000 dollars. But compared to my friends in the Information technology field its meager. Most of the teachers I work with get somewhere in the 50,000s. If you’re teaching 5th grade, you might get something like 40,000 dollars. Depends on your qualifications and your experience. These are the only two things that matter. If you’ve have a graduation degree, but less experienced, you can only make around 45,000 dollars. Teaching is a tough job. And sometimes, I buy my own supplies. But it depends on what you want to do for your children, no one expects you to get your own supplies but that’s something you want to do for them sometimes. I want to talk about racism, that you had asked about earlier. No one’s openly racist or anything, but I can get a sense that they don’t want me here. Because I can sense some sort of a jealousy on our education, our property, our salaries and our cars. For example, I earn more than 60,000 dollars a year, but most of the other teachers earn around 45,000 dollars. So they compare and they ask me why I earn more? They don’t take into account my experience and my qualifications. They just think, “I’m a teacher, you’re a teacher.” So, we should all be equal. But, some of the “teachers” haven’t even finished their teaching certificate course. So, they don’t even make 1500 dollars a month. They are part of the TAP (Teacher Advancement Program) program. That’s where they get trained as teachers. After taxes, they take home about 1000 dollars a month. If they take days off, they lose some more pay. But they just compare my paycheck and theirs. Most of the Indian teachers don’t take a single day off. Out of 180 working days, we are there almost 175 days. But there’re a lot of others who take 4 or 5 days off monthly. They don’t take all these into consideration when they’re comparing paychecks.  They compare the way we dress. We dress smartly, we don’t want to wear round T shirts and jeans to work. That’s just not something we do. They jealousy about that too. (sic). They used old local cars, whereas we used international cars like, Toyota Camry or Lexus. And they’ve only one car at home. We usually have two cars and our spouse is working too. Sometimes, the son can also have a car of his own. Sometimes, it gets very hard. Even from the students, its very hard to tolerate jealousy.  * Heart: So, do the children feel like they’re entitled to good grades? SG: I don’t give them what they want if they don’t deserve it. Of course, they demand you to give them a certain grade. But I tell them, “You don’t deserve, I won’t give. Show it on paper and then demand me.” (sic) For anything that they can’t produce, they need the administrator’s support. Of course, most times, the administrators don’t support Indian teachers. I feel like the school administrators are also scared in some way. If they’ve to take any action on a student that I’m having trouble with, I’ll have to produce perfect documentation. But Indians, don’t do perfect documentation. We just want to focus on our teaching. The paper work can get out of hand and its long hard work to get just one student disciplined. We don’t want to expose the misbehavior of the student in front of the parent or the school because we don’t have the perfect documentation. We just use simple words, the student is disobedient or something and its not enough to deserve punishment. They focus a lot on these shallow things and not on the content of the subject or what’s more important for the student. The kids don’t want to do anything, all they want is a good grade. The 9th and 10th graders are the toughest grades to teach. If you want to be a teacher in a high school in America, you just have to shut your ears and eyes and get into your classroom. The kids keep throwing a lot of profanity on you constantly. You can’t save your self respect in situations like these. You have 25 children in a classroom and you can’t expect everyone to behave perfectly well. Some kids are rude, some have just returned from jail, some bring knives to school. Who knows if someone’s murdered someone and is sitting in your class now? There’s a current student of mine, and she’s just returned from being in detention system for 3 or 4 years. * Heart: Do you know why? SG: Drugs, or stealing or I don’t know, it can be anything. And that’s why I tell my kids, there are cameras everywhere in Walmart and other places. Don’t steal, if you need anything ask me. (Laughs) Or most times they fight a lot. When they use profanity, all you can do is write them up. In India, you can beat the shit of that guy. You do it at school and then even at home, he’ll get a good dose of that medicine. (Laughs) Here, all I can do is documentation. And when parents come, they are surprised that their child has used profanity. (Laughs) If you have the administrator’s support, they will talk to the parents to tell them that their child is at fault. If you want teach, you can’t survive the stress for long. By evening, I am so stressed out, that I can’t do anything else. * Heart: What’s the problem, does it start at home? Are they from broken families? SG: A lot of them are children to single parents. Parents with criminal background. They bring their boyfriend or girlfriend problems to class. On guy was like, “Someone’s talking to my girlfriend, and I don’t like that” and he’s using violence against the other kid in the hallway. Bottom line is, if they would focus on their education, there wouldn’t been a need for teachers to come from India.

Carmen Ponder, a 23-year-old pre-law student at Texas A&M University-Commerce originally though the man who was involved in a “road rage” incident with her was Chief Kerry Crews but she now says she may have gotten that identification wrong. This, according to her attorney. Many of her statements do not line up with statements given by Crews who has been put on routine paid administrative leave while a third party investigation is conducted by Fort Worth law firm Lynn Ross & Gannaway. According to reports, Crews had been shopping at Wal-Mart when he saw two motorists in a dispute in the parking lot. One of the motorists “failed to comply with [Crews] requests.” That person was then arrested for “evading arrest or detention.” Ponder shared a very different story on Twitter. According to her, she was driving when she was cut off by a black truck that had been driving erratically. She thought the driver might be impaired so she signaled and drove past into the stores parking lot. — Video appears to show Texas officer striking teenage girl —  She says the man then followed her into the parking lot and began to yell profanities at her. Ponder says the man stated he was teaching his 14-year-old how to drive and she should not have driven around them. Ponder said it was illegal for a 14-year-old to drive and continued to walk towards the Wal-Mart. That was when she heard him say, “Oh whatever, you black [expletive].” According to her, when she exited the store she was approached by a plainclothes officer who flashed his badge and said the man she got into the altercation with was his chief and she needed to apologize. She said no and began to walk towards her car when the cop grabbed her arm and told her she was being detained. At this point, she called 911. When more officers arrived, they were told by the first one that she had been evading arrest. She was held for 24 hours and charged with that crime. Her lawyers are requesting all charges be dropped and for those involved to be punished appropriately. @MeritLaw pic.twitter.com/LeHyS9JwHM — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 Related Posts Source: Putin believes ‘House of Cards’ is based on fact Suspect confesses to killing 8, including deputy Prince Harry hosts Obama in London in wake of Manchester bombing 8th graders refuse to pose with Paul Ryan during DC field trip White supremacist shouting hate speech kills 2 men on Portland train Eric Trump: Russia controversy is a ‘total hoax’ Post navigation Previous Previous post: Uber CEO’s mother killed in boating accident Next Next post: Eric Trump: Russia controversy is a ‘total hoax’ Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America Source: Putin believes ‘House of Cards’ is based on fact Suspect confesses to killing 8, including deputy Prince Harry hosts Obama in London in wake of Manchester bombing 8th graders refuse to pose with Paul Ryan during DC field trip White supremacist shouting hate speech kills 2 men on Portland train Eric Trump: Russia controversy is a ‘total hoax’ Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Politics Living Video Inspire Health Entertainment News Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio ©2017 Entertainment Studios LLC Powered by PressHarbor.com theGrio Proudly powered by WordPress Theme: TheGrio Theme Prod (nbcthegrio).

Tori Lee Castillo, 39, is facing child abuse allegations after she locked her two children in the trunk of her car while she shopped at a Walmart in Utah. Tori Lee Castillo, 39, was arrested after she returned to the car. Her children, ages 2 and 5, were taken by the Division of Child and Family Services and handed over to a responsible party, Riverdale City Police Department said in a statement. Police said they received a call Thursday after a witness saw the woman stuff the children in the trunk and leave her car at a parking lot. “The small children … began making noise and moving frantically, causing the vehicle to shake,” police said. “Several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children.” Bystanders coached the 5-year-old on how to open the trunk using the emergency latch in it, authorities say. Charity Maw told CNN affiliate KTVX that she was in the parking lot when she heard pounding from inside the trunk. When the children were finally freed, they were crying, she said. “I was shocked, I was shaken, and I was mad,” Maw told the affiliate. “And there’s two kids there, tears coming down their face. Bawling. They were scared.” A witness told CNN affiliate KSTU that when the woman returned to the car, she told them that her babysitter didn’t show up.

The Riverdale City Police Department got a call Thursday after a witness reported seeing Castillo put her kids in the trunk. "The small children ... began making noise and moving frantically, causing the vehicle to shake," Utah police tell CNN. "Several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children." Those good Samaritans coached the 5-year-old on how to open the trunk using an emergency latch. "I was shocked, I was shaken, and I was mad," a witness tells CNN. "And there's two kids there, tears coming down their face. Bawling. They were scared." Castillo was arrested after returning to her car, per the AP.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   4% Hilarious 1% Intriguing 48% Depressing 2% Brilliant 29% Scary 15% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 76 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Tenant Heard Tale of Missing Woman, Started to Dig Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 76 comments Greg Warren 1 hour, 21 minutes ago Please, please, please let me execute this worthless excuse for a human being. scout May 28, 2017 10:00 PM CDT Is the Mormon Romney her husband?

I was abused by her. With said, I think i could do a heaven lot better than that woman. A mother is suppose to treasure her kids and parent them. Maybe theyre pushy? Maybe they disregard her. Maybe shes a pushover. Maybe a lack of "No!" and spankings make them spoiled? Who knows? But what i do know is that a mother should be using her motherly instincts instead of locking them in the trunk. I should know. Ive been locked in dog crates in inhumane conditions. I could show and teach them more about love and respect than her! Good God! Yall have a blessed night!

Tori Castillo, 39, is accused of locking her kids, ages two and five, in the back of her vehicle before popping into Walmart in Riverdale, Utah. AP:Associated Press 2 Tori Castillo allegedly locked her two children in the boot of her car Officers arrived at the scene after they were called to a report of child neglect. Witnesses told police the children began “moving frantically, causing the vehicle to shake” before “several good Samaritans observed this and came to their aid”, Gephardt Daily reported. One of the witnesses guided the five-year-old to pull the emergency latch to release the door and the children were then freed. Google 2 The children were spotted outside Walmart in Riverdale Recalling the incident, Heidi, an eyewitness, told Fox 13: “I could hear some kids crying. I turned to my friend and I’m like, ‘There’s people in this trunk. There’s kids in this trunk!'” She said when the boot was finally opened, the children were scared and sweating from the heat. Heidi added: “It was kind of heartbreaking to see that somebody could do something so cruel.” Most read in news SUPERMARKET EXECUTION First picture of dad, 35, shot dead in Sainsbury's car park 'as he held his toddler son in his arms and pleaded for his life' MINUTES FROM MASS MURDER Suicide bomber Salman Abedi caught on CCTV in lift to Manchester Arena wearing £300 Nike trainers with his hand on trigger of homemade device HOLIDAY HORROR British man arrested after seven-week-old baby and several adults injured when car mounts pavement and slams into pedestrians in Marbella near celeb nightspot the Ocean Club TERROR HERO IS '23RD VICTIM' Survivor of London 7/7 terror attack Tony Walter, 52, found dead hours after Manchester bombing as friends claim 'he didn’t want to live in a world where ­attacks continue' path to evil Brothers held over Manchester attack lived next to murder victim 'whose death caused bomber's turn to terror' I'M ORF!

Courtesy A Cuban band performs on the street. top story Trip of a lifetime: Compass School juniors travel to Cuba by Isaac Stein Sentinel Staff 20 hrs ago (…) Courtesy photos Courtesy photos Courtesy A Cuban band performs on the street. A s summer’s gearing up, many of us are thinking about warm sun and the ocean. But what if you could add The Malecón, ’50s cars, hiking, street food and a cultural experience that just recently opened up to Americans? Then you’d be like the 14 juniors at The Compass School in Westminster, Vt., who journeyed to Cuba late last month for the 11th grade’s annual class trip, which ran for 10 days. While an exhaustive list of what they did could go on for pages, the students explored Old Havana and Old Trinidad, visited the Museum of the Revolution in Havana, hiked and cliff-jumped in Parque el Cubano (a park in Trinidad, Cuba, that’s renowned for picturesque waterfalls) and stayed with host families in multiple Cuban towns. To Olivia Veale, 16, of Springfield, Vt., one memorable time was when she was staying with woman in her 50s or 60s in Trinidad, and the two carried on a conversation about politics, entirely in Spanish. Olivia paraphrased the woman as saying that while she didn’t particularly care for Raul Castro’s current government (as compared to Fidel Castro), she generally preferred socialism over capitalism as an economic system. Rick Gordon, the director of the grade 7-12 independent school in Vermont, accompanied the students to Cuba and added that he also was able to converse frankly about politics with the Cubans he met. “(I met) a barber who said, ‘The Castros? They’re crooks!’ ” Gordon said, adding that his impression was that the Cuban government allows citizens “to do and say whatever you want … until you can’t.” Gordon also said that roughly two-thirds of the people he spoke to about the issue believe Raul Castro is going to keep his promise to step down as president of Cuba in 2018, but the word on the street was “most people said it doesn’t matter who’s the head (of the government); the system is never going to change.” But perhaps political cynicism doesn’t mean apathy. Elijah Alexander, 16, of Claremont remarked that he was impressed with “how happy the people were there,” even when they didn’t have much in the way of personal belongings, and suggested that Cuban culture values family and personal happiness over material success. Elijah added that he was surprised that the Museum of the Revolution preserved revolution-era bullet holes in the building, saying he thinks “The Smithsonian probably wouldn’t keep bullet holes in the wall.” For his part, Gordon elaborated on his observations about the scarcity of goods in Cuba; for instance, he went to a dry goods market in Havana that had less than 50 items — and some of them weren’t complementary. For instance, one could leave a Cuban market with “a can of tomatoes, a pair of underwear and a match.” He also noted that the school fundraises to make the trip possible for all of its students, many of whom come from low-income families. As for where The Compass School juniors head next, only time and a vote among the next crop of 11th-graders will tell. “Water, water everywhere/nor any drop to drink,” goes the The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. But when you think about quantities of water, are you as creative as Anna DuMond, 9? If one inch of rain fell on Keene, she noted, the runoff from the Wal-Mart parking lot alone would be able to fill a bathtub more than 4,000 times. Anna, a 4th-grader at Wheelock School in Keene, took first place in the 2017 New Hampshire Fourth Grade Water Science Fair, which coincided with the state Drinking Water Festival on May 10. It was held at the Recreation Center on Washington Street in Keene, and organized by the N.H. Drinking Water Coalition, which includes members Aaron Costa and Eric Swope, both of Keene’s Public Works Department. For context, 4th-graders at all Keene elementary schools participated in the science fair, as well as 4th-graders from Harrisville, Marlborough, Manchester and Westmoreland. Keene and Manchester also held city fairs with the top few projects from each of the schools; students like Anna had to place at those events, which were held in April, Swope said. Swope also said he’s always impressed at the level of complexity of the student projects, and added a few water-related jests in a news release about the event. “Though we were celebrating all things water, we also celebrated that the skies did NOT open up and douse us with the water that had been the weather pattern during the preceding days,” Swope wrote. Back to Anna’s project: She demonstrated how an aquifer works and also explained the environmental impact of runoff and impervious surfaces. For example, she explained, pavement, unlike gravel, is impervious, which means water can’t pass through. The effect is that the runoff (and pollutants) transfer quickly to nearby bodies of water. Anna’s presentation certainly impressed the judges, though she was also humble in victory. She expressed appreciation for her friend Maia Chretien’s project on osmosis; Maia, of Symonds School, took fourth place. Colleen Brophy, Anna’s mom, added that when she saw the other projects, she was impressed with their quality, realizing “it’s anybody’s game here.” As for Anna, she’s getting back to her studies. She said that her class’s science unit, which discussed surface tension and cohesion, has been completed, and they’re “studying Egypt now.” In a previous Quick Studies column, we featured the Extended Learning Opportunities (ELO) program at Hinsdale High School. Earlier this month, students in the program demonstrated what they learned this year as part of a school-wide event. On Wednesday, they’ll be giving back to their ELO supervisor, or mentor, during the Mentor Recognition Dinner, a catered event at the school, according to Karen Thompson, Hinsdale’s extended learning coordinator. An ELO can, for example, take the form of an internship, an apprenticeship or independent study, according to the N.H. Department of Education website. While she was certainly excited for the students’ learning demonstrations, Thompson said she’s also looking forward to the dinner. “Each student spends time thanking their mentors for their learning experience and shares how the experience has helped shape their lives. It is my favorite night of the year,” Thompson said. In the near future, local college students will be able to converse with international scholars on topics of Holocaust and genocide studies. Keene State College is welcoming international genocide scholars to campus as part of a joint initiative with the Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation. Keene State hosts the Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies and also offers a bachelor’s degree in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. Every fall semester, starting with this upcoming one, Keene State will host one fellow as part of the program. As part of the arrangement, the visiting scholar will live on campus, have a meal plan, and is eligible to enroll in two full classes (and audit as many as they like), all with a full waiver of tuition and fees. The first scholar to arrive in Keene as part of the program is Hikmet Karcic, a Ph.D. candidate at the International University of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a researcher at the Institute for Islamic Tradition of Bosniaks. His research focuses on mass atrocities that have occurred in the Balkans, especially those committed during the Bosnian War (1992-95), according to a news release from the college. Bosniaks are a Muslim-majority nation and ethnic group that live mostly in Bosnia-Herzegovina; during the Bosnian War, which occurred during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, they were targeted for genocide by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska.

The ripples from the fall of the final gavel keep traveling for weeks, either in the form of bills that make their way to the governor’s desk, or things left undone. Both of those kinds of consequences led to disappointment or confusion in two substance-related industries that backers paint as trying to move forward. Big-box retailers that supported the right to sell liquor alongside groceries saw their efforts rebuffed by Gov. Rick Scott, who vetoed a hard-fought measure aimed at tearing down the state’s “liquor wall.” Meanwhile, disputes continued over the state’s medical-marijuana market, a reminder that the system of nurseries is just as much of a business as corner drug stores, even if the legal footing for the latter is firmer in the eyes of federal officials. And with plenty of uncertainty about just how final the Legislature’s decision on the state’s annual spending plan will be, one departing state official announced he would stay on the job a bit longer — even as the churn of agency heads continued. POUR ONE OUT FOR THE LIQUOR WALL BILL After hours of debate and House approval that rested on a dubious one-vote margin, there was no final victory toast for those who supported getting rid of a decades-old law requiring hard spirits to be sold in separate facilities from groceries and other retail goods. Scott might be a Republican, but he saw no reason to tear down this wall. In typical Scott fashion, he attributed the decision to one thing: jobs, and specifically those that small-business owners said would be lost if the bill was approved. The veto was a victory for independent liquor-store owners, ABC Fine Wine & Spirits and Publix Super Markets, which fought the bill during the legislative session that ended May 8. “I carefully reviewed this bill and I have met with stakeholders on both sides,” Scott said. “I listened closely to what they had to say and I understand that both positions have merit. Nevertheless, I have heard concerns as to how this bill could affect many small businesses across Florida. I was a small business owner and many locally owned businesses have told me how this bill will impact their families and their ability to create jobs.” Left to cry in their beers — which, along with wine, can already be sold in big-box stores — were supporters of the proposal (SB 106) like Target, Costco and Walmart. They had banked on a free-market and convenience argument that came up short, even as the bill got closer to becoming law than it has in earlier attempts. “We have made tremendous progress in the last four years, and there is a clear momentum in Florida for this common-sense approach to liquor sales,” said Michael Williams, a spokesman for the group Floridians for Fair Business Practices, which supported the repeal. “While Governor Scott ultimately chose to veto Senate Bill 106, we look forward to working with state leaders in the future to finally put an end to this outdated, Prohibition-era law.” It was Scott’s first veto of the year, but if the Tallahassee rumor and speculation mill is to be believed, it probably won’t be his last. The governor also gave approval to some big-ticket or even medium-sized items this week. He signed a tax-cut package that was much smaller than the one he requested but includes some consumer-friendly items like tax-free holidays for back-to-school shopping and hurricane gear and a repeal of the “tampon tax.” “Since I’ve been in office, I’ve fought to cut taxes and reduce burdensome regulations to help boost Florida’s economy and ensure our children and grandchildren have the opportunity to succeed in our great state,” Scott said in a prepared statement. “Every time we cut taxes, we are encouraging businesses of all sizes to create opportunities for families across the state, and more money is put back in taxpayers’ pockets.” The savings are projected to reach $180 million over two years due to some permanent cuts. Scott had requested $618.4 million in cuts before the legislative session, and an initial House package approached $300 million. But the package was scaled back substantially as the House and Senate negotiated a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Business groups also got some goodies, including a reduction in the commercial lease tax from 6 percent to 5.8 percent. That’s projected to save businesses $25.4 million next fiscal year, with that total growing to $61 million when the cut is in effect for a full year. Business groups have long argued that the state should repeal the tax, and Scott had asked for the lease tax to be dropped to 4.5 percent. “The most significant steps are often the first ones we take on an issue, and this cut opens the door for future reductions of this burdensome tax,” said Maria Wells, Florida Realtors president, in a release following the signing of the tax-cut package. Scott also signed a bill establishing state criminal charges for engaging in or supporting terrorism or terrorist activities that result in death or injuries, and legislation authorizing the payment of $3.75 million in the child-abuse case that resulted in the death of Nubia Barahona. Lawmakers said the Florida Department of Children and Families failed to prevent abuse of Nubia and her twin brother, Victor. Nubia Barahona’s decomposing body was found in February 2011 in the bed of her adoptive father’s pickup truck. Victor Barahona was convulsing in the truck, as both children had been doused with toxic chemicals, authorities said. MONEY-JUANA Lawmakers might not have passed a measure during the session to implement the constitutional amendment allowing full-fledged medical marijuana that voters approved last year, but the nascent ganja industry keeps rolling. In a long-awaited decision, an administrative law judge Tuesday called for the state to issue two new licenses to medical marijuana operators, saying competing businesses — which lost out to another operator selected by Florida health officials in 2015 — were virtually tied. Administrative Law Judge John Van Laningham’s recommended order came months after a hearing in the matter and long after he decided that the winning licensee, Alpha Foliage, known as Surterra Therapeutics, should have been ineligible to apply for a license because of changes in ownership. Van Laningham’s order could boost from seven to nine the number of operators licensed by the state to grow, process and distribute marijuana and derivative products to patients. Licenses have been awarded in five different regions of the state. On Tuesday, Van Laningham recommended that the Department of Health issue new licenses to Tornello Landscape, also known as “3 Boys Farm,” and Plants of Ruskin. The two nurseries, both based in Ruskin, challenged health officials’ decision to issue a “dispensing organization” license in the Southwest Florida region to Surterra. Under administrative law, Van Laningham’s recommended order will have to go back to the department for final action. If the agency decides not to authorize two licenses, then 3 Boys should win because it received the highest score, “if only by a mathematically insignificant margin,” Van Laningham wrote. Whether the agency will issue two new licenses is questionable; state officials have maintained in the past that current state law restricts the Department of Health to granting only one new license in each of the state’s five regions, based on administrative or court rulings. The challenges are rooted in a 2014 law that initially called for one license to be awarded in each region of the state for nurseries to grow, process and distribute medical marijuana. That law allowed limited types of non-euphoric cannabis for some patients and was expanded last year to allow full-strength pot for people who are terminally ill. But the already coveted licenses are even more desirable after the passage in November of a constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana for a broad swath of patients with debilitating conditions. Under every scenario envisioned thus far, the current license holders will automatically be eligible to grow and sell pot products for an exponentially larger patient base in Florida, which experts predict could quickly become one of the nation’s biggest markets. SOMEONE OLD, SOMEONE NEW Departing Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater knows what he’s going to do next. When he’s going to do it is still up in the air. When he originally announced that he would step down to take a job at Florida Atlantic University, Atwater said he would leave at the end of the legislative session, which came on May 8. The week before that, he released a farewell letter. But Atwater said this week he’s waiting until action on the budget wraps up. “We had a responsibility, when we said to finish session, maybe I should have been more clear about that, that all the work is completed, and not put it in the hands of someone who will be coming in for just a couple of days, to try to learn the systems and get it uploaded to start the fiscal year,” Atwater said. “Hopefully, it comes in for a landing soon.” Atwater said Florida Atlantic University officials are “being very patient” and made clear he expects to switch jobs before the start of the school year. “Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, absolutely,” he said. Atwater was on hand for the meeting Tuesday of Scott and the Cabinet, where Noah Valenstein was named as Florida’s next environmental secretary. Valenstein, a former Scott aide who is executive director of the Suwannee River Water Management District, will take over at the Department of Environmental Protection on June 5. Unlike most agency heads who answer only to the governor, the secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection falls under Scott and the Cabinet. Valenstein said after the meeting he wants to bring the “philosophy I’ve had at Suwannee River” to the state department. “The issues are the same everywhere,” said Valenstein, who grew up in Alachua County. “All Floridians care about the environment, it’s the underpinning of what makes the state such a great place to live.” Environmental groups, who haven’t always seen eye-to-eye with Scott and other Republicans, seemed optimistic. Anna Upton, outside general counsel for the Everglades Foundation, said she expects Valenstein to do well because of his background with environmental law and the inner workings of state agencies. “He understands that people come to the state of Florida for our beaches, for our springs, for our national parks, our state parks, and of course the Everglades,” Upton said. STORY OF THE WEEK: Gov. Rick Scott vetoed hard-fought legislation that would have torn down the state’s “liquor wall,” a defeat for retailers that had hoped to sell hard spirits alongside groceries and other goods. QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “Walmart has a competitive edge. They buy in such large quantities, that there is no way the person with two or three liquor stores can compete with them price-wise.”— Mike Doolan, a manager at Market Square Liquors in Tallahassee, arguing against the “liquor wall” repeal. by Brandon Larrabee, The News Service of Florida Comments Name (required) Email Address (will not be published) (required) Website (enter your own site, if any; not northescambia.com) Your Comments: Have a comment on this story?

By Faith Karimi CNN (CNN) -- A woman is facing child abuse allegations after she locked her two children in the trunk of her car while she shopped at a Walmart in Utah, police say. Tori Lee Castillo, 39, was arrested after she returned to the car. Her children, ages 2 and 5, were taken by the Division of Child and Family Services and handed over to a responsible party, Riverdale City Police Department said in a statement. Police said they received a call Thursday after a witness saw the woman stuff the children in the trunk and leave her car at a parking lot. "The small children ... began making noise and moving frantically, causing the vehicle to shake," police said. "Several good Samaritans observed this and came to the aid of the children." Bystanders instructed the 5-year-old on how to open the trunk using the emergency latch in it, authorities say. Charity Maw told CNN affiliate KTVX that she was in the parking lot when she heard pounding from inside the trunk. When the children were finally freed, they were crying, she said. "I was shocked, I was shaken, and I was mad," Maw told the affiliate. "And there's two kids there, tears coming down their face. Bawling. They were scared."

In addition to it being a place for clients to wait, the space has been used for community programs including movie night and a community Christmas. Comments aAFont Size When Tim and Linda Jordan were given the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance’s Out Against Hunger Award a few years ago, the nomination letter by Lynn Sud... BISMARCK -- Point Cedar is a tiny community -- not much more than a spot in the road -- in Hot Spring County. An aging population, lack of jobs and a stagnant local economy have had an impact on the area. "We've seen a need in the community," says Tim Jordan, who, with his wife, Linda, grew up in Point Cedar. Both are ministers of New Beginnings Church. "There's a lot of need here. A lot of people hurting." The couple oversee New Hope Outreach Ministries, a food pantry. With the help of Glen and Barbara Shuffield, who manage the day to day operations of the food pantry, and other volunteers, they provide boxes of food three times a month to local residents. "This area has never recovered from the 2008 economic collapse," Tim explains. "There are no jobs here. There used to be a saw mill at Glenwood. It closed. Different major manufacturing plants over in Hot Springs have closed. The plants in Arkadelphia have closed, and Hot Spring County is not a manufacturing county to begin with." The closest grocery store for this small community used to be in Bismarck, which is 12 miles away. "Now the closest full-service grocery store, such as Wal-Mart or Kroger is in Hot Springs, and that's 25 miles away," Tim says. New Hope Outreach started with a thrift store that kept a couple of shelves of canned goods for people in need. The Jordans soon realized that wasn't enough. They built a 400-square-foot food pantry next door. "We were swamped that first day," Linda says. "We had people come and spend the night that first night to get in line." And even that wasn't enough. "It was kinda like we were already behind," Tim says. "As soon as you drive the first nail, you're already behind." "People had to wait outside," Linda says. "There was no place for anyone to wait. We had one lady collapse from heat exhaustion, and when it was cold, people would start fires to try and keep warm." Traffic and parking were also a problem. They knew they had to build a bigger building, but weren't sure how. Help came in the form of philanthropist Dorothy Morris of Hot Springs. Tim and Dorothy met at an Arkansas Hunger Alliance workshop and soon discovered they are related. Morris wanted to help the Jordans better serve the needs of the community. Tim had received some state grants, and Morris helped round up more grant money through nonprofits. "So between the two, we pulled it together and built all this with a lot of volunteer help," says Tim about the new food pantry, built in 2015. The 4,000-square-foot building has a commercial kitchen, a warehouse, bathrooms and a dining area. The couple don't owe a dime on the building. Men from the community came together to erect it. "Those trees come out of our neighbor's yard," says Tim, pointing at the wood walls. "Most of the lumber came out of her yard, and we cut it up at our sawmill." "The benches and the curtains are all hand-made. The only things we bought were the two fans. Everything else was made or donated," Linda says. Clients can now come in and wait their turn in the dining room, a homey place with overhead lights made with Mason jars hanging from wagon wheels, a fireplace and stained concrete floors. "We can give them coffee and cookies and give them something to do and get them out of the elements," Linda says. They figure they feed 200-250 families a month. They serve those living within a 10-mile radius of the food pantry or in the Bismarck School District. "We've never turned anybody away. If we find out that they are out of our area, we give them food and then tell them where their closest pantry is," Linda says. "The only thing we ask for is where they live. We don't ask them anything financial. They need food. It's hard for some people. "A lot of people in need won't come because of pride. We try to make it as discreet as possible. We don't dive into how much money they have. We say just 'come,'" she adds. Other churches participate, as well. On the first Saturday of the month, Bismarck First Baptist Church serves breakfast at the pantry. Bismarck United Methodist Church pitches in with funding. Still others provide much-needed volunteer help. At one time, New Beginnings Church was buying the food they were distributing, but now donations come from various sources including the Arkansas Foodbank and Kroger. They even have a greenhouse and garden where they grow vegetables to supplement the donations. Food insecurity is a problem everywhere, Tim says. "It is an ongoing struggle in small communities." The couple hope to build another greenhouse to provide more fresh and nutritious food, build a loading dock and get a generator so that if their electricity goes out, they don't lose food. It's all donation based, says Tim about their funding, "You've got to watch what you're doing and try to figure out best where money can go to help folks." For more information about New Hope Outreach or to make a donation, contact the Jordans at (501) 865-6426.

Janet Blackmon Morgan jblackmon@thesunnews.com Local May 27, 2017 11:23 PM Side streets take drivers nowhere on Kings Highway, Ocean Boulevard By Emily Weaver eweaver@thesunnews.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Traffic was jamming on South Kings Highway on Saturday with passengers of cars, souped-up mo-peds and tricked-out motorcycles dancing to tunes as they crept northward at a snail’s pace. It took Cindy Goodwin’s neighbor an hour and 17 minutes to make a two-block trek to Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market at 17th Avenue South and Kings Highway, Goodwin said outside her 15th Avenue apartment. Goodwin made the same journey in 30 minutes, she said, but only because she avoided Kings Highway by navigating alleyways and parking lots. “I’ve never seen it like this — ever,” Goodwin said. “And it’s going to be like this until Monday!” The heavy traffic congestion on the northbound lanes of South Kings Highway was compounded by the one-way only traffic on Ocean Boulevard and the closure of most side streets leading to it along with a barricaded Yaupon Avenue. Bikers and motorists in attempts to escape the slow-to-no-go traffic on Kings Highway ventured down the side streets anyway, only to be turned around. “All these cars and motorcycles will come zipping down here, thinking they’re going to get on Ocean Boulevard, they get to that little hill right there and they all turn around,” Goodwin said. The southbound-only traffic on the boulevard and the metal barricades, blocking street accesses, were up Friday and will remain up through Monday, adding to congestion through the weekend. “People that have brought their families down here for vacation, Memorial holiday, they’ll never come back,” Goodwin said. Tru Legendz, a club of bikers out of Fayetteville, N.C., rolled into a parking garage of a south-end hotel around 7 p.m., gearing up for a night of vacation fun. But the roadway congestion and the nightly 23-mile traffic loop puts a damper on the good times, they said. “The loop is kind of killing the fun for us,” said Kenneth Maxson, who’s been making the annual trek to Myrtle Beach with the 4-year-old club for two years now. “I understand they’re trying to control the traffic and make sure the locals are not stuck out in traffic and everything, but for us, if we get caught in the loop and we’re trying to get back here, it takes anywhere from three to four hours just to get back here because there’s so much traffic and so much congestion.” And stalled traffic is bad news for a motorcycle’s engine. “It’s not good for the bikes because the engines start running hot. If you let it run too hot, it will blow your engine,” Maxson said. “So what we usually do, once we hear our fans kick on, we’ll just cut the whole bike off and then we have to walk it down whatever road we’re on … until it cools down or until it opens up fast enough for us to get air to the engine.” Maxson says his club does a lot of community service projects and that Tru Legendz comes to Myrtle Beach to have a good time and mingle with other bikers. They don’t come to cause drama, he said. “I know some people come out here and cause trouble, but I think the people that’s coming out here to have a good time, we shouldn’t be punished for the troublemakers,” Maxson said. “It feels like that’s what they’re doing. They’re punishing everybody for the actions of a few.” Traffic-inspired headaches exist for visitors and residents alike. But some passengers made the most of it, jamming on tunes in the traffic jam, hours before the loop would bring more delays.

They heard the kids scratching and making other noises inside the car and guided them to reach for an emergency latch to free themselves.

Dr. Carl Gold, 59, filed a lawsuit Feb. 14 in Sangamon County Circuit Court, contending the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation violated his rights when it issued a summary suspension of his license effective Feb. 6. The next hearing in the case is scheduled July 6 in front of Circuit Judge John Schmidt. The suspension, which prevents Gold from practicing medicine for at least a year, was triggered by what state officials said was a violation of a June 20, 2016, “consent order” with the department that put Gold’s license on probation for at least 12 months. Doctors whose licenses are on probation can continue to practice. The consent order, which Gold signed, didn’t admit guilt but said the state was informed by the U.S. Department of Justice that Gold, an anesthesiologist, had “diverted Schedule II Controlled Substances” from the Decatur hospital “for personal use.” Documents from the state don't indicate when the alleged thefts took place, but the state's case against Gold began in 2015. In the order, Gold agreed to not prescribe medications for his own use and said he would participate in Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, receive ongoing treatment from a doctor certified in addiction medicine, and submit to blood or urine testing. The state's suspension of Gold’s license ruled he violated his probation after IDFPR investigator Ronald Romano said in a sworn statement that Gold tried to get other people to supply urine for his urine test while he was working Dec. 9 at Passavant Area Hospital in Jacksonville. Romano’s statement said the president of Passavant’s medical staff submitted a report to the state that “raised serious concerns regarding (Gold’s) professional conduct and his ability to provide safe, quality care to patients.” According to Romano, Gold was told to provide a random urine sample Dec. 9. Gold then “approached at least four individuals and discussed obtaining urine samples from them,” Romano said. Gold “was able to obtain a urine sample from a unit clerk,” Romano said. When Gold was questioned about his conduct at Passavant, according to Romano, Gold’s responses were “not logical, consistent or credible, which further escalated the concerns for (Gold), for patient safety and for the hospital’s employees.” Gold, who lists on his Facebook page that he has been medical director for anesthesia services at the 93-bed Jacksonville hospital, didn’t say in his lawsuit whether the description of his alleged attempt to submit a fake urine sample was accurate. But even if the facts in the investigator’s statement were true, they didn’t constitute a violation of the consent order, according to Gold’s Feb. 14 court filing requesting a temporary restraining order to lift the suspension. Circuit Judge Ryan Cadigan denied Gold’s request for a restraining order Feb. 22. Gold's appeal to the 4th District of the Illinois Appellate Court failed to overturn Cadigan’s decision. Gold says in his Sangamon County lawsuit that the report about his conduct at Passavant “made no finding of any action that compromised patient safety, or any finding that Dr. Gold violated the terms of the consent decree or the Medical Practice Act.” A May 3 filing by the Illinois attorney general’s office, defending the IDFPR, disagreed with Gold’s interpretation and asks the court to dismiss Gold’s complaint. Assistant Attorney General Adam Poe argued that Romano’s statement implicated Gold for multiple violations of the Illinois Medical Practice Act, including unethical conduct and abuse of drugs. Gold’s conduct, Poe wrote, made department officials think Gold “may have experienced a substance-abuse relapse that could potentially affect his ability to safely and competently practice medicine.” The “erratic behavior” recounted in Romano’s statement describes Gold as “acting in desperation to obtain false urine samples to deceive the department about his alleged drug abuse,” Poe wrote. The allegations established an “immediate and serious concern for the safety of the public,” Poe added. Documents filed by Gold’s attorney, Alexandra de Saint Phalle of Springfield, accuse of the state of applying a “nebulous standard” for taking away Gold’s license. De Saint Phalle noted that Gold never had a positive drug test after the consent order. Gold underwent hair testing in January 2017 that showed he hadn’t ingested any controlled substances for up to 90 days before the testing, de Saint Phalle wrote. Catie Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Hospital Sisters Health System, said Gold no longer is on the medical staff of St. Mary’s Hospital or HSHS St. John’s Hospital, where Gold also had worked in the past. She wouldn’t comment on any details of Gold’s alleged theft of drugs from St. Mary’s, including questions from The State Journal-Register about whether any patients were put in danger by Gold’s alleged abuse of drugs. “It is the policy of all HSHS hospitals to not comment on personnel matters,” she said. “All physicians’ medical staff files are privileged and confidential.” Gold couldn’t be reached for comment last week. De Saint Phalle didn’t return a phone call Friday. Michael Leathers, a spokesman for Memorial Health System, which operates Passavant, said Gold provided anesthesia and pain-management services at Passavant until Dec. 22 and was employed by AEF Management while providing services at Passavant. Leathers wouldn’t comment on Gold’s alleged conduct involving urine samples or elaborate further. — Contact Dean Olsen: dean.olsen@sj-r.com, twitter.com/DeanOlsenSJR. ***** Health-care professionals from Springfield area disciplined By Dean Olsen and John Reynolds, Staff Writers Here's a summary of disciplines issued by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation against the licenses of Springfield-area health-care professionals since late 2015. * D. Gordon Allan, a doctor from Springfield, was reprimanded in October 2016 for performing a right-knee surgical procedure on the wrong knee. The plan, and consent from the patient, called for a left-knee arthroscopy, according to documents from the state. Allan, a surgeon at Orthopedic Center of Illinois, agreed in a “consent order” with the state to settle the matter without admitting or denying any allegations. A reprimand issued against a physician license doesn’t stop the doctor from practicing. The consent order said the department received a mandated report of a settlement of a malpractice claim in July 2016 that set in motion the state’s investigation of that claim. There was a $70,000 settlement of a malpractice claim against Allan in June 2016, according to the department’s physician profile database. The database doesn’t specify details surrounding the settlement. Allan was unavailable for comment, and an OCI spokeswoman wouldn't comment. * Crystal Bell, a pharmacist from Pawnee, was placed on probation for six months in late 2015 after her Missouri license was suspended and placed on probation for four years in March 2011 for filling unauthorized controlled substance subscriptions. * The license of Mary Ann Corrigan, a registered nurse from Springfield, was placed in “refuse to renew” status in 2016 after her Texas nursing license was disciplined for failing to report a patient’s declining condition to her supervisor before she was fired in that state. * Amelia Crane, a licensed practical nurse from Springfield, was reprimanded in 2016 for having been found guilty of misdemeanor retail theft in February 2015. * Bryanna Davis, a licensed practical nurse from Hillsboro, was placed on probation for at least two years in late 2015 for testing positive for marijuana during pre-employment screening in April 2015. * The license of Katrina Funk, a pharmacy technician from Springfield, was revoked in late 2015 after she tested positive for cocaine and marijuana on a pre-employment screening. * Vicki Hefley, a licensed practical nurse from Hillsboro, was reprimanded in 2016 after turning in incomplete or fraudulent documentation based on her interactions with a home-care patient. * Shannon Ilsley, a registered nurse from Springfield, was suspended for at least 12 months in 2016 after violating a “care, counseling and treatment” agreement when she relapsed on alcohol. * The license of Maria Kenny, a pharmacist from Springfield, was placed in “refuse to renew” status in 2016 after she delayed the transfer of patient prescriptions in a timely manner, failed to complete the required change of “pharmacist-in-charge” paperwork and failed to complete an inventory as departing pharmacist-in-charge at a Wal-Mart pharmacy. * Gregg Laws, a doctor from Carlinville, was reprimanded and fined $500 in 2016 for failure to diagnose a subarachnoid hemorrhage in a hospital emergency room patient. * Amber McCray, a registered nurse from Chatham, was suspended for at least 12 months in 2016 for violating conditions of a consent order. Her license was put on probation in April 2015 after she tested positive for Methadone, according to state officials. * Ronda Mills, a licensed practical nurse from Springfield, voluntarily surrendered her license permanently in 2016 after failing to report being fired by Oak Terrace nursing home. She was fired after admitting she would test positive for marijuana and opiates, according to state officials. Mills’ license previously was suspended for a minimum of six months after testing positive in November 2014 for marijuana and cocaine during a pre-employment screening for a LPN position at Heritage Health in Springfield. * Clayton Parks, a doctor from Springfield, was issued a temporary medical permit with a reprimand in late 2016. The reprimand, according to documents from the state, was based on his Illinois pharmacy technician license being suspended in 2011 for diversion of controlled substances for personal use. Disciplinary action also was taken by the Iowa Board of Medicine against Parks’ Iowa resident physician license based on the 2011 discipline in Illinois. * Bradley Restivo, a doctor from Springfield, was issued a temporary medical license with a reprimand in 2016 after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in 2013. As part of the reprimand, state officials required him to take and pass all five topic areas in the “ethics and boundaries post-licensure essay examination.” * Tamera Richards, a licensed practical nurse from Springfield, was suspended for at least six months in 2016 for pleading guilty to retail theft in 2015 in Sangamon County. * Sarah Sosinski, a licensed practical nurse from Springfield, was suspended for at least two years in 2016 after she used the personal checking account of a patient at Villa Health Care West in Sherman to pay her personal bills, was convicted of a felony and fired by her employer. Documents from the state indicated Sosinski used the patient’s checking account to pay about $350 in Comcast bills and a $372 car loan payment, all in summer 2014. Sosinski pleaded guilty to felony theft in 2015 in connection with the conduct, then failed to report the conviction to the state, according to the documents. She was fired by Villa Health Care in August 2014 in connection with the incident, according to state documents. * Vicki Warrick, a registered nurse from Springfield, was reprimanded in late 2015 and ordered to complete coursework after the state was notified that in January 2013, while employed at the Charleston Transitional Facility in Champaign, she waited to send a patient to a clinic appointment instead of a hospital when the patient showed signs of a worsening sore that ultimately required surgery. * Heaven Willhite, a pharmacy technician from Springfield, was suspended for 90 days in late 2015, and put on probation for at least two years, for being fired by her pharmacy employer after she stole controlled substances. * Cynthia Woods, a registered nurse from Taylorville, was placed on probation for two years in 2016 after she was fired for removal of controlled substances without a written physician’s order and for failure to report the termination to the state.  — Contact Dean Olsen at dean.olsen@sj-r.com, 788-1543, twitter.com/DeanOlsenSJR.

This subset saw close to 5% year over year growth, compared to the rest of the carbonated beverage industry, which dropped 0.85%. You might expect to detect the hints of lavender, juniper or hibiscus in bath soap or potpourri, but not in your soft drink. Quotes in the article PepsiCo Inc PEP ▲ 117.91 +0.38 +0.32% Jones Soda Co JSDA ▲ 0.5250 +0.0250 +5.00% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 78.13 -0.18 -0.23% Dollar General Corp DG ▼ 72.32 -0.15 -0.21% But it's unique formulations that are at the heart of the growing segment of "craft soda," fizzy concoctions that are starting to make an impact in the $52.5 billion U.S. soft drink market. With traditional colas and other soft drinks under attack by nutritionists, craft soft drinks -- also known as artisanal, specialty or small-batch soda --  are capturing share by hyping premium and natural ingredients, creative flavors, limited runs, unusual packaging or their local roots. Smaller bottlers are borrowing a page from craft beer brewers, which grew from grassroots to collectively become a major factor in an industry dominated by giants like Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller and helped spark the brew-pub movement that has revitalized the bar business. When it comes to craft sodas, Coca-Cola and Pepsico have not only taken notice, they have created their own portfolios to compete right along with the smaller players. Craft-soda volume grew 5% in 2016 to 88.8 million gallons compared to the year before at a time when the rest of the carbonated beverage industry was down 0.85%, in 2016, according to the Beverage Marketing, a consulting and research company. Craft soda reached $541 million wholesale in 2016, up from $427.7 million in 2011. Adding to the froth: Craft soft drinks attract affluent Millennials who don't want to be seen as following the crowd with traditional soft drinks. "When you pick up a craft soda, you're saying something about yourself. You identify with the qualities of that beverage. If you pick up a craft soda or beer, you're saying, 'I’m looking for something better, more natural, more conscious of the environment," said Michael Bellas, chairman of the Beverage Marketing. "This has some legs. It has some good growth ahead of it. This is where the consumer is." Some of the better-known craft brands are publicly traded, like Seattle-based Jones Soda and Los Angeles-based Reed's to small-batch producers like Brooklyn Soda Works in New York, Dry Sparkling in Seattle, Cool Mountain Beverages in suburban Chicago, Real Sugar Soda in the Dallas area and Cannonborough Beverage in Charleston, S.C. Even the industry giants are joining in; Coca-Cola and Pepsi both have craft soda lines in their beverage portfolios. Many craft brewers started in specialty stores, retailers that focus on more healthy or upscale offerings. From there, they are moving into the mainstream. While their sales numbers don't threaten Coke or Pepsi, they're redefining the market. "There’s a large trend for natural wellness and there's a trend of gourmet food. This is the place the rubber hits the road," said Chris Reed, founder of Reed’s. "Every industry I know has a premium category from hotels to ice cream to cars. Soda didn’t have it. It made sense." But it isn't all sugar and spice for craft soda makers. Earlier this month, Reed's reported that it lost $2 million in the first quarter, up from a loss of $1.6 million a year ago. Its interim CEO, Stefan Freeman, told investors that the entire business is being evaluated to get back to profitability. LIkewise, Jones Soda said it lost $197,000 in the first quarter, compared to a profit of $49,000 last year due to issues involving shipments to 7-Eleven, one of its big customers. With that top-shelf aura comes a higher price. Craft sodas can cost three times as much as a traditional one and they often are in four packs, rather than six- or 12-packs. For instance, a four-pack of 12-ounce glass bottles of Dry Sparkling, a juniper-flavored soda, costs $5.99, for example, and contain less soda than a regular carbonated beverage. Criticism about cost doesn't really bubble to the top of the discussion, because these drinks are more of a special treat to be savored rather than a mainstream soda that's downed by the quart to wash down dinner. "We drink so many carbonated beverages in the U.S. I really want to create an elevated experience with unique flavors," explained founder Sharelle Klaus. "I came up with lavender, kumquat, rhubarb. I wanted make those flavors shine, so I didn’t use a lot of sugar,"  The Seattle-based company sold more than 10 million units last year and now is on some CVS shelves, she added. Pepsi got into the game in 2014 with brands like Caleb's Kola, named after the company's Pepsi-Cola creator Caleb Bradham, adding Stubborn in 2015 and 1893, a reference to the year the business was founded, last year. "We start with a consumers focus, looking at the trends and primarily the millennial generation is looking for new taste experiences," said Chad Stubbs, a Pepsico vice president of marketing. "We thought it was more limited than it was, because it's working all the way from smaller places to Walmart, Dollar General and our other retail partners." Coca-Cola's foray into the segment came in 2015 via its purchase of Monster Beverage's portfolio, which included the craft soda brands Hansen’s and Blue Sky. The following year, when they debuted their new taglines, “This is What Original Tastes Like" and “Rooted in Real," the company said, "“The crafted and specialty beverage category is a fast-changing, dynamic category. We see great opportunities for growth in this emerging part of the beverage business."  Coca-Cola declined to comment. Joey Lifschitz first discovered craft soda at a restaurant in the hip Williamsburg section of Brooklyn about two years ago and dived right into the colorful world of atypical flavors and what he believes to be taste-enhancing glass bottles. The 42-year-old New York commercial real estate appraiser drinks about 10 a month at a cost of approximately $40. "I love soda, for better for worse," he said, citing pineapple and hibiscus-cinnamon-clove among his favorites. "The whole idea of craft soda is keeping it small and quality... When I go out, I try to look for craft sodas over Dr. Brown's (an established soft drin brand) or a Coke, if it's available. If I'm at a store or bodega and need a drink, I look to see if they have craft sodas."

The mother of the children told authorities that she had found them unresponsive after discovering they had left the room where she had left them playing. “The question is, can a 2-year-old open a car door and a 2-year-old and a 1-year-old climb inside and lock it,” Parker County Sheriff’s Capt. Mark Arnett told CNN in an interview. “In the course of the investigation, if charges are warranted, I’m sure the district attorney’s office will bring them.” Police were alerted to the scene of the incident Friday (May 26) in a subdivision near Lake Weatherford (west of Fort Worth, Texas) around 4 p.m., according to USA Today. The mother told authorities that the children “took off.” Sheriff’s Capt. Arnett told CNN that, according to the mother, she had last seen the children playing in a back room of their home. When she realized they were no longer in the room, she immediately searched the home. After the house search proved fruitless, the mother began looking outside for her children, where she eventually found them locked inside the family car. The mother told police that the car doors were locked when she first realized her children were in the car. She broke one of the windows to gain access and found that both children were unresponsive. The temperature in the area climbed to 96 degrees by that afternoon. Arnett said that the mother claimed to have found one of the children with her cell phone and car keys. He said the investigation into the hot car deaths was a joint effort by the Parker County Sheriff’s Office and the Texas Rangers. The Texas Rangers are investigating the deaths of two children who died, according to their mother, when they locked themselves inside the family vehicle. [Image by Steve Adamson/Shutterstock] The Tarrant County medical examiner’s website, which handled the examination of the bodies, identified the victims as Juliet and Cavanaugh Ramirez. The little girl, the oldest of the two, celebrated her second birthday in February. “This case is in the early stages of the investigation,” Parker County Sheriff Larry Fowler said in a news release. “Any comment regarding this case at this time would be an assumption until all of the facts are gathered.” The Texas hot car deaths occurred just a day after a woman was arrested in Riverdale, Utah, when she allegedly locked her two young children in the trunk of her car while she shopped at Walmart. According to Deseret News, Riverdale Police were alerted to the Riverdale Walmart after receiving a call from a witness who claimed to see a woman lock two children in a car before leaving to go inside and shop. Riverdale Police Lt. Casey Warren said that the two children, ages 2 and 5, started making noise and causing the car to shake. “Several good Samaritans observed this,” he said, “and came to the aid of the children.” The observers were then able to instruct the 5-year-old, a girl, to pull an emergency latch located inside the trunk to allow both children to escape the confines of the trunk. Lt. Warren said Child and Family Services was contacted afterward, and the children were then handed over to a responsible party. Police interviewed the mother upon her return to the car. Tori Lee Castillo, 39, was arrested and booked into the Weber County jail for child abuse, Warren said. Riverdale, which is south of Ogden, Utah, experienced temperatures in the mid-80s on Thursday. More than three dozen children die annually because they are left unattended in a hot car. [Image by Africa Studio/Shutterstock] According to KidsAndCars.org, 37 children die on average annually as victims, most as a result of parents unknowingly leaving a child in the back seat of a vehicle, of what is often referred to as hot car death.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint CHICAGO – Kale has had quite a run. Less than a decade ago, the leafy green vegetable was used primarily for decoration on salad bars. Now kale, known for its health benefits, is so ubiquitous that even ­McDonald’s uses it in salads. Za’atar, a Middle Eastern spice blend, may not be as familiar to many Americans, but it plays a starring role in one of the salads that Starbucks recently rolled out in Chicago as part of its new lunch menu. As Americans increasingly demand exotic flavors, spices like za’atar are expected to become more common on menus. Identifying up-and-coming food trends is equal parts art and science, and it’s a process that some in the food industry pay a lot of attention to. “The Cronut went from nothing to Time magazine in no time; others peak and fall off,” said Stacie Sopinka, vice president of innovation and product development at US Foods, a Rosemont, Ill.-based food distributor. Food trends are influenced by a wide range of factors, from fashion and pop culture to health fads. They are sometimes created by chefs, often in the world of fine dining, and then mimicked and re-purposed by other restaurateurs. Sometimes, it’s a consultant or distributor working with a big brand to develop a product that fills menu holes for a food company. Menu trends Datassential, one of several companies that track trends, calls that pattern the “menu adoption cycle.” Trends in the inception phase often start in fine-dining establishments and independent ethnic restaurants or markets, where the food item is considered unique in the way it’s prepared, presented and tastes. Piri piri sauce, a spicy and tangy topping from Portugal, and togarashi, a Japanese spice blend, are in that phase now. Both meet consumers’ growing demand for exotic spices, according to ­Datassential. The adoption phase is when mainstream restaurants catch on to the trend. Early adopters tend to be gastropubs, fast-casual and independent sit-down restaurants, and specialty or gourmet food stores. A restaurant like Rick Bayless’ Xoco would jump on the bandwagon at this point, Datassential’s Mike Kostyo said, but so would Panera, Whole Foods, and even the Cheesecake ­Factory. In the proliferation phase, trends hit the mainstream and often are adjusted to have broad appeal. This means the up-and-coming ingredient is incorporated into burgers, pasta dishes and other menu items mainstream that America is likely to consume. ­Sriracha aioli, a spread that lowers the spice intensity of the Thai pepper sauce, is in the proliferation phase now. It’s often served on sandwiches and with French fries. In the final phase, a food trend can be seen across the industry. Brands like Denny’s and Wal-Mart catch on, but so do convenience stores, schools and office cafeterias. Food trends Not all trends follow this common cycle. In fact, only about 30 to 40 percent of foods or ingredients in the inception phase ever continue on, according to Datassential. Consider bone marrow, a popular sight at some high-end restaurants, but not something that would ever make its way to a fast-food chain. US Foods, which supplies restaurants with everything from produce to prepared meat, helps restaurants get on board with the latest food trends, with a special emphasis on the desires of millennials, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. In 2011, the company rebranded, conducted extensive research and began positioning itself to better provide trendy ingredients to independent restaurants. That same year, it launched its own branded line of products, Sopinka said. The items US Foods developed have to fill a lot of holes. The products have to be able to be used in multiple ways, be healthy but still flavorful, and in some cases, be fully cooked so that restaurants can save labor hours — a critical expense. The company’s offerings have evolved to include products ranging from riced cauliflower, which can be used in gluten-free pizza crust and sides and salads, to chicken shawarma that is fully cooked and ready to heat and serve. “We don’t need to be first. For us, it’s a matter of figuring out which ones are going to stick,” Sopinka said. Kerry Ingredients and Flavours is also a major player in menu consultation and the translation of trends. When a major quick-service chain like McDonald’s wants to develop a new burger, Kerry, which has its North American headquarters in Beloit, Wis., pulls all the burger concepts developed industrywide over the last several years and examines everything from buns to toppings, looping in current trends, said Elissa Rempfer, Kerry’s food service marketing research and insights manager. The resulting tests usually show up in fast-food restaurants as limited-time offers. Because chains have huge footprints and need to appeal to a wide range of people, they aren’t often early adopters of trends. To help chains get in the game, companies like Kerry often take a trend, like smoke flavoring, and mix it with something familiar, like mocha or vanilla, Rempfer said. While an independent restaurant might try something bold like smoked ice cream, chains tend to opt for a more subdued interpretation. For example, Starbucks got in on the smoke trend with a Smoked Butterscotch Latte. When trying to hook younger diners, many brands believe visual appeal tops all. Food, more than ever, has to be camera — or smartphone — ready.

Get Out, the horror film that takes a hard look at race in today's society, spawned the #GetOutChallenge, which involved running full speed at the camera before darting off to the right ala Walter's infamous moonlit sprint in the film. Everyone from Steph Curry to the cast of Black Panther got in on the fun, but surprisingly, the creator of the film that spawned said meme hadn't gotten into it...until now. Visiting The Tonight Show to promote the home release of Get Out, Peele decided to do his best #GetOutChallenge sprint as his entrance onto the set. Here's what it looked like. "That's the first time I've done the #GetOutChallenge," Peele said. "I'm so glad I didn't wipe out." Their conversation quickly dives into Peele's recent marriage and word of him having a child on the way, but they also remember the time ?uestlove choked on stage. Peele also spoke about the show he's working on with Tracy Morgan, and relays a story of Morgan choking on a Ding Dong during a phone conversation. Imitating Morgan, Peele remembers their conversation: "Survived Wal-mart truck, killed by Ding Dong." Further into his visit, Peele describes Get Out as a "social thriller," saying it's a movie that is "creepy, but humanity is the creepiest part of it." He also talks about Daniel Kaluuya (the star of Get Out) and his ability to cry on demand. If you haven't seen Get Out (or taken the #GetOutChallenge), spend some time this weekend taking this film in.

Washington Post photo by Sarah L. Voisin.   Thomas Heath The Washington Post     Ephi Zlotnitsky landed in Washington as a 22-year-old immigrant from Israel on a July Saturday in 1989. The next day, the former Israel paratrooper, who barely spoke English, walked into a local kosher deli and got a job. As he recalls it: "The owner said, 'I don't have a job for you.' I said, 'I'm not leaving.' He asked me, what can I do?" "Whatever you want," Zlotnitsky replied. "Wash dishes. Clean floors." He did all that -- and also made a mean Israeli salad. Fast forward 28 years. The peripatetic Zlotnitsky, now 50, has started several companies, including a real estate company and a Maryland-based software firm. But it's his foray into airline travel that got my attention. Zlotnitsky is not only an example of the rich contributions that immigrants bring to America. His is also a tale of the thankless frustrations that go with building a business. And what with all the horror stories about fights, riots, even scorpions, on the airlines recently, I thought Zlotnitsky's little project to bring peaceful sleep to airline travelers was timely. The entrepreneur has helped invent an airplane pillow with the kitschy name of JetComfy. JetComfy reminds me of those wacky late-night ads hawking offbeat contraptions like the Veg-O-Matic, Pocket Fisherman and Inside the Shell Egg Scrambler. Like entrepreneur and TV marketer Ron Popeil, Zlotnitsky is always thinking of the next thing. People like Zlotnitsky impress me. I wish I had 2 percent of his energy and resourcefulness. After talking with him for an hour, I called the businessman who recommended him to me and asked, 'Is this guy for real?'" He assured me he was. "I wasn't the brightest guy," said Zlotnitsky, who was born and raised 20 minutes north of Tel Aviv. "But I've always been this guy who was thinking outside the box. I don't believe in 'no.' " This anecdote is from when he was a teenager: "We were driving in a car at night in the middle of nowhere in Israel and a belt broke in our car. We couldn't see anything. "The driver looks at me and said, 'We are stuck here.' I said 'I am breaking the mirror.' I told him to turn on the headlights and shine from one mirror to another. We managed to fix the belt and drove back home. From that day, people came to me to fix stuff." His latest mission is fixing sleep problems for travelers. The airspace for plane pillows is as crowded as the skies. The horseshoe pillow has been around for decades. A former Virgin Atlantic flight attendant, a few years back, invented a J-shaped pillow. "Airlines are cramming you in and there is less space and less everything," he said. "At least you want to sleep normal." Zlotnitsky and a business partner have invested three years and $350,000 to create the JetComfy. The pillow is the size of a purse and sells for $39.99. About 10,000 units have been sold since it went on sale in January. Zlotnitsky said he has plans to open the first JetComfy comfort sales center in Dulles International Airport in August and hopes to expand to 25 locations at larger airports in a year. The pillow is available now on Amazon Prime and at Luggage Plus stores and will be offered online by Walmart later this month. It weighs less than a pound and measures 9.5-by-5.5 inches. It looks nothing like a pillow -- more like a foam headrest attached to a foot-long pole supported by the arm of your seat. Zlotnitsky is betting that, among the more than 3 billion people who fly every year, there is enough of a market for him to sell millions of JetComfys. "We plan to sell over 350,000 units by mid-2018 in the U.S. alone," he said. "We are working to start distribution is Europe, China, Australia and the Middle East." After leaving the Israeli Defense Forces, Zlotnitsky started a plastering company. It failed, leaving him $250,000 in debt. "I didn't know what I was doing," he said. "I took loans. I bought machinery. All kinds of crazy stuff." He eventually paid off the bank loans. Zlotnitsky had better luck in the United States. He and his brother, Chanan, grew a small newspaper distribution route into the region's largest news delivery businesses, known as News One. They sold it to Hudson News in 2008, before print's steepest decline and in time to make some money off the sale. They invested in iControl. The $150 million company's technology aids communications between retailers and suppliers, and Zlotnitsky owns 22 percent of it. Goldman Sachs owns a chunk, too. In between, he has invested in real estate that earned enough money to subsidize iControl, JetComfy and a few other endeavors. "I don't know what I'm worth," he said. "I hope I'm worth a lot." JetComfy all started on a diving trip with his wife to Bora Bora in 2014. As they were exiting the Air Tahiti jet, he heard a passenger named David Brecht, a battery engineer from San Diego, call it the "worst flight ever." At the hotel bar later, the two decided to team up to bring restful sleep to those who can't afford to buy spacious first-class seats. Zlotnitsky's idea was to re-create the comfort of your chin resting in the cup of your hand with your elbow resting on the desk or table. "That's the natural position," he said. "You tell somebody to rest their head, and that's what they are going to do." They created mock-ups out of cardboard. They drew designs on toilet paper. They bought "selfie sticks" for the pillow stand. They Skyped between Maryland and San Diego. They bought a used 3-D printer for $2,300. They bought used airline seats on eBay to test their designs. They bought foam, aluminum, plastic. They pulled all-nighters. "Dave is the geek that can take my ideas and make it happen. I am the guy taking it to the business. We spent almost two years building this crazy thing." They tried out several names: EZ Rest (using Zlotnitsky's initials); EasyComfy. Their wives came up with JetComfy. The low point came on a factory-hunting trip to China in March 2016. Zlotnitsky arrived in Shenzhen, an industrial city of 12 million, in the middle of the night, meandering for three hours in a cab with a driver who did not understand English. " 'That's it,' I thought," Zlotnitsky said. "I'm not coming back from this one. It was like a movie." But he did come back after finding a small factory that could build most of the parts for his pillow. By last summer, they had nine test pillows that they asked friends and family to try. They sent samples to the Hallmark Channel and media outlets. They got a write-up on the HuffPost's website and a profile by a San Diego television station. Zlotnitsky sent me a free sample. My wife, Polly, took it with her on a trip overseas last week to serve as my guinea pig. "JetComfy is a plus," she reported back from Europe. "Not nirvana, but a definite improvement. It has earned a return ticket."

She was in her 50s, living alone, paycheck to paycheck, overweight, struggling to manage her diabetes, and had recently lost a breast and suffered debilitating chemotherapy. Doctors insisted she could no longer work at the shoe factory where she’d spent decades on the line. But Aunt Mary held firm. She didn’t want charity, to be on the dole. She would figure something out. Americans pride ourselves on bootstraps culture — work hard, earn your keep, pull yourself up — and President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for 2018 reflects those principles. There are $193 billion in proposed cuts to food stamps (known now as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP). More than 40 million Americans depend on these benefits to feed their families and, contrary to common belief, 80 percent of those on SNAP have jobs. They are the working poor. The $9 billion in cuts to education include special needs, advanced placement and training for technical jobs. Tamara Hiler, a senior policy adviser for the think tank Third Way, called the president’s policy tone deaf as it hurts the core of his supporters: the poor, the rural and the working class. Cuts for farmers and agriculture over the next decade equal $50 billion. And then there’s health care. Kentuckians depend on Medicaid more than people in most states, so the president’s plan to slash Medicaid by $616 billion over the next 10 years (in addition to the $880 billion already proposed in the House Republicans’ health-care bill) would prove devastating to our most vulnerable citizens. And yet conservatives cheer the president’s plan. Aunt Mary was a proud American. It took us months to talk her into signing up for Medicaid. I’m convinced she would have held out longer, maybe forever, if my mother had not become terminally ill and guilted her into filling out the paperwork. “You’re my favorite sister,” my mother told her, “we were born 13 months apart and grew up sharing a bed. Do it for me. I won’t be able to die in peace knowing you’re not taken care of.” After my mother’s death, with Medicaid to pay for health care and medication, Aunt Mary lived another 12 years. A colorful character, she filled the mother-void in my life, but she also took what responsibility she could for her health. She managed her diabetes with diet and insulin and, after having a tumor removed from her heart, kept at the physical-therapy exercises on her own. She even lost some weight. When painful, diabetic neuropathy set in and she became wheelchair-bound, Aunt Mary signed up for Meals On Wheels. And though it took gargantuan effort, she continued to press her slacks, steam her blouses, do her hair and put on makeup every single morning, because, “if I’m getting a home-cooked meal, personally delivered, the least I can do is make myself presentable.” Aunt Mary was on the dole, but she knew the importance of appearances. Americans may have a bootstraps culture, but we can also be a cruel and judgmental lot, quick to righteousness. To the poor or addicted, we want to scream: “Clean up your act. Get a job.” To minority groups and immigrants: “Keep your head down and your mouth shut. Learn English. This is our country. If you don’t like it, get out.” To the obese mother in line at Walmart, with her full cart of food and her SNAP card: “Why do I have to pay when I work hard and you’re the lazy one, the one who made the wrong choices?” To the sick, as Rep. Mo Brooks from Alabama recently put it, our goal is not to provide health care or a safety net, but to reduce insurance “costs to those people who lead good lives.” So much for Matthew 25: 35-36: “I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me.” The president and his cabinet, and the majority of their supporters, believe massive cuts in social welfare programs, health care and education are necessary. A long overdue pulling-up of our collective American bootstraps. Hallelujah! they say. But at what cost? Am I the only one with an Aunt Mary?

The grungy hole-in-the-wall that had been the theater's home for 36 years "smells like sawdust and sweat and teenagers and Stephanie," she said, referring to tireless founder Stephanie Morrison Hrbek. Few artistic institutions in Cleveland are so indelibly linked to one person. She is ingrained in the very molecules of the place. Two years after shepherding an ambitious move to a $7.3 million, state-of-the-art performance venue in the Gordon Square Arts District in 2015 - and nearly 40 years after directing and choreographing "Godspell," the theater's first production - Morrison Hrbek is stepping down as executive director. The idea is to free her from the day-to-day duties of running a company so she can focus on growing Near West's small endowment and make way for fresh talent, "an indefatigable human being," she says, adept at both raising funds and the consciousness of Near West's casts, crews and audiences. Stephanie Morrison Hrbek, executive director of Near West Theatre since 1978, in a curtain speech before a production of "Children of Eden" at the company's former home in a meeting hall owned by St. Patrick's Church in 2012. (Peggy Turbett/ The Plain Dealer) From its inception, the theater - co-founded with husband the Rev. George Hrbek and Father Robert Scullin - has strived to make the world a better place, one production at a time. "She uses the theater as a healing art in an urban environment," says Leo Serrano, a Near West alum and one of the stars of "Godspell" in 1978. "It's not art for art's sake, but art to empower neighborhood kids to find their own voice, to find confidence, to build teams, to trust each other, to support each other." He was 15 when he first saw her - a woman with a bright smile and shock of dark curls bounding across the parking lot of St. Patrick's Church, where he and his cousins were shooting hoops. "She was radiant - her energy came off her. But then her enthusiasm - you know how some people are so enthused that you become enthused?" That's how she convinced jocks to turn into musical theater geeks in a single afternoon. "I was like, 'Yeah, OK. We're cool, we're in.' There was no thinking about it. We didn't even know her!" Serrano, now a chief fundraiser for the Cleveland Municipal School District, is a member of the search committee tasked with filling the vacancy left by Morrison Hrbek. They're on the hunt for a managing director to partner with longtime artistic director Bob Navis Jr, the breakout star of the Ted Sikora film captured pounding the piano and bellowing "I want it to feel more Brechtian!" at skinny boys in Batman T-shirts. "We're looking for a managing director - not the new Stephanie," Navis Jr told the committee on Day 1. "That's never going to happen," he said. But the house that Stephanie built is sturdy and meant to last. So, too, is its social justice mission. Make no mistake - the cheerful, big blue box of a building on Detroit Avenue isn't just a theater. To the kids and parents and, in some cases, grandparents who have participated in its youth, teen and multigenerational shows, Near West is so much more, including a de facto social service agency. Morrison Hrbek and staff have heard it all: spousal abuse, addiction of all sorts, diagnoses of cancer and HIV, kids wrestling with gender and sexual identity, family discord. They don't just listen; they make connections to a vast array of helping institutions on the near West Side. "Stephanie knows all the leaders of those institutions - they're her friends!" says Navis Jr. She also knows the alums who walked the boards, hammered the nails and hung the lights, whether the production was two years or two decades ago. She runs into them all the time in the Ohio City neighborhood. "I go to the grocery store, and I see somebody who's a cashier who was involved in the 1990s," says Morrison Hrbek. "And then I go to the hospital, and there's Danielle Edelman waiting on my husband - she was in 'Seasons of Love' in 1997." How about Patrick Ciamacco, artistic director of Blank Canvas Theatre? " 'South Pacific,' 1996," she says, without hesitation. "Honey, I'm the walking encyclopedia of institutional knowledge." Ciamacco was in a high school math class when his friend passed him a note. His mom had seen an ad in The Plain Dealer about auditions at Near West. Cast as "a chubby little Seabee," says Ciamacco, he fell head over heels for the place, as so many do. The kid from suburban Brunswick, Ohio was introduced to the openly gay Navis Jr, who became his mentor, and black and Latino cast mates, a diverse group of friends Ciamaco says he'd never have met in growing up in his hometown. As the company's choreographer, "Stephanie was at every rehearsal," he says. "And she looked everyone in the eye. She would talk to everyone - it didn't matter if you were the lead or in the ensemble or a crew member, she cared about your experience." Morrison Hrbek was never an aloof administrator. "She's hands-on," says Ciamacco. Navis Jr concurs. "She will sweep gum off the floor, if that's what needs to be done. She's always been that person and she still is that person." Ciamacco directed "Aladdin, Jr.," his first solo show, in 2006. In 2011, he took the lessons he learned from Morrison Hrbek and founded Blank Canvas, borrowing lights and chairs and scrap for risers. "Most of our audience is sitting on wood that was used in a Near West Theatre production," he says. "Without Near West and Stephanie, there would be no Blank Canvas." He thinks there might not be a Patrick either, at least not the man he is today. He was Mr. Bumble in "Oliver" in 1998 as his father, a football coach who took a while to warm up to the whole drama thing, was dying of cancer. Though he'd dropped out of the show because of his dad's illness, his parents encouraged him to rejoin the cast. Somehow, they knew it was exactly what their son needed. Toward the end, Ciamacco drove back to the theater in a blur. He walked into rehearsal weeping. He remembers the feeling of arms around him and of being surrounded by love. His father died soon after; the run of "Oliver" was dedicated to the memory of his dad. "I don't think I would have survived if it wasn't for Stephanie and Bob and everyone at the theater," he says. Cyle Black in the Near West Theatre production of "Assassins," in 2016. ( Near West Theatre)                                                                                  Cyle Black could easily wonder the same thing. He was 19 when he appeared in the Near West production of Stephen Sondheim's "Assassins" in 2016, arriving at rehearsals smelling like the burritos he made at an East Side Chipotle. It was weird, he says, but even though he had to take two busses and a train to get there, "Near West felt more like home than any other home I'd ever been in." Still, after the final cast party, he dropped out of sight when his hard-knock life got exponentially worse. He came out to his Jamaican mother at 12; she responded, he says, by putting him out. He floated through the foster care system, until he aged out at 18. He spent his nights at a cousin's in South Euclid, then couch-surfing with friends, then sleeping anywhere he could, even, he says, at a Walmart. One day, he found himself in Gordon Square. He wasn't thinking about Near West, just around the corner, or the people he'd met there, when he posted a message on Facebook yearning for some stability. The calls started almost at once. From associate artistic director Kelcie Dugger, who came to the theater at 12 in 2002 with her twin Monique, and Morrison Hrbek. He couldn't quite believe they really wanted to help. So many people had made similar promises over the years to earn "karma points" but never delivered. He decided to test them and wandered over to the theater, found Bob Navis and asked if he could work crew for the new production of "Mary Poppins." "No," Bob answered.  He knew it. Do-gooders were about to disappoint him again. "You're not doing crew," Navis Jr told him, seeming to rub the salt in. "You're going be in this show. Rehearsal starts in 15 minutes. Be ready and stretched.' "It got intense from there," says Black. Today, he's living near the theater with another alum who got bit by the Near West bug about 10 years ago working concessions. Black is earning money working on the construction of a bed and breakfast his benefactor plans to open soon. Near West just closed "Mary Poppins," where Black hoofed so hard in "Step in Time," the dance of the Chimney Sweeps, he had to run backstage and take a few puffs of his inhaler so he could make it through the rest of the show. It was an auspicious title. He thinks the house that Stephanie built might be imbued with a touch of Mary Poppins' magic. How else could his life have been so transformed? But that's the story of Near West Theatre, told again and again, for almost 40 years. There is no better legacy.

NEW YORK >> The U.S. State Department expects 20.5 million applications for new and renewed passports this year, and that will be a record number. The busy year is no surprise. Adult U.S. passports must be renewed every 10 years, and it was 10 years ago that a new law went into effect requiring passports for Americans traveling to Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean. That new law resulted in a surge of passport requests in 2007, along with extraordinary delays that stretched into months for some individuals. This year the State Department says it is beating promised turnaround times of six to eight weeks for processing passports. “In 2007 it was not a good situation,” Brenda Sprague, deputy assistant secretary for passport services, said. “We did a lot of post-mortem discussions and have spent 10 years getting ready for this and addressing all the challenges we expected to come. We are extremely busy, but I am pleased to say that we are so far, knock wood, staying well ahead of ­­­­ the curve.” Tips from Sprague for avoiding passport hassles: >> Make sure your photos meet the requirements as described at travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/­passports/photos. Among other things: You can’t wear glasses or a hat in a passport photo, you must look directly at the camera, the photo must be shot against a light background and your expression should be neutral, though a smile is OK. Sprague said CVS, Walmart and other purveyors of passport photos have worked with the State Department to make sure their passport photos meet standards. >> Keep an eye on the expiration date on your passport. Many countries require that your passport be valid for six months after you cross their border, so you might need to renew earlier than you think. >> Check the travel.state.gov website for rules on passports for minors. Their passports must be renewed every five years, and both parents must appear when the application is submitted, among other detailed requirements.

Peek became the facility’s director of operations in March. Comments aAFont Size BATESVILLE  Batesville Help and Hope, an agency that provides food and clothing to those in need in Independence County, serves around 2,000 people per month. John Peek has been a volunteer at the agency for over a year and became director of operations in March. Peek said giving back to the community is his favorite part of the job. “You hear stories about the hardships people have faced, and that pulls at your heartstrings and reaffirms the work you’re doing,” he said. Batesville Help and Hope operates a food pantry and a clothing center, with the help of volunteers. Peek said the food pantry is the most significant part of the operation. Eligible people can come in and pick up a box of food once a month, and the size of the box correlates with the size of the family, he said. Peek said eligible patrons are people who meet federal poverty guidelines and live in Independence County. People requesting assistance are asked to provide documentation to verify their residence and income levels, along with photo identification. Peek said the agency also provides emergency boxes of food for people with immediate needs, such as families who have experienced a house fire. A clothing center is also operated by the agency, and people are provided clothing cards that allow them to get a certain number of items each month. “Sometimes people will donate toys and books to us. We have a children’s book section and an adult book section. There’s an honor system in place, and people are able to take books out for a month and return them at their leisure,” Peek said. Peek also mentioned that the agency added a classroom in January and plans to have workshops available regularly on-site by the end of the year. “We’re looking for local agencies or institutions that would like to offer informational sessions here,” he said. The impact of the agency on the community is significant, and Batesville Help and Hope operates one of the larger food pantries in the state, he said. He said the agency receives food donations from Walmart, Kroger, the United States Department of Agriculture and local businesses, along with significant funding from the United Way. “A third of the food we pass out is purchased through the food bank in Little Rock at a discount,” Peek said. Local churches also contribute to the food pantry and host fundraisers, he said. Peek said he expects the agency to do more structured fundraising within the next few months. “We’re always in need of volunteers,” Peek said. “People who will give their time, treasure or talents are appreciated.” Volunteers can help during the day or in the evening hours. Nona Floyd, a desk volunteer at Batesville Help and Hope, has worked with the agency since 1998. Aside from working at the desk and registering people into the system, Floyd has spent time working in the clothing department. Floyd said she began working at the agency after a friend asked her to work in her place while she had surgery. Floyd never left the agency and said she enjoys helping people. She said the agency has a tremendous impact on the community, especially the elderly and handicapped. “We’re able to provide people with good nutritious food and clothing,” she said. Floyd said she’s glad the agency is able to help people with temporary needs as well. “Sometimes people who’ve been laid off at work just need us for a month or two,” Floyd said. It’s important to make people feel welcome and free of judgment, she said. “The most important part of my job is treating people with dignity and not making them feel like they’ve failed in some way because they have to come here,” Floyd said. “We believe in compassion for everyone,” she added. “When people are in need, I’m glad we can help them.” Floyd said it’s impressive that she lives in a community where people care about others and are willing to volunteer time and effort to make life easier for those around them. She said everybody at the agency is a volunteer. “We work with a lot of good people,” Floyd said. “Many of us have worked or lived here for extended periods of time,” Peek said, “and we like to give back to the community. That’s a key motivating factor.” Staff writer Kayla Baugh can be reached at (501) 244-4307 or kbaugh@arkansasonline.com. Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More News You know you’re a grandmother when ...

Did the driver spend as much time learning to drive that 40-ton big rig as your plumber spent learning to work under your kitchen sink? Probably not. And the Trump administration doesn’t seem to think that’s a problem. The Department of Transportation is again delaying regulations setting basic training requirements for people who drive large trucks or busses, rules that Congress has been asking for since 1991. “Congress, safety groups and families of truck crash victims have beenbattling to get the U.S. Department of Transportation to act on a commercial driver’s license training rule for over two decades,” said Peter Kurdock of the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. The standards, which were published in December and have already been stalled twice by the Trump administration, include classroom instruction in driving, emergencies and planning trips. The most recent delay is until June 5. Fatal crashes involving large trucks or buses rose by 20% from 2009 to 2015.  On average, more than 4,000 people are killed each year, and nearly 100,000 injured in large truck crashes. The annual cost to society from crashes involving commercial motor vehicles is estimated to be over $110 billion. Training in skills such as trip planning might prevent accidents such as those in tiny Ponca, Ark., where truck drivers bound for a Wal-Mart distribution center have been using GPS that puts them on steep and winding rural highways. The published regulation was watered down to eliminate requiring a minimum amount of behind-the-wheel training. A draft required 30 hours of behind-the-wheel training, but that was removed. The regulation would have a grace period until February 2020 and would only apply to applicants who have not received their commercial driver’s license by Feb. 7, 2020. Firefighters, farmers and military drivers would be exempted from the regulation. The American Trucking Associations opposes a time-on-the-road requirement.  The trade group, which represents trucking companies, not drivers, spent about $1.8 million in federal lobbying last year. “We believe demonstrating proficiency is far more important than showing a number of hours behind the wheel,” said Sean McNally of American Trucking Associations. “Once you demonstrate proficiency, you should be able to take the state test, apply for a job and start earning a paycheck.” Safety organizations have asked that the final rule be reconsidered because it doesn’t include mandatory behind-the-wheel training. The organizations, which included the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the Truck Safety Coalition, pointed to state requirements for jobs such as being a plumber or a barber. Texas requires a journeyman plumber to have 8,000 hours of experience. Barbers licensed in Virginia must have 490 hours.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Nonprofit group sets goals for improvements in Pana Saturday May 27, 2017 at 7:00 PM May 27, 2017 at 7:48 PM Tamara Browning Staff Writer @tambrowningSJR PANA -- Former teacher Ruth Baldock hopes soon to show her daughter more visual evidence of the work the nonprofit Pana Pride has been doing to improve the town's image. “My daughter, who lives in St. Louis, she keeps saying, ‘Well, show me something, Mom,’ ” said Baldock, who moved to Pana in the 1970s for a teaching job. “She’s really glad we’re doing this, but she keeps saying, ‘I want to see something that looks different.’ ” Baldock, a member of Pana Pride’s beautification committee, could point to a new program, “Yard of the Month,” taking place May through October. It encourages residents to clean up, enhance or beautify their properties. Plus, there’s an upcoming streetscape project in which more than 60 trees (including Bradford Pears) will be planted in a three-block area of Locust Street. “The streetscape is very important right now in addition to the yards. ... We’ve done a lot of things, but they’re all going to start to show,” said Tom Dean, president of Pana Pride. Board member A.J. Wiss also recalled a number of completed projects such as painting Pana’s downtown curbs yellow, and the grand opening of a bike trail. Then there was the recent Dumpster Days. “There were 12 or 13 big dumpsters at the city garage, and we’ve had that program to where people bring their trash and dump them in for years,” said Wiss, a native of Pana. “This year, we decided that Pana Pride would go out and pick up for people that couldn’t bring their stuff in, and we loaded 4 1/2 dumpsters just on a Friday.” People assets Pana Pride became active in 2014. It became a nonprofit a year later. “There was a small group of 15 of us who had a desire to be a part of increasing the pride of the residents in Pana and being part of the future of where Pana was going,” said Dean, who came to town in 1988 and owns McCracken-Dean Funeral Home. Pana Pride’s treasurer, Paula Lebon, a Pana native, said the group “struggled for about a year,” implementing small projects like painting a building downtown and planting flowers. Pana Pride got more concrete direction after it began participation in October 2016 in the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs at Western Illinois University’s MAPPING the Future of Your Community program. A Pana Action Plan 2017 was developed that noted four high-priority goals (corresponding committees have been established for beautification, retail and dining, manufacturing and industry, and events), strategies, projects and action teams. After the conclusion of the program, a town meeting was held March 19 to share information and invite the community’s participation. Nearly 300 people attended. “When we did the rural mapping ... we talked about what the assets of the community are," said Dara Thompson, who was born and raised in Pana and is Pana Pride’s secretary. “Everyone talked about the people that are here, that that was one of our biggest assets. ... We’re trying to get everyone together and pool those talents and assets to make Pana a better place.” A ‘good place’ A goal highlighted through the mapping program is attracting new residents and visitors by beautifying Pana through well-maintained residential districts, attractive community entrances and a restored downtown with attractive streetscaping and design elements. Among strategies is to encourage refurbishment of buildings and facades. With that in mind, Pana Pride is exploring the possibility of acquisition and restoration of the old brick railroad freight house adjacent to Walmart. Used by the Illinois Central and New York Central lines, the freight house dates from the 1800s and is in disrepair. A goal is to restore the building for use as a tourism center or railroad museum. The group also is hoping that property south of the freight house that’s been used as a parking lot could be developed, perhaps partly as a park. “We’re trying to do things for people when they drive through town to say, ‘Hey, Pana is a good place to live,’ ” Dean said. “We’re only 35 miles from Decatur. We’re 40 miles from Springfield. We have great schools. We have a good hospital. In fact, our hospital is just getting ready to put on about a $12 million expansion. ... We have recreation. We have everything that you would want to have.” Dean added that Pana is a supportive community. “The people are so giving, and so you ought to come live with us,” he said. Thompson said Dean spoke eloquently at the town meeting about how the community could support Pana Pride. “He told the people that, ‘If you don’t ever want to come to a meeting or if you don’t want to be involved in any of the things that we do, if you just mowed your yard, if you just do something to beautify your property, then we would consider you a member of Pana Pride,’ ” Thompson said. Said Dean: “Just take pride where you’re at and what you own.” -- Contact Tamara Browning: tamara.browning@sj-r.com, 788-1534, twitter.com/tambrowningSJR. *** Want to participate?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why I Won't Go Near Brick-and-Mortar Apparel Stocks Right Now Full-price, mall-based, and department-store retailers got destroyed last week. They may look cheap now, but I'm not touching them; here's why. Billy Duberstein (Dubs82) May 27, 2017 at 4:23PM Last week, investors experienced a violent sell-off for many department-store apparel retailers after some companies posted earnings. Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Sears, and Ascena Retail Group all took a beating, down between 10% and 30% in just one week. The catalysts were earnings reports from several names, although not every company mentioned reported. Still, almost any retailer primarily selling full-priced apparel was sold off, as investors concluded that these companies are all in secular decline. And while many value vultures may be looking at these names right now, I'd stay away for several reasons. Image source: Getty Images. Looks can be deceiving A secular decline is dangerous, because it makes the stocks in question look cheap, with low price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, along with high dividend yields. But there is no telling how quick or severe the pain will be, as evidenced by continued same-store sales declines across the board. For instance, activist investor Starboard Value LP took a position in Macy's back in July of 2015, at around $65 per share. Its thesis was that Macy's owned real estate that by itself was worth more than its market capitalization. Starboard proposed selling off Macy's properties and leasing them back. Greenlight Capital, another prominent hedge fund run by David Einhorn, also took a position in 2016 at around $45 a share. The problem with this theory was that a) if Macy's stayed in these locations it would have to pay rents, and b) even if Macy's vacated, the locations were retail spaces that would have to be filled by someone else. Judging by the performance across the sector, it would difficult to find a dependable tenant when everyone was closing stores. In March, Starboard exited its position, eating a 60% loss. Greenlight exited in January for a smaller, yet still unpleasant, 30% loss. This is what happens when value investors mistake a turnaround for a secular decline: embarrassing losses. You might think that with Macy's trading at around $23.60 and the yield over 6%, the bottom is in. But as Clint Eastwood said in Dirty Harry: "Do you feel lucky?" Even good management can't do anything In 1988 Warren Buffett quipped: "With few exceptions, when a manager with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact." Returning to Macy's -- my punching bag for this article, although my argument could apply to all the other names as well -- new CEO Jeff Gennette seems to have an intelligent, well-thought-out, and appropriate strategy. The company reduced head count, is closing unprofitable stores, and is experimenting with new formats in women's shoes and jewelry. Macy's also opened up its own discounted format, Macy's Backstage, which will feature off-price merchandise, and it is expanding e-commerce. This seems prudent: People are buying fewer full-priced clothes, so the move to footwear and jewelry is wise. When they do buy clothes, they increasingly look for deals. This has given rise to off-price retailers such as TJX Companies' T.J. Maxx, Ross Stores, and Burlington Stores. The problem is that all of these moves are easily replicated. What's to stop Kohl's or Nordstrom from also stocking more footwear and watches? Every retailer out there is developing more robust e-commerce initiatives (usually carrying lower margins), and as customers order more online, companies will suffer sales deleverage from fixed rent and labor costs. Also, Macy's is late to the off-price game, a few years behind Nordstrom, which unveiled Nordstrom Rack years ago. Off-price stores can also possibly diminish the larger, more profitable division, so there is cannibalization risk. Finally, if everyone is discounting, why wouldn't customers go to the stores known for the biggest discounts: Wal-Mart or Amazon? The big problem Keep in mind: The terrible results are happening in an economy that is nearing full employment and where consumer spending is actually good -- U.S. retail sales actually grew 0.1% in March and 0.4% in April. Imagine what would happen in a recession. It's perhaps fitting that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos summed up the problem well: "All businesses need to be young forever. If your customer base ages with you, you're Woolworth's." Department stores have been late to adjust to a population that increasingly seeks discounts, and a millennial generation that craves "experiences" and the convenience of shopping online. Bottom line: Some of these retailers will survive, but it's hard to pick any winners, and even the survivors are likely to be much smaller companies than they are today. Why play with fire?

Pana Pride’s treasurer, Paula Lebon, a Pana native, said the group “struggled for about a year,” implementing small projects like painting a building downtown and planting flowers. Pana Pride got more concrete direction after it began participation in October 2016 in the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs at Western Illinois University’s MAPPING the Future of Your Community program. A Pana Action Plan 2017 was developed that noted four high-priority goals (corresponding committees have been established for beautification, retail and dining, manufacturing and industry, and events), strategies, projects and action teams. After the conclusion of the program, a town meeting was held March 19 to share information and invite the community’s participation. Nearly 300 people attended. “When we did the rural mapping ... we talked about what the assets of the community are," said Dara Thompson, who was born and raised in Pana and is Pana Pride’s secretary. “Everyone talked about the people that are here, that that was one of our biggest assets. ... We’re trying to get everyone together and pool those talents and assets to make Pana a better place.” A ‘good place’ A goal highlighted through the mapping program is attracting new residents and visitors by beautifying Pana through well-maintained residential districts, attractive community entrances and a restored downtown with attractive streetscaping and design elements. Among strategies is to encourage refurbishment of buildings and facades. With that in mind, Pana Pride is exploring the possibility of acquisition and restoration of the old brick railroad freight house adjacent to Walmart. Used by the Illinois Central and New York Central lines, the freight house dates from the 1800s and is in disrepair. A goal is to restore the building for use as a tourism center or railroad museum. The group also is hoping that property south of the freight house that’s been used as a parking lot could be developed, perhaps partly as a park. “We’re trying to do things for people when they drive through town to say, ‘Hey, Pana is a good place to live,’ ” Dean said. “We’re only 35 miles from Decatur. We’re 40 miles from Springfield. We have great schools. We have a good hospital. In fact, our hospital is just getting ready to put on about a $12 million expansion. ... We have recreation. We have everything that you would want to have.” Dean added that Pana is a supportive community. “The people are so giving, and so you ought to come live with us,” he said. Thompson said Dean spoke eloquently at the town meeting about how the community could support Pana Pride. “He told the people that, ‘If you don’t ever want to come to a meeting or if you don’t want to be involved in any of the things that we do, if you just mowed your yard, if you just do something to beautify your property, then we would consider you a member of Pana Pride,’ ” Thompson said. Said Dean: “Just take pride where you’re at and what you own.” -- Contact Tamara Browning: tamara.browning@sj-r.com, 788-1534, twitter.com/tambrowningSJR. *** Want to participate?

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Home > Games > Spider-Man: Homecoming Spidey Suit Drone Is Coming To Skies Near You Spider-Man: Homecoming Spidey Suit Drone Is Coming To Skies Near You Posted by Jeremy Konrad May 28, 2017 Comment One of the more intriguing parts of the new Spidey suit in the upcoming Spider-Man: Homecoming film is the fact that he can pop off the symbol on the front of the suit and use it as a drone to see his surroundings. Like, say, a spider-sense… Anyway, classic Spidey fan in me aside, it does look nifty. And since they’re really hammering home the “Tony Stark as a mentor” thing in this one, it makes sense for them to include such a thing. And since drones are all the rage now, of course you can purchase one of your very own! The Skyrocket Toys official Spider-Drone will come in two different versions. Here are the features: Front & Back LED Lights: Illuminate Spider-Drone’s spectacular design, even in low-light situations, slicing through the night with front and back LED lights. Dual Flight Modes: Choose between Auto and Manual flight modes. Auto Mode supports hands-free altitude hold. The controller’s intuitive thumb sticks allow smooth forward, backward and sideways movement. Adjustable Flight Sensitivity: Find the controller sensitivity that matches your piloting skills and experience. Auto Launch and Land: Launch Spider-Drone into an aerial hover with the touch of a single button. Press the button again for a quick and smooth landing. Voice Feedback Controller: Show off the Voice Feedback Controller feature, which guides your flight with phrases from the movie. Direct Drive Motors: Spider-Drone’s direct drive motors have high torque and low inertia, which means faster, more precise positioning. Adjustable Wide-Angle Lens: Perfect your wide-angle view – available only on the Streaming Video Spider-Drone. Quick-Swap Battery (included): Spend less time tinkering and more time flying. Once a battery is depleted, easily replace it with a fully charged Quick-Swap Battery (sold separately). The $89.99 version will be available first at Walmart starting June 4th, while the $149.99 version with video components will be exclusive to Toys R Us starting July 1st.

Most of the work is to be completed for the New Orleans tricentennial celebration in 2018. New Orleans International Muralists LLC, headed by coordinator Daniel "DeeJay" Pate and lead artist Jamar Pierre, won its last required permit from the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East on Thursday (May 18). It already had received permits from the Army Corps of Engineers and the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. The murals will be similar to an original artwork titled "Resilience" by Pierre. That piece includes images based on New Orleans' history, music and culture, including Mardi Gras Indians, jazz musicians, riverboats and the city's architectural features. The group "wants to integrate all that speaks to the soul of new Orleans: music, second lines, social clubs, historical figures, traveling along the river, shipping and receiving, historical events, legal and governmental proceedings, the Native Americans and Mardi Gras Indians," says a mural project description provided to levee authority members. Pate, a Mardi Gras Indian himself, was a classroom schoolteacher in New Orleans for 10 years and also has worked as an academic adviser with the University of New Orleans' Upward Bound program. He has organized public art events, murals and private and corporate art projects for the past 16 years. Pierre's clients have included Time Warner Entertainment, Essence Magazine (including a poster for the 2007 Essence Music Festival), the cit of New Orleans and the Fore!Kids Foundation. His artwork was featured in the second season of HBO television's "Treme" series. A 70-foot mural by Pierre is on the side of St. Peter Claver Catholic School. Pate said he hopes to begin priming some of the floodwalls for painting within a few days. The hiring of as many as 10 artists for the project must wait until the group has raised at least $50,000 in donations from the public. He estimated that the entire project will cost $300,000 to $450,000. Pate has set up two ways for the public to donate, either through the mural firm's web site, or at a GoFundMe web site. Artists will start at 9th and Tchoupitoulas streets and work downriver to Jackson Avenue. Pate said that when he and Pierre began work on obtaining approvals for the murals in 2014, they estimated the project would take 18 months to complete. Pate hopes that most of the walls can still be completed within a year to meet the October 2018 date of the city's 300th birthday. The plan is to march downriver into history, with the first panels dedicated to events in the 2000s, then working back in time, Pate said. Each mural segment will cover the entire floodwall, using materials approved in advance by the Army Corps of Engineers. Floodgates will not be painted. The artists also have agreed to set aside $2,500 to $5,000 annually for maintenance costs, including removal of graffiti at least quarterly. The team hopes to extend the project downriver along an older segment of the wall, below Jackson Avenue, that contains more than 100 archway panels. Much of that work depends on whether they receive financial support from major donors such as Walmart, which is located across the street from many of the arches. In a letter to the corps, the team committed to painting the first 17 archways between Josephine Street and Jackson Avenue. "We intend to have a collective of artists do a series of famous doorways or a series of 'comic strip' style displays that peek into New Orleans' past as it relates to the Port of New Orleans and its shipping and receiving industry, plus the recreational vessels that have traveled up and down the Mississippi River over the last 300 years," the letter said.

Phoebe Sheehan psheehan@centredaily.com Community May 27, 2017 11:18 PM Centre Sluggers adult baseball league offers players another trip to the plate By Leon Valsechi lvalsechi@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story STATE COLLEGE Every Sunday from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend, adult baseball players have a chance to hit the field in State College and continue playing the game they love, or dust off the cleats and take another swing at a fastball. The Centre Sluggers 28-years-and-over baseball league was founded in 2001. The league began with four teams, named after Major League Baseball teams, and about 60 players. As the 2017 season gets underway, the league will field eight teams and more than 120 players. The wooden bat league plays its games at the State College Teener League fields located off West College avenue, and attracts players from as far as Bedford. The nine-inning games are umpired by a local crew hired by the league and the rules closely resemble major league rules, with a few exceptions to promote safety. One of the league founders was the late Paul Mazza Jr., who was also the founder of the South Hills School of Business and Technology. After about a 40-year hiatus from the game, he returned to the field and played for the Yankees. In a leadership role with the league, he authored the local rules to reflect the tone of the sluggers. “We will never intentionally hurt any other player because we understand that all of us need to go to work on the morning after the game and feel good about the game we played,” Mazza wrote in the league rules. The league was originally a member of the Men’s Senior Baseball League, which is a national organization with more than 300 affiliates and about 3,000 teams. John Young, former league president and current player, said when the league began to grow, the decision was made to become an independent league, which he said is unique for an adult league. Young is an environmental scientist from Lemont during the week, but when the 65-year-old suits up in his Orioles uniform, he’s an infielder who still has pop in his bat and speed to get down the line. “Baseball is a great game and there is a lot of tradition to it,” Young said. “I think the guys like the history of the game and it brings you back to your youth a little bit.” Young’s story is similar to many players in the league. He played Little League, advanced through youth baseball and played in college and county league before taking time off and returning years later. During Young’s time as president, he played a key roll in getting a second division of the league started — the Centre Hardballers 40--and-over league. The Hardballers play Tuesday and Wednesday evenings under the lights at the Teener League fields. The games are seven innings and are played within the sluggers’ rules. They are also played with a less competitive edge, according to Young. The league president prior to Young was John Pringle. Under his leadership, the league began playing one Sunday per year at Medlar Field at Lubrano Park. For one afternoon per season, players enjoy the practice facilities and field conditions of the minor league ballpark as their families and friends experience an afternoon watching their favorite player. Jason Bickle, league president, said the Medlar experience is the highlight of the season for most players. Bickle is a 40-year-old department manager at Wal-Mart off the field, but on Sundays during the season, he suits up as an infielder and pitcher for the Diamondbacks. He ended his playing days when he was 18 years old, but after hearing about the league in 2013, he grabbed his glove and hit the field once again. Attracting players to the league is difficult, Bickle said, but during his time as president he hopes to grow both leagues and increase their visibility in the community. “I think if people come out to see our games, they’ll realize that this is a great league,” Bickle said. “And if a guy is thinking about playing, I always tell him that the league is competitive, but we truly play for love of the game.” Leon Valsechi: 814-231-4631, @leon_valsechi Andy Bennet, of the Diamondbacks, catches a ball during a game Sunday, May 21, 2017 at the Teener league complex.
