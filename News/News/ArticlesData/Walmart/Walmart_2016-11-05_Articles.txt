Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 6, 2016 at 1:34PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been doing some soul-searching. After years of operating as a bare-bones retailer, paying employees the minimum wage or as little as possible, the company seems to have turned over a new leaf. CEO Doug McMillon, who took the helm in 2014, has invested billions in higher wages and training in order to bring stores up to modern standards and improve customer satisfaction. McMillon lifted the base wage to $9/hour in 2015 and again to $10/hour in February of this year. The moves seem to have paid off as same-store sales reached their fastest clip in years in the company's most recent report, increasing 1.6% in the second quarter. It's been a long time coming for Wal-Mart critics. For years, advocacy, worker, and union-backed groups like OUR Walmart have called on the retail giant to hike wages and improve workers' rights, eyeing a minimum of $15/hour. The United Food and Commercial Workers, a 1.3 million-strong union, has repeatedly tried to unionize the company's workers. However, Wal-Mart's recent efforts are causing some to see it in a different light.  This new strategy of paying workers better to improve company performance instead of minimizing all costs has caused some to draw comparisons with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the membership-based warehouse retailer that has outgrown Wal-Mart for several years.  When it comes to labor relations, Costco may be the diametric opposite of Wal-Mart. It's a veritable darling of labor advocates, and has avoided all of the union fights that have sullied Wal-Mart's brand. The warehouse giant pays a minimum of $13/hour and many of its store-level employees make upwards of $20/hour. It regularly ranks as one of the best places to work, and it has an exceptionally low turnover rate for a retail business.  Costco's philosophy is pretty simple -- treat people well and they'll return the favor. The company believes it's more profitable in the long-term to pay people a decent wage because it minimizes turnover and maximizes productivity, commitment, and loyalty. Borrowing from Costco Paying its employees better and giving them more opportunities seems to be paying off for Wal-Mart, but those decisions didn't come cheap. Those two years of wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, which is the primary reason why earnings per share are down this year and expected to remain flat next year. Wal-Mart and Costco have very different operating models. As a no-frills warehouse operation, Costco displays its goods on pallets, meaning it does not need employees to stock shelves as Wal-Mart does. The buy-in-bulk nature of Costco also means it needs fewer cashiers as a percentage of sales as the average amount its customers spend is much higher, and the help-yourself nature of shopping there means there are hardly employees on the floor to assist you.  As a result, Costco is much more efficient with its use of labor, meaning it can afford to pay its employees less.  Costco's revenue per employee, a popular way of measuring labor efficiency, is nearly three times that of Wal-Mart, as the chart below shows. WMT Revenue Per Employee (Annual) data by YCharts That explains why it can pay its hourly workers about 50% more than Wal-Mart, since even with that gap its overall labor costs are still less. According to a study by the UC Berkley Center for Labor Research, if Wal-Mart were to accede to labor activists' demands and pay a base wage of $15/hour, it would cost the company an additional $4.95 billion a year. That study was performed at the request of advocacy group OUR Walmart, so the actual number could be even higher, but a $5 billion increase in expenses would cut more than a third off of Wal-Mart's profit, a sacrifice shareholders would be unlikely to tolerate. Wal-Mart and other retailers have raised wages as the labor market has tightened, making hiring good employees more competitive. But continuing wage hikes would have diminishing marginal returns, as there is little need for the company to offer a starting wage that's at least 50% better than that of the average retailer. On the question of higher wages, Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the leverage that Costco does through its warehouse business model to pay average employees around $20/hour. The two companies' diverging pay scales may be due in part to strategic choices, but mostly they're a reflection of their much different business models.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Flipkart in talks with Wal-Mart, CPPIB for $1 b funding Priyanka Pani   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet E-commerce giant looking to take on Amazon, Alibaba Mumbai, November 6:   After a year of discussions with various global investment firms, Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart may soon close a deal to raise around $1 billion to fuel its expansion and take on arch rival Amazon.in. According to two sources, the Bengaluru-based company is exploring the option of seeking funds from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores. CPPIB, which opened an office in India last year, has been quite active in the Indian market and has invested as much as $2 billion since 2010 in companies such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, L&T Infrastructure Development Projects, Piramal Enterprises and Shapoorji Pallonji Group. If the Flipkart deal goes through, it would be CPPIB’s first investment in an internet-based company in India. Flipkart is also talking to Wal-Mart on the sale of a minority stake to the American retail giant. Wal-Mart’s partnership could also help Flipkart take on Alibaba, as it scales up its India presence. The Chinese player already has investments in mobile payment and commerce firm Paytm and another e-commerce marketplace, Snapdeal.Foothold for Wal-Mart? While Wal-Mart has declined to comment, industry watchers said that if it invests in Flipkart it may do so with an eye on getting a foothold into the niche grocery segment. Wal-Mart has been exploring the option of getting into the food and grocery segment since the Centre relaxed FDI rules. “Wal-Mart will have to choose between investing in an established e-commerce player like Flipkart and investing in its existing cash & carry business,” said an industry expert. This will be Flipkart’s 13th round of funding since July 2015, when the company raised about $700 million from Steadview Capital and Tiger Global Management, at a $15-billion valuation. In all, Flipkart has raised about $3.2 billion over seven years.Valuation hit However, over the last 12 months, the company’s valuation has plunged to around $11 billion following a series of markdowns by its own investors and by outside investment banking firms, as it failed to achieve its sales and revenue targets for 2015. Amazon, on the other hand, has pumped in over $5 billion in its Indian unit over the last four years.

By Travis Hoium On 10/29/16 at 4:00 PM Close How Energy Is Going Greener This article originally appeared on the Motley Fool. The decision to install solar panels can be driven by factors like a desire to use clean energy or an interest in becoming more self-sufficient when it comes to electricity. But when large companies choose to go solar, they're doing so based on the dollars and cents of the investment. You may not know if the  Target or Walmart  store you're shopping at has solar, but if it does, it's saving the company money. And today, U.S. corporations are installing solar energy rapidly as a way to save millions of dollars.  Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> The Solar Energy Industries Association recently released its Solar Means Business 2016 report, and it showed a big increase in the amount of solar energy on corporate rooftops. There's now more than 1 GW of solar for corporate customers, enough to power 193,000 homes. Target led the way with 147.5 MW, with 70 MW installed so far in 2016, while Walmart is using 145.0 MW. Apple 's 93.9 MW and Costco 's 50.7 MW means those companies are also among the top five installers.  Seven out of the top 10 corporate customers have installed SunPower solar panels, reflecting the company's corporate focus. SolarCity, meanwhile, has Walmart as a major customer.  One incredible stat from the report is that more than three quarters of the commercial solar installations and half of the capacity are at data centers. Large data centers are often buildings with flat roofs, perfect for solar energy, and they're energy hogs. So offsetting some, or all, of the energy consumption with solar on a roof or a nearby field is an attractive option.  Solar panels on the island of Eigg, Inner Hebrides, Scotland. Paul Hackett/Reuters How big is commercial solar today?  In the first three quarters of 2016 there was 142 MW of solar installed at corporate sites. Compared to a total of 13.9 GW expected to be installed in 2016, this is a fairly small market. But it's becoming increasingly important.  Utility-scale solar, which will be around 7.8 GW this year, is the largest segment of the solar market in general. But it's highly volatile, and 2017 will see only a small number of new projects signed and built. Commercial solar is improving in viability, and will likely be a growth market in the future.  One reason that corporate solar customers haven't traditionally been a big customer base is that it's hard to finance their installation. It may sound crazy, but it's easier to finance a residential solar project that's backed by a customer with a reliable FICO score than it is a corporate customer with anything but a stellar credit rating. Companies come and go, leaving creditors in their wake, and solar companies—and their financers—don't want to take the loss for companies that go out of business. Today, solar is cheap enough that companies can put systems on their balance sheets, or even take out loans to finance projects. This means the financing barrier is breaking down, opening up the market.  The two companies that have put a lot of attention on commercial solar are SunPower and SolarCity. Both have installation designs built to make commercial rooftop installations cost effective and efficient.  SunPower's pitch is based more around a higher efficiency product that's able to squeeze more energy out of each square foot. In small installations, a higher efficiency can lead to lower cost per watt—that's a big reason the company is serving so many of these customers.  10 stocks we like better than SunPower When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market. (Stock Advisor returns as of October 3, 2016) David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks  for investors to buy right now…and SunPower wasn't one of them! Click here to learn about these picks!

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Related Walmart stops accepting Visa at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

News York County Six new faces vie for three spots on City Council Mike HoltzclawContact Reportermholtzclaw@dailypress.com Privacy Policy When Poquoson residents came together last year to successfully block plans for a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, it was something of a watershed moment for the city. As citizens spoke up to define what they wanted and what they didn't want, it put an even sharper focus on the subject of economic development in the city. How to market that type of city, how to attract new businesses and families, will be a central issue in Tuesday's City Council election, in which three seats will be filled. Residents will vote for one candidate for each district, not just in the district where they live. Incumbents Henry Ayer III, Raymond Vernall and Traci-Dale Crawford chose not to seek re-election. Here's a look at the three races. Western Precinct Candidates: David Hux and Kylene Pase When Kylene Pase served on the board of Concerned Citizens of Poquoson, the group that rose up to block Wal-Mart, she felt more connected than ever to her hometown. Caption Sanctuary cities resist Trump's immigration deportation plans President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan involves deportations that could test cities with friendly policies for undocumented residents. President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan involves deportations that could test cities with friendly policies for undocumented residents. Caption How Trump’s victory has affected the stock market A Trump administration is expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects and ease many federal regulations. A Trump administration is expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects and ease many federal regulations. "The goal was to get the City of Poquoson more involved in what was going on, and make them more aware," Pase said. "Years and year ago, we heard that at City Council meetings, half of the city attended ... We wanted to bring a little of that back." She is a single mother of three, and has never run for office before. Her opponent, David Hux, a designer at Newport News Shipbuilding, has spent five years on the Poquoson School Board. Hux believes Poquoson is moving in the right direction regarding economic development. The city has earned high marks for its schools and for public safety, and Hux proposes to increase revenue "through thoughtful, well-planned and managed growth and development." Central Precinct Candidates: Kevin Brennan and Thomas Cannella II Fourteen years ago, government defense contractor Kevin Brennan ran for Poquson City Council and lost to incumbent Arthur "Binks" Holloway. This time around, his opponent is Thomas Cannella II, the 19-year-old grandson of the late "Binks" Holloway. Cannella, a sophomore studying political science and history at Christopher Newport University, said he always knew he would run for elected office. "Everything I've done has been with one goal in mind, and that is to run for council and serve my city one day," Cannella said. "I don't believe it's ever too early to serve. I think I'm ready. I know I'm ready." His biggest talking point leading up to the election has been a push to raise salaries for the city's teachers, firefighter and police. Cannella said the city loses too many of the people who provide those things because they leave quickly to seek better pay. Brennan said any spending increases need to be offset by new revenue sources, so citizens won't be hit with higher taxes. He said many small business owners have left Poquoson to move elsewhere on the Peninsula, citing lower rents. Eastern Precinct Candidates: Jana Andrews and Greg Martin With Traci-Dale Chapman, the only woman on City Council, choosing not to run for re-election, Jana Andrews believed it was important to maintain a female voice. But more important than that factor, she said, is her background as a financial analyst and the insight that gives her into the city's budget. "Financially we are in good shape with what we have, and obviously the AAA bond rating is a great thing," Andrews said. "But it's a tight budget, and any city department will tell you that they have to squeeze every bit out of their budget and could use more. The challenge is how to increase revenue without raising taxes." Her opponent, Greg Martin, sees that challenge as well. "If we can spread that around, a lot of other good things will happen in the city," Martin said. "Upgrading our facilities, bringing on new employees in public safety and the school system, and providing upgrades in infrastructure that will help the quality of life of our citizens." Holtzclaw can be reached by phone at 757-928-6479. Poquoson City Council candidates Citizens will vote for one candidate in each precinct, not just in the precinct where they live.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Walmart Black Friday Deals To Grab This Weekend Posted: Nov 5 2016, 11:36am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 5:13am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale is underway. Here are the best deals to get this weekend. Walmart launched the early Black Friday 2016 sale on November 1. The first early Black Friday weekend features new deals in the Walmart online specials sale. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com The deals list got enhanced by new deals on the Sony PS4 Slim and Xbox One S bundles. The weird Disney Princess Carriage Ride-On is back in stock and sells for $398. Walmart is again this year offering low cost Android tablets and tablets with keyboards. The new generation runs on Android 6.0. the 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro with 32GB storage almost provides a full laptop experience. Walmart lists again the $125 32-inch TCL 32S3750 Roku Smart TV deal. It is only available for pick up in a store. The TV shows up in the best-seller listing on Sunday, which suggests that there is new inventory. Check the stock at local store under Pickup Options. Walmart Black Friday Deals $125 32-inch TCL 32S3750 Roku Smart TV $398 50-inch VIZIO D50-D1 D-Series1080p 120Hz Fully Array Smart HDTV $299 Xbox One S 500GB bundle /w bonus game, movie and controller $299 Sony PS4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 w/ free COD: Infinite Warfare $279.99 50" Sceptre X505BV-F 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $378 55" VIZIO D55n-E2 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $848 65" VIZIO D65u-D2  4K Ultra HD 2160p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV $219 Apple iPad mini 2 $98 11.5" RCA Galileo Pro 32GB Tablet with Keyboard Case Android 6.0 The weirdest thing to see on the Walmart online store are the Hatchimals deals. The retailer has announced to dramatically increase the number of products offered on online through marketplace partners. Now Walmart's marketplace partners are offering Hatchimals at outragous prices of $199. The Amazon marketplace is definitely more mature and reflects the market values of Hatchimals in a much better way. The offers on amazon from 3rd parties match what Hatchimals sell for in eBay auctions. Listings like that reflect kind of badly on the image of Walmart. When you look at the page of Walmart's online specials, you see among the deals listed a $199 Hatchimals. That just does not look right. There is certainly some room for improvements of how marketplace offers should be displayed online at walmart.com, so it is clear to shoppers that these items are not sold by Walmart directly. See our Hatchimals Shopping guide for the latest on the Hatchimals stock situation. Find more early Black Friday deals picks on sale today.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 5, 2016 at 12:01PM Image source: Getty Images. It's pretty exciting when you find a stock idea you can really get behind. We reached out to some of our top Motley Fool contributors to ask them what stocks have them jumping for joy right now. They came back with an eclectic list of intriguing stocks that includes Transdigm (NYSE:TDG), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL), Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN), and Terra Nitrogen Company (NYSE:TNH). Are these stocks right for your portfolio? Read on to find out. This stock will continue flying high Daniel Miller: One stock I'm excited about is found within the aerospace industry, but it's not the juggernaut manufacturers you'd likely think of (like Boeing or Airbus). Rather, TransDigm is a leading designer, producer, and supplier of engineered aircraft components and systems that are used on just about every commercial and military aircraft in service. The company IPO'd roughly a decade ago and hasn't looked back. TDG data by YCharts. The good news for long-term investors is that the aerospace industry isn't slowing down, either. In fact, Boeing estimates that more than 39,000 commercial airplanes -- we're not even considering military aircraft, here -- will be needed over the next two decades thanks to a surge in Asia demand. Those airplanes are valued at more than $5.9 trillion, and TransDigm's business should carve out its fair share of that pie. TransDigm also possesses competitive advantages that should last for the long term. It has intellectual property on its products that are produced according to strict FAA certifications. Further, for those unaware of the process, once FAA certifies an aircraft design, it also certifies the bill of materials, which would include TransDigm's parts. That essentially creates switching costs for aerospace manufacturers that are less likely to make changes in the design for years. Ultimately, TransDigm's business has soared along with a booming aerospace industry, but part of the reason its growth has been such on a blistering pace is its acquisition-heavy strategy and leveraged balance sheet. That makes TransDigm risky, but if it continues to do business as well as it has historically, the company is poised to reward long-term investors. No more messing around Tim Green: The retail industry is going to look a lot different 10 years from now. E-commerce will continue to steal away sales from traditional retailers, and the weakest operators will struggle to survive. Wal-Mart, the 800-pound gorilla of the brick-and-mortar retail business, aims to not only survive, but thrive. The company is going all-in on e-commerce, and while this will hurt its results in the near term, it's the only path forward. Wal-Mart is scaling back its plans to open new stores, with just 55 U.S. stores planned for fiscal 2018, down from 230 in fiscal 2016. At the same time, the company is rapidly growing its stable of e-commerce distribution centers and investing in new technology to make its warehouses more efficient. According to Justen Traweek, VP of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment, Wal-Mart can now ship to the majority of the U.S. population in one day. The $3 billion acquisition of Jet gives another boost to Wal-Mart's e-commerce business, while at the same time giving the company a brand that may prove more appealing to younger consumers. Other initiatives, like ShippingPass, a $49 annual subscription service that provides free two-day shipping and online grocery pickup and delivery, show that Wal-Mart isn't going sit idly by and let Amazon eat its lunch. Wal-Mart may have fallen behind in e-commerce, but that doesn't mean it can't catch up. Image source: Getty Images. Sales of this newly approved drug look ready to explode higher Sean Williams: Call me a bit biased since I've been a shareholder for more than two years, but I'm really excited to see what happens next with biotech Exelixis. There have been two major dynamics at work with Exelixis: the rise of Cabometyx and the recent struggles of one of its biggest competitors. Cabometyx is Exelixis' lead cancer drug. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April as a treatment for second-line renal cell carcinoma after it delivered the first-ever "trifecta," as management has called it: Cabometyx led to statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival, median overall survival, and overall response rates relative to the placebo. It was a big win for Exelixis after Cabometyx flopped in an advanced prostate cancer study. Here's where things get interesting. Recently, Exelixis announced mid-stage data from the CABOSUN trial, noting that Cabometyx proved to be superior with respect to progression-free survival to the current standard of care, Sutent, in first-line renal cell carcinoma. It's possible a label expansion opportunity could be on the horizon. Exelixis is also benefiting from the suggestion of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) in the CELESTIAL trial, which is examining Cabometyx as a treatment for advanced liver cancer. The IDMC suggested the phase 3 trial continue as planned, which implies that Cabometyx has a shot of hitting its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival. Top-line data should be out next year. Finally, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, a cancer immunotherapy that can seemingly do no wrong, is reeling after Opdivo failed to even come close to hitting its primary endpoint in a first-line non-small cell lung cancer study known as CheckMate-026. The failure of Opdivo, which is the current market share leader in second-line renal cell carcinoma, could open the door for Cabometyx to capitalize in the second-line (and perhaps, down the road, first-line) for this indication. Things are really starting to heat up for Exelixis, and shareholders should rightly be excited. The reason is clear Todd Campbell: Align Technology, Inc. is one of healthcare's fastest-growing companies, and demand for its Invisalign clear orthodontic aligners is showing no signs of slowing. In Q2, Align Technology's year-over-year sales and profit increased by 29% to $269 million and 59% to $0.62 per share, respectively. ALGN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Invisalign's growth stems from compelling advantages versus traditional metal braces. Since Invisalign is clear, it's less noticeable to others. The aligners can be removed easily, and there aren't any restrictions on the types of food you can eat while wearing Invisalign. Invisalign can be cheaper than traditional metal braces, too. Currently, Invisalign's market share is only 7%, and since next-generation Invisaligns are being designed for use in tougher-to-treat patients, the peak sales opportunity appears big -- especially if Align Technology successfully extends its reach beyond orthodontists to general dentistry. Based on the company's anticipated revenue growth, Align Technology's C-suite thinks bottom-line growth will clock in north of 23% per year over the next five years, so even though shares are up significantly, I think there's still plenty of upside ahead. A strong player in a tough market  Tyler Crowe: Just about every publicly traded commodity is struggling today, even ones we assumed would be very stable markets, like agriculture products and fertilizers. The thing is, the agricultural market is suffering from the same malaise as everyone else: too much capacity brought on to satiate the rapid growth of the Chinese economy with little regard to the possibility that this market would slow down. One product in particular has been hit hard: nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea. Despite the 10-year decline in prices, Terra Nitrogen Company still looks like a compelling investment.  What separates Terra Nitrogen from the rest is that it is out in front of a major shift in the industry. Its urea and ammonium nitrate manufacturing capacity uses cheap domestic natural gas versus more expensive means, such as the anthracite coal used across much of the Asia Pacific region. So, despite the very low prices for urea today, Terra Nitrogen still has gross margins in the 55%-60% range over the past 12 months. Add in the fact that the company has a very lean operation and no debt and you get a company that throws off loads of cash it can distribute to investors -- it is a master limited partnership -- and generates a whopping 45% return on capital. Any potential investor needs to keep in mind that Terra Nitrogen is a variable-rate master limited partnership, so its payout varies from quarter to quarter based on commodity prices and any maintenance downtime. When you consider that the company can do so well even in a distressed commodity market like today, there's a lot of reasons to think Terra Nitrogen will succeed over the long term.

Exelixis is also benefiting from the suggestion of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) in the CELESTIAL trial, which is examining Cabometyx as a treatment for advanced liver cancer. The IDMC suggested the phase 3 trial continue as planned, which implies that Cabometyx has a shot of hitting its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival. Top-line data should be out next year. Finally, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, a cancer immunotherapy that can seemingly do no wrong, is reeling after Opdivo failed to even come close to hitting its primary endpoint in a first-line non-small cell lung cancer study known as CheckMate-026. The failure of Opdivo, which is the current market share leader in second-line renal cell carcinoma, could open the door for Cabometyx to capitalize in the second-line (and perhaps, down the road, first-line) for this indication. Things are really starting to heat up for Exelixis, and shareholders should rightly be excited. The reason is clear Todd Campbell: Align Technology, Inc. is one of healthcare's fastest-growing companies, and demand for its Invisalign clear orthodontic aligners is showing no signs of slowing. In Q2, Align Technology's year-over-year sales and profit increased by 29% to $269 million and 59% to $0.62 per share, respectively. ALGN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Invisalign's growth stems from compelling advantages versus traditional metal braces. Since Invisalign is clear, it's less noticeable to others. The aligners can be removed easily, and there aren't any restrictions on the types of food you can eat while wearing Invisalign. Invisalign can be cheaper than traditional metal braces, too. Currently, Invisalign's market share is only 7%, and since next-generation Invisaligns are being designed for use in tougher-to-treat patients, the peak sales opportunity appears big -- especially if Align Technology successfully extends its reach beyond orthodontists to general dentistry. Based on the company's anticipated revenue growth, Align Technology's C-suite thinks bottom-line growth will clock in north of 23% per year over the next five years, so even though shares are up significantly, I think there's still plenty of upside ahead. A strong player in a tough market  Tyler Crowe: Just about every publicly traded commodity is struggling today, even ones we assumed would be very stable markets, like agriculture products and fertilizers. The thing is, the agricultural market is suffering from the same malaise as everyone else: too much capacity brought on to satiate the rapid growth of the Chinese economy with little regard to the possibility that this market would slow down. One product in particular has been hit hard: nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea. Despite the 10-year decline in prices, Terra Nitrogen Company still looks like a compelling investment.  What separates Terra Nitrogen from the rest is that it is out in front of a major shift in the industry. Its urea and ammonium nitrate manufacturing capacity uses cheap domestic natural gas versus more expensive means, such as the anthracite coal used across much of the Asia Pacific region. So, despite the very low prices for urea today, Terra Nitrogen still has gross margins in the 55%-60% range over the past 12 months. Add in the fact that the company has a very lean operation and no debt and you get a company that throws off loads of cash it can distribute to investors -- it is a master limited partnership -- and generates a whopping 45% return on capital. Any potential investor needs to keep in mind that Terra Nitrogen is a variable-rate master limited partnership, so its payout varies from quarter to quarter based on commodity prices and any maintenance downtime. When you consider that the company can do so well even in a distressed commodity market like today, there's a lot of reasons to think Terra Nitrogen will succeed over the long term.

(Associated Press file) Print Email NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com By NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author on November 05, 2016 at 10:33 AM, updated November 05, 2016 at 10:34 AM comments With huge sales and steep savings at nearly every retailer, Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — has long been touted as one of the best times of the year for buying just about anything. But it's not all discounts and deals on the 2016 post-Turkey Day shopping bonanza. Use this guide to determine what you should purchase and what you should skip on Nov. 25 to ensure you're getting only the best bargains. Buy: Previous models of Apple products Traditionally, major retail stores such as Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart discount Apple products each year on Black Friday, and previous-generation models usually see the most dramatic deals. These offers may include price cuts, free gift cards with purchase or a combination of both. This year, look for deals on MacBooks, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs. Last year, for instance, Target devoted almost an entire page of the bull's-eye retailer's 2015 Black Friday ad to Apple. Shoppers scored a free Target gift card when they bought any iPad Mini, iPad Air or Apple Watch. There was also a 20% discount on all iPods. Skip: Toys Toys are one of the seasonal purchase staples, but you might want to think twice before picking them up on Black Friday. Historically, it's best to wait until closer to Christmas to purchase dolls, action figures and the like. You may run the risk that certain items will sell out, but you may also be able to find bigger savings on what's left. Last year, in the final days before Christmas, toys were on sale at Kmart, Wal-Mart and Big Lots, to name a few. Shoppers bought one toy and got a second toy at 50% off on Monster High dolls and accessories, Fisher-Price preschool toys and Block Tech playsets, as well as activity and science sets. » MORE: Full list of 2016 Black Friday store hours Buy: Gaming system bundles Black Friday is for gamers just as much as it is for shoppers. This year, look for savings on video games and video game systems from retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and GameStop. You'll find particularly great offers on gaming bundles. Traditionally, these include the game console plus a combination of games and accessories. Last year, video game retailer GameStop took $50 off both the Xbox One 500GB Gears of War Ultimate Bundle and the PlayStation 4 500GB Uncharted Collection Bundle. Skip: Christmas decorations You've likely seen the blowout post-Christmas clearance sales every year on Dec. 26 as you made your way to the store to return that gift that missed the mark. The absolute best time to buy Christmas decorations, wrapping paper, tinsel and other seasonal trimmings is right after Christmas (for obvious reasons). But if you need these items before the holiday, don't buy them on Black Friday. Sure, you'll see plenty of deals on artificial trees and rolls of wrapping paper, especially at home and craft stores, but retailers are more eager to slash prices the closer it gets to Christmas. Buy: Electronics (TVs, tablets and smartphones) Electronics deals are a Black Friday staple, and for many consumers, that means shopping for a new TV, tablet or smartphone. In 2015, Target offered an impressive $249.99 deal on a 55-inch Westinghouse LED TV. Over at Staples, tablets were all the rage. Shoppers could save up to 25% on select iPad models. Staples also dropped the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7-inch down to $79.99 (regularly $139.99). No matter where you choose to spend your Black Friday (or your Thanksgiving), you're almost guaranteed to find TV and tablet doorbusters. Another electronics deal to keep an eye out for: smartphones. Verizon offered $100 off the retail price of select Android smartphones last year. » MORE: Black Friday 2016 ad leaks Skip: Bedding You've got the entertainment center covered, but you should hesitate before stocking up on supplies to refresh the look of your bedroom this Black Friday. The lowest prices on bedding and linens have been known to appear in January during what are called "white sales," so hold off until then if you can. January 2016 white sales took place at Macy's, Pottery Barn, Nordstrom and more. Buy: Video games, CDs, DVDs If you're in need of some affordable stocking stuffers, look no further than the video game, CD, DVD and Blu-ray department at most major retailers this Black Friday. You'll find films and gaming titles deeply discounted from their original prices. In 2015, for example, Best Buy offered select Blu-ray titles for $9.99 each and up to 70 CD titles for $6.99 each. Wal-Mart had certain video games for $25 each and a selection of special-buy DVD titles for just $1.96 apiece. Skip: Outdoor essentials You won't see too many grills or patio furniture sets plastered on the front pages of Black Friday ads this year. That's because, not surprisingly, outdoor products and patio furniture are deeply discounted immediately after summer ends. If you didn't pick up these products at the close of this summer, wait until Labor Day sales roll around next year. Can't wait until then? Another viable option is the Spring Black Friday Sale that home improvement store Lowe's usually holds each year. Buy: Home appliances No secret here. Black Friday is well-known for its offers of huge savings on washers, dryers, refrigerators and kitchen appliances. Look for similar deep discounts again this year. Last year at Sears, the Kenmore 4.3-cubic-foot washer and 7.3-cubic-foot dryer were on sale for $799.98 for the pair. That's a 57% discount. Best Buy took $1,500 off the price of a Samsung 28.2-cubic-foot 4-Door French Door Smart Refrigerator, bringing it down to $2,099.99. If you're in the market for smaller appliances such as coffee makers, mixers, blenders or vacuum cleaners, expect deals this year from department stores such as Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Macy's. Skip: Winter clothing Fall and winter clothing generally isn't the best value on Black Friday. Jeans, for instance, see better sales in October, and retailers frequently offer big clearance sales on jackets when winter gives way to spring. Of course, if you need something to keep you warm before then, you'll be able to find some bargains this Black Friday. Year after year, Macy's and J.C. Penney have offered doorbuster deals on women's boots. In the past, select pairs have been just $19.99 each. Buy: Travel deals Whether it's hotel rooms, ski lift tickets or airfare, you can expect big deals on travel this Black Friday and Cyber Monday (Nov. 28). Check for deals from online travel sites like Expedia and major airlines alike. Note: In the past, most of these promotions were available for a very limited time. Skip: Mail-in rebates If you want to avoid some of the hassle related to Black Friday shopping, resist deals that require a mail-in rebate. Unless you're disciplined enough to fill out the form and wait to receive the rebate, you could end up paying more than you intended. And even if you do follow through with rebate, you'll have to shell out a higher price at the register before getting some of your money back. Always read the fine print; some kitchen appliances, electronics and other popular items may require you to fill out a mail-in rebate to achieve the advertised price. At Kohl's, for example, some small kitchen appliances were available for $7.99 last year — but that was after a $12 mail-in rebate. Buy: Online doorbusters Finally, for the ultimate combination of convenience and savings, spring for online doorbusters this year. Plenty of big box retailers are bringing their doorbusters online this Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Office Depot and OfficeMax, for instance, will be closed on Thanksgiving Day 2016, but deals will be available online starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the holiday.

The world’s largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart’s goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, which because of its size — more than 10,000 stores globally — gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.” Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn’t estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. It will also work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible. The retailer plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Ms. Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc - The Kroger Co - Whole Foods Market Inc - Doug McMillon - Canada - United States - North America Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society CEO Doug McMillon points to a “new era of trust and transparency” for customers and communities PHILADELPHIA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–At today’s Net Impact Conference, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon will outline a roadmap that will guide the company’s role in society on critical issues over the next several years, pointing to a “new era of trust and transparency.” The roadmap adds fresh detail to Walmart’s sustainability agenda and contains new commitments that reflect a wider recognition of the company’s impact on communities and the planet. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: Power half of the company’s energy from renewable sources under a plan designed to achieve science-based emissions targets: Walmart is one of the largest private-sector investors in renewable energy, including solar and wind power. In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Under the recently approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with expanded use of renewable energy, to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Achieve zero waste to landfill in key markets by 2025: Progress so far has been significant on the original goal. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines. Walmart will also continue working to reduce landfill waste in all markets, moving as fast as infrastructure and best practices allow. Sell more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect: Packaging: Walmart pledges to work with suppliers to reduce product and packaging waste and preserve natural resources. Our goal by 2025 is for Walmart’s private brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. Affordable, safe and healthier: Walmart will double the sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. by 2025 and work with suppliers and its own private brand products to remove certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors in products where customers don’t expect to find them, as well as reduce sodium, added sugars and saturated fat where possible. Additionally, Walmart will expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, grapes, coffee, and tea. Natural resources: Walmart is expanding sourcing of commodities produced with zero net deforestation. In partnership with governments, NGOs and industry groups, Walmart has previously been working to source private-brand palm oil and beef from Brazil’s Amazon with zero net deforestation. Under the roadmap, Walmart will expand its work into additional critical commodities, including all Brazilian soy and private-brand pulp and paper. McMillon will also discuss the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: Support the human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain: Walmart is joining the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration of businesses and NGO partners working to ensure ethical recruitment and treatment of workers globally. This is on top of Walmart’s work underway in four areas that present risk to the dignity and safety of workers: seafood; apparel; produce; and electronics. Be the place to go for an individual’s first job: Walmart will further its efforts to afford a good experience for the thousands of people who come to the retailer for their first job. Associates will be provided with workplace mobility – a good start, new skills and a clear path to grow and succeed – whether or not they remain with the company. To further these efforts, Walmart has recently signed on to the White House First Jobs Compact, a nationwide effort to help connect out-of-school, out-of-work youth to their first jobs. Provide a clear path for career advancement: By 2025, Walmart U.S. will put millions of associates through focused training programs to equip them with skills to improve career growth, from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay. The retailer’s Pathways program provides training in core skills for entry-level associates and rewards them with a pay increase upon completion. The Academy training program – for supervisory associates – is expected to graduate 250,000 people alone by the end of 2017. As part of this commitment, Walmart strives to be a destination employer for young people and returning service members. Predictability, stability and pay: Walmart is committed to improving predictability in the lives of its associates by providing work schedules more than two weeks in advance in the U.S.; as well as implementing a strong leave policy that empowers associates to decide how to use their paid time off based on individual needs. Walmart also believes in equal pay for equal work. Associates with the same qualifications, performing the same jobs and making the same effort to achieve the same results, should receive the same pay. Improve the lives of people in communities: Walmart will source more products locally around the world, including $250 billion in products supporting American jobs by 2023 and $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the U.S. by the end of this year. The retailer also committed to donating 4 billion meals to fight hunger by 2020 and, over five years, to contributing $25 million towards disaster relief and resiliency around the world.

Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy, who had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband, was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop a few feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city in 2016 agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice’s family for $6 million.

Former North Charleston, South Carolina, officer Michael Slager, 34, is on trial for murder in Charleston in the April 2015 fatal shooting of Scott, 50. Both officers, who are white, have pleaded not guilty. The cases are among a series across the country since mid-2014 — from the fatal shooting of a 12-year-old boy in a Cleveland recreation area to that of a 66-year-old woman in her Bronx, New York, apartment — that have raised a national debate over race and policing.

The Department of Justice also opted against bringing civil rights charges against Wilson. The death of Brown, who was unarmed, led to months of sometimes-violent Ferguson protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. JOHN CRAWFORD III Police in the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Beavercreek responded to a Wal-Mart store in August 2014 on a call of a man waving an apparent rifle. A white officer fatally shot Crawford III, 22, who was carrying what turned out to be an air rifle from a store shelf. Police said they believed it was a real gun and that he didn’t respond to their commands to put it down. A grand jury declined to indict the officers. The U.S. Justice Department has been reviewing the case. LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Van Dyke, who is white, was charged in November 2015 on the same day that the city, under judge’s orders, released dashcam video showing the 17-year-old McDonald being shot 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty and is free on bond. The video has prompted local and federal investigations of both the shooting and the Police Department. AKAI GURLEY Peter Liang, a rookie New York City police officer, was convicted Feb. 11 of manslaughter in the November 2014 death of the 28-year-old Gurley. Liang was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn in 2014 when he fired and a bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he had been holding his weapon safely when a sound jarred him and he accidentally fired. In April, a judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years’ probation and 800 hours of community service. An attorney for Gurley’s family said in August that New York City reached a settlement of more than $4 million with the family. TAMIR RICE Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy, who had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband, was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop a few feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city in 2016 agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice’s family for $6 million. FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man entered a Baltimore police van in April 2015 shackled but alive. He died of severe neck injuries suffered during the ride that followed. His death led to rioting. Prosecutors in July 2016 said they were dropping charges against the remaining police officers awaiting trial, leaving no convictions against six officers who were charged initially in the case. Gray’s family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff’s deputy Robert Bates, age 74, was sentenced in June to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, an unarmed and restrained black man, during a sting operation. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, Police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced Oct. 12 to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting William Chapman II, 18. Rankin shot the unarmed Chapman on April 22, 2015, after responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart store. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed Chapman “willfully, deliberately and with premeditation.” Chapman’s body was delivered to the medical examiner with handcuffs still bound behind his back, according to news reports at the time. Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin’s stun gun, according to the reports. Rankin, who is white, was fired after the shooting. WALTER SCOTT Michael Slager faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder in the shooting death of Scott in April 2015 in South Carolina. The shooting was captured on cellphone video by a passer-by. Slager told investigators Scott had grabbed his Taser and pointed the stun gun at him as they fought on the ground. Slager was fired by the North Charleston Police Department. There has been a $6.5 million settlement between North Charleston and the Scott family. Slager also faces federal charges including for allegedly violating Scott’s civil rights. SAM DUBOSE Ray Tensing faces 15 years to life if convicted of murder of Sam DuBose, killed in July 2015 near the University of Cincinnati campus. Tensing’s body camera captured much of the traffic stop, although the two sides dispute what conclusions can be reached. Tensing’s attorney says DuBose was using his car as a weapon that could have killed him. The university fired Tensing, hired outside consultants, and restructured its public safety department. The school also reached a $5.3 million settlement that includes free undergraduate tuition for DuBose’s 13 children. DARRIUS STEWART A federal prosecutor announced in September there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges in the July 2015 fatal shooting of Stewart, 19, by Officer Connor Schilling. Schilling, a white Memphis, Tennessee, police officer, shot Stewart during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants. Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allows him to receive disability pay. A grand jury in November 2015 declined to charge the officer. JEREMY MCDOLE Jeremy McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander’s cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general’s office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed “extraordinarily poor” police work. RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ricky Ball, 26. Boykin, facing trial Nov. 28, has said he shot Ball because the man appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin as he was trying to resign, saying he had broken department policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancee to ride along without permission, and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. DEMARCUS SEMER A Florida grand jury cleared two police officers in September who fatally shot Semer, an unarmed black motorist, in April 2016 as he fled. Prosecutors said the man’s actions gave the officers a reasonable belief that their lives were in danger. The St. Lucie County Grand Jury cleared Fort Pierce police Sgt. Brian MacNaught and officer Keith Holmes for the shooting of Semer, 21, during a traffic stop. Prosecutors say their investigation showed he refused to get out of his car and then tried to drive away, clipping Holmes and dragging MacNaught. Both officers are white. ALTON STERLING Sterling, 37, was shot to death July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking widespread demonstrations across Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II were placed on administrative leave. Neither officer has been charged in the case, which was turned over to federal investigators. PHILANDO CASTILE Castile was shot and killed July 6 by officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Hispanic, after being pulled over as he drove through a St. Paul, Minnesota, suburb with his girlfriend and her young daughter in the car. His girlfriend began livestreaming on Facebook shortly after the shooting and said Castile, 32, was shot while reaching for his ID after telling the officer he had a gun permit and was armed. Yanez and his partner, Joseph Kauser, who was present for the shooting, were placed on administrative leave. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has turned its findings over to a county prosecutor, who will review the case. TYRE KING The 13-year-old Ohio youth was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer Sept. 14 after running from police investigating a reported armed robbery. Police said he a pulled a BB gun that looked like a real firearm. Officer Bryan Mason, who is white, was put on administrative desk duty while the investigation into Tyre King’s death continues. The attorney for his family has asked for a Justice Department review. KEITH LAMONT SCOTT The North Carolina State bureau of Investigation is reviewing the fatal Sept. 20 shooting of Scott by a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. Scott, 43, was sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his Charlotte apartment complex when he was shot by police trying to find a different man. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times as he slowly backed out of an SUV. Scott’s family said he did not have a gun and was reading a book. The shooting, part of which was recorded by his wife and shared widely on social media, caused days of violent protests and a state of emergency to be declared in Charlotte. TERENCE CRUTCHER Tulsa, Oklahoma, police Officer Betty Jo Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Sept. 22 in the shooting of Crutcher, an unarmed man. Shelby, who is white, shot the 40-year-old Crutcher on Sept. 16 shortly after she arrived on a street to find his SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Crutcher was seen without a weapon and with his hands up on videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter before Shelby shot him. Police Chief Chuck Jordan has said that Crutcher did not have a gun on his body or in his SUV when he was shot. Shelby has pleaded not guilty and is on unpaid leave. ALFRED OLANGO In the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, a police officer opened fire on Ugandan refugee Alfred Olango within a minute of arriving at the scene on Sept. 27. Olango’s sister had described her brother as mentally unbalanced in multiple 911 calls. Video released by police shows the officer approached the 38-year-old man with gun drawn, as Olango paced in a strip mall parking lot. Olango pulls something from his pocket, takes what police call a “shooting stance,” and aims something at the officer, who then fires his gun. A second officer fired his Taser simultaneously. The object in Olango’s hands turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. The two officers were placed on leave as the district attorney investigates. DEBORAH DANNER New York police were responding Oct. 18 to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person when Sgt. Hugh Barry encountered Danner, 66, in her Bronx apartment. The mentally ill woman picked up a baseball bat in her bedroom and tried to hit Barry, who fired shots that killed her. New York’s mayor rebuked him publicly the next day, and he has been stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty while the state attorney general’s office determines whether the case falls under its authority to investigate police shootings of unarmed civilians. Police are also investigating the officer’s actions. Farrar reported from New York.

This year saw the addition of a memory board to honor those who have died was attached to one of the three vehicles donated by Red's Towing, Transport & Recovery, in West Springfield. To qualify in Sunday's run each rider was asked to bring a new unwrapped toy or a gift card in place of an entrance fee. Bruce Rivest, one of the event coordinators, said he was adopted through Brightside as a child, and wants people to know about Brightside for Families and Children. Rivest along with organizers Melvyn Hook and Pete Silvano, meet with representatives of Brightside several times a year to keep them (Brightside) up to date on the annual toy collection. Last year the toy run drive provided 237 families with toys, said Rivest. Hook noted that one art company donated art supplies, while some individuals donated PlayStations and bicycles. Older children usually receive gift cards so they can buy what they want, he added Riders left the Walmart parking lot at 11a.m. and proceeded to Providence Hospital, in Holyoke, where the toys were to be unloaded. The riders were served chocolate chip cookies and hot chocolate during the 30-minute stopover. Riders then continued to an after ride party at the Moose Family Center on Fuller Road in Chicopee. Sponsors for the ride included Indian Motorcycle of Springfield, Red's Exxon, Rock 102 and Lazer 99.3, and Walmart, while Chicopee, Springfield, and South Hadley Police provided escort service for the riders. Brightside for Families and Children is part of the Mercy Medical Center and the Sisters of Providence Health System.

It was clear very early one that Microsoft will be very aggressive selling the Xbox One S this Holiday season. We called out a new Console war back in September and now we are in the middle of it.

Xbox fans can get much more free stuff and deeper discounts on the Xbox One S.  Initially we believed that there will be deals on the original Xbox One, but with the amazing deals on the Xbox One S, it does not make sense to bother with the old Xbox.

Amazon offers until November 12 a free game of your choice with any Xbox One S bundle on amazon.com. The new Microsoft Xbox One S is a great upgrade for Xbox One owners. Amazon offers a trade-in of your old Xbox One to make the upgrade more affordable. The Xbox One S supports 4K for watching video. Gameplay is upscaled to 4K. More importantly, the Xbox One S also supports HDR, giving games richer, more luminous colors and higher contrasts. In case you are hunting also for a 4K TV with HDR this Holiday season, we have listed the best 4K HDR TV Deals on sale now. Full HDR10 support is in most cases only found on 2016 TV models.

(Photo: Kevin O'Leary photos) 87 CONNECTTWEET 81 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE ABC's Shark Tank has built enough of a quirky kind of brand recognition that an 11-year-old girl recently approached Kevin O'Leary at the San Francisco airport and wanted to talk about financing deals with convertible debentures. Everyone it seems has an idea about how a deal should be done — or an idea for a new product — to share with a shark. Celebrity investor O'Leary — who co-founded O'Shares, a line of exchange-traded funds — chatted with me by phone last week about how entrepreneurs can get financing, life in the Shark Tank and why, more than likely, I shouldn't plan to strike it rich with a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Here are excerpts from that interview: QUESTION: How did you end up with the role as the one who challenges the contestants on the show, where you're kind of like the Simon Cowell of the sharks? How did that happen?  ANSWER:  Either you make money or lose money. My feeling from day one, and you know Shark Tank has gone on for many years now, is that it's better to tell the truth. A couple of episodes ago, we got into an argument about it. The family comes out with a product or service and clearly it has no merit and the probability of success is extremely low. They're funding it with their own money. They're mortgaging their homes or going into credit card debt. The other sharks tend to say, "You know I'm not going to invest in it." It's clear to them also that it has no merit. And yet they'll give them encouragement to go on. Well, I find that incredibly disingenuous. Reality is going to strike anyway. And if they think it's tough in the shark tank, wait until they get out in the real world. They're going to get eaten alive. I'm not the mean guy; I'm the best friend they ever met. They're lucky they met me. Q: I happened to watch the show on Friday and saw you talking about this deal, this LuLu Bang sauce, and they already had some shelf space in Walmart. But you were really, really hard on them. Why? A: The numbers were showing it was failing in Walmart. The number of turns per week were too low to stay on the shelf. That consumer market is brutally competitive.  I'd argue that the chance of getting a hot sauce to actually return on an investment is extremely low unless you have a different strategy. I'm not saying it's impossible that they're successful, I'm just saying the probability is incredibly low. I'm the merchant of truth, that's what I am, and I'm Mr. Wonderful all bundled together. Q: Did you ever have a deal that you thought was a surefire bet but it bombed?  A: Mark (Cuban) and I did ToyGaroo and it went to zero. Lost a fair chunk of money on that one. They didn't understand their customer acquisition costs. (ToyGaroo, which went out of business, was to be the Netflix of toys. Parents would rent toys and send them back when the child was done playing with them.) Q: What are the signs of a winner?  A: One, they're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less. Take (Wicked Good) cupcakes for example. 'We make cupcakes. We put them in a Mason jar. We FedEx them all over America.' I get it. No. 2, they're able to articulate why they're the right team to execute the business plan. They want to grow their business; here's how they're going to do it. You get those two elements together you can start to sense in the Shark Tank things are starting to sizzle like an isotope. You realize these entrepreneurs have a plan. Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the Shark Tank, you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in Shark Tank history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of Shark Tank's first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. USA TODAY Life without lattes? Test-drive your retiree budget ahead of time Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it.

Everyone it seems has an idea about how a deal should be done — or an idea for a new product — to share with a shark. Celebrity investor O'Leary — who co-founded O'Shares, a line of exchange-traded funds — chatted with me by phone last week about how entrepreneurs can get financing, life in the Shark Tank and why, more than likely, I shouldn't plan to strike it rich with a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Here are excerpts from that interview: QUESTION: How did you end up with the role as the one who challenges the contestants on the show, where you're kind of like the Simon Cowell of the sharks? How did that happen?  ANSWER:  Either you make money or lose money. My feeling from day one, and you know Shark Tank has gone on for many years now, is that it's better to tell the truth. A couple of episodes ago, we got into an argument about it. The family comes out with a product or service and clearly it has no merit and the probability of success is extremely low. They're funding it with their own money. They're mortgaging their homes or going into credit card debt. The other sharks tend to say, "You know I'm not going to invest in it." It's clear to them also that it has no merit. And yet they'll give them encouragement to go on. Well, I find that incredibly disingenuous. Reality is going to strike anyway. And if they think it's tough in the shark tank, wait until they get out in the real world. They're going to get eaten alive. I'm not the mean guy; I'm the best friend they ever met. They're lucky they met me. Q: I happened to watch the show on Friday and saw you talking about this deal, this LuLu Bang sauce, and they already had some shelf space in Walmart. But you were really, really hard on them. Why? A: The numbers were showing it was failing in Walmart. The number of turns per week were too low to stay on the shelf. That consumer market is brutally competitive.  I'd argue that the chance of getting a hot sauce to actually return on an investment is extremely low unless you have a different strategy. I'm not saying it's impossible that they're successful, I'm just saying the probability is incredibly low. I'm the merchant of truth, that's what I am, and I'm Mr. Wonderful all bundled together. Q: Did you ever have a deal that you thought was a surefire bet but it bombed?  A: Mark (Cuban) and I did ToyGaroo and it went to zero. Lost a fair chunk of money on that one. They didn't understand their customer acquisition costs. (ToyGaroo, which went out of business, was to be the Netflix of toys. Parents would rent toys and send them back when the child was done playing with them.) Q: What are the signs of a winner?  A: One, they're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less. Take (Wicked Good) cupcakes for example. 'We make cupcakes. We put them in a Mason jar. We FedEx them all over America.' I get it. No. 2, they're able to articulate why they're the right team to execute the business plan. They want to grow their business; here's how they're going to do it. You get those two elements together you can start to sense in the Shark Tank things are starting to sizzle like an isotope. You realize these entrepreneurs have a plan. Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the Shark Tank, you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in Shark Tank history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of Shark Tank's first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. USA TODAY Life without lattes? Test-drive your retiree budget ahead of time Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it. They only disclosed the purchase price but none of the other terms. Why it worked so well is it had a very simple solution to a huge problem. People want printed versions of their children to show grandparents and extended family members. Not everybody uses their phone; they want a photograph.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Read the other stories in this series here. LA PLATA COUNTY, COLO. — The river gallops past ghost towns and plunges through canyons of quiet before tumbling into the old mining town of Durango. Legend has it that the Spanish christened these waters more than 300 years ago to honor a small band of conquistadors who died on its banks without receiving the sacrament of last rites. They called it El Rio de las Animas Perdidas. The River of Lost Souls. Today, some 53,000 people live in Durango and the surrounding county of La Plata. And all along the Animas, people are still dying before their time, particularly women in midlife, succumbing not to diabetes or heart disease, but to suicide. Two-and-a-half times as many people die by suicide as homicide in this country; among whites in 2014, it was nearly nine times as many, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although more men than women take their own lives, the rate of suicide has nearly doubled among middle-aged white women since 1999 — rising from 7 per 100,000 to 12.6 in 2014 — helping to explain a startling increase in their early mortality. The numbers are even worse for middle-aged white women with a high school diploma or less. For them, the suicide rate has more than doubled over the past 15 years, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal health data. Most of the victims lived in small towns and rural areas, particularly in the Southeast and in mountain states, where social isolation can be acute. Colorado has the fourth-highest suicide rate in the nation for white women ages 45 to 54. Among Colorado counties with a population of at least 30,000, La Plata has the highest. Since 2007, 14 middle-aged white women have killed themselves here. The Post looked at half of those cases and found striking commonalities: Most worked physically demanding jobs. Most suffered from chronic pain. And most struggled with mental-health issues that, surviving friends and relatives say, were addressed through psychiatric medications that were ultimately ineffective. Nationally, many mental-health experts have raised concerns about the growing use of such medications for everything from insomnia to ordinary loneliness. Between 1999 and 2013, psychiatric drug prescriptions shot up by 117 percent. The number of prescriptions written by non-psychiatrists also has risen. As many as 80 percent of all antidepressant prescriptions are written by physicians who are not psychiatrists, multiple studies have found, and doctors often give the drugs to people who have received no psychiatric diagnosis. Studies also show that the drugs work only about half the time and can produce side effects, such as anxiety and sleeplessness, that mimic worsening symptoms. Women are far more likely than men to receive these prescriptions: In the United States today, nearly 1 in 4 white women ages 50 to 64 is taking an antidepressant, according to federal health officials. No expert suggests that these medications are driving the uptick in suicide among this population. Research into that question is difficult, because many women on psychotropic drugs are already prone to depression and suicide. PhRMA, which represents the nation’s biggest drug companies, declined to comment for this story. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the nonprofit American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said the presence of multiple medications may suggest that the patient’s mental illness was particularly difficult to treat. “When I hear that someone is on more than three psychotropic medications, that tells me their doctor was going after the condition because the person didn’t respond to the first medication,” Moutier said. “There is a case to be made for rational polypharmacy.” However, Moutier added that multiple prescriptions can also suggest “suboptimal treatment.” And for women who believe the drugs hold the promise of a cure, other medical experts said, their failure can induce a withering spiral of hopelessness. “There’s all kinds of reasons to be depressed, and doctors are not attending to them anymore,” said Joel Paris, a professor of psychiatry at Canada’s McGill University. “What doctors are being told is, if the patient isn’t getting better, then you need to add another two or three [medications] to the regime. “The issue that antidepressants help about half the time is absolutely right.” The western slope of the Rockies has always had higher-than-average suicide rates, people venturing westward in search of excitement or escape and finding neither. For Pamela Beckert, Colorado was just another place to start over. Born in Ohio, Beckert grew up in Arizona. She was married twice but largely raised her son on her own. After Beckert’s father died in the 1990s, and with her son grown, she became a nomad, moving first to Fort Worth, then to Durango. Nothing felt permanent, including her jobs — a waitress in a bar, a process server, a security guard for Planned Parenthood. She had trouble paying rent, and sometimes her moods vacillated wildly. Through Medicaid, she received psychiatric medication from a Durango health clinic: Wellbutrin to raise her spirits; Lamictal to even out the mood swings; Klonopin for anxiety; Seroquel, an antipsychotic, to sleep. Sometime in the months before her death, Beckert stopped taking all of them and began stockpiling the pills. “It had become so dark at the end,” said Beckert’s son, Sean Dillman, who lives in Arizona. “I look back and I’ll always wonder what I could have done. But her demeanor was always the same. . . . I had no idea, no clue this is where she was at.” No longer able to afford her apartment, Beckert bunked with a friend and worried about where she would go next. When she asked a caseworker at the clinic about temporary housing, the young woman suggested Beckert live out of her Jeep at the back of the vast Walmart parking lot. Surely no one would notice her there. Pamela Beckert died of an overdose in this parking lot in Durango, Colo. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Wendy Faye Miller passed that Walmart on Route 550 nearly every day for decades. Most often, she was driving home from her bartending job at the Purgatory Mountain ski area, the road weaving around the Animas, where the outdoorswoman loved to raft and fish. Miller couldn’t wait to move to Durango. She left Waterford, Mich., at 17, missing her high school graduation to follow the man who would become her first husband. That was 42 years ago. About five miles east of downtown and half a mile past a sign that reads “Pavement Ends,” Miller lived in a mobile home until last December. A sagging porch and a tin roof secured with concrete bricks betray the home’s age. Most days, the only sounds are distant dogs barking at strange cars and the crunch of pickups passing on the unpaved road. When she lived here, Miller owned two horses until she was forced to sell them to pay bills. Her most beloved possession: a pearly white Harley-Davidson motorcycle. “She loved to ski. The outdoor lifestyle. She never grew out of it. Ever,” said her only sibling, younger sister Lorrie Searle, who still lives in Michigan. In addition to tending bar, Miller shoveled snow in the winter and sprayed mosquitoes for the county in the summer. Nearly all her life she also cleaned homes and businesses, including the office where her daughter, Autumn Concepcion, now works. It wasn’t easy: Miller had had two back surgeries for injuries suffered while breaking up a bar fight and falling down the stairs carrying a keg of beer. Autumn Concepcion’s mother, Wendy Miller, pictured in rear, killed herself at age 59. Autumn said she was very close to her mother and continues to grieve. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) The woman with the quick smile didn’t like being alone. She was an alcoholic, according to family and friends, but careful to conceal her misery. Only her daughter saw her mother’s sadness. “I could see her in town and she’d be fine, laughing, and then talk to her 20 minutes later at home, and it would be totally different,” Concepcion said. “Even her voice would change.” Miller’s daughter suggested she see a mental-health counselor in Durango. More than half of all counties in the United States — all of them rural — have no practicing psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers, according to a 2013 federal report. In La Plata County, only one mental-health clinic accepted Medicaid. Miller, unfortunately, qualified for Medicaid only part of the year, when she wasn’t earning wages above the federal poverty limit. Otherwise, she would have to pay on a sliding scale, and the scale didn’t slide quite enough. Miller visited just once. “She hid her pain,” said Crystal Andasola, a close friend. “She was a broken person, with a broken spirit, a broken soul.” Charlotte Sieber hanged herself when she was 54. (Family photograph) Charlotte Sieber fought depression for years, and then she battled her own medications. The Sweden native was a flight attendant when she met her future husband, Brad, more than 30 years ago. They settled in a small, fruit-tree-laden enclave just north of downtown Durango, where they had two children. He was a UPS driver; she found a job in a local clothing store. But 20 years ago, after injuring her neck and back in a series of automobile accidents, she could no longer work, and she spiraled into depression. “If she had a great day, it was usually two or three weeks before there was another,” said Sieber’s husband. The psychiatric medications doctors prescribed seemed to work only for a short time (when they did at all): the antidepressant Effexor, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Seroquel. There were others, too, but none offered long-term relief. “Multiple drugs overload the system in ways we can’t predict,” said Rene Muller, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins. “Everyone metabolizes drugs differently, which also affects how they interact with each other.” Four years ago, Charlotte Sieber met Jennifer Roeder, who told of her own travails trying to come off psychiatric medications when they failed to help her feel less depressed. “It was the first time she heard that maybe the drugs were hurting, not helping,” Roeder said. Sieber began to slowly wean herself off her many medications, tapering the drugs one at a time, according to family and friends, though she often had to stop to let her body and mind recover. “It’s really hard to withdraw from antidepressants,” said New York psychiatrist and pharmacology expert Julie Holland. In some cases, “people feel like cold water is running down their spine. They can feel their brain sloshing around, or electric zaps in their head.” By July 2015, Sieber had successfully discontinued all but one of her psychiatric medications. “One of her worst [side effects] was sleep. She could not sleep,” said Pati Wolfe, who often joined Sieber in the struggle to withdraw from drugs. “This went on for months and months. Maybe a couple of hours a night was all she would get.” It was so bad that Sieber had to move out of the bedroom she shared with her husband so he could get some sleep. Heart palpitations, obsessive worrying and anxiety clouded her nights. She lost weight and sometimes told friends it was too hard to talk to them. Toward the end of July 2015, Sieber texted Roeder: “I know I’m in a state of shock, never been this sick in my whole life. Of course the long process of tapering (6 years in Nov.) has worn me out.” Over the next two months, Sieber mostly retreated to her room, where she wrote in a journal and painted delicate pastoral scenes on seashells she had collected at the shore. At other times, she sat out back on an island deck, under the scrub oak and beside a stream that branches off a creek that branches off the River of Lost Souls. Seashells painted by Charlotte Sieber in Durango, Colo. Her husband, Brad, said she was happiest at the beach. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Pamela Beckert, 54, died Sunday, Jan. 15, 2013, after telling a friend, with whom she was living, that she might be late. “It’s going to get really, really cold. Don’t wait up for me,” Beckert told her. “I know my way home.” A week later, friends found her body, clad in a white winter jacket and jeans, a pair of mittens and clogs beside her. Beckert had bought a light blanket at Walmart and a cup of tea at Starbucks, downed dozens of pills from six different bottles of psychiatric medication, then lay down in the back of her Jeep Wrangler — at the far end of the Walmart parking lot. Wendy Miller, 59, died on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. It snowed hard all day in La Plata County, and Miller fell while leaving a house she had cleaned that afternoon. She was scheduled that evening to clean her daughter’s workplace, but Concepcion called to tell her they’d closed early. Miller asked her daughter to let her know when she got home safely, and at about 6 p.m. she did. Her mother texted back: “good, thank you, xoxo.” Miller was probably already home by then, after stopping to buy a fifth of McCormick vodka, which she nearly finished that night. About 9 p.m., she was on Facebook, making plans for her 60th birthday party in January. At one point she smoked a little pot, which usually helped her sleep. Then, sometime after 9:30 p.m., Wendy Miller crawled into bed, put a .38 Special in her mouth, and pulled the trigger. Her shopping list was still on the kitchen table: dish towels, laundry soap, milk. Brad Sieber reminisces about his wife, Charlotte Sieber, at his home in Durango. Sieber has struggled to reconcile his feelings about her death: “I'm a fixer. I fix things. But I couldn’t fix Charlotte.” (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) No one knows what Charlotte Sieber, 54, was doing in the hours before her death on Nov. 11, 2015. She was alone in her bedroom that Wednesday afternoon, with her 26-year-old son on the computer in the next room. Two weeks earlier, her husband, Brad, had called a suicide hotline. They told him to take her to the hospital, but he knew that was the last place his wife would go, afraid she’d be given even more medications. The final text Jennifer Roeder received from her friend had come five weeks earlier. Sieber had told her: “I’ve been really really bad, however it makes me feel worse talking about it . . . Trust me, I just need the pain and suffering (anxiety/fear/panic) to go away, not to mention the insomnia!” Sieber hanged herself from a rope thrown over a rod in a small closet in her bedroom. Later, her husband found a belt from one of her dresses, torn in half and thrown in the trash. It had taken her two tries to die. After his wife’s death, Brad Sieber’s anger banged its fist against his grief. Furiously, he scoured the house for the bottles of pills he believed had driven his wife to take her life. He found them in the medicine chest, the kitchen cabinets, the drawers of her desk — two dozen of them, maybe more — and poured them all, one by one, down the toilet. Then Sieber threw the bottles and all his wife’s medical files into a garbage bag and dragged the load out of the house. Beyond the rock garden, the apple trees and the stream from the creek from the River of Lost Souls, he spilled all those decades of pain into the backyard fire pit. And as the pyre burned into the twilight, Brad Sieber watched and wept.

Life Buy/Sell Health Close 1 of 2 Art Maines, standing, with his stepfather Bill Haney.  Maines wrote a book on scams against the elderly after his father fell victim to one. 123rf.com More older Americans are discovering social media, and scammers are there waiting for them By Jim Gallagher St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jim Gallagher Nov 6, 2016 (…) +1  Art Maines, standing, with his stepfather Bill Haney.  Maines wrote a book on scams against the elderly after his father fell victim to one. +1  123rf.com Nelda is 76, lives in central Missouri and is $27,000 poorer because she trusted a message that seemed to come from a friend on Facebook. Her case illustrates a nasty and evolving phenomenon: As more old people discover social media, they are finding new ways to get scammed. Nelda and her friend Susie had worked together at a school where Nelda managed the cafeteria. “I go to church with Susie,” said Nelda. “We’ve been together for years.” They were friends on Facebook so when the Facebook message came in September with Susie’s name attached, Nelda believed it. “Did you get your money yet?” the note asked. “Oh, I got mine.” Susie went on to explain that she’d received a big cash “grant” and saw Nelda’s name on the list of winners. She sent Nelda to a page on the Facebook website, which showed happy people standing by a UPS delivery truck. “This is a great organization,” Susie wrote. Nelda didn’t know that Susie’s Facebook account had been hacked, and that messages from Susie were really from a crook. Nelda didn’t ask that her last name be withheld in this story, but the Post-Dispatch is withholding it anyway. Scammers hunt for trusting victims, and Nelda is a prime catch. The local sheriff’s office confirmed that she reported the scam. Social media surge The sheriff has seen a “tremendous increase” in scam complaints as more older people learn to use social media, an officer said. “Five or 10 years ago, they were being scammed through the mail or by telephone.” Now, computers and smart phones do them in. Nelda is married, but her husband has mild dementia. She checked the website and soon found herself text messaging with an “agent.” “You have won prize money of $70,000 in an ongoing cash grant,” he wrote. The grant was sponsored by a “conglomerate” promoting responsible citizens. She was warned not to tell anybody about her good fortune, to protect the UPS drivers who would be carrying all that cash. Could this be true? Of course, said the fake Susie in another Facebook message. “I got $90,000,” she said. Nelda was delighted. “My granddaughter underwent major surgery today and this will help her,” she texted the agent. Then came the catch. Nelda had to pay an $850 delivery fee, then UPS would deliver the cash to her door. “You have to take cash to the MoneyGram store,” said the agent. Fake Susie was on Facebook again, assuring Nelda that she’d done the same thing and got the money. So, Nelda wired off the money. Then came another problem. The IRS had gotten wind of the windfall, and wanted $6,000 in taxes before the money could be released. “I had cancer a few months ago and I had to use about everything,” Nelda told the agent. “I am just devastated. This is crazy,” she said. But she followed instructions, traveling to Walmart and other stores and wiring four payments of $1,500. Dividing the payment was a smart move on the scammer’s part. Walmart clerks had become suspicious. “Do you know the person you’re sending money to?” they asked Nelda, who assured them that she did. The crooks played their games twice more — the truck had been in an accident, and another big delivery fee was needed. Then her award had been raised to $150,000, but she had to make another tax payment first. All the while, Nelda kept hearing from fake Susie on Facebook, urging her on. “This is very legitimate,” said Susie. When she told the scammer about the suspicious Walmart clerks, they sent her to a bank and had her send money to a Bank of America account. The routing number shows a branch near Richmond, Va. Amid it all, her son arrived on the scene and learned what was happening. “Mom, it’s a scam,” he told her. Nelda didn’t believe it. Then she went to church and saw the real Susie. Susie knew nothing about a grant, but she did know that her Facebook account had been hacked. Nelda realized that she’d been taken. “I told her (Susie), and she turned white and started crying,” said Nelda. “Then both of us were crying. I was just sick. I told my husband I may have really messed up,” said Nelda. Can she stand the loss of $27,000? “I’ll just live on Social Security,” she said. Warning signs Facebook and other social media sites are guidebooks for thieves. A member often lists relatives, friends, interests, education, personal events, with pictures attached. All that can be used to mimic another’s identity. “These people are as good at data mining as any big corporation,” said Art Maines, a St. Louis social worker who became a crusader against elderly fraud when his stepfather was scammed. Nelda was the victim of a scam with several variations. More often, victims are told they’ve won a sweepstakes, sometimes second prize in the Publisher’s Clearinghouse drawing. Sometimes they learn they’ve won a lottery. Facebook and other social media provide fodder for the “grandma” scam. The caller claims to be a grandson or other relative in deep trouble, needing money quickly to get out of jail or a jam. They know the names of family members, mention vacation and other family details. Any request for payment to use MoneyGram, prepaid cards, gift cards, iTunes cards, electronic transfers and the like is almost certainly a scam, says Bill Smith, investigator for the Better Business Bureau in St. Louis. Chances of recovering the money are nearly nil. Local law enforcement will investigate if it seems the thieves are local, but most fraudsters are outside the U.S. So it becomes a job for the FBI. Authorities in India recently emptied an entire building of people pretending to be IRS agents, arresting 70. They were on the phone to Americans, threatening to jail or sue them if they didn’t make big payments immediately. More than 600 others are under investigation. The IRS scam — which has become a national plague — illustrates a change in tactics for criminals, from sweet talk to threats. “It used to be that they were the nicest people you’d ever talk to. Now it’s about intimidation,” says Maines, author of “Scammed,” a book on preventing fraud of the elderly. A call from the IRS demanding money immediately is always a scam, says the IRS. The agency almost never calls taxpayers and always sends letters first. More younger victims Loneliness and cognitive loss can make certain old people easy marks for scammers. But the elderly as a group actually don’t seem more vulnerable than others. In fact, the old lose less to fraud than younger people, according to a survey of 2,000 people this year by the Better Business Bureau. Adjusted for their share of the population, the bigger losses are among people ages 18 to 54, with the greatest losses among those ages 25 to 34. People over 54 lose less, and that holds true for people over 65 and over 74 years old. “Far from the prevailing stereotypes, several studies have found that those most likely to be exposed, targeted and ultimately victimized are the young, the middle-aged, and the better educated,” the study said. Youth and education seem to bring overconfidence, the study suggests. They think they will recognize a rip-off, when they actually don’t. But older people are less likely to understand computers and the online world, and that can lead to losses. Rose Smith, 60, holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology and an associate degree in paralegal services. Her education didn’t save her from a sneaky computer scam. She downloaded what she thought was Microsoft Outlook software. The installation stopped, and a popup appeared advising that she call a toll-free number with questions. She called, and the technician, who had a foreign accent, gave her instructions that completely shut down her computer. “It was totally blank, blank, blank,” she said, and nothing she tried would revive it. “He told me the only way I could get the computer back was to pay him $200.” She’d have to purchase a gift card and tell him the numbers. “I was totally outraged. I realize that this guy totally scammed me,” said Smith, who lives in the Central West End and has gone public with her story on television. She paid the money.

A request that money be sent by Moneygram, or other wire transfer, through a gift or prepaid card or an iTunes card is a sure sign of a scam. News that you've won a prize, but must send money first in order to collect, is always a scam. The Federal Trade Commission offers these tips for friends of the elderly hoping to save them from being victimized.  Watch out for: Suspicious changes in wills or powers of attorney: Out of the blue, your grandfather wills all of his belongings to his new nurse. Financial activity the person couldn’t have done herself: You discover repeated ATM withdrawals from your bedridden mother’s bank account. Bills not being paid: When visiting a neighbor, you see mail piling up on his desk. Maybe his caregiver is using his money for something other than paying bills. Significant withdrawals or unusual purchases: You notice charges for fancy electronics on your thrifty aunt’s credit card bill.

Kevin O'Leary, celebrity investor, will speak at a forecast luncheon in Detroit Nov. 18 before the CFA Society Detroit. (Photo: Kevin O'Leary photos) Story Highlights Kevin O'Leary says Potato Parcel -- where people send messages on potatoes -- could prove popular. Two in 10 deals can go bankrupt; while two in 10 can skyrocket. Shark Tank can give an edge to those in middle. Competition is unbelievable in food; frozen products especially tough. ABC's "Shark Tank" has built enough of a quirky kind of brand recognition that an 11-year-old girl recently approached Kevin O'Leary at the San Francisco airport and wanted to talk about financing deals with convertible debentures. Everyone it seems has an idea about how a deal should be done — or an idea for a new product — to share with a shark. Celebrity investor O'Leary — who cofounded O'Shares, a line of exchange-traded funds — plans to visit Detroit on Nov. 18 to speak at the 2016 Forecast Luncheon for the CFA Society of Detroit at the Motor City Casino Hotel. The event, expected to attract more than 500 people, is also open to nonmembers. The ticket price for nonmembers is $65. See www.cfasociety.org/detroit. ► Related: 'Shark Tank' star thrills local candy makers The 62-year-old Canadian, who was once part of the cast of CBC's "Dragons' Den," chatted with me by phone last week about how entrepreneurs can get financing, life in the "Shark Tank" and why, more than likely, I shouldn't plan to strike it rich with a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Here are excerpts from that interview: QUESTION: How did you end up with the role as the one who challenges the contestants on the show, where you're kind of like the Simon Cowell of the sharks? How did that happen?  ANSWER:  Either you make money or lose money. My feeling from day one, and you know "Shark Tank" has gone on for many years now, is that it's better to tell the truth. A couple of episodes ago, we got into an argument about it. The family comes out with a product or service and clearly it has no merit and the probability of success is extremely low. They're funding it with their own money. They're mortgaging their homes or going into credit card debt. The other sharks tend to say, 'You know I'm not going to invest in it.' It's clear to them also that it has no merit. And yet they'll give them encouragement to go on. Well, I find that incredibly disingenuous. Reality is going to strike anyway. And if they think it's tough in the shark tank, wait until they get out in the real world. They're going to get eaten alive. I'm not the mean guy; I'm the best friend they ever met. They're lucky they met me. Q: I happened to watch the show on Friday and saw you talking about this deal, this LuLu Bang sauce, and they already had some shelf space in Walmart. But you were really, really hard on them. Why? A: The numbers were showing it was failing in Walmart. The number of turns per week were too low to stay on the shelf. That consumer market is brutally competitive. I'd argue that the chance of getting a hot sauce to actually return on an investment is extremely low unless you have a different strategy. I'm not saying it's impossible that they're successful, I'm just saying the probability is incredibly low. I'm the merchant of truth, that's what I am, and I'm Mr. Wonderful all bundled together. Q: Did you ever have a deal that you thought was a surefire bet but it bombed?  A: Mark (Cuban) and I did ToyGaroo and it went to zero. Lost a fair chunk of money on that one. They didn't understand their customer acquisition costs. (ToyGaroo, which went out of business, was to be the Netflix of toys. Parents would rent toys and send them back when the child was done playing with them.) Q: Have you ever worked with any businesses with a Michigan connection?  A: Yes, Talbott Teas. It was acquired by Jamba Juice. (West Bloomfield native Steven Nakisher and his partner Shane Talbott founded the Chicago-based company.) Q: What are the signs of a winner?  A: One, they're able to articulate the opportunity in 90 seconds or less. Take (Wicked Good) cupcakes for example. 'We make cupcakes. We put them in a Mason jar. We FedEx them all over America.' I get it. No. 2, they're able to articulate why they're the right team to execute the business plan. They want to grow their business; here's how they're going to do it. You get those two elements together you can start to sense in the "Shark Tank" things are starting to sizzle like an isotope. You realize these entrepreneurs have a plan. Here's the third thing, and this is where I've seen the air go out of the room, you have to know your numbers. If you get to the "Shark Tank," you get through the 100,000 applications, you're actually on the carpet, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in hell to perpetuity and I will personally put you there. What are your gross margins? What's your break-even analysis? How many competitors? How fast is the market growing? Q: You seem to do fewer deals than the other sharks. I don't know if that's true or not. But if it's true, why is that?  A: No, it's not true. I just tend to do very high-quality deals. The truth is I've had the largest exits in "Shark Tank" history. Groovebook, for example, was sold for $14.5 million cash. No one has done that before. Look at the success of something like Wicked Good Cupcakes. It's a monster hit. One of "Shark Tank"'s first royalty deals. Everybody was saying 'Wow, royalties, that's terrible.' No, it isn't. The family still owns 100%. It's the fastest-growing cupcake company in America, and I've made a lot of money, too. Look at IlumiBowl, everybody laughed at those kids from Salt Lake City. $7 million in sales. IllumiBowl — that's a toilet bowl light. You go near your toilet, it lights it up. Monster, mega smash hit. The other sharks have no imagination. I create deals. I look at them as pieces of art. Q: You mentioned Groovebook. Is it correct that you put $75,000 into that deal? So how much did you make personally? Why did it work out so well? A: We don't discuss the terms of the deal with Shutterfly; they bought it. They only disclosed the purchase price but none of the other terms. Why it worked so well is it had a very simple solution to a huge problem. People want printed versions of their children to show grandparents and extended family members. Not everybody uses their phone; they want a photograph. This thing sent catalogs every month of 100 of your top images of that month to every extended family member. It went viral. It exploded. The reason Groovebook or IllumiBowl or Wicked Good Cupcakes or recently the Potato Parcel. Think about how ridiculous that is:  somebody writes your name on a potato and mails it to you. I invested in that because I know what's going to happen. It's going to explode. The reason all that is occurring is that "Shark Tank" is an amazing platform. It has millions of people watching it every night. Q: Yet why doesn't everything work out? What are two or three things that really hold up a deal? A: If you look at venture investing since the late '50s, the typical model is you make 10 investments, two of them are phenomenally successful; 10, 100, 200 times on your money. Six of them are what are called the living dead where they stay alive but they make no money. And two of them go bankrupt within a year. It's the six living dead. The biggest challenge the living dead have is customer acquisition. So what happens in "Shark Tank" is some percentage of the living dead, the marginal companies, the ones that weren't going to make it in the normal world, get free advertising each year because they're in the "Shark Tank" family. The ones that do fail generally it's because execution skills aren't there. Q: I have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies, five kinds of chips, peanut butter, everybody loves it. The recipe was given to me by a colleague on the copy desk. How do I make money on those cookies? A: My advice to you is don't quit your day job. Q: And you haven't even tasted the cookies. A:  It doesn't matter how good they are. The competition is unbelievable. Every year we get somebody who has a 'bright light' dream of breaking into the cookie market. It's next to impossible.

Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has more than 11,500 stores globally, while a combined Shoprite and Steinhoff would have 9,211 stores in Africa, Europe, the UK, US and Australasia. But the much-talked-about deal is still just that - speculation. Outgoing Shoprite CEO Whitey Basson told Business Times this week he had not calculated the valuations on the rumoured acquisition. "[Christo] Wiese is the controlling shareholder, so he may have done the sums on it to see how it will affect him. "I'm not the major shareholder of Steinhoff, in fact I'm a small shareholder in Steinhoff and a reasonable shareholder in Shoprite, but the elements will have to tell you if there's a merger," said Basson. Africa's grocer gets to sleep in after 37 years There has been speculation about the acquisition of Shoprite by integrated retailer Steinhoff since about 2006, but the deal may soon become a reality with Basson's retirement. The announcement of his departure from the biggest grocer in Africa saw Shoprite's share price gain about 4.19% to R199.90 at the close on Monday, the most it has risen in two months. An Investec report cited in the Financial Mail said Wiese controlled more than 50% of Shoprite's voting rights and he could use this to push through a deal before April, when his voting rights drop below 50%. Wiese has a 16% stake in Shoprite through ordinary shares and an additional 291.8million deferred shares held through Thibault Financial Services, which carry 35% of Shoprite's total voting rights. Wiese also has an 18% stake in Steinhoff. It is not clear what strategy a combined group would follow, but it would be a sizeable business. Alec Abraham, a senior equity analyst at Sasfin Wealth, said a merged entity would not be as significant as Walmart. "They [Walmart] have got their foot in Africa via Massmart. It's not quite in the same space as Shoprite, so I don't think it's necessarily a major threat to them in any way. "It depends, however, if a Steinhoff and Shoprite combination would want to develop into different types of categories and become a general merchandise retailer. I don't believe that is the case," said Abraham.     If Steinhoff does make an offer for Shoprite, it won't be the first time the grocery retailer has been a target. In 2007, Brait Private Equity offered to buy Shoprite for R26 a share, or an initial offer of R14.2-billion, but shareholders rejected the deal after failing to agree on a revised offer. Since 2007, both Shoprite and Steinhoff's share prices have risen over 300%. Four years later, Wiese was appointed a non-executive director of Brait. Steinhoff bought Pepkor from Brait last year, and more recently bought Tekkie Town. Slow talk on fast-food stew In September this year, Wiese invested a further R24.3-billion in Steinhoff to help finance its acquisition spree in Europe and North America. Steinhoff had already bought furniture businesses Mattress Land in the US and Fantastic Holdings in Australia. It also bought UK discount retailer Poundland. Victor Dima, an analyst at Arqaam Capital, said a Steinhoff-Shoprite merger would only happen if it made sense for the shareholders. Dima said Shoprite's share price had risen because "they posted very strong and unexpectedly good numbers, especially when you look at African growth, and more so growth in Africa in constant currencies, [which] is over 50%". "So the market would be reacting on this news primarily, and with the announcement of Whitey leaving and the replacement, the market was not disappointed." Wiese could not be reached for comment this week, but in October he dismissed rumours that Steinhoff was poised to buy Shoprite, saying discussions had been going on for a number of years. But it may not only be Steinhoff that is looking at Shoprite. "There may be other companies, it's not just Steinhoff in the world, maybe Anglo American," Basson joked. "If we could merge then I can get a plane for cheap." Shoprite's share price declined 2.72% to R186.05 by the close on Friday.

Hillsborough County State Attorney Mark Ober’s office wasted time and tax-payer money prosecuting a 57-year-old disabled mother for stealing $29 of flea medicine—allegedly because Ober didn't want to upset the local Walmart. In early 2014, Vicki Carll was walking out of a Tampa Walmart when she "two men grabbed her, manhandled her and dragged her back into the store," according to WTSP. From their report: At the time Carll says she was baffled. “I didn't know what was happening, I thought I was being mugged,  actually, because I had $500 in my hand and I didn't know what was going on, I had no idea.” It turned out Carll was being arrested for shoplifting. The security guard who was waiting on a bench next to the exit said she stole flea medication worth $29. According to a civil suit Carll filed against Walmart early this week, Carll had examined the flea medication while in the store, but put it back on the shelf once she realized it was the wrong kind. She hadn't realized that a "floor walker," a pseudo security-guard whose job is to identify shoplifters, had been following her around the store. Carll says that the floor walker, Arismendy Rosario, picked up the flea medication, planted the evidence, and then waited for her to leave the store. From WTSP: [Carll's Attorney Barry] Cohen claims this was an elaborate plan by the security guard to frame his client. In a lawsuit filed Monday afternoon, Cohen points out the security tape shows the guard, who just started that day, dumped something on the floor from a box and then seconds later accused Carll of stealing that item. According to Cohen, a veteran attorney, “I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy, in this case the Walmart employee, was actually caught on video planting the evidence." According to Carll's complaint, the video footage shows: Mr. Rosario himself removing the individual pet medication doses from its box as he sat on the bench awaiting Ms. Carll to arrive from the checkout register […] Mr. Rosario placing the individual medication doses on the ground underneath the bench where he sat and waited for Ms. Carll to arrive from the checkout register […] Rosario and [another employee] forcefully dragging Ms. Carll back inside the store entrance to the point next to Rosario’s bench under which he had hidden the medication. […] Mr. Rosario reaching back under the bench to retrieve the pet medications from where he had placed them. Mr. Rosario then accused Ms. Carll of stealing the medication. It was Mr. Rosario's first day on the job. Carll called the incident ”the most humiliating thing you could ever go through.” Despite the fact that video evidence clearly proved that Carll had not stolen anything, Ober's office arrested and charged Carll. Prosecutors spent ten months of time and money on the case, refusing to drop it and ultimately taking her to trial.  The jury took less than sixty seconds to acquit Ms. Carll of the crime. WTSP reported that one juror “said it seemed obvious the guard planted the evidence and couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case.” As is custom in shoplifting cases, Walmart could have asked the state's attorney's office not to press charges. But instead they asked prosecutors to bring charges, “apparently decid[ing] to carry the charade of criminal proceedings to their ultimate conclusion by jury trial just to try to protect itself from civil liability by not admitting the outrageous wrongdoing of its own employees,” according to the lawsuit. Ober's office should have refused to prosecute. The video evidence demonstrated that Carll had been framed. Not to mention the allegedly stolen items were only worth $29 anyway. But in the end, Ober spent ten months of time and tax payer dollars on a case that was the definition of open-and-shut. Why would Ober's office decide to charge her and take her to trial? Carll claims it's because Ober cared about Walmart instead of justice. Carll filed a lawsuit this week against the retail giant, as well as against Rosario, and the other employee who restrained her. From her complaint: Unfortunately, the decision by the Hillsborough County State Attorney to proceed with the charges against Ms. Carll and to take this farce all the way through a jury trial speaks more to the desire to maintain WAL-MART’s good graces, political influence and financial support in an election year than it does to the duty of a prosecutor to seek the truth and to subject a citizen to criminal charges only when there is a valid and good faith basis to believe that the person is, in fact, guilty of those charges. That sense of duty was conspicuously absent in this case, according to Ms. Carll’s jury. Ober is up for re-election on Tuesday. He's running against Democrat Andrew Warren, a former federal prosecutor. 217 Comments Share this article 221 221 221 217 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, told police he raised his concerns to management at the Hermitage store last week but "no decision had been made" regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint Friday. McClimans decided one "solution" to the problem was shooting his co-worker so McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol and drove to the store, the complaint said. Although McClimans originally planned to shoot the other employee outside the store, McClimans went in and shot him about 10:30 p.m. Thursday, the complaint said. The employee was shot four times, including twice in the back, authorities said. He was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. Hermitage police said he's expected to recover. An attorney for McClimans wasn't listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment. McClimans also is charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license. The Wal-Mart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday after the shooting. It reopened Friday morning. Store employees wouldn't comment, but Wal-Mart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. "Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated," Crowson said. "We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement." Wal-Mart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. Although McClimans told police he's switching genders, it wasn't known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked "male" on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans.

When Barb Johnson Frank spotted the red plaid shirt hanging on a rack in the men’s department at Wal-Mart late this summer, she snatched it up. It wasn’t the Official Lucky Husker Shirt yet, but she wore the button-down to the season opener and cheered the team to a 43-10 victory over Fresno State. And she wore it when the Huskers cruised past Wyoming 52-17. And when Week 3 rolled around with another Husker victory -- The Ducks! We beat the Ducks! -- she began to feel quite fond of the garment she’d considered merely “serviceable” when she purchased it. Then came Northwestern, that not-too-tough road game that looked pretty grim at halftime. Barb was there. Her shirt was there, but she’d stuffed it in her bag. “I layer,” the retired teacher explained Friday. Barb and her husband, Alan, were at the road game with longtime friends and fellow fans Carla and Rob Nixon. “So she puts it on and all the sudden, the game changes,” Carla said. Final score: 24-13. Huskers 4-0. And that’s when that piece of permanent press, made in Bangladesh, became Barb’s Official Lucky Husker Shirt. Her contribution to the 2016 team. Maybe you have a lucky Husker shirt, too. Or a pair of charmed earrings or a troll doll talisman (like Robert Smith), or a game-changing ritual, like watching the game from the kitchen if Nebraska fumbles or the other team scores (like Mary Ryan). Maybe you painted your toenails lime green in August (like me) and found yourself unable to switch to scarlet because the original shade got the team past Illinois and Indiana and Purdue. Or maybe the team went 7-0 because you vacuumed before sitting down to watch (like Pam Holmes). Or you rediscovered your corduroy Husker cap from 1990 and started donning it every Saturday (like Jerry Basham). You get it. You can’t call plays (admit it), and you can’t catch a pass, block a punt or open up a hole for Terrell Newby, but you do what you can. You hoist your Husker flag before 8 a.m. every game (like Sue Barie Buller) and the team keeps winning. You sit in the same spot to watch with your neighbors and the Huskers eke out another W. You record every game, you put Husker scarves on your Shelties’ necks, you faithfully wear the same cheesy football earrings. Which is why on the Thursday before the team’s trip to Camp Randall, Barb carefully folded her shirt with its perfect record -- and Top 10 ranking -- and slipped it into a plastic bag and walked into the Athletic Department offices. She handed it to a friendly young woman at the reception desk, saying: Here, this shirt needs to go to Wisconsin. “I told her I didn’t think it was necessary to have it on the field, just throw it in the equipment truck or something -- it just has to be within range.” She included a few photos in the package -- the lucky shirt hanging from the bronze arm of Bob Devaney, another of her godson with the same statue outside the stadium, a third of the happy post-game scene in Evanston. "Shirt was needed," she wrote in black marker. She included a handwritten note. Dear Coach Riley, Assistant Coaches and our Beloved Huskers … Barb Johnson Frank here. Love my Huskers and always will. The fan who grew up in Iowa and moved to Lincoln in 1971 wrote that this team was her favorite in all those years. You guys have heart -- for each other, for your school and the state, for challenges of all sorts, for the game … Enclosed please find my official LUCKY shirt. When I found Barb this week, courtesy of her friend Carla, she didn’t know what had happened to her shirt. The young woman at the athletic department had smiled “knowingly,” she said. “She seemed like she’d probably seen it all.” She probably had, said Mary Lyn Wininger, football office secretary for 21 years, 15 of them working for Tom Osborne. The most memorable: dozens of four-leaf clovers, picked, pressed, laminated and delivered by a female fan. “She wanted us to give them to the players for good luck,” the retired secretary said. (She can’t say for sure, but it might have been 1995. GBR.) On Friday, Barb posed once again with Bob Devaney. She wore her back-up lucky shirt, identical to the first one. (She bought two that day, just in case.) She explained why this 2016 team is so special. “I like the way Coach Riley thinks about his work and what it means to teach college students about life.” She explained her soft spot for his players. “I really do think they have heart. I appreciate just the way they’ve stood with each other through a really tough situation.” She didn’t go back to the football office to get her lucky shirt back. She wasn’t sure she wanted to know if it had made the trip. (It did, on the equipment truck.) Barb felt like the red plaid shirt from Wal-Mart had accomplished its mission, despite the loss in Madison. A fine record of 7-1. And a fan happy to be cheering her Huskers this Saturday night. Bringing them all the luck she possibly can straight from the bottom of her Big Red Heart. Reach the writer at 402-473-7218 or clangekubick@journalstar.com. On Twitter @TheRealCLK.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, told police he raised his concerns to management at the store last week but “no decision had been made” regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint Friday. McClimans decided one “solution” to the problem was shooting his co-worker, so he took his grandfather’s .380-caliber pistol and drove to the store, the complaint said. Although McClimans originally planned to shoot the other employee outside the store, McClimans went in and shot him about 10:30 p.m. Thursday, the complaint said. The employee was shot four times, including twice in the back, authorities said.

Beach students treated to shopping spree for items lost in Matthew By Liz Kilmer Published: November 4, 2016, 10:51 pm Updated: November 4, 2016, 11:23 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) – Virginia Beach middle school students whose families lost items in Hurricane Matthew were treated to a Walmart shopping spree on Friday. The Plaza Middle School PTA collected donations to provide 23 families with $350 to spend at the Phoenix Drive location from 6 to 8 p.m. “It brings joy to me, and I hope that we brought joy to them,” said the school’s principal, Joe Burnsworth. 10 On Your Side walked the aisles with a family who lost everything in the storm. “We lost all of our furniture, and 90 percent of our clothes, it’s been rough,” said Shane Saddler. Saddler’s twins, Logen and Haylee, attend seventh grade at Plaza. Haylee and her mom were at their Windsor Oaks home when 17 inches of water poured in. “I felt quite upset,” Haylee told 10 On Your Side. During the shopping spree, called “Spend with a Friend,” the family filled shopping carts with toys, clothes, pillows, a Bible, and other items. “Just being thankful to have this opportunity to put smiles on the kids’ face, and for them to be able to get things that they need and want,” Shane said. The Saddlers said they’ve received help and assistance ever since the storm. “We have at church a disaster relief program,” Logen said. Someone connected to Haylee’s swim team provided a trailer for the family to stay in for the months it will take to repair their home. “You can see how many people have stepped forward,” the seventh grade girl told 10 On Your Side. While the storm has been devastating for the family, they are grateful for the help they’ve received. Shane said she is grateful for what the tragedy can teach to her children. “I would hope this would teach them to never take things for granted,” she said. “And always help somebody else who is in need.” The PTA will continue collecting donations for the holidays. If you’d like to help out, call Kim Henson at 757-816-2686 or make checks payable to Plaza Middle School PTA.

The smart speaker that's infused with Google Assistant can be yours for $129. It's Google's direct competitor for Amazon's Echo line, which means you shouldn't expect it to ever be sold by the mega-retailer. Google Home is a US-only product for now. Aside from being able to talk to it and ask it various questions, you can also control certain smart home devices (the list of supported ones should grow in the future). The 4K Chromecast Ultra which Google announced alongside the Home speaker has started shipping today, for those who pre-ordered from the Google store. The $69 device isn't officially available in any brick and mortar stores yet. And speaking of things that aren't officially available, the Daydream View VR headset should only be out on November 10, according to Google itself. That said, some people who have pre-ordered the Daydream View are starting to receive their units, which have been shipped early. That would normally be cause for celebration, but in this case there's a problem: using the headset requires an app called Google VR Services, which simply doesn't exist on the Play Store yet. We assume that will be published on November 10, so if you do get your Daydream View early, it looks like you'll have to wait a few days before you can use it.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) Acquires The Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts PARK CITY, Utah, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) is pleased to announce that the company has acquired The Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts, previously owned by CW Capital. The center is the latest project to join the PREP Strategic Investments portfolio. PREP is an independent company that separated the Strategic and Net Lease Investments business units from Phillips Edison and Company in May 2015. “We are excited to add this regional shopping center located in the main retail corridor of Boston’s South Shore,” said Michael C. Phillips, PREP President and Chief Executive Officer. “The future of this project represents what PREP is about, transforming retail, creating value and developing a shopping center for people to shop, dine and gather for years for come.” The Hanover Mall, a single-level regional enclosed mall, is comprised of 732,101 square feet, anchored by Macy’s, Sears and Walmart with several national outparcel tenants including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Trader Joe’s, Panera Bread, Buffalo Wild Wings, Petco and Office Max. The property was built in 1971 and was last renovated in 2004. Situated on Route 53 with immediate access to Route 3, the major thoroughfare servicing the communities south of Boston, the property features average daily traffic counts in excess of 26,600 and 60,900 vehicles, respectively. With a legacy of transforming retail properties, PREP has the expertise and experience to optimize retail property value. PREP identifies prime locations with development or redevelopment opportunities through a focused investment strategy. The Strategic Investment portfolio currently has three projects, two of them ongoing. The ongoing projects include Kenwood Collection in Cincinnati, Ohio and The Shoppes at Parma in Parma, Ohio. Kenwood Collection is a mixed-use development located next to Kenwood Towne Centre. The development includes 293,000 square feet of class-A office space, known as the Tower at Kenwood Collection, and 260,000 square feet of retail space on two levels. In addition, the project features a 2,300-space parking garage. The Shoppes at Parma is in the midst of an exciting transformation through its multi-phase redevelopment. The 750,000 square-foot open air center is anchored by J.C. Penney, Dick’s Sporting Goods, recently opened Gordmans, Walmart Supercenter and Marc’s grocery store and features specialty retailers, services and a wide variety of dining options. “Hanover Mall represents an ideal opportunity for PREP to apply our expertise and revitalize this well-known property to its full potential,” said Roy Williams, PREP Chief Investment Officer. “Now that the acquisition process has been concluded, we look forward to focusing our efforts on a comprehensive strategy that will reinvent the retail experience.” About PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) PREP has incorporated Phillips Edison & Company’s former development and strategic retail divisions and will focus on the acquisition, repositioning and management of power and lifestyle centers, enclosed malls, mixed-use retail projects and single-tenant developments.  PREP is a fully integrated real estate operating and asset management company. The company has expertise in every discipline of retail shopping center operation and management.

Done Editing Tags 94 Comments Share this article 89 89 89 Massachusetts is in the middle of its most expensive ballot measure fight ever—over the expansion of charter schools. Dark money has poured in from outside the state pushing a yes vote on Question 2, which would dramatically increase the number of new charter schools allowed each year, while unions in the state and the national unions they’re affiliated with have had to spend millions fighting back. More than 200 local school committees and 30 mayors have opposed Question 2. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is opposed. So is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. So what’s it all about? Charter school advocates like to frame their position as being somehow about civil rights, but let’s put it this way: you’ve got the Walmart Waltons pouring millions into charter expansion vs. the NAACP and the Movement for Black Lives opposing it. Juan Cofield, president of the New England Area Conference of the NAACP, is a leader in the fight against Question 2. He writes that Massachusetts charter schools: … don't serve students with serious special needs. They are not accountable to the local taxpayers who must pay for them. And many charter schools have been cited by the state for using hyper-disciplinary policies that target black and disabled students at shockingly disproportionate rates. You won't hear these facts from the billionaire backers of Question 2, who have a long history of claiming charter schools will "save" poor students of color, in an obvious effort to appeal to white progressives. Yes, there are individual schools that are falling short, and we must invest in them. What we must not do is allow 2016 to go down in history as the year Massachusetts cemented into law a separate and inherently unequal school system. If Question 2 passes, it will perpetuate de facto segregation by siphoning vital public education funds off to privately-run schools that only educate a select group of students. When he talks about siphoning funds, he’s not kidding. Question 2 would threaten bond ratings for Boston and three other cities, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Why is that? Nancy Grossman, a municipal treasurer, explains how this siphoning works: For simplicity’s sake, imagine a neighborhood school with 1,000 students and a $15,000,000 budget, or $15,000 per child. Assume that a very conservative one-third of this budget might go to relatively fixed costs for maintenance, debt service, basic administration, custodial staff and other costs that don’t vary significantly with student population. Thus, $5 million goes to fixed costs, $10 million to variable expenses such as instructional costs — $10,000 per child. If 200 students “choice-out” for charter schools and take with them perhaps $13,000 each (factoring in temporary state tuition offsets which this year average just 11 percent of assessed tuition) or $2.6 million, that leaves $12.4 million to run the school. Five million is still needed for fixed costs; $7.4 million is left for instructional needs. Dividing this amount by the 800 remaining students equals $9,250 left for instructional needs and other non-fixed costs, or $750 less per student. And, since charters educate proportionally fewer special-needs children, district schools shoulder a higher percentage of costs to educate these kids, but with fewer dollars per child available to do so. Author and former teacher Jonathan Kozol argues that the siphoning goes beyond dollars: … an even greater loss may be the draining-off of parents who no longer have a stake in advocating for the schools from which they’ve chosen to depart. Their advocacy efforts take place in a new and more select domain from that moment on. Who will stand up for the children at the schools they’ve left behind? Slice it any way you want. Argue, as we must, that every family ought to have the right to make whatever choice they like in the interests of their child, no matter what damage it may do to other people’s children. As an individual decision, it’s absolutely human; but setting up this kind of competition, in which parents with the greatest social capital are encouraged to abandon their most vulnerable neighbors, is rotten social policy. What this represents is a state-supported shriveling of civic virtue, a narrowing of moral obligation to the smallest possible parameters. It isn’t good for Massachusetts, and it’s not good for democracy. It’s significant that this fight is happening in one of the states with the very best public schools in the country—if opponents of public education can win in Massachusetts, it will be that much harder to fight back elsewhere. If you’re a Massachusetts voter, please vote no on Question 2. And wherever you live, pass the word on to your friends in Massachusetts. 94 Comments Share this article 89 89 89 94 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Photo: Trae Patton/NBC Superstore Thursday, 8:30 p.m., NBC Trigger warning, retail clerks: Thursday’s fall finale of “Superstore” could induce pre-traumatic stress disorder. In the second of two back-to-back holiday episodes (the first airs at 8 p.m.), the Cloud 9 employees put on a hell of a Black Friday display to kick off the holiday shopping season. On Black Friday, a potluck for staff members before the big-box store opens results in rampant food poisoning, including Amy (America Ferrera) and Jonah (Ben Feldman). They fight over bathroom-stall access while powering through a long shift that features door-busting by early-arriving customers. Amid the havoc, Amy confronts her troubled relationship with her husband, Adam (Ryan Gaul), while the will-they-or-won’t-they flame heats up between her and Jonah, despite the insalubrious conditions. Some Cloud 9 employees fare better than others — and there are significant cliffhangers. (“Superstore” returns at 8 p.m. Jan. 5.) The Post recently spoke with creator and executive producer Justin Spitzer, who said upwards of 100 extras were brought in daily to play store customers for the five-day shoot, which took place last month at Universal Studios in LA. What is your goal with this episode? If you go onto YouTube and look up Target, Kmart or Walmart on Black Friday, what you see is so crazy it feels like you’re watching a [TV] show. We just wanted to hit the chaos as much as possible. Where did the food-poisoning storyline come from? A lot of these stores provide meals to employees because it’s such a big day. To make the chaos of Black Friday pay off, we thought, “What’s the worst thing that could happen on the busiest day of the year?” And that’s one of them. Amy (America Ferrera) and Adam (Ryan Gaul) may be at a crossroads on “Superstore.”Photo: Bill Inoshita/NBC Do you feel bad for retailers who have to work Black Friday, much less Thanksgiving Day? [laughs] Of course; it’s got to be terrible. That’s an incredibly, incredibly difficult job, especially on that day. Sometimes they’ll get time-and-a-half, so there’s some compensation — but I don’t think anybody enjoys that experience. On top of all the mayhem at the store, Amy also has a pregnancy scare. Why did you include that? We wanted to use the scare as a catalyst for her to take some action in her marriage. She’s known in the back of her head that things aren’t great with Adam. But when you’re working all the time and with the day-to-day grind, sometimes you don’t act on those things. Any particular Black Friday moments that you think worked best? We have a somewhat emotional scene between Jonah and Amy while they’re sitting in side-by-side toilets. I’m pretty happy about the fact that we managed to do that. And I don’t know how much credit I can take for it, but America [Amy] at the end talking to her husband gave me goose bumps on set and when I watched it. — Eric Hegedüs And here’s what else to watch this week: Great Performances: Gypsy Friday, 9 p.m., PBS “Gypsy” has been revived countless times, but there was something extra special about the 2015 London production with Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”), who played Mama Rose.

By: Elizabeth Cameron For Metro Published on The sixth annual “Stuff this Truck” food drive for the Veterans Food Bank transformed the parking lots of the Royal Oak and 130 Avenue Walmarts into donation centres this weekend. The goal? Beat last year’s haul of eight full-sized skids. “The number of hampers we require this year has almost doubled from last year, so any help we can get it appreciated,” said John Sereda, a veteran and volunteer with the food drive organized by the Canadian Army Veterans Motorcycle Units. Sereda said Alberta’s economy is a factor in the huge increase. “We’re seeing an increased number of vets suffering from PTSD, or having a hard time adjusting after they leave the service,” he said. “We have some veterans from Afghanistan, and some going back to the Second World War, so there are a lot of people who need our support.” The Veterans Food Bank is looking for donations of non-perishable goods, cash, and toiletries. “Any items you would need, veterans could use them as well,” Sereda said. “I think we could always do more for our veterans, but the support we are seeing in Calgary has been quite phenomenal,” he added. Volunteers will be at the South Trail Crossing Walmart (130 Avenue) until 5 p.m. Sunday.

SWEET HOME CHICAGO: Chicago's spectacular skyline. Once there was Hope. Now there’s Park Ridge. “Hillgrimages” are as popular as “Billgrimages”. The party faithful and the compulsive-obsessive Instagrammers and Snapchatters stretch their selfie sticks as far as they will go and take photos of themselves under the “Rodham Corner” sign at the intersection of Wisner Street and Elm in Cook County, Illinois. READ NEXT Travel digest with Barry Couglan They pull faces outside “The Wonk’s House” in Park Ridge, an upper middle-class but not very quiet suburb about 10 miles north-west of downtown Chicago, under the approach path to the city’s O’Hare Airport. Park Ridge is a significant if not sacred neighbourhood. It is where Harrison Ford grew up. It is also the childhood home of the wife of the 42nd President and the only First Lady to be subpoenaed and fingerprinted by the FBI.  The first First Lady of the United States to have a postgraduate degree from Yale.  The first woman to be elected as a US Senator and the first Grammy-winning Democratic Party Presidential nominee who is a US Marine reject, a frustrated astronaut, a former Alaskan cannery fish descaler, a self-described “Rorschach Test” and the daughter of a fabric store owner and homemaker. As well as an ex-Republican. Hillary Rodham Carter Clinton campaigned for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in 1964.  The Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement (particularly the speeches of Martin Luther King) and her opinion that the Richard Nixon campaign against Nelson Rockefeller included “veiled racism” prompted Hillary Clinton to leave the Republican party in 1968. She worked in the Carter Administration. Bill Clinton put Arkansas on the map. Hillary too. They have made it a tourist destination. Pre-Clintons, Arkansas was backwater, rural Nowheresville. You didn’t run for public office. You ran for the state line. Prior to the Clintons, the most famous thing to have been born and to grow up in Arkansas was the world’s biggest-ever watermelon. All 255lbs of it. Before Bill and Hillary, all Arkansas could boast was producing more broiler chickens and less rocket scientists per capita than any other US state. So short of homegrown attractions was Arkansas that its official brochure actually boasted of having milk as its state beverage as well as some of North America’s prettiest sedge. The state now boasts a bauxite museum, the birthplace of “Walmart”(Bentonville) and, at the eastern edge of the state, Johnny Cash’s boyhood home at 4791 West Country Road, Dryess. But Arkansas’ biggest draw and tourist revenue magnet is the “Clinton Heritage Trail” featuring Bill-and-Hillary related places of interest.  The fairytale story of Hempsted County’s favourite son began in 1946. The ex-President’s actual birthplace, the Julia Chester Hospital on south Main Street in Hope, is no longer there which says much for his much-vaunted healthcare programme. It is now a funeral home which says even more. His two boyhood homes at 117 S. Hervey (where he lived from 1946-1950) and 321 W.13th are major landmarks and tourist must-sees. Busloads of fans visit them every day. South Hervey features a replica of an Oval Room rug. In Hope you can visit the graves of Bill’s parents and grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who looked after him after his father died in a car crash and before his mother married Roger Clinton, a local car dealer. The Clinton Route (affectionally known by some as the “Clinton Teen Boy Trail” ) takes you to “National Historic Sites”, scenes of keynote speeches, momentous soundbites, extraordinary feats of gladhanding and self-indulgent saxophone solos. It takes you to his old schools, the Park Place Baptist Church where he was baptised and on to 1011 Park Avenue, Hot Springs where he moved at the age of eight.  You can visit “Bathhouse Row” and the 1924 “Arlington Hotel” where he had his junior and senior proms. Al Capone holidayed there in the 1930s. After Yale (Connecticut), where he met Hillary, William Jefferson Blyth Clinton became professor of law at Fayetteville in his home state where Hillary, graduating from Yale in 1973, also got a job in the prestigious “Rose” law firm.  You can stroll the University of Arkansas campus and Waterman Hall where they courted. You can visit the “D-lux Café” ( now “36 Club Uber”) where the couple are meant to have engaged in energetic discussions about the future of the world and volubly cared about the world. There are many park benches where they might have once sat. For only $8 admission, you can snap yourself in front of a replica of Hillary’s wedding dress in their first home on 930 West Clinton (formerly California Boulevard) , a 1930 Tudor Revival bungalow where they married on October 11, 1975. The Clinton Home Museum’s phone number is 877-BIL- N-HIL. The museum also a First Ladies Rose Garden to which Bill might soon be making a contribution of his favourite cultivar. There are also homes on L and Midland Streets. The end of Arkansas’s “Billhillgrimage” love-in visitor attraction experience is the state capital and Little Rock’s 1950 Georgian-Colonial Governor’s Mansion where he was governor for 12 years.  He was first elected at the age of 32. It used to be an institute for the blind. Tours can be arranged. To see the buildings Louis XV1 chandeliers, silver from the USS Arkansas and a 1770 Waterford grandfather or “cabinet” clock. The Old State House is where Bill announced his bid for the presidency in 1991 and delivered his acceptance speeches in 1992 and 1996. The 1908 Arkansas Gazette Building served as his campaign headquarters during the 1992 presidential election. There are gift shops everywhere. The best-selling T-shirt in fishing-mad Arkansas (“The Natural State”) is still “The Best Way To A Man’s Heart Is Through His Fly”. There is also a museum. Or rather Little Rock’s huge “ William J. Clinton Presidential Centre and Library” which chronicles the couple’s extraordinary “ life of service”. It contains his beloved “Cadillac One” car, intimate photos of the family’s pets and a Valentine’s message from Hillary. There is also a reconstruction of the White House’s Oval Room. The Clintons have an apartment above the library overlooking the river and the Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. Illinois boasts the home of Ohio-born Ulysses S. Grant in Galena and Ronald Reagan’s childhood home in Dixon, as well as Lincoln’s house in Springfield and Barack Obama’s senator’s mansion on South Greenwood Drive, which is inaccessible to the public. A popular Obama place of worship is his old hairdressers, “The Hyde Park Hair Salon” on the University of Chicago campus, as well as restaurants like the “Valois Diner”, “R.J.Grunt’s” and “Spiaggia”. Not to be undone by Arkansas, “The Land of Lincoln” now has its own leg of the “Clinton Trail” starting at Hillary’s nativity site of the now abandoned Edgwater Hospital at 5700 N.Ashland Avenue. The Windy City’s Hillary tours take in her former family two-storey home (sold in 1987) at 235 Wisner which she shared with younger brothers Hugh and Anthony.  And her schools — the Eugene Field Elementary School at 707 Wisner, Maine East School on W. Dempster (where, years earlier, fellow Oak Ridger Harrison Ford was the first sports announcer on its student radio station) and Main South High —where Hillary the wonk (swot) was voted “most likely to succeed”; and where she began her social justice activism”, organising a babysitting group to look after the children of migrant Mexican workers in rural Illinois. The tours tell you that Hillary used to sometimes come to class in the ninth grade wearing her Girl Scout uniform. There is also Prospect Avenue’s 1928 Art Deco“Pickwick Theatre” movie palace. Sadly, despite Hillary’s ringing endorsements and schmaltzy memories of its onion rings and burgers, her favourite “Pickwick Restaurant” next door has closed. Hillary accepted the post of Secretary of State from President-elect Obama at the Chicago Hilton. She attended the private, all-women, liberal-arts Wellesley College in Massachusetts. This is where she worked on her political agendas in and she made her famous “breakout” militant commencement speech on behalf of the Class of ’69 and the youth of the Western world. Contemporaries remember a young lady who knew where she wanted to go and how she wanted to get there and what it would take.

Samsung has been going through a rough patch lately. 2016 has not been kind to Samsung. The year started off well with great Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Reviews. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Sales were going great however things turned sour when Samsung faced a twice –over recall and discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung now faces another recall. This time it is a Samsung washing machine. Samsung is issuing a recall of 2.8 million washing machines. It has been proven that these machines are defected. It is possible that a portion of the machine may detach while in use. This is very hazardous. It may cause potential injury due to the explosion risk. Given Samsung’s current customer relations this recall is not good at all. Almost 733 reports have been received by Samsung which faced the issue. Nine out of these machines also caused injury. Samsung has given two options in this scenario in a press release. One can just hope this recall does not cause more damage to the company than the Galaxy Note 7.

Elections White House Nation Cartoons Sign In Subscribe Sign In Subscribe Customer Service Customer Service Contact Us Sign In Newsletters Subscribe Subscriber Services Politics All Politics Congress White House Elections Nation All Nation Courts & Crime Economy National Security Cartoons About Us More Politics News November 6, 2016 12:09 PM Sussman who? Maine liberals move on after megadonor's exit By MARINA VILLENEUVE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story AUGUSTA, Maine The loss of a liberal megadonor's millions of dollars in contributions this election season led Maine Democrats fighting to regain control of the state Senate to increasingly lean on a national Democratic Party group targeting state races in the state legislature where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats the House. Maine Democrats' $2 million push to pick up at least three Senate seats in rural districts comes as the independent-minded New England state is becoming less reliably blue. Billionaire hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman once provided $1 out of every $7 raised by Maine's Democratic Party and its House and Senate campaign committees. But his donations have dried up since he and Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree announced last year that they were divorcing. "Any time you lose a donor of that magnitude, it's a big deal, especially in a state such as Maine," said Mark Brewer, University of Maine political science professor. As Sussman turns his attention to the presidential race, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, a national committee that offers financial assistance to state leaders and candidates, has stepped in by contributing $1.5 million this election cycle to Maine's Democratic Party and House and Senate campaign committees — double what it gave in 2012. The Washington, D.C.-based group — financed by unions, Wal-Mart and pharmaceutical companies — says Democrats have a good shot at five seats in areas where President Barack Obama received at least 55 percent of the vote in 2012. "GOP Gov. Paul LePage's bigoted, racially charged comments and erratic behavior have damaged the Republican brand in the state," reads the website of the group, which didn't respond to a request for comment. State campaign finance reports show political groups have spent $2 million on independent expenditures in state Senate races, with $1.5 million spent on races for seven Republican-controlled seats outside the Democrats' stronghold in southern Maine. Sussman, who once owned Maine's largest media company, has gained prominence as one of the nation's most prolific donors to progressive politicians, political groups and causes, with tens of millions in reported donations to national and Maine politics since 2008. He is a registered voter in Florida, from where he has supported dozens of Democratic congressional candidates and reportedly donated $21 million to the Democratic Party's pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. "It's very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics," he told The Washington Post last month. Sussman, whose divorce to Pingree became final this summer, didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. Between 2008 and 2014, Sussman gave $2.1 million to Maine Democrats and another $3.2 million to political action committees supporting causes like same-sex marriage and more funding for Maine public schools. But even though Sussman's name isn't appearing on state campaign finance reports, his money is finding its way to Maine politics in other ways. He gave the maximum $2,700 contribution to Pingree and Democratic congressional candidate Emily Cain for their primary fights, and has contributed $7.9 million to House Majority PAC, which has announced spending $1.6 million in Maine TV ads attacking Cain's opponent, Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin. Jason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said he supports political donors' free speech rights, but finds it hypocritical when Democrats don't denounce big out-of-state checks from one-percenters. "He became a significant liability to Democrats," Savage said, adding that Democrats used Sussman's checkbook for "ridiculous" attack ads that didn't help Democrats win the governor's seat or keep the Maine Senate. Even without Sussman's contributions, Maine Democrats have outraised Maine Republicans 2-1 this year, according to state reports. Maine Democratic groups reported raising $5.2 million so far this year, just about the amount reported by this point during the Democrat's unsuccessful 2014 fight to unseat LePage. Savage said he's proud the GOP spends less money in more targeted ways. Maine Republican groups have gotten an $180,000 boost from the Virginia-based Republican State Leadership Committee, and $190,000 from LePage's political group ICE PAC to help the GOP support candidates. ICE PAC has also reported spending $25,363 to support Republican senatorial candidate Ricky Long, who is running against former Democratic Attorney General Michael Carpenter. Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett declined comment. LePage's office didn't respond to a request for comment.

We have all the major highlights together in one place so you can quickly catch up on all that's been going on. One of the biggest highlights of the week was perhaps the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi 4; it was launched alongside the premium variant the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime, and a budget variant, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. If phones are not your thing, then you might be more interested in the fact that Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - which will very likely be the top selling game of the year - is now available to buy worldwide. Wondering if you should buy the game? Check out our Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare review to help you decide.(Also see: Everything You Need to Know About Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare) Then of course, there was crazy news like the man who legally changed his name to "iPhone Sim" (Ukranian for "iPhone 7"), in order to get a free iPhone 7 that was offered by an electronics store. In case you're wondering, Sim says that he's going to keep the name even now after getting the phone; though he might change it back once he has children. That's not the craziest thing someone has done for an iPhone over the years, and his family seems to be supportive of the decision for now. Meanwhile, other than launching the new MacBook Pros, Apple has jacked up the prices of the MacBook by up to Rs. 10,000 in India, though prices for other Macs remain unchanged. (Also see: Five Best Camera Phones Under Rs. 30,000) There were also a lot of launches that took place over the last week. We saw the launch of the Huawei Mate 9, which comes with a Leica dual-lens camera, and comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, a 5.9-inch screen, and a 20-megapixel camera. It also launched the limited edition Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9, with a EUR 1,395 (roughly Rs. 1,03,000) price tag. Aside from the phones, Huawei also launched the Huawei Fit activity tracker with a heart rate monitor. Samsung also announced a phone that really stands out this week - it launched a flip phone, the Samsung W2017, which has dual full-HD displays, and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. The premium phone's pricing has not been announced yet, but last year's version, the Samsung W2016, was sold at CNY 9,999 (roughly Rs. 98,700). At the other end of the spectrum, ZTE also launched an Android flip-phone, the ZTE CYMBAL-T, but this is strictly a budget affair, with a single 3.5-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 SoC. Launched in the US market, the phone is priced at $99.95 (roughly Rs. 6,700), and available in Wal-Mart stores. Other launches this week included the Alcatel Idol 4S (Windows 10) smartphone, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. As the name implies, the phone runs Windows 10 Mobile. Meizu launched two phones this week, the Meizo Pro 6s with a 12-megapixel camera, and the Meizu M5, which has VoLTE support and a 13-megapixel camera. The Intex Aqua Power M with a 4350mAh battery was launched, as was the Micromax Canvas Spark 4G with VoLTE support. We also saw two new tablets launched, the Lava Ivory Pop with a 7-inch display, and voice calling support; and the iBall Slide Brace X1, with 4G voice calling support. (Also see: iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, and Other Phones to Look Forward To) Meanwhile, Samsung's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad year continues, with the recall of 2.8 million washing machines in the US. The top of the machines can unexpectedly detach from the chassis during use, and Samsung has received nine reports of injuries, including a broken jaw. Between this and the Galaxy Note 7, well, it's going to take some courage to shop from Samsung. Railways booking platform IRCTC continues to add more partners for its online payments, and now apart from paying via netbanking, credit cards, and other wallets, users can opt to pay directly from their MobilKwik wallet while booking tatkal tickets. Google is also looking for simpler ways to get people to pay - this week it announced Google Play subscription promos, which will allow developers to entice customers with an introductory offer on subscription for a limited time. According to Google, subscriptions are the fastest growing business model on Play, with consumers spending on subscriptions increasing 10 times over the last 3 years. There was also some news that is bound to please Indian readers - Netflix is considering an offline mode, the company's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in an interview. For people in developing countries with poor Internet connectivity this could be a very helpful feature, and even for people who live in conditions with good connections, it could be useful in scenarios such as flights, where you could queue up videos for entertainment. Also, architecture and interior design platform Houzz launched in India - it now has a presence in 15 countries.s This week, in an interview Steve Ballmer, the previous CEO of Microsoft, also talked about how smartphones broke his relationship with the company's founder (and previous CEO) Bill Gates. Meanwhile, Twitter, which continues to face a lot of pressure, also lost two very senior executives in the India/ South East Asia region. India Head Rishi Jaitly announced his exit on Monday, while South East Asia and India Managing Director Parminder Singh left on Thursday. By the way, in case you were wondering, Reliance Jio and its relations with the other telcos remains in the news.This week, Airtel announced that it's providing another 7,000 points of interconnect to Reliance Jio - whether this will help interconnectivity between the networks remains to be seen, though in our experience, there are still a lot of problems when calling other networks from Jio. Airtel also said that it might bring in price drops, but will not offer Jio-like free calls. And finally, apart from the Call of Duty release, there was a lot more from the world of gaming this week. It was the end of an era, as Nintendo ended Wii U production this week, even as the curtains were lifted on Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro console, including the launch lineup of games for the beefed-up variant of the PlayStation 4. (Also see: PS4 Pro Unboxing: Here's What to Expect) Meanwhile on Friday Blizzcon kicked off, and the World of Warcraft maker had a lot to show. Some of the biggest highlights included the fact that Blizzard and Google Deepmind are going to use Starcraft II for AI research. It also revealed that it's going to bring the much-demanded Necromancer to Diablo 3 as DLC, nearly 5 years after the game initially launched. In case that wasn't enough, Blizzard also revealed that the original Diablo will be made playable in Diablo 3, as part of a free content patch for people who already bought the Reaper of Souls DLC. There will be special graphic filters to make the game pixelated and grainy just as it was in its original 1996 release.

Performing at the Cutting Room in New York Chappelle revealed his support for republican runner Donald Trump and criticised the opposition, Hillary Clinton. According to the Observer, Chappelle made misguided comments about LGBT and women’s rights. Speaking about activists, he said: “They should not be having that conversation in front of black people. You go ahead and feel something about your rights. But if you’re putting sexism and homophobia and transphobia in front of racism, you should be ashamed of yourself.” Chappelle attacked the controversial bathroom bill, which restricts people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, and instead demands they use the bathroom of the sex they were assigned at birth. “If you need to show your birth certificate to take a dump at a Wal-Mart in North Carolina, that’s insane,” he said. Chappelle counteracted this as he said he would not want to use a urinal next to a “woman with a dick.” The comedian went on to discuss the ‘pussy grabbing’ tapes that were leaked recently. “What I heard on that tape was gross,” Chappelle said. “But the way I got to hear it was even more gross. You know that came directly from Hillary.” Chappelle denied that Trump was talking about sexual assault. “Sexual assault? It wasn’t. ‘And when you’re a star, they let you do it.’ That phrase implies consent. I just don’t like the way the media twisted that whole thing. Nobody questioned it.” He confirmed he would vote for Hillary Clinton despite supporting Trump. However, he felt his vote would be wasted and likened it to sleeping with Halle Berry and having her fart in his face. “I’m still going to go for it, but I wish she hadn’t done that thing,” he said. He went on to praise Trump’s “resilience” and demeanour during the second presidential debate. “Something about this was backward,” Chappelle said. “A gay white man and a white woman asking a multibillionaire how he knows the system is rigged and insisting it’s not. Does that sound right to you? It didn’t seem right to me. “And here’s how you know Trump is the most gangsta candidate ever. They asked him how he knows the system is rigged and he said, ‘Because I take advantage of it.’ He may as well have flashed his membership card for the Illuminati right then.” 25 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous story North Carolina lawmaker comes out as bisexual after homophobic attack Next story Pakistani woman files petition in court to seek gender reassignment surgery More like this Hillary Clinton vows to be an ally to LGBT community in the White House if elected US Election 2016: LGBTQ candidates to watch out for RuPaul’s Drag Race judge: ‘Clintons are paedophiles, Obamas are murderers’ Sir Elton John: We have to make sure that love trumps hate Neil Patrick Harris isn’t looking his prettiest in the ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ teaser LGBT people quote Trump’s craziest phrases in hilarious new video Christian activist: Vote Trump, or Hillary Clinton might force kids to have gay sex Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos burns Pride flag in vile election ad More: LGBT Hillary Clinton Trump comedian activists presidential election Dave Chappelle ST Test Trending Trending Now Christian marriage blogger announces she is dating soccer star Abby Wambach Sainsbury’s Christmas ad casually features a same-sex couple for a second year in a row 17 Biden and Obama memes that will make your week better Pro-Republican ad depicts little girl getting raped because of transgender equality Trending Christian marriage blogger announces she is dating soccer star Abby Wambach Sainsbury’s Christmas ad casually features a same-sex couple for a second year in a row 17 Biden and Obama memes that will make your week better Pro-Republican ad depicts little girl getting raped because of transgender equality Latest stories Remember that time Trump stood up for gay people and Mexicans?

Weekly Newspaper Museum Online Newspaper (E-Edition) Simple battery reported on Country Lane Posted by Staff Writer in Public Safety Sunday, November 6. 2016 Comments (0) Simple battery and criminal trespass were reported on Country Lane recently. Deputy Chad Parr went to a home there and met with a grandfather who said his granddaughters had been fighting. Par interviewed the granddaughters and one of them told him that the other came into her room and wanted to know where all her stuff was. She said she told her she didn’t know, but she needed to get it and “get out of the house.” That when she said the other girl hit her in the head with her fist. The other girl then left with in a car with a male and female. Their grandfather said after they stopped fighting, the one who hit the other went outside and starting kicking the back door. He said she may also be on methamphetamine. Both were explained the TPO and two-part affidavit process. Other incidents on file at the sheriff’s office recently included: •Identity fraud was reported by someone on Whitsel Road. A man told Deputy Gabe Martin that he had purchased a firearm about two weeks prior from a gun shop in Winterville and about three hours after buying the gun, he received a text from a bank stating that someone had attempted to open accounts in his name at various places, including JC Penny, Zales, Best Buy and Walmart. •Identity fraud was reported in Madison Hills. A man there said he had received a $1,500 bill for a credit card in his deceased wife’s name from an auto store in Charlotte NC. He said a purchase was made on the card on Sept. 22 and his wife passed away a few days earlier. The store told him he needed to file a police report to have the bill canceled. •Simple battery was reported on Hwy. 29 North near Mason Mill Road. Deputy Austin Dean Blake and Cpl. Shawn Rhoades responded to a suspicious female waking south near Mason Mill Road. While in route we were flagged down by a man in a vehicle at Superior Trailers who had called in the woman. The complainant said he picked up the woman and was giving her a ride to the DFACS office in Danielsville. He stated he and a passenger spotted the female while they were driving down the highway. They passed a white SUV going about 60 miles per hour with the door open and witnessed a white female in the passenger seat struggling with the driver. The complainant stated that when they passed the vehicle he observed the driver pulling the woman by the hair as she struggled to get away from him. Blake then spoke to the victim, who told him that she and the driver were going down Hwy. 29 near Jones Chapel when they began to argue and she told him to stop so she could get out. At that point, she said he became physically abusive and grabbed her by the arm and hair to keep her from getting out of the SUV. He finally stopped so she could get out. She said she didn’t want to press charges. Sae said they do not live together but have been dating for three years. She also said he has been arrested previously for physical abuse against her. According to the report, she was “very uncooperative” in giving any of the offender’s information.

Download The Definitive Guide to API Integrations to start building an API strategy. JavaScript's recent rise in popularity calls attention to platforms such as Node.js, which offers a revolutionary take on the role of JavaScript on the web. By now, it's clear that Node.js is a valuable tool for those who care about the future of web development. Why Care About Node.js? Developers Embrace Node.js for a Number of Reasons, Including: Better performance. PayPal, one of the major early adopters of Node.js, noticed that when compared with a similar Java framework using Spring, Node.js showed a 35% average decrease in response time when delivering pages to the end user. Other companies have noted comparable improvements. Better time to market. Node.js is a lightweight, flexible tool with a smaller CPU footprint, fewer files and lines of code, and no compilation required. This lets you write, test, and deploy your code quicker and easier than with alternatives like Java, PHP, and Ruby. Strong user community. Dozens of major companies, from Yahoo and Netflix to Walmart and Microsoft, have adopted Node. In 2015, more than 120 of the Fortune 500 companies used Node.js internally. This corporate support caused interest in Node.js to skyrocket among both developers and hiring managers. Check out Cloud Elements Developer community How to Integrate Node.js Into Your Stack Even if you're already using technologies like Java and PHP, you can integrate Node.js into your tech stack using various APIs developed by the Node.js community. For example, Node.js and Java can work together using the node-java API and you can run Node.js web applications on a PHP server using Node.php. If you're merely curious about trying Node.js, there are a number of internet tutorials that will walk you through topics such as creating a REST API with Node.js and integrating Node.js into various platforms. How Node.js Benefits Your Business Some businesses that switched to Node.js have written extensively about the positive effects for users. For example, Groupon reported that its page load times were cut in half after moving from Ruby on Rails to Node.js. Additionally, when Walmart launched its new Node.js system on Black Friday of 2013, servers remained online and CPU utilization never went above 1 percent. Adopting Node.js benefits your product and app development teams, as well as potential hires. As a fresh, interesting technology, Node.js helps motivate developers, making them more productive and challenging them intellectually. Jeff Harrel, director of user interface engineering at PayPal, said: "Since PayPal has adopted Node, I’ve been told countless times from engineers in passing that they are energized by their job again and excited to be adopting a modern technology to build our future."

Authorities say they received an anonymous tip at about 5:20 p.m. after someone spotted Decker's vehicle at the Walmart in Eau Claire.  The 35-year-old was taken into custody without incident by the Eau Claire County Sheriff's Department and the Eau Claire Police Department. He's now at the Eau Claire County jail; no word yet on when he'll appear in court.  Police asked for the public's helping finding Decker after he ran from an officer Thursday morning. They spent part of the day searching for him around Violet Avenue and Stein Boulevard, which put an elementary school in the area on lock down for a short time.  They say he was wanted on a Department of Corrections warrant and was also a Person of Interest in another case. Authorities thought Decker could have been armed, so they said they were extra cautious in their search for him.  The Eau Claire Police Department told News 18 Saturday that they were grateful for the public's help in the case, saying officers couldn't do the work they do without the community's help. They said they received a number of calls from people trying to help find Decker.  ========================================================================================================= Eau Claire (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police have called off the search for 35-year-old Dennis Decker. Police had been searching the south side of Eau Claire since this morning after he fled from police.  Earlier, police told News 18 Decker may be armed. Though the officer never saw him with a gun, they still warned people to avoid the area.  They say there was no incident with Decker on Thursday morning, but he's wanted for a Department of Corrections warrant and has an extensive criminal history. Police say even though the search was called off, they're committed to finding Decker.  "We don't just give up a search and pack up and go home," ECPD Spokesperson Kyle Roder said. "We search the immediate area the best we can. Obviously, we can't go into residences and things, but we search the areas that we can search in these. And then we do a follow up investigation. So we are still looking for him."  Now, the department is asking for the public's help locating Decker. Anyone with information is asked to call 715-839-4972.  News 18 has also learned that the lockdown has been lifted at Putnam Heights Elementary School.  ------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police have identified the suspect as 35-year-old Dennis Decker. According to court records, he has been charged multiple times with eluding an officer. He has also been charged with obstructing an officer, criminal damage to property and car theft.  -------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police tell News 18 the suspect has a probation warrant out for his arrest and ran from police. They say he has an extensive criminal history.  --------------------------------- UPDATE (WQOW) - Putnam Heights Elementary School is on lockdown as the search for a possible armed man continues on Eau Claire's south side.  Principal Kim Koller tells News 18 Eau Claire Police informed her of the situation and the school went into lockdown. Koller says that means learning-activities will continue but will stay inside. Students will also be supervised during transitions in the hallway.  Koller says that practice will continue until the school hears otherwise from the police department.  ----------------------- Eau Claire (WQOW) - Eau Claire Police Department say they are searching for a possibly armed man in the area of Violet Avenue and Stein Boulevard, south of Bollinger Fields.  Police are asking people to avoid the area. They say the man was wanted and ran away from officers. He is reportedly wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, flannel shirt and light colored jeans.  Our reporter on scene says officers are searching the area with guns drawn.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     McDonald's Offers Online Ordering Posted: Nov 5 2016, 6:30pm CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   McDonald's is FINALLY getting into the mobile ordering and paying market, meaning that customers will be able to use their smartphones to order and pay for food, which will streamline the process, according to Business Insider. Don't Miss: Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deals You won't be able to use this until next year, when people in the US, Australia, France, Canada, and the UK will be able to use it at some 25,000 restaurant locations. Mobile ordering has helped many fast food restaurants with their traffic, though McDonald's has been lagging behind. Starbucks, in particular, has had huge success. It will benefit the chains, the workers, and the customers because it will improve accuracy, speed up serving times, and can even offer up specials. McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook has been planning on mobile ordering for a long time so that people can order when they want and know when they can expect their order to be finished. It has been tested in almost two dozen locations in Georgia. When Starbucks launched their mobile ordering, 25% of customers have picked up on it to pay and 6% use it to pay ahead. In high traffic times, that makes everything easier. Even without mobile ordering, McDonald's has 14 million app downloads, which has offered up some great information to the company. This app could do the same, and make it easier to help with staffing.

Faith Hill Surgery Alan Jackson Releases ‘Precious Memories’ Gospel Collection By Laura McClellan November 5, 2016 6:00 PM SHARE TWEET EMAIL EMAIL REDDIT Rick Diamond, Getty Images Alan Jackson has released a special collection of his gospel tunes for the upcoming holiday season. Titled Precious Memories Collection, the project includes songs from his Precious Memories album from 2006 and 2013’s Precious Memories II, as well as a couple of new originals. The collection is available exclusively at Walmart. The original tunes were inspired by Jackson’s wife, Denise, who is the author of an inspirational book titled It’s All About Him. Jackson says he wrote the song “It’s All About Him” to try to enhance the spirit of what she wrote. “Inspired by Denise’s strength and ability [in writing her book], I sat down and wrote a song of the same title hoping to add musically to an already uplifting story,” Jackson explains in a press release. The second original song is titled “That’s The Way,” which is a song special to the couple, as Jackson sang it to his wife on their wedding day. The first Precious Memories project was originally conceived as a gift to family and friends from Jackson, but upon receiving the thoughtful gift, the recipients encouraged Jackson to release it publicly. Though no singles were released from the album, it was still certified Platinum by the RIAA. The 28-track Precious Memories Collection is now available at Walmart. Jackson recently teamed up with Chris Young to provide a guest vocal on Young’s version of “There’s a New Kid in Town” on Young’s new record, It Must Be Christmas. The tune is an original song Jackson recorded for his first holiday album, Honky Tonk Christmas, in 1993 as a duet with Keith Whitley, who also co-wrote it.

New Masters of the Universe Toys Announced It Turns Out Rats Are Actually Ticklish More Games The Weirdest And Worst Sonic The Hedgehog Fan Art By K. Thor Jensen 11.05.2016 :: 12:00PM EST kthorjensen Stay on target Sega Mega Drive goes mini, the pint-sized, retro console wars are here 11 franchises that should ripoff Pokemon Go Of all the video game mascot characters, none inspires the fanatical devotion that Sega’s quick-footed blue hedgehog does. Nobody ever maced a Gamestop employee because they changed the color of Mario’s arms, nobody ever started a Change.org petition because they changed Crash Bandicoot’s voice actor, nobody ever bombed a Wal-Mart because there was never a fourth Gex game. But Sonic fans are deeply into their character. And when you have love, you have fan art. The Internet is home to literally millions of drawings of video game characters in all kinds of situations, and probably half of them involve Sonic in some way. If you tried to download every hedgehog on DeviantArt, you’d need a hard drive the size of a Sega Saturn to hold them all. Sonic fan art is a very big deal, and a lot of it is pretty freaking weird. We went on a deep dive through the worlds of Twitter, Tumblr, and DeviantArt to dredge up some Sonic art that gave us all kinds of dark feelings. Page through the slideshow below if you dare and feel free to paste your own favorite examples into the comments, which we will never read because we value our sanity. Gotta go fast! View as: One Page Slides 1. Sonic The Feedee One of the things you'll notice right away is that Sonic fans love to blend the blue hedgehog with all kinds of other fetishes. In this example, Tails is the "feeder" working diligently to help Sonic get big with the aid of chili dogs. 2. Shadow Stripping Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic's genetically engineered dark mirror, is the subject of a fair amount of fan art. He's often positioned as a more sexually adventurous figure, the top to Sonic's bottom. I wonder if using a stripper pole charges up your Spin Dash? 3. Cyborg Sonic A big genre of Sonic fan art is "OC"s, or "original characters" - new anthropomorphic animals that fit into the video game universe. Most of these OCs are just clumsily re-colored versions of Sonic, Tails and the like, but some go flat-out nutty with the cyborg parts and such, 4. Sonic Lion King Recoloring existing art is a big deal in the fan art community, as is blending two media properties together. Case in point: this deeply weird and clumsy Sonic / Lion King mash-up, which hurts the eyes to look at. 5. Shadow Praying Religious Sonic fan art is another rich vein of weirdness. This one depicts Shadow and a Chao, both ludicrously muscled and packing some serious heat in their Speedos, taking a prayer break. 6. Chili Dogs It's probably fair to say that at least some bad Sonic fan art is made ironically, as a joke. But think about this: we started this gallery with Tails feeding an obese Sonic chili dogs, and now we have another chili dog related image. There's obviously something deeper going on here that we don't have enough Chaos Emeralds to understand. 7. Sonic Shoes Meal As you'd expect from a character who runs a lot, there is a disturbingly huge amount of Sonic foot fetish material out there. This odd piece of art mixes in a little humiliation and food into the mix, with the poor tan OC forced to eat dinner out of Sonic's toe cracks. 8. Sonic Gap Style Drawing Sonic characters as more traditional anime protagonists is a pretty popular thing, especially if you're a horny teenager. One of the best things about this drawing is the Transformers-style power bars for their stats, revealing that neither hedgehog could make a saving throw vs. Sadness. 9. Take My Blood What do you do after you've created your Sonic OCs? Why, tell melodramatic adventures with them in MS Paint, of course. This panel from what I'm sure is a thousand-page epic is notable for lots of things: hedgehog boobs, pants but no shirt, exposed belly button. But my favorite is the smear of turquoise used to represent tears. 10. Realistic Sonic Some of the most upsetting Sonic fan art is where people take the low-detail cartoony style of the franchise and try to render things in a more realistic way. This here is a nightmare straight from the Upsidedown, with Sonic's rippling muscles only outdone by Tails' slavering face. 11. Tails Digesting If you haven't been keeping up on your fetishes, you might not have heard of "vore." In brief, it's when you get off from the idea of being swallowed up and digested by another living thing. Needless to say, Sonic fandom is chock full of vore art, like this pic of Sonic and (presumably) the artist. 12. Weird 3D Vore Sticking with the vore tip, we have an ineptly rendered 3D tableau featuring Amy Rose choking down some sort of cat with big titties as Sonic holds her belly admiringly. The blue guy looks a little off-model to me. 13. Sonic Crucified Here's another religious tableau featuring Sonic nailed to a cross like Jesus in front of an approving audience of Link and Pikachu. The delicate black and white shading really lends an air of seriousness to it. 14. Bloody Pageviews The sexual relationship between Sonic and Shadow is one that is explored across myriad pieces of art. I'm not 100% sure what's happening here: Sonic appears to be pregnant, and also feeding Shadow from her wrists with blood because Shadow is a vampire as well as a hedgehog. Cool stuff. 15. Real Sonic What If Sonic And Eggman Were In Real World? We think it'd look a little something like this, and also the police would probably be called. 16. Sonic Nipples For a lot of these fan artists, playing Sonic video games isn't enough. They want to hang out with the speedy hedgehog and his pals in the real world. That's how you get masterpieces like this, where a poor dude with three nipples has a very awkward pool party with Sonic and a buxom (and possibly bloody?) Amy Rose. 17. Sonic Simpsons Why exactly somebody felt the need to recast the Simpsons as Sonic characters (or is it the other way around) is completely beyond me. I think Maggie probably comes out of this one the worst. 18. Mike The Hedgehog 9-11 There is a lot of Sonic 9-11 art. Like an insane amount. We could have done an entire gallery of Sonic 9-11 tributes but I didn't want to get too morbid. Special appearance here by OC "Mike The Hedgehog," who is basically Sonic but green. 19. Buff Sonic Buff Sonic We typically think of Sonic as a lean, mean running machine, but some people like to draw him rippling with muscle. We can't see this dude being able to pull loop-de-loops with this build. 20. Sonic Urinals Okay, we're stepping into the dark world now. Abandon all hope, ye who would enter here. Sonic, Tails and Knuckles have been transformed into urinals and they can't wait for you to fill their gaping mouths with hot piss. 21. Sonic Condoms Sure, let's draw Knuckles, Sonic and Tails as condoms. Why not. What possible downside would there be to doing this? 22. Sonic Suicide The idea of a suicide pact between Amy Rose and Sonic is something that we'd never even thought to consider. What really makes this difficult to deal with is the contrast between their expressions - Amy's cheerful acceptance of death juxtaposed with Sonic's creeping fear. 23. Sonic Toilet That's it. I'm done. Peace out. I'll see you in the bleach tank.

Although regulators could challenge the acquisition or slap conditions on it that may limit how AT&T can use its new assets, the purchase hints at a future where a single company can monetize the same customer multiple times over, just through the customer's routine use of the Internet. Quotes in the article AT&T Inc T ▲ 36.77 +0.64 +1.77% Time Warner Inc TWX ▲ 88.67 +1.87 +2.15% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Best Buy Co Inc BBY ▼ 39.88 -0.06 -0.15% Other Internet providers have made stabs at building this kind of business model. Verizon, for example, wants to do something similar with Yahoo and AOL. But if AT&T succeeds — and that's still a big if — it will be that much closer to turning its subscribers into virtual cash machines, going to them over and over to grow its revenue base. Here are a few ways that could work. Sell connectivity At its core, AT&T is a network company. Its main job until now has been to sell you access to communications, such as phone or Internet service. These services act as conduits to the information or media you can find once you're hooked as a subscriber. This business model is not going away. In fact, it is what allows all the other business models to follow. It is also the easiest to describe, because selling data plans is the most directly observable way in which AT&T makes money from consumers like you and me. Sell content  On top of selling you the network, companies such as AT&T increasingly want to sell you the content that travels over those networks — including shows like “Game of Thrones” or “Westworld.” Historically, these types of shows were only available on cable TV. But thanks to the Internet, accessing this content just becomes a matter of network capacity. And guess who does networks? AT&T. Because AT&T's merger with Time Warner could allow the telecom giant to control HBO's entire content catalogue, any money the premium channel makes could belong, ultimately, to AT&T. That includes the $15-a-month subscription fee that HBO charges for its Internet streaming app, HBO Now. HBO has been called the “crown jewel” of Time Warner, and AT&T knows it. Suppose you're an AT&T Wireless subscriber and you pay for HBO Now. In the wake of a successful merger with Time Warner, this would allow AT&T to double-dip into your wallet. Sell advertising This is the big one. Advertising, particularly of the targeted variety, forms the cornerstone of the entire Internet economy. And Internet providers want a big slice of it. To compete with other ad heavyweights like Google and Facebook, Internet providers need to collect and use behavioral data. That means analyzing your browsing history, your app usage history, your location history, your financial information and other data that can help build a picture of who you are as a consumer. And since your Internet provider is collecting a lot of this information anyway simply to provide the basic function of getting you where you want to go on the Internet, its perspective is, why not use that data for advertising? Armed with these insights, a company, such as AT&T, could approach a company, such as Walmart or Best Buy, and say, “I can reach this demographic for you. Do you want to advertise with us?” And if Walmart or Best Buy said yes, they could put their ads on any number of sites or channels owned by AT&T. As a result of the Time Warner merger, that could include platforms, such as TBS or CNN. Targeted ads promise to “feature prominently” and in some cases represent “the whole ball of wax” for telecom companies in the new digital economy, according to Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson. Things get even more intricate from here. Not only could the ads be targeted to a specific demographic, but thanks to a technique known as cross-screen advertising, a particular customer could see the same ad on their TVs that they do on their phones and their tablets. AT&T's tests show that cross-screen advertising can boost a company's sales by as much as 87 percent. If ads are about repeated messaging, this approach may be the purest — and most lucrative — form of it yet. Federal regulators voted last week to limit how Internet providers can use your data, in a victory for privacy advocates. Still, many consumers may voluntarily opt in to the advertising, particularly if they're offered financial incentives in exchange.'© Barta IV Sell your data A company, such as AT&T, could put your data to work for its own advertising business. But it could also benefit by sharing your data with marketing firms and other third parties who can use that information themselves. Data brokers who traffic in behavioral insights are often invisible to the average consumer, but what they know about you can affect your choices, such as the types of credit you're offered. A network company with deep insights on its subscribers could sell the data to a third party. All of these different business models entail monetizing different aspects of the customer relationship. Under the right circumstances, a telecom company could theoretically use a customer as a cash machine by: 1. Selling her a mobile data plan 2. Convincing her to pay for premium content on top of that plan 3. Watching how the customer engages with that content 4. Showing them ads tailored to her engagement 5. Selling that engagement data to third parties That doesn't even begin to contemplate any potential cross-promotions or special bundles of content and service designed to lure even more customers into the ecosystem. Nor does it go into possible licensing deals with other businesses that could allow, for example, AT&T to charge other firms for the use of DC Comics' intellectual property, such as Batman or Superman. The upshot is that by melding content and distribution, telecom and cable companies likely envision a whole constellation of business models that may form the foundation for a new digital economy, one that orbits largely around them.

(Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg) Published November 05. 2016 11:15AM | Updated November 05. 2016 8:22PM By Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Bloomberg What’s in your jeans? A rogue’s gallery of unpronounceable chemicals whose effects on humans are suspect. Perfluorochemicals, phthalates and azo dyes are among the substances that are widespread in making clothes. Under pressure from consumers demanding safer alternatives to harmful chemicals, American companies including Levi Strauss & Co. are taking a more European approach. The European Union has banned or restricted more than 1,000 chemicals; the U.S. has banned or restricted fewer than 50. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. Suppliers are often reluctant to share their formulations, buyers balk at higher costs, and in some cases cost-effective safer substitutes simply aren’t available. Levi’s has prohibited certain chemicals since 2000, but this is different. The jeans maker and other companies are asking suppliers to use materials generated from bacteria, fungus, yeast and methane gas to replace the petroleum-based substances that make up more than 95 percent of U.S. products’ inventory of chemicals. There are plenty of incentives to change. A Pike Research report estimates that the global market for green chemistry will increase to almost $100 billion by 2020, from $11 billion last year. Millennials are overwhelmingly interested in sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. And innovating can give companies a competitive advantage, said Monica Becker, co-director of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council, which works with companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Companies can make false promises that a product is consistent with green-chemistry practices, Becker said, but guarding against that are assessment methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program. Rules can also confound the efforts of U.S. companies. To approve chemicals and processes, the European Union uses a so-called hazard-based approach that the Chinese government is also considering. Manufacturers need to prove their products meet safety standards before they bring them to market. The U.S. method is risk-based. It involves weighing metrics, such as quantity and duration of exposure, to assess the danger in an existing product — if data exist. Proponents of a hazard-based approach argue that exposure to even tiny amounts of some chemicals correlate with learning disabilities, asthma, allergies and cancer. “Shouldn’t it be that chemicals are guilty until research proves them innocent?” said Amy Ziff, founder and executive director of Made Safe, a new hazard-based certification program. Levi’s said its goal is to use only chemicals that pass hazard-based screens by 2020. Even as some suppliers push back, “we wouldn’t give up on hazard-based,” said Bart Sights, Levi’s director of global development. Levi’s already uses some green methods to make its signature blue jeans. To give them a worn look, Levi’s uses an enzyme derived from fungus and tumbles the jeans in ozone gas instead of bleach — a process that Sights estimated has had the added benefit of saving the company a billion gallons of water in the past three years. “Some companies are spending the same amount on environmental compliance as they are on research and development,” said John Warner, president and chief technology officer of Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, who created the first green-chemistry Ph.D. program in the U.S., at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Companies can be roiled by the use of non-green chemicals. Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. was beset by lawsuits last year after a “60 Minutes” investigation said it used unsafe levels of formaldehyde. Shares plunged before a government probe ended without a product recall. The company no longer sells the flooring. Such problems have investors taking notice, said Mark Rossi, whose company, Clean Production Action, created the Chemical Footprint, modeled on the carbon footprint, that investors can use to measure risk and costs. It also developed and licenses a chemical-screening method used by Levi’s and others. Rossi has signed on firms including BNP Paribas, Calvert Investments and Trillium Asset Management, while companies like Johnson & Johnson and Clorox Co. participated in the first survey to assess their footprint. Gojo Industries Inc., maker of Purell hand sanitizer, has pledged to cut its chemical footprint in half by 2020. In the five years since it launched a campaign to spur clothing makers and sellers to get rid of toxic substances, Greenpeace International has signed on 78 brands, said Kirsten Brodde, head of the organization’s Detox My Fashion campaign. At the Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, across the Bay Bridge from Levi’s San Francisco headquarters, students have worked with the jeans maker and companies such as outfitter Patagonia Inc., office-furniture maker Steelcase Inc. and Mango Materials Inc., which manufactures plastics out of methane gas, to develop safer materials, including a non-toxic resin for Autodesk’s 3D printers. But an overnight change for the greener just isn’t possible. “When it comes to materials, we’re at the very initial step, which is figuring out what the heck is actually in our products,” said Marty Mulvihill, a founder of the Berkeley Center and its former executive director. “A lot of companies are just completing that first step.” A comprehensive replacement for formaldehyde, for example, hasn’t been developed, Mulvihill said. Mulvihill is now a partner at Safer Made, a new venture-capital firm he co-founded that’s seeking investments in companies that use green chemistry. It’s looked at more than 100 companies, with plans to invest in 10 to 15 firms in the next five years, he said. Patagonia has also invested in green chemical companies. A Levi’s supplier, Beyond Surface Technologies, is one of a dozen the Ventura, Calif.-based clothing maker has seeded out of 1,400 prospects it’s looked at since 2013. “Ultimately, some of these companies that we fund could be able to help us clean up our own supply chain,” said Phil Graves, Patagonia’s director of corporate development. There are 20 environmentally friendly chemicals available for the company’s textile finishes, compared with 200 to 300 that contain non-green chemicals, said Matthias Foessel, Beyond Surface’s founder and chief executive officer. Developing safer alternatives can take years, while acceptable green substitutes for some substances used in waterproofing and stain protectants, such as perfluorocarbons, don’t exist, Foessel said. New chemicals often behave differently than expected. Beyond Surface had been trying to create a water repellent when it developed a fabric that absorbs sweat instead. Still, Foessel’s eight-year-old firm, based near Basel, Switzerland, now has more than 100 customers, including Adidas AG. “Ten years ago, people wouldn’t have even talked to us,” Foessel said. “People accepted that you had to use chemicals that pose a risk.” Workers make jeans in Parras, Mexico. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. (Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg) Next Article Loading comment count...

He returned to the centre around 3 a.m. Saturday. (Source: Gerri Knight) Cameron MacLean, CTV Winnipeg Published Friday, November 4, 2016 4:09PM CST Last Updated Saturday, November 5, 2016 8:22AM CST A man who went missing from the Selkirk Mental Health Centre Thursday evening has returned safely. Brian Knight, 49, was reported missing around 8:15 p.m. Thursday. He returned to the centre around 3 a.m. Saturday. The hospital called Knight’s mother, who lives in Brandon, to let her know. Knight’s sister-in-law Gerri Knight told CTV News that he likely spent a lot of time in the McDonald’s at the Wal-Mart in Selkirk, not far from the RCMP Detachment and the centre. She said she believes spent the nights outside and they worried he would get hypothermia. Brian was cold, hungry and tired by the time he returned to the centre, she said. Brian’s disappearance worried the family because he has schizophrenia and had just moved into the centre from Brandon on Monday, she said. “We were really, really concerned that he was in this unfamiliar community. We didn’t know the choices he would make, and we knew that the community was not familiar with him,” she said. In Brandon, everyone knew to call police if they saw him on the street, she said. Gerri thanked members of the public who responded with tips and members of the media for reporting on the disappearance.

Surprisingly little, as it happens. For all the storm and fury of this most unpleasant of U.S. presidential campaigns, the two chief contenders are actually campaigning on common ground. The chief issues for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are job creation, boosting economic growth, national security, and what they each regard as genuine free trade. A rupture in U.S.-Canada trade relations would be near-catastrophic for the U.S. The North American auto and livestock industries, to pick just two examples, are thoroughly integrated between the U.S. and Canada. New England gets most of its electric power from Quebec — something to keep in mind the next time you see the New York City skyline at night. That’s Canadian electricity lighting up Times Square and Broadway. The anti-trade rhetoric of the candidates for the U.S. presidency has obscured the fact that in seeking greater economic growth — the top goal for each candidate — the U.S. will have to become a more vigorous exporter. That means gaining greater access to world markets. And that, in turn, requires an even greater U.S. commitment to free trade than currently exists. Trump and Clinton have each expressed reservations about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and they also vow not to proceed with the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 12-country trading block of which Canada is a member. Yet either candidate, as president, will almost certainly leave NAFTA wholly or largely untouched, and will also lead America into a ratified TPP. Trump is a global entrepreneur. His business has long generated much of its profits outside the U.S. And Hillary Clinton was a Day One negotiator for America on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in her role as U.S. secretary of state. Stepping away from the TPP talks, on completing her tenure at State, Clinton declared that the not-yet-completed TPP is “the gold standard of trade agreements.” Why would each of these candidates flip-flop on free trade after becoming U.S. president? This space can highlight only some of the many compelling reasons: •Most of the low-skill, low-pay U.S. jobs that were vulnerable to offshoring have already been lost. And in the main, they haven’t been lost to America’s NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Most have been lost to China, South Korea, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia and other lower-cost jurisdictions with which the U.S. has no trade deals. They’ve also been lost from the U.S. Midwest to the world’s newest sweatshop, the low-pay, anti-union U.S. South. •Trump has all but declared a trade war with China. But no one wins in a trade war. Americans who can only afford to shop at Wal-Mart or Costco will find the shelves bare. And China’s retaliatory walls against U.S. imports would enrage CEOs of the Fortune 500, who would demand compensation for the damage Trump has done to their extensive Chinese investments. Given America’s current era of discontent, bashing the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans might be a slam dunk in winning a presidential nomination. But doing so as president is profoundly contrary to America’s economic interests. •For the U.S. economy, there is tremendous upside potential in using the TPP to bulk up U.S. trade with America’s existing trading partners (TPP members Japan and Australia) and cracking new markets in the Pacific Rim (Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand) and Latin America (Chile, Peru, Colombia). America derives only about 20 per cent of its GDP from exports, pointing to a tremendous upside potential for the U.S. economy by becoming a more substantial exporter. Frankly, as a mature economy, America’s internal economic growth rate will be modest for decades to come. For America’s GDP to grow substantially, the U.S. simply must build up its export prowess. And that can be achieved only by embracing free trade. Clinton and Trump know this. And they have each been watering down their anti-trade talk as the election approaches. Trump regards himself as a superb negotiator, and relishes the chance to, as he has said, “negotiate the best trade deals ever.” But whether Trump or Clinton are able to improve much on what seven years of TPP negotiations have already yielded is beside the point. They’ve each revealed themselves as free traders, in stark contrast to what they’ve said on the campaign trail. •Strengthening NAFTA and recommitting to the TPP would enable the U.S., finally, to establish harmonious relations with a Latin America that, in the main, has felt nothing but the back of America’s hand for generations. •Free trade has been good for the U.S. In the six years after the U.S. joined Mexico and Canada in creating NAFTA in 1994, the U.S. created 23 million new jobs, a record that remains unsurpassed. And Canada has seen a whopping 173-per-cent increase in merchandise exports to the U.S. alone from 1994 to the present. As a TPP-member America gains more favourable terms of trade with Vietnam, Malaysia and Chile. American job creation will soar once again from the surge in sales of tariff-free IBM mainframes to the governments and private-sector businesses of America’s fellow TPP countries. And American consumers will enjoy greater access to, and lower prices for, Kiwi woollens and Vietnamese shrimp, the most nutritious in the world. •Finally, if America opts out of the TPP negotiations, the other 11 TPP member-countries, including Canada, will remain committed to the TPP. That would greatly disadvantage the U.S., which would be on the outside looking into one of the world’s biggest free-trade zones. That is the scenario that Britain faces if it exits the European Union (EU) in March, as the U.K. PM has said she will do. Outside the TPP, America loses the chance to isolate China, whose growing regional influence is of great concern to Washington. Conversely, a TPP whose members include the largest- and third-largest economies (the U.S. and Japan, respectively) will tame China’s recent adventurism in the South China Sea and elsewhere. Accordingly, China has already signalled an interest in eventually joining the TPP, and so has the emerging economic powerhouse South Korea. It’s a simple matter of geopolitics. The U.S. can allow its influence in the world to weaken by revoking NAFTA and rejecting membership in the TPP. Or the U.S. can use its membership in the world’s biggest trade blocks, in which it will be the biggest member, to gain still more influence in both the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Trump and Clinton are emphatic adherents to Pax Americana. Retreat from free trade is one of the surest ways of undermining that U.S. doctrine. Neither of these candidates wants to be the first U.S. president to break faith with it. What’s at stake for Canada in the U.S. presidential vote on Nov. 8? Surprisingly little, as it happens. For all the storm and fury of this most unpleasant of U.S. presidential campaigns, the two chief contenders are actually campaigning on common ground.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Amazon Echo And Google Home Set To Battle For Holiday Dominance Posted: Nov 5 2016, 4:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 3:33am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The contender to Amazon's digital assistant home device has arrived. The fight is on this Holidays. Who will win? Amazon stood up Google and Apple with the release of Amazon Echo two years ago. That is right. While Google was still playing with sandbox toys, Amazon has shipped a device that can answer all your questions you ask out loud in your home. For two years there was nothing comparable. Now Google finally ships the Google Home device, a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Amazon launched on November 7 an Amazon Echo deal with the lowest price in the history to celebrate the 2nd birthday of the Amazon Echo. The Amozon Echo sells for $140.39 for a limited time. Google Home comes out of the gate with a $50 lower price. Google Home sells for $129 at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. These retailers make a big deal out of the Google Home launch and feature the product prominently in their stores. Google is set to go full in with the Google Home this Holiday season and attack Amazon's market share with the Echo.  The Amazon Echo had a two year head start and Amazon used this time to get a long list of developers behind the Alexa platform. There are more than hundred Amazon Echo Skills that enable the device to play music, order food and control your home. Google Home is behind, but also offers a developer platform that will quickly add these skills. So which home assistant is better? You can't go wrong with either one. A side to side test asking questions to Echo and Home on Digital Trends shows that Google Home is a bit better in answering knowledge questions. Amazon needs to be careful not to get behind in that field. For instance Alexa fails to answer the question what koalas eat. The Amazon Echo sold for $149 on Prime Day earlier this year and in the Black Friday sale last year. Amazon is in full control of the pricing of the Amazon Echo and it will be clear that the Amazon Black Friday 2016 deal will be at least as low as $129 to match Google Home. We could even imagine that Amazon goes in the offensive and prices the Amazon Echo for under $100. Amazon has its e-commerce eco system behind the Amazon Echo. Google does not have that advantage. For Amazon, the Echo is just another way to get people to shop on Amazon.com. Amazon Prime members can use their voice to order anything on Amazon.com just by asking Alexa on their Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Amazon Fire TV, or Fire tablet. Amazon will even have hundreds of exclusive deals just for voice shoppers this holiday season listed at www.amazon.com/alexadeals. You can have Alexa tell you her deals by just asking: "Alexa, what are your deals?" Jeff Bezos' Amazon imperium will not let Google to easily waltz in between them and shoppers. There are no rumors yet about Amazon releasing a new Amazon Echo 2. A new Echo that leaps Google Home in performance and specifications would be the best weapon, but it is not clear what new hardware features would be improving the user experience. The Amazon Echo comes in white and black and is available on amazon.com and at Best Buy.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Smoking Leads To DNA Mutations That Cause Cancer Posted: Nov 5 2016, 6:39am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Smoking leads to Mutations in the DNA of the Smokers   It has been found that smoking cigarettes leads to mutations in the DNA of the smokers. Smoking has been found to have a deleterious effect on the DNA of smokers. The novel study showed how tobacco consumption had such a harmful impact on the human body. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals For those folks who consume a pack of cigarettes each and every day, they are allowing for changes in their body which may do untold harm in the future. The study was published in the journal Science. The cells in the human body which are exposed to the smoke are in particular vulnerable to extensive damage on a long term basis. Over 150 mutations occur among these cells. 97 of these are in the larynx and 39 are in the mouth. Smoking both harms the organs directly exposed to the smoke as well as those organs which are indirectly involved with the smoking. Genetic changes and the chance occurrence of cancers is also increased by several percentage points. Although the evidence for this link between smoking and cancer was always there, now physical and visible proof of the changes in the human body due to smoking are available. Smoking is connected with 17 types of cancer. It also kills 6 million people on an annual basis. Tobacco smoke contains 60 carcinogens. The genes are mutated thanks to these carcinogens and thus the likelihood of cancer is doubled and tripled in smokers. Those who smoke a pack a day are liable to have 150 extra mutations in their lungs on an annual basis. Lung cancer is always a risk that hangs over the heads of heavy smokers like the proverbial Sword of Damocles. The likelihood of lung cancer among men who smoke is 23 times whereas in women it is 13 times. The experts examined 5000 tumors and these came from 17 types of cancers. The one causal reason for all these various cancers was smoking. It all ultimately boiled down to changes in the DNA. Some of the effects are directly linked and others are indirectly linked. Even DNA methylation showed changes. Every cancerous genome is a record of sorts which reveals what exactly occurred on a regular basis and caused the cancer to attack the body of the individual. Smoking has been identified as the biggest contributor to cancer risk among average populations on a worldwide level.

Charter school advocates host 'Yes on 2' event in Springfield Michelle Hernandez, a mother of three living in Springfield. Great Schools Massachusetts, an educational organization advocating for lifting the charter school cap, held an event in downtown Springfield on Monday, September 12, 2016 in support of the ballot effort to lift the cap. Print Email Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com By Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com masslive.com Follow on Twitter on November 05, 2016 at 7:00 AM, updated November 05, 2016 at 7:09 AM comments The Republican/MassLive.com is running a series of stories looking at who is funding each of the four 2016 Massachusetts ballot questions. Here is a look at the money behind Question 2. By far, the most well-funded ballot question is Question 2, which would allow the state to approve 12 new charter schools a year outside of an existing cap. Supporters of charter school expansion, primarily through the Great Schools Massachusetts committee, have raised $23.6 million. The opponents of expansion, Save Our Public Schools, have raised $14.1 million. Some of the money funding the charter school effort comes from local corporations. One ballot committee, Expanding Educational Opportunities, raised a total of $575,000 from seven Massachusetts businesses — MassMutual Financial Group, State Street Bank, EMC Corporation, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Partners Healthcare, The Kraft Group and Suffolk Cares. (The committee gave the money to Great Schools Massachusetts, the main pro-charter group, to spend.) Other money comes from wealthy individuals from out-of-state. Arkansas' Alice Walton, who runs a family foundation funded by the proceeds from Wal-Mart, donated $710,000, while her brother Jim Walton gave $1.1 million. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg contributed $490,000. A lot of the money comes from individuals in the financial industry, generally working in Boston. The investigative news outlet International Business Times reported that financial executives who manage money for Massachusetts state pension funds contributed $778,000 to groups backing Question 2. There are also outside education reform groups who have contributed huge sums of money to the campaign. Most notably, the New York-based Families for Excellent Schools gave $15.6 million. Groups like Families for Excellent Schools are nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors. "This is a truly unprecedented financial push by the charter school industry and their billionaire backers to buy our election with untraceable money whose source we will never know," said Juan Cofield, president of the New England Area Conference of the NAACP and chairman of the No on Question 2 campaign, in a statement. Dominic Slowey, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association, responded that the outside money is a way to "balance the political playing field" with unions who have influenced federal, state and local elections for years. "For decades, the teachers' union has been able to outspend and outmaneuver and out-politick on Beacon Hill to control the debate and to influence legislative outcomes," Slowey said. "This is the first time that we're able to have some financial assistance behind us to put up a fight." Slowey added that most of the charter school campaign's money is coming from business leaders, community leaders and philanthropists. Mo Cunningham, associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns, made so-called "dark money," where the donors do not have to be disclosed, much more common. "Outside spending and dark money is part of the landscape now," Cunningham said. The anti-charter school money comes mainly from teachers' unions. The Massachusetts Teachers Association donated $7.5 million, the American Federation of Teachers donated $2 million, the National Education Association gave $5.4 million, and tens of thousands of dollars apiece came from local teachers' unions in Boston, Salem, Lynn, Lawrence and Lowell. Several labor unions also donated to the ballot committee. The enormous amount of money on both sides of the question means that both campaigns have been running a large amount of paid advertising, in addition to conducting direct mail campaigns and grassroots organizing. Polling has found that voters are paying a lot of attention to the discussion, even though it will primarily affect urban districts, and it will likely be a tight race.

The home improvement superstore, to be built on 3.4 hectares at the intersection of Sain and Tole bi streets, will create 400 new jobs. Photo: kapital.kz “OBI’s entrance into Kazakhstan means global revolution in amenities provision. We used to find solutions to modernising markets in different ways and working with major global retailers is a number one decision we focused on,” said Almaty Deputy Akim (Mayor) Yerlan Aukenov during the Oct. 28 Auezov Invest Forum, reported Kapital.kz. Founded in Germany in 1970, OBI has become a leading European DIY retailer with 570 hypermarkets in Central and Eastern Europe. The company’s annual turnover amounts to about 7 billion euro (US$7.7 billion). The hypermarket offers construction, renovation and gardening equipment as well as car accessories, bathroom equipment and lights. Carrefour, which has the second largest trade turnover in the world after Walmart, is already established in the Kazakh market. OBI is among the top retailers for gardening and amenities items. Aukenov noted Kazakh bazaars have a very narrow selection and prices are higher than they should be, while OBI offers quality, a broad range of goods and acceptable prices. “With this approach, we will make the market transparent. This is about the development of an entire city,” he added. All permit procedures between the Akimat (city administration) and Asadel Retail Group, which owns the hypermarket’s franchise, have been concluded and construction was slated to begin Nov. 1, said Asadel Director Nurlan Abdikarimov at the forum, according to Kapital.kz. “We are already looking at the market and think that perhaps Almaty will have three OBI hypermarkets. We have an offer on where to locate the second store. We will review the offer more closely based on local and commercial terms. Astana will be next and elaborations on locating that facility are also being held already. During the next five years we plan to build six hypermarkets in Kazakhstan, but I think we will not stop there. Perhaps there will be more; it all depends on market conditions,” he said, according to the news agency. Construction of the second OBI in Almaty and those in Astana and Shymkent will begin in 2017; the store in Aktobe is scheduled for 2018 and the one in Karaganda in 2019. “We are a DIY (Do It Yourself) retailer. Our formant is different from that of others and our country does not have one yet, I believe,” said Abdikarimov. OBI was approved in Russia 10 years ago and has been extremely successful, opening 27 hypermarkets with a huge turnover. The local population has been very interested in the format, he added. Similarly, he suggested Kazakhs will find the stores to be an acceptable and convenient way to offer goods that could help improve housing and living conditions. Manufacturers from Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries will supply most of the merchandise. Household and garden commodities under the hypermarkets’s OBI, CMI and Lux store brands will be an important feature, according to Kapital.kz.

Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation’s second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles G. and David H. Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need,” Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. “With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital,” said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line “Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC,” Emily Keech, the committee’s executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. “I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights,” Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. “I don’t want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries,” Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. “It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way,” said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. “And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive.” Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. “The key to any ballot measure is the right language,” Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Walmart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Va. “In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language.” Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: “The clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds.” Republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo. “Ballot initiatives will not be the left’s mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them,” said the memo, from the Republican State Leadership Committee, in February 2015 as the group prepared fundraising efforts. “It’s time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own.” The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, “The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion,” and then discussed “the importance of ballot initiatives” as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation’s largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the United States Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. “When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects,” said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, “I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time.” But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives. “As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns,” she said in a statement. Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a “contact list” prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee’s executive director. “I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country,” Keech wrote to Cegavske, referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company’s monopoly over much of the state’s electricity market. Cegavske’s executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. “Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution,” the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April. “What great news!!!!” Keech wrote back. “The Secretaries’ contacts are ALWAYS better than ours.” In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was “categorically false.” Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael R. Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to an Oregon candidate who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election — published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — said those groups were prepared to support the effort. “The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives,” the memo said, noting its “pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process.” The impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits. For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would “prohibit” firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place. This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters. Cegavske said the ballot language she used fairly reflected text submitted to her office by those advocating the measure. “There was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question,” Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement. After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to “meet and strategize” about its opposition effort. A spokesman for Husted said that “the amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome” and that “the secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works.” Minimum-wage advocates chastised Washington’s secretary of state, Kim Wyman, who is in the midst of a re-election campaign. She has benefited from a blitz of radio advertisements paid for by the Republican group that sponsored the May meetings with industry representatives. Wyman declined requests to comment. At the three-day hunt — where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls — there was little discussion of formal election matters. Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. “I was 60 yards away,” Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. “The two that got away,” Kobach said. “We’ll get ’em tomorrow,” said one of the corporate executives. https://www.propublica.org/article/clay-pigeons-how-lobbyists-secretly-w...   Eric Lipton is a Washington-based correspondent for The New York Times, where he writes about government relations, corporate agendas and Congress.

The shareholder, among the company's 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company's direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited Whole Foods' poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Several activist investors, who asked not to be named, said they are aware of the shareholder's suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It's unclear if any has begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas-based company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. "Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders," Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an email Friday. "As discussed on Wednesday's earnings call, we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term." Shares of Whole Foods rose 2.7 percent to $29.22 at 12:42 p.m. in New York after being temporarily halted. The stock has suffered a steep decline, falling by half from a 2015 high of $57.20. The company said Wednesday it will end its longstanding practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, continue to advance on Whole Foods' organic turf, weighing on sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Wal-Mart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Organic products have become widely available at U.S. stores, often at lower prices than Whole Foods offers. Food deflation hasn't helped the company, as other retailers slash prices amid falling costs for items like beef and eggs. Whole Foods has said its new chain, called 365, will add to 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. That forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the stock reached its all-time high of $65.24. Analysts have since questioned whether there's capacity for more high-end organic grocers in the U.S.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

She said there were multiple factors that went into the decision, including the need for shopping hours. “We decided it would be in the best interest of those working in and for the mall and for their families to take the day off,” Freeland said. “Everybody needs a break.” According to the National Retail Federation, the Black Friday weekend brought in more than 151 million shoppers nationwide last year, making it the largest shopping weekend of the year. “It’s crazy,” Freeland said. “But it’s fun. It’s a lot of fun.” She said in years past, they have estimated between 90,000-100,000 people visit the mall over the three-day shopping period. Many stores in the area, like Walmart and Macy’s, will remain open on Thanksgiving to begin sales. However, those at Kentucky Oaks Mall aren’t concerned that being closed will cut into their profits. Freeland said while they want to remain competitive with the stores that are choosing to remain open, they are still expecting to bring in a large amount of consumers Friday morning. “People will be relaxed and ready to shop,” she said. She said they plan on continuing the Balloon Drop Friday morning, which is a tradition that the mall looks forward to every year. “There’s a prize in every balloon. It might be $5 or $500. You just never know,” said Freeland. She said the community has rallied around their decision to be closed, which is something that makes them feel like they are doing the right thing. Freeland said they’ve received dozens of messages from community members applauding them for the move and showing their support. “I’ve even had an employee say that she almost cried because she has a new baby, and she was so happy she would be home to spend Thanksgiving with her family,” Freeland said. Kentucky Oaks Mall is corporately owned by Cafaro Company, which is based out of Niles, Ohio. The company has 12 other malls, each of which decide whether or not to remain open on the holiday. Freeland said Cafaro, as well as those who work at Kentucky Oaks Mall, will evaluate the results of this year’s sales to see what happens in the future.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up in July. A prominent developerís deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Residents reluctant to back residential plan that doesn’t include details on commercial half of site. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) The South Salt Lake Planning Commission is expected to vote Nov. 17 on a new proposal to develop the southern half of the old Granite High School property. But the plan got 3½ hours of attention at the commission's meeting Thursday, where about 25 residents chimed in. A plan to develop the site of the closed century-old school with homes and a Wal-Mart grocery store on the northern portion died at the hands of a mayoral veto in March. Now, Garbett Homes has revived the deal with a proposal that focuses only on the less-controversial residential half of the lot. Garbett Homes has applied to change the land use to get started on construction of about 80 homes near 3540 S. 500 East. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The developer says the homes will imitate the style and solar capability of homes in the nearby Terra Sol development and feature a 1-acre park. The commission's feedback to Garbett Homes: The proposed park doesn't meet city standards for green space, and the commission also thinks it could be better situated to serve the larger public. Community Development Director Michael Florence says some of the speakers from the public liked the plan, and some listed lack of green space and wanting to preserve the property's history as concerns. Most opponents brought grievances from the old plan. Residents hesitated to back a plan that didn't specify what would happen to the commercial northern half of the old school site. "We made it clear to the Planning Commission that they had to consider the merits of the project that was in front of them, because the north half wasn't part of this project," said Florence.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

By Robert Faturechi, ProPublica and Eric Lipton, The New York Times click to enlarge Copyright: kyoza3d / 123RF Stock Photo Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation's second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles G. and David H. Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. "The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that's a news story I don't need," Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. "With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital," said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line "Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC," Emily Keech, the committee's executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. "I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights," Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. "I don't want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries," Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. "It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way," said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. "And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive." Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. "The key to any ballot measure is the right language," Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Walmart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Va. "In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language." Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: "The clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds." Republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo. "Ballot initiatives will not be the left's mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them," said the memo, from the Republican State Leadership Committee, in February 2015 as the group prepared fundraising efforts. "It's time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own." The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, "The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion," and then discussed "the importance of ballot initiatives" as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation's largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the United States Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. "When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects," said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, "I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time." But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives. "As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns," she said in a statement. Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a "contact list" prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee's executive director. "I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country," Keech wrote to Cegavske, referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company's monopoly over much of the state's electricity market. Cegavske's executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. "Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution," the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April. "What great news!!!!" Keech wrote back. "The Secretaries' contacts are ALWAYS better than ours." In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was "categorically false." Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael R. Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to an Oregon candidate who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election — published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — said those groups were prepared to support the effort. "The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives," the memo said, noting its "pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process." The impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits. For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would "prohibit" firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place. This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters. Cegavske said the ballot language she used fairly reflected text submitted to her office by those advocating the measure. "There was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question," Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement. After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to "meet and strategize" about its opposition effort. A spokesman for Husted said that "the amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome" and that "the secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works." Minimum-wage advocates chastised Washington's secretary of state, Kim Wyman, who is in the midst of a re-election campaign. She has benefited from a blitz of radio advertisements paid for by the Republican group that sponsored the May meetings with industry representatives. Wyman declined requests to comment. At the three-day hunt — where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls — there was little discussion of formal election matters. Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. "I was 60 yards away," Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. "The two that got away," Kobach said. "We'll get 'em tomorrow," said one of the corporate executives.

 Why Americans don't participate in the biggest shopping day in the world Hayley Peterson Nov. 6, 2016, 4:25 PM 13,811 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alibaba Founder Jack Ma during a presentation for Singles' Day.Reuters The biggest shopping holiday in the world is kicking off next week, and most Americans don't even know it exists. The holiday is called Singles' Day and it's held every year on November 11. It's like China's version of Cyber Monday, but seven times as big. Alibaba — China's largest e-commerce company — has helped turn Singles' Day into the biggest shopping frenzy in the world by offering deep discounts during the 24-hour period on items as varied as cars and clothes. Hundreds of other companies have started taking part in the cyberspending blitz over the years by offering discounts of their own. So why don't more Americans' participate in Singles' Day — or even know what it is? US retailers are largely to blame, as most of them have been reluctant to add another "Black Friday" or "Cyber Monday" to their fall calendars. "All retailers are laser-focused on ramping up for the period from Black Friday to Christmas," says Danny Silverman, head of product strategy at ecommerce analytics firm Clavis Insight. "To participate in Singles' Day would sap sales from that critical period." Workers sort packages after Singles' Day in 2015.Reuters This would be a risky move "particularly for publicly held companies where Black Friday to Christmas sales are considered indicators of retailer and market health," he said. Singles' Day also coincides with Veterans Day in the US, and some retailers already plan promotions tied to that holiday, says Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, an e-commerce solutions provider that owns FreeShipping.com. Several US-based companies do in fact participate in Singles' Day — including Walmart, Macy's, Gap, Target, and Costco — but very few of them offer deals to domestic shoppers. Most of them target Chinese shoppers on Alibaba's shopping websites Tmall and Taobao. In fact, Costco was the top TMall Global seller on Singles' Day last year. The company sold about $3.14 million worth of products in a single hour, according to Alibaba. The most popular brands sold on Singles' Day last year include Uniqlo, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance. An employee sorts packages at a hub of Shentong (STO) Express delivery company in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, November 11, 2014.Reuters Overall, Alibaba generated $14.3 billion in sales on Singles' Day last year. This year, sales are expected to reach $20 billion in the 24-hour period, according to the research firm Fung Global Retail and Technology. By comparison, Americans spent $5.8 billion online last year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, the largest sales days in the US. Caporaso says its only a matter of time before more US retailers take advantage of Singles' Day and start promoting it domestically. "Last year, QVC, Michael Kors, and Bloomingdale’s offered specific promotions, and we expect a similar showing this year, with additional retailers potentially joining the festivities as Singles’ Day approaches," Caporaso says.  So US shoppers should keep their eyes peeled on Singles' Day, because there might be some unexpected deals coming their way.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo WASHINGTON – Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage. Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday’s election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party. Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party’s nomination to Barack Obama. Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton. Clinton’s admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist. Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party’s odds-on favorite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July. For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton’s infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband’s presidency about a “vast right-wing conspiracy.” Many Democrats back her for championing women’s rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/ Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy. As President Obama’s secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran’s nuclear program, China’s growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died. That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack. ‘WHAT TO MAKE OF ME’ A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up. “The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ‘service’ part has always come easier to me than the ‘public’ part,” Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. “I get it that some people just don’t know what to make of me.” At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, “There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill – nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States.” Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama’s Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges. “If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently,” Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a “mistake” for which she took responsibility. The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear. Trump seized on the probe into Clinton’s email, deriding her as “Crooked Hillary,” saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant “lock her up.” Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief. “Such a nasty woman,” Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy. MIDWESTERN ROOTS Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a “rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican” and a mother who was a closet Democrat. She said she inherited her father’s distinctive laugh – she called it “a big rolling guffaw” – and Americans have heard it frequently. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator. Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat. At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple’s only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980. As Arkansas’ first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member. Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband’s bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get “two for the price of one” if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who “stayed home and baked cookies.” After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette’s song, “Stand by Your Man.” “You know, I’m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,” she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. “And you know, if that’s not enough for people, then heck, don’t vote for him,” she added. Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors. Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as “Hillarycare.” At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights.” She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton’s sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted “conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he ‘knew about Whitewater.'” In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater. In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with “high crimes and misdemeanors” for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a “Soviet-style show trial” and condemned what she called “an attempted congressional coup d’etat.” She also said she “wanted to wring Bill’s neck” for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling. “All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does,” she wrote in her 2003 book “Living History.” Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009. She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party’s nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president. In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump. “What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn’t stop caring, and she doesn’t stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven’t always appreciated it,” Obama told a September rally. – Reuters Related Posts Mugabe threatens ‘Gukurahundi’ genocide on War Vets backing Mnangagwa Harare, – Embattled Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe on Thursday shocked Zanu PF loyalists when he bluntly threatened a crackdown akin to the Gukurahundi massacres on a section of war veterans ...

News World Americas US elections Welcome to Grundy, Virginia - the town that loves Donald Trump the most There was nowhere in America where the tycoon performed better in the primaries Andrew Buncombe Grundy, Virginia @AndrewBuncombe Sunday 6 November 2016 18:34 BST Popular videos Rae Sremmurd hitting the mainstream thanks to Mannequin Challenge First full look at Emma Watson's Belle in Beauty and the Beast trailer Daily Mail evacuated after 'suspicious package' found The Hilltop features in new The Walking Dead trailer There are so many campaign signs hammered into the roadside or plastered onto fences in the valley that follows the Levisa Fork River, that it is pointless to try and count them all. Yet the only ones that mention Hillary Clinton, are those suggesting she should be sent to jail. There are a lot of places where Donald Trump’s quick-fix political message - about bringing back jobs from overseas, against immigrants and about defending traditional industries - have resounded powerfully with voters.  But there was nowhere that topped Virginia’s Buchanan County when it came to voting for the New York tycoon in this year’s primaries. This Appalachian community, tucked away in the mountains near the borders with Kentucky and West Virginia and coloured by the reds and rust of autumn leaves, is officially the "Trumpiest" place in the country. Nancy Looney and Jeanette Matney said there were only a few well paid jobs still in Grundy (Andrew Buncombe ) “I will vote for Trump,” said Jeanette Matney, 46, whose husband until last year had a job in a coal mine she said paid $10,000 a month. After being unemployed for a year, he how works as a correctional officer at the Keen Mountain Correctional Centre she said now earns $1,700. “The mining used to be booming. The place where my husband was a miner probably now has no more than 100 people,” she said.  “When you lose that sort of money, you live on a budget, you send things back. You go to the grocery store and only get the things you need.” Buchanan County, which has an estimated population of 22,776 and of which Grundy is the county seat, came to the attention to political pundits earlier this year when it gave Mr Trump his biggest margin of victory during the Republican primaries. The 70-years-old may not have come within three hours of the county, but on March 1 people delivered him 69.7 per cent of the vote. Of the 2,278 votes cast for Republicans, 1,588 went to Mr Trump, 313 for Marco Rubio and 266 for Ted Cruz. Ms Clinton won 523 of the 744 votes cast for Democrats. Miners in Grundy can earn more than $90,000 a year (AP) It is not hard to see why this small rural community, with a population that is 95 per cent cent white, rallied around Mr Trump with such intensity. It is one of many across the country that have seen the good times go, to be replaced by hardship, unemployment and depopulation. At the heart of the community was the mining industry. It was hard, unhealthy and dangerous work; employees frequently suffered broken limbs, wore out their joints or else fell ill to black lung, or coal workers' pneumoconiosis.  One former miner, Paul Yates, who worked in the industry for 22 years and who was eating breakfast in a diner, demonstrated how he used to eat his sandwiches while lying horizontally.  But people said that workers took those risks after calculating they would be able to provide for their families with the healty salaries they provided. “There used to be no problem getting a job in the mines in the Seventies and Eighties,” said Tim Ellswick, who was sitting next to a statue of a miner that stands outside the Buchanan County courthouse. Virginia has seen mining jobs fall by almost 40 per cent in the last few years (Andrew Buncombe ) The 54-year-old said he was not planning to vote on Tuesday; he said he had ever voted in a presidential election. But one of his friends, Lonnie Looney, said he would be casting his ballot for Mr Trump. He did not think greatly of either of the candidates, but he believed Mr Trump was the best chance people here had to see the mines restored, and well-paid manufacturing jobs returned to America. “During the Seventies and Eighties, this place was booming,” he said. “You could not walk down this street there’d be so many people on it, and shops and stores.” He said he thought Ms Clinton was guilty of having lied to the FBI. “If I’ve done something wrong, I have to pay for the consequences. I don’t think she is any better than us,” he said. “In five years, in this community, everybody will leave. If you have money, you can stay. But if you need to work, you will have to leave.”  The decline of the mining industry is not something unique to Buchanan County. As it is, the mountains here are a rich source of metallurigucal coal used in steel making. But reports have pointed out that Australia and Russia are also major providers of this type of coal, the price of which has tumbled by up to 75 per cent since 2011. The Roanoke Times-Dispatch said that between 2011 and 2015, the number of  coal mining jobs in Virginia fell from 4,867 to 3,033 - a loss of around 38 per cent. Earlier this year, one of the largest employers in the county, CONSOL Energy, sold its mine and assets in a $420m deal with Coronado IV. Local people said that nothing had arrived to take the well-paying jobs provided that the mines provided. The only options for work were now in places such as Wal-Mart, or fast-food restaurants which pay minimum wages and and are rarely full time. Unemployment in Buchanan County officially stands at more than 12 per cent, while a remarkable 20 per cent of residents under the age of 65 are on disability payments. Around 23 per cent of people live below the poverty line Obesity and diabetes are rife. The Atlantic magazine last year described Grundy as the “sickest town in America”. People here feel Ms Clinton will do nothing to help. Indeed, they seize on a comment she made in a town hall meeting in March in which she said she was the only person with a “policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country”.  There were only signs for Republican candidates in Grundy (Andrew Buncombe ) “Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right,” she had said. “And we’re going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people. Those people laboured in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories.” The people of Buchanan County did not appreciate the comment, which Ms Clinton said was spun out of context. In May, she was confronted by an unemployed miner, Bo Copely, who asked: “How you could say you are going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs, and then come in here and tell us how you’re going to be our friend?” Dirk Hall said listeners to his radio station were mainly supporters of Mr Trump (Andrew Buncombe ) By contrast, Mr Trump has sought to portray himself as a friend of the mining industry and promised to cut back on regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. “We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 per cent,” he said in a speech before the Virginia primary. “If I win, we’re going to get clean coal and that technology is working. I hear it works.” A powerful insight into the views of the residents of Grundy was provided courtesy of the local radio station, WMJD, which plays a lively mix of classic country. One recent morning, the station’s owner, Dirk Hall, invited The Independent to sit in and take calls from listeners.  Read more Donald Trump in the White House would wreck the world economy Variety endorses a presidential candidate for first time in 111 years Trump and Clinton never talk to us, say 'demoralised' American-Muslims One after another talked of the need to restore the mining industry, if the community was to have any chance of surviving. And they believed Mr Trump, and not Ms Clinton, was their best shot. One woman caller said: “Good morning…Welcome to the United States of America, of which we are still very proud. But if Hillary gets in, it is going to be a different story.” More about: US election 2016 Grundy Buchanan County coal mining Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton.Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist.Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favorite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July.For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a "vast right-wing conspiracy."Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2]Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy.As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died.That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack.'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME' A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up."The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part," Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. "I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me."At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, "There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States."Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges. "If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently," Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a "mistake" for which she took responsibility.The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear.Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as "Crooked Hillary," saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant "lock her up."Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief."Such a nasty woman," Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy.MIDWESTERN ROOTS Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a "rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican" and a mother who was a closet Democrat.She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it "a big rolling guffaw" - and Americans have heard it frequently. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator.Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat.At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980.As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member.Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get "two for the price of one" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who "stayed home and baked cookies."After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, "Stand by Your Man.""You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette," she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. "And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him," she added. Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors.Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as "Hillarycare."At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights." She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted "conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'" In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater.In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with "high crimes and misdemeanors" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a "Soviet-style show trial" and condemned what she called "an attempted congressional coup d'etat."She also said she "wanted to wring Bill's neck" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling."All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does," she wrote in her 2003 book "Living History."Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009.She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president.In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump."What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying.

Satullo | For lehighvalleylive.com By Sara K. Satullo | For lehighvalleylive.com The Express-Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 06, 2016 at 7:49 AM, updated November 07, 2016 at 3:50 PM comments Penn State Lehigh Valley is adding a new degree inspired by the growth of the Lehigh Valley's distribution and manufacturing sector. Penn State Lehigh Valley is offering a new degree program inspired by the region's burgeoning warehousing and logistics industry. (Courtesy photo | For lehighvalleylive.com) The Center Valley campus will begin offering a bachelor of science degree in project and supply chain management in fall 2017. The program comes out of close work with Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp., which commissioned an Oxford Economics analysis of the region's top-growing business sectors, said Penn State Lehigh Valley Chancellor Tina Q. Richardson. "The commonwealth campuses have the opportunity to select degrees for their portfolio that match the needs of their region," Richardson said. "...We anticipate the growth in enrollment in this program will be very high." Distribution is the region's fastest growing industry and manufacturing is the region's largest economic sector, said Don Cunningham, CEO and president of LVEDC. "It's important that we maintain a strong pipeline of talent to fill jobs in these sectors, and I applaud Penn State Lehigh Valley for their forward-thinking approach in introducing this new degree," Cunningham said. The Lehigh Valley's biggest housing developments The Lehigh Valley's proximity to Philadelphia and New York, and easy access to major highways like Interstate 78, Route 22 and 33, have contributed to a boom in warehousing. A massive Fed-Ex hub is planned in Allen Township, and Amazon just opened another distribution center at Chrin Commerce Center in Palmer Township. Lehigh Valley Industrial Park VII is home to Primark's East Coast distribution center and Zulily. And, the adjacent Majestic Realty center is home to Crayola and Wal-Mart facilities. "The number of distribution and manufacturing companies in the Lehigh Valley, and our proximity to New York City and Philadelphia, will allow for endless field experience and networking opportunities for our students," said Kenneth Thigpen, director of academic affairs at Penn State Lehigh Valley. Students will be able to graduate and find good-paying work quickly, which made the major an attractive addition to the campus' offerings, Richardson said. The median salary of a supply chain manager is $104,850, according to the O*Net database, which was developed for the U.S. Department of Labor. The major will help students develop knowledge, skills and abilities in project management, supply chain principles and business fundamentals, officials said. It provides a broad educational foundation that lends itself to further specialization, such as logistics or procurement, said Maung Min, director of business programs at the college. "Very simply, supply chain management deals with the flow of goods and services," Min said. "If you are interested in understanding the management and planning of turning raw materials into final product and the coordinating that is involved in this process, then project and supply chain is for you." All of the courses will be offered at the Penn State Lehigh Valley campus. Sara K. Satullo may be reached at ssatullo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @sarasatullo and Facebook.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Hatchimals Pengulas, Draggles, Burtles, Owlicorns And Bearakeet Detailed Posted: Nov 6 2016, 4:50am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 8 2016, 7:50am CST, in News | Holiday Gift Guide   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Hatchimals are the hottest Holiday toys of 2016 and have become the collector's items and gold for resellers. See also a video explaining in detail how to play with Hatchimals and how to unpack them without damaging the egg. Spinmaster's Hatchimals bring back memories of the Furby madness almost 20 years ago. Just like the Furby in 1998, Hatchimals have sold out early in the Holiday season and a big reseller market started to trade the hard to find Holiday toys. You can find the Hatchimals flooding the Amazon Marketplace right now. Don't Miss: Black Friday 2016: Everything You Need to Know Now The Hatchimals reseller market prices the hatchlings at about a 100% premium depending on the kind of Hatchimals. For those who have been there for the Furby craze, the Furby also had different prices depending on the color and pattern of the fur. Spinmaster used that well and proven concept and offers five different kinds of Hatchimals, with three of them sold exclusively at specific retailers. Each kind of Hatchimals comes in different colors, adding another dimension for collectors.  To make it even more interesting, each egg contains one of two colors. The colors of the Hatchimals inside is coded into the colored dots on the egg shell. Find all Hatchimals listed below. Hatchimals have a suggested retail price is $59.99. As reported earlier, Spinmaster has announced that the initial shipments of Hatchimals have sold out. There is supposed new inventory still hitting store shelves this month, but the toy maker also said that their increased production will miss the Holidays and arrive in early 2017. The Hatchimals demand is dramatically higher in the United States than in other countries. The reseller prices in Germany and the UK are still way under $100. If you have friends in Europe, you can ask them to pick Hatchimals up for you and mail them to you. European toy stores expect new Hatchimals inventory still to arrive end of November. As mentioned above, the prices for Hatchimals on the reseller market available on Amazon.com and eBay.com are increasing almost every day now. The average price is now at around $150 for single Hatchimals egg. Pengulas Hatchimals As the name suggests the Pengula Hatchimals look like cute little penguins. Available colors of Pengulas are Pink and Teal and in the all Pink Pengulas egg are red and a pink Hatchimals. Pengualas are according to Spinmaster happy-go-lucky Hatchimals who are quirky, friendly, clumsy, and kind. Pengulas are common. Pengulas are sold in all stores that carry Hatchimals. Draggles Hatchimals Also common are the Draggles. These Hatchimals are curious, brave, and energetic, Hatchimals Draggles are also quite shy and lovable.

See the available Owlicorn deals on eBay and Amazon. Burtle Hatchimals Walmart's exclusive Burtle Hatchimals is my personal favorite. Burtles are super sweet Hatchimals with soft shells and butterfly wings, who hail from a magical meadow says Spinmaster. I just love the little curly antennas, which looks much cuter than the Owlicorn's horn. The Burtle Hatchimals is listed on walmart.com. The Burtle is available on the reseller market. BearaKeet Hatchimals The BearaKeet Hatchimals is also cute with its little teddy bear ears. With their unique feather shaped tails and vibrant coats, Bearakeets are the spunkiest Hatchimals according to Spinmaster's description.

The best option to buy Hatchimals now is on the Amazon.com. About Hatchimals Hatchimals are magical creatures that live inside of eggs. Each egg contains one of two interactive Hatchimals. Kids need to care for the toy while it is still inside the egg and its eyes will light up as it makes cute sounds, telling you how it’s feeling. Once your children have played with it enough, you’ll see rainbow eyes. That means its time to hatch. Hatchimals can’t hatch on their own. Kid's touch encourages them to peck their way out of the egg. Now you get to raise your furry Hatchimal through 3 stages, from baby to toddler, to kid. Your Hatchimal sings “Hatchy Birthday” each time it enters a new stage. Teach yours to walk, dance, play games and more. It will even repeat what you say in its own voice.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 6 November 2016 | MYT 8:37 PM Fending off foes, Clinton blazes a trail with White House in sight by will dunham WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage. Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesday's election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party. Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her party's nomination to Barack Obama. Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton. Clinton's admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist. Clinton entered the 2016 race as her party's odds-on favourite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamoured with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July. For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clinton's infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husband's presidency about a "vast right-wing conspiracy." Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [http://polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2] Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy. As President Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Iran's nuclear program, China's growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died. That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack. 'WHAT TO MAKE OF ME' A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up. "The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part," Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. "I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me." At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, "There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States." Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information by email, but Obama's Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges. "If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently," Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a "mistake" for which she took responsibility. The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear. Trump seized on the probe into Clinton's email, deriding her as "Crooked Hillary," saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant "lock her up." Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief. "Such a nasty woman," Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy. MIDWESTERN ROOTS Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a "rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican" and a mother who was a closet Democrat. She said she inherited her father's distinctive laugh - she called it "a big rolling guffaw" - and Americans have heard it frequently. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator. Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat. At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couple's only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980. As Arkansas' first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member. Most Americans were introduced to her during her husband's bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get "two for the price of one" if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who "stayed home and baked cookies." After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynette's song, "Stand by Your Man." "You know, I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette," she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. "And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him," she added. Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. WHITE HOUSE CONTROVERSIES Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors. Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as "Hillarycare." At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights." She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted "conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he 'knew about Whitewater.'" In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behaviour related to Whitewater. In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with "high crimes and misdemeanours" for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a "Soviet-style show trial" and condemned what she called "an attempted congressional coup d'etat." She also said she "wanted to wring Bill's neck" for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counselling. "All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does," she wrote in her 2003 book "Living History." Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009. She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the party's nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president. In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump. "What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it," Obama told a September rally.

Find & Save Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive subscribe Editorial: Reviewing the ballot questions Sunday Nov 6, 2016 at 2:00 AM Nov 7, 2016 at 11:30 AM Our recommendations on questions facing Massachusetts voters Early voting in Massachusetts has proved popular in its inaugural run, and as many as a third or more of eligible voters have already cast their ballots in some communities. For the rest of us, Tuesday is the last chance. While we can’t believe there are many voters still undecided about the hard-fought presidential contest, there are four ballot questions that deserve thought before you head to the polls. Allow us to review our recommendations.  Question 1  Five years ago, the state Legislature legalized casino gambling, establishing a process for authorizing three full casinos and one slots parlo, spread across the state. Voters endorsed the law in 2014, rejecting a move to repeal it by a strong margin. Question 1 aims to change that structure for the sole benefit of a developer who wants to build a slots parlor next to Suffolk Downs in Revere. His project’s location, close to the Wynn casino now being built in Everett, would undermine the state’s plan to create a sustainable gaming industry spread around the state. There’s simply no good reason to support Question 1, so we urge a No vote. (Full editorial here)  Question 2  The most contentious issue on the ballot would authorize more charter schools to open in struggling school districts where they are now capped by law. Charter schools are public schools, open to all students, controlled by independent boards and supervised by the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. For the proponents of Question 2, it’s all about the kids - specifically, the 32,000 mostly urban, mostly low-income students stuck on waiting lists for charter schools in the cities where the cap has prevented charter expansion. For the opponents, it’s been all about the money - specifically, the state aid that follows the students to the charter schools. We find the money argument unpersuasive. A Mass. Taxpayers Foundation report found that 3.9 percent of public education funding goes to charter schools, which educate 3.9 percent of the public school population. Meanwhile, per-pupil spending has risen in every school district, notably Boston’s, which now spends more per pupil than Wellesley. Charter schools spend significantly less per pupil, while delivering better results - especially for low-income students, English language learners and special needs students. Independent researchers have found two years in a charter school is often enough to close the achievement gap between white and minority students. Public charter schools have a mixed record nationally, but here in Massachusetts, where for-profit charter schools are prohibited and state education officials set high standards for awarding and renewing charters, they are changing lives for the better for the state’s neediest children. On their behalf, we urge a YES vote. (Full editorial here)  Question 3  If approved, Question 3 would require all eggs and meat sold in Massachusetts be produced in humane conditions, specifically that hens and livestock be kept in pens large enough so they can turn around, stretch their legs and extend their wings. Proponents argue that other states have already adopted similar rules, and that major purchasers of agricultural products, including McDonald’s, Walmart and Dunkin’ Donuts, have already committed to selling only humanely-raised products. Opponents argue that conscientious consumers can already choose to purchase only humanely-raised products, and that the new rules will drive up the cost of food. We find that the evidence from other states indicates such changes aren’t all that expensive, and the long phase-in period in Question 3 will give producers plenty of time to adapt. We recommend a YES vote. (Full editorial here)  Question 4  Four states have already legalized the possession and sale of marijuana for recreational use, and Massachusetts is one of five states considering proposals to to do the same on Tuesday’s ballot. Question 4 would create a Cannabis Control Commission empowered to regulate marijuana products and marketing, with local control over siting and signage, and an option to ban facilities through a vote in a local election. Some opponents of Question 4 have fallen back on Reefer Madness hysteria, warning of poisoned pets and children, carnage on the highways and neighborhoods overrun with lurid pot shops. Others have said the state Legislature should produce its own legalization bill, and that it’s just too soon to take such a big step. Our position is that marijuana is already widely used and here to stay. There are legitimate public interests involved - keeping adult intoxicants away from children, highway safety and consumer protection, for starters - but a regulated market of licensed dealers is much better suited to protect those interests than the black market that has been supplying the Bay State with marijuana for 50 years. We doubt the Legislature could - or would - produce a better bill, and lawmakers will have ample opportunity to address any problems that arise from legalization that the Cannabis Control Commission can’t handle. We recommend a YES vote.

(Reuters/Lucy Nicholson) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession The Art of Parenting November 06, 2016 There are more than 180 nations with laws guaranteeing some form of paid maternity leave. Among them are some of the world’s poorest, smallest, and most dangerous countries, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Dominica, Haiti, Kiribati, Syria, and Yemen. There are nine countries without it—six tiny Pacific island nations, Papua New Guinea, Surinam, and the United States of America. The US, a pioneer in so many domains, is a laggard when it comes to government support for childcare and family needs, and in no aspect are its deficiencies more glaring than in providing paid leave for new parents. The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires US employers to provide only unpaid time off for childbirth. While some employers do offer paid parental leave, only 12% of American workers are covered by those policies. The US became a global outlier because of long-standing philosophical ideas about the role of the state in society, and how its economy has evolved. But it’s also due to strategic decisions made by advocates for women’s rights, during a crucial moment in policymaking history, in the face of fierce opposition to leave policies on the part of business interests. Despite its lamentable record, the US may now be closer to enacting some form of paid family leave than at any point in its history. Legislation introduced in both the US House and Senate are gaining support, a handful of states have adopted their own policies, and both major-party candidates for president say they endorse some form of paid leave. (Hillary Clinton wants to cover up to 12 weeks of leave for both parents, while Donald Trump has proposed six weeks of maternity leave only, through an expansion of federal unemployment insurance.) Advocates for paid leave are particularly optimistic that a Clinton presidency might yield a new federal policy. “We could have a perfect storm of a president that prioritizes this issue, law makers who are hearing more and more about it, and the demonstration that it works well on the state level and provides economics benefits,” says Vicki Shabo, vice president for the National Partnership for Women & Families, which is lobbying Congress on the issue. The FAMILY Act The key differences between the proposal in the Congress, called the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, and Clinton’s proposal, is the funding mechanism. The FAMILY Act borrows from the state models, and would fund paid leave through a modest payroll tax paid by both workers and employers; Clinton, meanwhile, has proposed a new tax on the highest earners. The FAMILY Act might have an easier path through Congress, particularly because it is based on the successful state plans, but Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $250,000, which may be why she hasn’t supported a new payroll tax. Shabo says her group doesn’t prefer one plan over the other, so long as some version of paid leave becomes law. Any bill will be boosted by either a Democratic majority in Congress or a major breakthrough among Republicans. The current versions of the bill, sponsored by New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut representative Rosa DeLauro, both Democrats, have yet to escape their legislative committees. If paid parental leave becomes law, the US could quickly become a leader on the issue for the first time in more than century. The traditional US model broke down years ago In Europe, legalized maternity leave dates to 1883, when Germany passed the first law. Sweden followed in 1891, and France in 1928. Initially, the laws were rooted in paternalistic concern for the health of mothers and children. Particularly after World War II, when women entered the workforce in large numbers, many countries adopted laws to shield pregnant women from the workplace and return them to the home. In many nations, taking leave was mandatory. In the 1960s, the motivations behind the laws in Europe began to shift and the rights of women began to guide lawmakers. Increasingly, women were guaranteed rights to return to their jobs and were offered income replacement, usually paid by the government. Those countries had reasons beyond a sense of justice to ensure women could afford to have children, says Joan Williams, a law professor at the University of California Hastings, who has written about these policies. As birth rates declined, Europe was confronted with a looming labor shortage. Policymakers viewed increasing the domestic population as preferable to depending on immigrants, and they looked for ways to reduce obstacles for parents, she says. The experience for working mothers in the US was much different, in part due to the country’s abundant labor supply, but also its small-government tradition and Calvinist-informed views about sex and family. Says Williams, “The reason you have paid maternity leave in Europe is they think of citizenship very differently than in the US. In the US having children is viewed as a private frolic, the same as hang gliding. You don’t subsidize my hang gliding, I don’t subsidize your child.” Instead of relying on the state, US workers have traditionally looked to their employers to care for them. Through much of the early to mid-20th century, much of US labor was organized in what some theorists call the Fordist industrial economy, named after Henry Ford. Under this system, workers—almost always male—were paid a wage high enough to ensure their loyalty to the firm, and to provide for their families. The wives could afford, and were expected, to stay at home and raise children, according to Catherine Albiston and Lindsey Trimble O’Connor, who describe the history of US leave policies in an article called “Just Leave” in the Harvard Journal of Law & Gender. The Fordist system depends on industry offering life-long work, and on families organized in traditional, two-parent models. Both of those assumptions began to break down in the 1970s, as US industry fell pray to foreign competition, and as the rise of no-fault divorces meant more families were no longer in traditional two-parent households. From 1970 to 2012, the number of US households with married parents and children fell in half, from 40.3% of all households to 19.6%, according to US Census data. The changes in family and employment structures meant more women with children needed to work—while the simultaneous rise of feminism meant that more women wanted to, and could. In the 1970s, US legislators began passing laws to ensure that women could take time off after childbirth and return to their jobs. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include pregnancy, in response to a US Supreme Court decision ruling that employers were not obliged to provide disability benefits for pregnant women. While the law protected women in jobs with benefits that included disability leave, most low-income workers weren’t covered. The next year, California passed a law requiring employers to give women up to four months of unpaid leave following child birth. The California legislation was ushered into law by then-state assemblyman Howard Berman, a Los Angeles Democrat who was the chamber’s majority leader. Six years later, Berman was in Congress, and planned to introduce a similar law creating a national right for maternity leave. In meetings with women’s rights advocates, Berman was convinced to expand the bill to include paternity leave, too. The argument: Men also need time to bond with their babies, and law that only applied only to women meant employers might not hire women if they thought they might become pregnant, Berman recalls. But as Berman’s maternity leave bill evolved into something more ambitious—it would eventually became the basis for Family & Medical Leave Act—discussions about actually paying parents during their leave didn’t advance far. “In the early ‘80s, no one was talking about paid leave,” Berman says. With Reaganism in its ascendancy, and the country coming out of a recession, there was little interest in creating a new entitlement, and it was clear that asking employers or tax payers to pay for maternity leave would kill any bill. “We talked about it and were told pretty early on by political leaders that it just was a non-starter,” says Judith Lichtman, the former executive director of the Women’s Legal Defense Fund (now called the National Partnership for Women & Families), and an early backer of the bill. “It just wasn’t something we could get.” The long road to FMLA In 1985, a conference on parental leave, held in New York, was attended by a wide range of advocates who called for the immediate passage of a leave bill. Paid leave was endorsed in theory, but the only recommendation was that the funding mechanism be studied. “By this means the critical question of pay would be finessed, not just for this conference but by the successive waves of legislative authors and advocates over the course of eight sessions of Congress,” journalist Ron Elving wrote in his book Conflict and Compromise: How Congress Makes the Law, a history of the FMLA. Eventually Berman’s concept was taken up by Patricia Schroeder, a representative from Colorado, who in 1985 introduced the first bill to create a federal parental leave policy. But if its advocates thought a bill without a pay component would have easier passage through Congress, they were proved wrong. The FMLA faced strong resistance from business lobbies, particularly the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. Along with the costs associated with keeping jobs open, employers objected to the idea of the government interfering with how they run their business, said Aparna Mathur, an economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “There’s historical resistance to the federal government getting between the employer and their employees,” she says. Catherine Albiston, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, sees a different motivation. “Their real issue with FMLA is the idea that employers would no longer have unilateral control over the schedule of their employees,” she says. “That medical leave was an entitlement, not a privilege controlled by employers.” Despite the eventual support of Congressional Republicans—including conservatives like Henry Hyde, who were persuaded that allowing women to take time off after childbirth would reduce abortions—the bill was vetoed twice by then-president George H. W. Bush. It wasn’t until after Bill Clinton’s inauguration in 1993 that the FMLA was passed—without paid leave. Even Walmart is getting more generous now While the FMLA was a step forward, it still has flaws, UC-Berkeley’s Albiston notes. It only covers workers in business with more than 50 employees, and who work 1,250 hours in a year, which excludes part-time workers or those who piece together employment from several part-time jobs. That means about 40% of workers aren’t eligible. Even with its gaps, more than 200 million workers have taken advantage of the FMLA since its passage, evidence that Americans quickly embrace social insurance programs. “There is resistance, and then once a program is in place, it’s widely heralded,” Lichtman says. She expects introduction of paid leave would be met with a similar reception. In the decades since FMLA’s passage, there’s been growing recognition in the business world of the value of retaining and rewarding employees. Employers of professionals in technology and consulting firms compete to offer the most generous family benefits programs, such as providing up to 16 weeks paid for either spouse, paid in-vitro fertilization, and even couriers to transport newly pumped breast milk home for traveling mothers. As unemployment falls and workers have more bargaining power, an increasing number of low-wage employers are also providing more generous benefits. Even Walmart, the largest US private employer, has begun offering workers a disability plan for illness or childbirth. Full-time employees can take up to 26 weeks off with 50% pay, for a maximum of $200 a week. Paid leave is gaining support In retrospect, the business lobby’s resistance to FMLA was probably misguided, says the AEI’s Mathur, and she thinks there are sound economic reasons for passing paid leave, particularly if employees cover the cost through a payroll deduction. A paid-leave policy would benefit the economy by keeping people in work, Mathur says. It also might lead to more women entering the workforce, a trend that has climbed sharply from the 1940s but has plateaued in the last two decades. Another argument in support of paid leave is that it would be far less costly than other government insurance programs like Medicare and Social Security. Only about 13% of workers would take advantage of it in any given year, and so the payroll deductions proposed in the FAMILY Act bill are minimal: $0.02 on every $10 earned, or about $1.50 a week for the average worker. Similar plans have been effective in New Jersey, Rhode Island and California, where almost 2 million claims were filed between 2004 and 2014, according to the FAMILY Act’s sponsors. One major shortcoming of the FAMILY Act is that it doesn’t protect workers from retaliation by employers for taking leave, Albiston says. That means low-income workers, especially, might be more reluctant to take leave, and with good reason, she says. While the major business lobbying groups remain opposed, a number of companies have signed on, ranging from predictably progressive Patagonia to more surprising names like Morgan Stanley. And a leaked survey of 1,000 business executives conducted Frank Luntz, a pollster for Republicans, showed overwhelming support for increasing the length of maternity leave and introducing paternity leave. “The fact that there are many big businesses today, unlike in the late ’80s and early ’90s, that are supportive of paid family leave makes me hopeful,” Lichtman says.

It actually runs a collection of industry-leading enterprises such as Kayak.com, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.com - and its crown jewel is Booking.com. Booking.com is the leading player in online travel in Europe. As the European hotel market is very fragmented, many hotels are run by individual owners who lack the expertise and scale to market their hotel to online travelers. Thus, they’ve happily signed on to Booking.com’s platform to help fill rooms. This is a win-win relationship, and since Booking.com was the first mover in Europe, it has built a massive network of properties. That makes it the go-to site for millions of travelers who want the biggest selection of hotels, which in turn attracts more properties. That powerful network effect helps keep competitors at bay. Booking.com’s success is a big reason that Priceline Group’s profits have grown so quickly. Over the last five years, profits have compounded at more than 20 percent annually. Better yet, analysts are currently projecting more than 16 percent growth annually over the next five years. Priceline’s forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio near 18 might not seem “cheap,” but it seems a fair price to pay for a wonderful business that’s poised for prosperity. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Priceline.) Ask the Fool Q: What happens to my cost basis in a stock when the stock splits 2-for-1? - D.T., Walnut Creek, California A: Your basis also splits 2-for-1. Imagine that you bought 100 shares of Acme Explosives Co. (ticker: KBOOM) for $50 each, paying a $10 commission. Your cost basis is $5,010 - or $50.10 per share. After the split, you have 200 shares and your basis is still $5,010, or $25.05 per share. Always add the purchase commission to your cost basis and subtract the sale commission from your proceeds - you’ll save a few tax dollars that way. If you’re paying much more than $10 per trade in commissions, you might want to find a less expensive brokerage. Learn more at sec.gov/answers/openaccount.htm. Q: What is a stock’s “multiple”? - S.G., Elkhart, Indiana A: A “multiple” usually reflects a stock’s price being compared to something. The most common multiple is arguably the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, arrived at by dividing a stock’s current price by its earnings per share. Imagine Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN), a company trading at $60 per share. If it earned $3 per share over the past year, its P/E is 20 (60 divided by 3). You can refer to it as trading at an earnings multiple of 20. If you read analyses of various companies, you’ll see references to price-to-sales multiples, book-value multiples, cash-flow multiples and more. It’s instructive to compare a company’s multiples with those of its peers, to see whether its stock appears to be undervalued or overvalued. Target, for example, recently sported a P/E of 12.4, while Wal-Mart’s was 14.7. That suggests Target is the better bargain, though of course you’ll need to study it more closely. My Dumbest Investment I’ve had some bad results in my investing, but the most annoying mistake I made happened when I first started. I bought one share of stock in each of four companies. That was all the money I had at the time. Years later, the stocks were way down, and I no longer wanted to even own them. Making matters worse, the commission fees of buying and selling one share amounted to more than the cost of the share. I really want to yell at anyone who recommends buying just one share of stock in order to get into investing. - F.D., online The Fool responds: It’s important to pay attention to the commission fees you pay. These days plenty of good brokerages charge $7 or $10 or less per trade, but commissions of $25 or more haven’t been that uncommon in years past. If you buy $100 worth of stock and pay a $25 commission, you’re forking over 25 percent of the value of your investment just in commissions. We suggest paying no more than 2 percent, so if you’re paying $10 per trade, you’ll want your investment to be worth at least $500. Still, despite all that, it’s not the greatest crime if you pay a few $10 commissions to buy a few shares of stock to get you started. Keep up with your holdings over time, too. When you no longer have faith, sell.

The requests come among a multitude of pre-trial motions filed by both defendants and the prosecution in the case, which began two years ago with the discovery of McMillan’s lifeless body on Nov. 4, 2014, in the home he shared with his mother, brother, and the man who authorities said assaulted him repeatedly over the course of some weeks. In pre-trial motions filed recently with Common Pleas Judge William P. Mahon, defense attorney George S. Yacoubian Jr. of Radnor, who represents Gary Lee Fellenbaum, said that his client’s constitutional right to a fair trial had been hopelessly compromised by the pre-trial publicity the case had received in newspaper articles, television broadcasts, and internet posting. “The self-evident conclusion is that this county has been so saturated with the facts underlying this case that it is impossible for defendant to receive a fair trial before a jury of impartial persons who learn of the case only through the evidence properly admitted during trial,” Yacoubian wrote in his request for a change of venue. Advertisement Laurence Harmelin of West Chester, a veteran county defense attorney representing Jillian Tait, McMillan’s mother and Fellenbaum’s girlfriend, also filed a motion requesting the trial be moved. Harmelin made mention of almost one dozen articles about the McMillan murder and the upcoming trial in the Daily Local News, as well as an online poll that appeared in 2015 asking “Death Penalty for Couple Who Tortured Boy?” He noted that many of the stories included graphic descriptions of McMillan’s death and the allegations against Tait. “The wide dissemination of such gruesome, sympathy-engendering, front-page news stories, Facebook articles and internet polls, has created a substantial likelihood that a fair trial cannot be provided, as it will be impossible for the defendant to select a fair and impartial jury of citizens from Chester County,” Harmelin wrote. Both attorneys ask Mahon to either move to trial to another county in the state, or in the alternative to bring residents of another county here to hear the case. A hearing on that motion, as well as the three dozen or more others that were filed by the deadline Mahon imposed earlier of Nov. 1, will be held on Jan. 5, 2017. The trial is scheduled to start April 3, 2017, with jury selection. Mahon has reportedly expressed concern privately about the jury selection process in the case of both Fellenbaum and Tait, who at this point will be tried together. Not only is the trial one in which the prosecution is seeking the death penalty against both defendants, which would require extensive questioning of each panelist to see whether they could impose a death sentence, but it also has been the subject of much discussion in the media, both locally and nationally. In addition, the allegations themselves that have been made against both defendants — that they participated in the beating and torture of 3-year-old Scotty and his older brother, now 8, and kept him from medical care in the West Caln trailer home they shared with Fellenbuam’s wife, Amber Marie Fellenbaum, and the Fellenbaum’s young child — could make it extraordinarily difficult to impanel a jury made up of people who declare they could judge the case fairly on the facts alone and not on sympathy for the victims. Mahon is reportedly considering calling in dozens more prospective jurors from the county than the 124 he had summoned in the last death penalty case over which he presided, that of Coatesville chainsaw killer Laquanta Chapman. He has also noted that extra alternate jurors might need to be empaneled because of the possibility that some jurors chosen might not be emotionally able to complete the trial. The last time a trial for a county crime was tried out of the county was reportedly the escape case involving then-convicted murderer Nicholas Yarris, who jumped out of a constable’s car in West Whiteland and fled while being transported from state prison to Delaware County. That was held in Carlisle, Cumberland County in the mid-1980s. The infamous Johnston Brothers murder trials were also heard by out-of-county juries in the early 1980s. Yacoubian, the private attorney who was hired by Gary Fellenbaum’s family to replace the county’s Public Defender’s Office over the summer, has made it clear in his motions that he is very concerned about the way the jurors are given the evidence in the case. In his motions, he asks Mahon to forbid all “in-life photographs” of McMillan that might prove inflammatory to the jurors; shield them from knowing beforehand what case they might be hearing; and order that there be strict rules about behavior by those attending the trial, including no talking or shaking heads during testimony, or displaying signs, banners, or clothing that might be prejudicial, both in the courtroom and outside the courthouse. For its part, the prosecution also filed motions in the case last week. In them, they ask Mahon to allow a computer simulation of the case to be used in opening statements, and to have McMillan’s older brother, who is expected to testify, give his testimony outside the presence of Fellenbaum. First District Attorney Michael Noone, who is leading the prosecution, also asked Mahon to allow an unidentified “support person” to be with the older child when he testifies. The Daily Local News is not reporting the name of the older brother. Gary Fellenbaum, 25, Tait, 32, and Amber Fellenbaum, 25, all worked at the Walmart in western Chester County in the summer and early fall of 2014. Tait moved in with the Fellenbaums at a trailer home on Hope Lane sometime in September, 2014. Beginning in October 2014, according to the allegations set forth in the case against the Fellenbaums and Tait, Gary Fellenbaum began physically abusing both of Tait’s sons. The abuse included punches and beatings, but also whipping with a crudely fashioned “cat o’nine tails,” and tying the boys to chairs or hanging them upside down by their feet. Allegedly Fellenbaum’s beating of Scott McMillan escalated to the point where the boy could not hold down his food. Angered, Fellenbaum allegedly punched him in the face so hard he fell out of his chair, and later punched him in the stomach. The boy began vomiting and later passed out. Although Fellenbaum and Tait tried to revive him, they left him alone in a bedroom for several hours before finding him completely unresponsive in the evening of Nov. 4, 2014. Both allegedly gave incriminating statements to police investigators after their arrests. Yacoubian and Harmelin have asked Mahon, in their motions, to suppress those statements, saying they were given under duress. Amber Fellenbaum, who did not participate in the alleged abuse, called 911. She is not charged with murder, but rather with endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person. To contact staff writer Michael P. Rellahan call 610-696-1544.

Well it was probably in their respective warehouses with retailers waiting for a massive restock for the holiday season, which is exactly the case with Toysrus Canada. As can be seen in the images below, the Wave 2 deluxes are now on the shelves, along with the latest Robots in Disguise Mini-con Weaponizers and Warriors. The Wave 2 deluxes are also popping up all over Walmarts in the US, showing that the line is slowly starting to saturate across both countries. This just shows that there is a substantial gap between product being sent to retailer warehouses and them being stocked on the shelves. Here is hoping all you fans find the toys you want this holiday season! Thanks to user Gunslinger from cybertron.ca for some of the images above.

No hanging packages sitting messily on the shelf.... in the wrong section, no RID Minicons and Gen Legends on the same rack (bonus points if it's not EITHER of their racks) I've had like no luck at TJ Rossalls stores, but I think asking someone in Canadia to ship me a Sky Lynx would wind up pretty expensive after import fees.

Patricia Pautke told Albuquerque’s KOB-TV (http://bit.ly/2fm9ANB ) on Friday that she was stopped by an employee as she was leaving the store on Halloween. According to Pautke, the male worker made her lift up her clothes in front of other employees and customers to prove she wasn’t hiding any merchandise. Pautke filed a police report this week and has since received an apology from a manager. In a statement, Wal-Mart says it is looking into the incident and will take appropriate action.

Imagine being able to sleep a full night's sleep, with every single worry swiped from your mind. Getting overwhelmed with debt have many repercussions. Aside from the emotional toll, debt could have a negative impact on your credits scores. Many people that engage the services of buy here pay here car dealer because of their inability to access traditional dealership blame it on bad credit scores that comes with previous debts. Isn't that discouraging? A bigger downside is this: many people have absolutely no clue as to why they're in such a life-choking debt. I'll talk about some possible reasons why you might not be able to "shake the shackles" of debt. 1. Out of Sight, Out Of Mind The golden truth of being a consumer is that "if you can't buy something with cash right there and then, you can't afford it." Sadly, more than 57% of people disagree with this. However, there's a silver lining to debt - there's good debt, and there's bad debt. Good debt usually has interest rates below 10%. Hopefully, the savviest of the savvy take advantage of interest rates with tax advantages, on top of those low interest rates. Home mortgages (in best-case scenarios) and student loans are prime examples of "good" debt. Whatever appreciates in value is considered good debt. The evil "bad" debt? Those are things like titanium/black/gold credit cards and 35-40% loans. Nix them, if you can. How? Out of all the credit cards you have, pick the one or two big boys that have the lowest annual interest rates. These cards will then become your "emergency" cards. All the other plastic cretins? Hide them. Remember the adage, "out of sight, out of mind." 2. Poor Money Management An example of poor money management is buying everything new. Buying new means no one else used it before you. So what? There is no shame in using used things. There is shame, however, in having your new toys, gadgets, and stuff taken away because you couldn't pay for them. Buying everything new sets you up for walking down the red line. "Used" doesn't mean "low quality." Being frugal doesn't mean "shopping like poor people." It's okay to be frugal and buy used. 3. Poor Mindset It's a fact in today's business world that your mindset determines your success or failure. Having a millionaire mindset ensures you have half of a chance of getting out of debt's potholes and never again fall into financial quicksand. Luckily, Lifehack developed 6 easy steps to get into the millionaire mindset. In "The Millionaire Fastlane", author MJ Demarco attacks several financial institutions and the ludicrousness of them, such as 401(k)s. Demarco writes, "How to get rich slow: Go to school, get good grades, graduate, get a good job, invest in the stock market, max-out your 401(k), cut up your credit cards, and clip coupons (e.g. be the king of expedia coupon use) ... then someday, when you are, oh, 65 years old, you will be rich." Having enough money to support yourself and your family several lifetimes over isn't worth a roll of toilet paper... if you're miserable the entire time. 4. Not Budgeting While Married This tip is extremely handy for newlyweds. Making a budget as a married couple is not enough. Sticking to that budget is. It's why people who manage money as a married couple are more successful than people who spend, willy-nilly, without developing a plan. You can even use pre-made spreadsheets to keep track of all your income and outcome - totaling the costs at the end of each month (this is a bonus, as it makes filing your taxes come tax season much more bearable). Tracking that budget is more important than merely creating the budget. Want to make sure you both stick to the track? Use a handy envelope budgeting system. This is a perfect system for younger couples who don't make a lot (there's no shame in that). Everything has limits, and as a married couple looking to manage money, the envelope budgeting system will set you on the right track to recognising those limits and respecting them. 5. Throwing Money Down The Drain Want to know how you found yourself in debt quicker than it took you to blink twice? Not saving enough of your money (10% doesn't count for anything, these days, as MJ Demarco proved)... Or even nothing at all. In his book, Demarco wrote "Society, through its 'Get Rich Slow' mandates, has defined 'normal' for you. Normal is waking at 6 a.m., fighting traffic, and working eight hours. Normal is to slave at a job Monday through Friday, save 10%, and repeat for 50 years. Normal is to buy everything on credit." The only way saving your income (to keep from spending most of it) helps your debt, is because it can be used as an "emergency only" box. 6. Your Mortgage Is Too Big Sometimes, mortgages can remind people of nooses. Others, they can be a source of income. According to the Federal Reserve, on the average, home loans make up a grand whopping 68% of household debt. Isn't that a giant "boulder" people are carrying on their shoulders? A few simple quick fixes to this problem would be to find a roommate to take care of some costs, or you can opt for renting a spare room to guests. Another strategy is to get rid of unused liabilities like Timeshares. One of the most renowned American radio talk show host, Laura Ingraham helps people get rid of their timeshares permanently by endorsing reputable companies that help with such case. So, taking inventory of such things you have that can be better managed for income generation (or cost reduction) could go a long way to help you out of debt. 7. Entitlement In small towns, when Wal-Mart set up shop and "ruined" other shops, local business owners complained. "We were here first!" They said. "Wal-Mart's stealing our business!" So what? This little trap called "entitlement" ensures you're on the path to ruin. According to MJ Demarco, author of "The Millionaire Fastlane", thinking anything else is bad for you. "Expect a price to be paid. Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. When you hit the first pothole (and yes, it will happen) know that you are forging the process of your unfolding story." Last Thoughts To stay out of debt, it is imperative that you reward yourself for a hard day's work - or when you pass a special milestone. Always remember that if you can't buy it with cash, right now, you can't afford it. This is the dogma that prevents credit card companies from stealing your life, your money, and (most importantly) your freedom.

While sales for "long term food" typically see an increase around natural disasters and elections, "this is more intense than what we saw in 2012," said Keith Bansemer, VP of marketing for My Patriot Supply, a manufacturer and seller of survival food. During the previous election his company saw sales double. This time it's triple. "We have everyone we can on the phones," he said. "We are overwhelmed." A handout image showing a one-year supply of food for four people. My Patriot Supply Purchases at other long term food supply companies are up as well. Another company, Legacy Foods, said sales are also up 300 percent. And emergency preparedness online store TheEpicenter reports a 6 percent uptick in year over year sales. The meals, sold by the plastic bucket or tote bin, are typically dehydrated or freeze-dried food in sealed military-grade Mylar packs. Menu items include pasta primavera, Hawaiian Style Sweet n' Sour, cheesy broccoli and rice soup, orange energy drink mix and chocolate pudding. They're sold in bundles based on how long they'll feed you. For $2,000 spent at Legacy Foods, you could eat three square meals a day for an entire year. That's 1,080 servings. TheEpicenter has a 14-day supply kit for $235 that's recently been "selling really well," said owner Bryan Nelson. The most popular entry-level seller at My Patriot Supply is a 3-month supply for $497. It comes a in nondescript gray slim line totes bin designed to be easy to stack in the back of a closet or slip under your bed. Big name retailers are in on the game. Costco sells a 1-month supply of 390 servings in plastic gallon buckets for $114.99. Wal-Mart has a bucket deal, too. What's feeding this new urgency? Survivalist consumers says they're preparing for post-election unrest that could involve everything from massive riots, to power grid outages, to the total collapse of the financial system where a can of food becomes currency. And it's not just guys digging a hole on their farm and filling it with MRE's who are driving sales, companies say, but schoolteachers, moms, and successful financial planners. Nor is it limited to just rural areas. A sampling of freeze-dried foods sold by Wise. Wise "Frederick Reddie," a 41-year-old "urban prepper" from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is stocking up on staples like rice and peanut butter and working on expanding his 6-month supply of emergency food to two years. He has to use a pseudonym to protect his supply from any future hungry neighbors, he told NBC News. Reddie predicts a Trump win that has the urban poor revolting across the nation and the imposition of martial law to quell riots and the burning of businesses. But he's also getting ready for the possibility of a Clinton victory that he says could lead to conflict with Russia and "World War 3 in 2017." Either way, Freddy's ready - with both supplies and a word of advice. "At minimum stock up your cabinets as if you knew a hurricane was coming," he said. "It'll be like a hurricane that could touch every city in America." The companies take pains to point out that they sell food not just for the collapse of civilization but also for camping, outdoor recreation, and natural disaster preparedness, like Ebola or volcanoes. Their customers are careful, self-sufficient and pragmatic types, they say, students of history who know things like stock market bubbles and crashes go in cycles and are taking small, meaningful steps, to reassert control over a toxic election. They're always thinking ahead. Cans of food that last 25 years are "better than money in the bank," said Nelson. "If you think the value of money is going to go down, then you could convert dollars into something tangible that you can use later" for either eating or barter. Bansemer said that his customers don't necessarily fear a specific election outcome, but change itself. "You hear them saying, no matter who wins, I know I could take a positive step myself and secure what's important," he said. "They're securing their food supply."

The OSU Throwing Back A Century By Phil Hecken, on November 5th, 2016 Click to enlarge By Phil Hecken While we’ve known about this throwback since this past summer, earlier this week The Ohio State University unveiled their 1916/17 fauxback uniform which they will we wearing today against Nebraska. As you can see from the splash, OSU quarterback J.T. Barrett had some fun mimicking the pose struck by Chic Harley (who was actually listed as a half back, but the rules and strategy back then were much different than today’s game), the star of that 1916 team. Besides the obvious 100th year anniversary, there is another reason the team is throwing back (fauxing back, really) — that season, the Buckeyes went undefeated, and claimed their first conference title. Photos from back then are scarce, but we do have the photo of Harley and this graphic as a visual reference point for the unis the Buckeyes will roll out today (you can click any enlarges below to enlarge): As you can see, the jersey had the friction strips common in the day, and those were gray, with the base of the jersey being scarlet. The sleeves, almost a vestigial element on today’s jerseys, were full length. The pants appear to be tan, which would be typical of the canvas pants of the day. So, basing the uniform on this, clearly the best OSU can do is a fauxback. The pants that will be worn today will be gray and not tan — so points off for historical accuracy, but the gray pants will look much better, thus pleasing my OCD. So, let’s take a look at the uni: For all intents and purposes, it’s a decent facsimile of the original. Given the constraints of modern uniform design, there’s not much more the team could do to make it look any better (obviously they’re not going to wear long sleeves — though it would be cool if players who go with undershirts have ones with faux friction strips), and I’m glad the team didn’t go with the tan pants look. It’s just not aesthetically pleasing (when accurate) and it looks downright stupid when historically incorrect. As far as the mimicking of the strips — it’s hard to pull off, even when teams have the best of intentions. The full uniform will have some cool red socks with gray stripes: You’ll note the helmet is solid gray — but it’s not perfectly smooth. The team has added a rough texture to it (not sure why — if players wore helmets back then, they were leather and while likely rough, I don’t quite get the decision): I wasn’t a fan of that when the Washington Huskies did it, and not a fan of this. Overall, I like the uni and I’m looking forward to seeing it in action. If you want to see some really high-resolution images, and be subjected to Nike’s marketing-speak, feel free to click here . . . . . Speaking of Nike, this is another one-off the team will wear — they’ve been given a “special” uniform every year since 2009 (and two for their playoff run two years ago), and of all those, I think this is one of their better efforts. Here’s what they wore from 2009 through 2015 2009: The first year of the “Pro Combat” series — this one was actually worn on the road for THE game against UM. It featured a white helmet and the uni number on the side. These were supposedly based on the 1954 unis. 2010: These were probably my favorite of all the alternate unis — these were 1942 throwbacks, featuring a wonderful font (which is similar to the font that UCLA sported a couple seasons ago. Blank scarlet helmet over scarlet jersey and gray pants. 2011: These were supposedly based on the 1961 unis, and I’m not really a big fan. I based a column on them back in 2011. They wore those against Wisconsin — the first time they’d broken out an alt against any team but UM. 2012: These were technically not throwbacks (although they did evoke a sense of unis from years past), but rather a “modern” take on the uniform, as envisioned by Nike. These had giant helmet strips (which nicely matched the stripes on the sleeve caps), and also had a chrome helmet stripe and black cage. I was not a huge fan of these. 2013: Like the year before, this was another ‘modern’ take on the OSUni. They wore the same helmet as the year before, and featured a similar sleeve cap as the year before. Instead of gray britches, though, the team wore a white set. These looked clean, but they didn’t necessarily look like OSU. 2014: For the first year of the playoffs, conveniently for Nike, all four teams wore their uniforms and they created new uniforms for all four teams (OSU, Oregon, Alabama and Florida State). OSU and UO met in the National Championship game, and although Oregon was the higher seed (and could have worn a “dark” uniform), somehow Nike, er…the teams decided Oregon would wear white/gray and OSU got to wear scarlet. The unis were 1968-inspired unis. 2015: Black for Blacks Sake. Enough said. . . . . . Well there you have it. From the photos, I kinda like the 2016 one hundred year anniversary fauxback. Or is it really a throwback to Jimmer Vilk’s 2016 Hallowe’en costume? Nah, let’s go with Chic Harley’s 1916 squad. I’ll need to see how it looks on the field to render a final decision, but so far, so good. What say you guys? MLB Playoff Uni Tracking A few years back, reader Alex Rocklein tracked the MLB Playoffs by uniform — you guys may recall this. Here’s what his 2010 Uni Tracking looked like. After a few weeks of MLB playoffs, including the World Series, we’re now at our final graphics package. Alex has a few quick notes: * 9 uniforms went 0-1 and only one had a perfect record (Indians 1-0 in home threads). * AL wore alternate solid color jerseys for 25 games whereas the NL (or, the Cubs) wore them in 5 games. + + + + + + + + + + World Series + + + + + + + + + + Record By Uniform + + + + + + + + + + Full Playoffs Thanks, Alex.

Grab Bag: Couple odds & sods from Leo Strawn, Jr.: ” Just a reminder…I (sort of) predicted the Cubs WS win on UW on October 2 in this ticker item: The AFL Grand Final (Aussie rules football’s Super Bowl) was played Thursday night and it was a beautiful colour-on-colour match, with Western Bulldogs in blue and Sydney Swans in red. Cubs fans take note: The Dogs pulled away in the last few minutes of a close game to break a 62-year premiership (championship) drought in their first Grand Final appearance since 1961.” (Emphasis Leo’s). Also from Leo, “Australian rules football club North Melbourne Kangaroos recently issued a rather menacing teaser regarding their new logo. (That release date is in Australian; it says Nov. 4, not April 11.) The official logo did not disappoint. Much better than what they had been using, IMHO.” … “I was in PHX and I saw this 70s ‘throwback airplane from United,” writes JohnMark Fisher. “According to this article it’s been this way since 2011. I think it looks great and its name, ‘Friend Ship’ is rather clever. I’m also quite certain that they only made one of these based on the fact that the ID is still the same (N475UA – kind of hard to tell from the pictures).” And that’s all for today. Sorry there isn’t more, but until this election is over, I’m running on fumes. I’m actually working a portion of today, and won’t be on the boards much. Please play nicely. Thanks to Alex for the final MLB Uni Playoff Tracker. I’ll catch you guys tomorrow with the SMUW crew. Until then, follow me on Twitter @PhilHecken. Cheers.

Phil Hecken | November 5, 2016 at 10:26 am | Actually I meant gray, but yes. Now fixed. arrScott | November 5, 2016 at 9:26 am | The Orioles are celebrating the 25th anniversary of Camden Yards next year. Their 25th season in OPACY was this year. Mangler | November 5, 2016 at 9:29 am | Previously, according to Twitter, the New Orleans Zephyrs were set to become the Po’ Boys. https://twitter.com/... This article shows the candidates in consideration for the new nickname: http://ballparkdiges... The Jeff | November 5, 2016 at 9:29 am | I’m curious about the Stabler thing… I’m sure other deceased players have made it into the Hall, did any of them get rings or jackets? Are they being assholes, or is this just the normal way it goes? RobYaz | November 5, 2016 at 9:49 am | This article is more informative: http://deadspin.com/... “Update (5:20 p.m.): A Hall of Fame spokesman sent a long statement, mostly filled with background, that did include near the end their reason for not giving the Stabler family a ring and jacket. Emphasis added is mine. Additionally, every living Hall of Fame member receives a Hall of Fame Gold Jacket and a Hall of Fame Ring of Excellence to wear as symbols of his personal Hall of Fame achievement. The Hall of Fame has never presented either of these two personal items posthumously. The Hall of Fame does present to the family of a posthumously elected Hall of Famer, the Gold Hall of Fame Crest that is featured on the Hall of Fame Gold Jacket. This is done during Enshrinement Week at the Hall of Fame Gold Jacket Dinner when the other Class members are presented their Gold Jackets.” The Jeff | November 5, 2016 at 10:48 am | So… business as usual and no outrage required. Alrighty then. arrScott | November 5, 2016 at 9:35 am | Well at least the Zephyrs aren’t becoming the Nite Owls. Still, after Jacksonville, it’s been a terrible week for classic minor league team names. At this rate, the Durham Bulls will rename themselves the Stogie Butts by the end of the month. Mangler | November 5, 2016 at 10:32 am | We don’t know that yet. My impression is that the team will highlight each of the nickname choices on Twitter until the winning entry is announced on the 15th. DenverGregg | November 5, 2016 at 11:21 am | Zephyrs was a 1983 rebrand of the Denver Bears, so it ain’t all that “classic”. They can do some cute stuff with NONOs and there’s still hope for a whimsical, as opposed to ferocious, logo. The Jeff | November 5, 2016 at 11:59 am | 1983 was over 30 years ago, so yeah, it’s classic now. Ronnie Poore | November 5, 2016 at 9:42 am | South Carolina going with Garnet jerseys, black helmet & pants vs Missouri. This is a new combination for the Gamecocks: https://twitter.com/... JB | November 5, 2016 at 10:02 am | Northwestern graphite “HB #2” uniforms represent students’ standardized test prowess. Neeko | November 5, 2016 at 10:08 am | Ohio State was considered the home team for the national championship game v Oregon Phil Hecken | November 5, 2016 at 10:34 am | Doing this from (very very frazzled these days) memory, so I won’t argue what’s now a moot point, but I’m pretty sure the only way they would have been considered the “home” team was for some funny business to have taken place. They were the #4 seed and considered the “road” team (and wore white jerseys) against #1 Alabama, who they beat. Oregon was the #2 seed and defeated FSU (#3). Unless some “reseeding” took place, a #2 vs. a #4 would mean the #2 seed should, for all intents and purposes, be the the “home” team. But if Oregon (for whom Nike had created a white/gray uni, with the full expectation they’d be playing #1 Alabama) were the higher seed, they’d *normally* wear a dark (black? gray? lightning? green apple?) uni. Probably not wanting to repeat an outfit, they opted (no doubt with Nike’s blessing/encouragement) to wear the white jersey, thereby allowing the new scarlet top for tOSU. It’s a moot point anyway, but I’m about 99.9% positive tOSU wasn’t the “home” team for that game. Neeko | November 5, 2016 at 10:56 am | Look up the box score Phil Hecken | November 5, 2016 at 11:29 am | I just did. Where does it say OSU was the designated home team? It’s a neutral site game and OSU is the lower seed. Not sure how you can say they were designated the “home” team. But either way, it’s a moot point. They wore scarlet. But that wasn’t decided until after the first two playoff games were played, and I remember (this, vividly) how Nike got Oregon to decide to go with the white uni they were expecting the team to wear against Alabama (but because OSU upset ‘bama, there was talk UO would wear a new dark uni, or come up with a new combo). All of a sudden, UO went with their pre-planned white/gray combo allowing THE to wear scarlet. Neeko | November 5, 2016 at 11:39 am | There’s always a designated home team. In football, the designated away team calls the coin toss. In that particular game, Oregon called the toss. Also, in American sports, the home team is listed second in a boxscore. Phil Hecken | November 5, 2016 at 11:47 am | In American sports, the higher seed is the “designated” home team. Whatever, I’m done arguing with you. If you say they were the “home” team, then they were the home team. But by all rights UO would/should have been. The only reason they were designated the “home” team (if indeed they were) was because of the costumes Nike created. The Jeff | November 5, 2016 at 12:03 pm | So… WHY were OSU the home team? College football doesn’t have anything equivalent to the NFL in terms of alternating conference advantages or anything, so… for what reason was the #4 seed given “home” status over the #2 seed? Were they re-seeded after beating Alabama? Did the teams just agree to it? What’s the deal, yo? Neeko | November 5, 2016 at 12:42 pm | It might have something to do with the rotation of the six bowls – just a guess Jon Rose | November 5, 2016 at 10:19 am | That Camden Yards patch is the worst patch since the Domino’s Citi Field patch. Because if there’s one feature that’s totally unique to CY, it’s bricks, apparently. Brent | November 5, 2016 at 10:37 am | I think it’s funny that the Washington State helmets are called “liquid steel”.(Eye roll) Actual liquid steel would be bright orange or yellow. More like room temperature steel. But go Cougars! The Jeff | November 5, 2016 at 10:54 am | Mercury. Eric Burtis | November 6, 2016 at 9:01 am | What bothers me is that they called it their “weapon of choice” ChefCap'nDad | November 5, 2016 at 11:22 am | OK, what’s this whole thing about spelling Halloween with an apostrophe? It’s annoying as hell Joe from Eagle Mills | November 5, 2016 at 12:05 pm | Hallowe’en is a contraction of [All] Hallow[s] Eve[ning]. (Kind of like Cap’n is a contraction of Captain…) Wade Heidt | November 5, 2016 at 12:56 pm | Lakers should consider bringing back the 1980s throwback as their regular uniform. Though they are not much different than their present unis, overall the different details of the 1980s uniform look better and it is a classic. Wheels | November 5, 2016 at 8:04 pm | Absolutely. It was a shame when they switched to the current wishbone-collared set in 1999. LarryB | November 5, 2016 at 1:14 pm | Phil, Nice job today on the Ohio State 1916 uni/alts. Much of what you said I agree with. I prefer throwbacks over alts. These I do like because Chic was so important to Buckeye history. I was hoping they would be more accurate but that would include tan pants and brown helmet. As you said it would not have looked as good though. I am still not 100% sure the friction strips were gray. At first I thought so then I went with brown and recently thinking gray. But who knows. You make good points about the fauxbacks they have worn over the years. My favorite was the 1942 ones. They were closest to original.Plus I love that font style. Disappointed in the 1954 effort. Not even close to being accurate. The 1961 version was not accurate but tired somewhat. I kind of liked the look because of the color combo of scarlet and gray. I was against the black unis since that is so overdone. But admit they looked good. Maybe some day OSU can do all grays. The wide stripe alt look I dont care for and glad they have not worn those recently. Keep up the good work. Michael Emody | November 5, 2016 at 1:33 pm | I suppose the big question for the Cubs is if they’ll be sporting gold embellished uniforms at the beginning of the 2017 season. NIX | November 5, 2016 at 2:47 pm | The helmet texture is inspired by cannon balls. Which comes from the “Music and Cannon Fire” quote that is found on the back neck label. A special game woven label bearing the inscription “music and cannon fire” on the inside collar is pays homage to Harley’s running style, “a cross between music and cannon fire, and it brought your heart up under your ears.” Pedro N | November 5, 2016 at 6:58 pm | I feel like the style of Harbaugh’s khakis has changed. Didn’t he used use to qear pleats? Johnny | November 5, 2016 at 7:50 pm | If a pitcher for the New Orleans Night Owls throws a no-hitter, it would be a… NO NO no-no …and, I’ll leave now RickAZ | November 5, 2016 at 8:05 pm | Ohio State has one of the best looking uniforms in CFB, and should forget all these lame looking alternate or retro uniforms. Most of the retro uniforms that college or NFL use that go back to the leather helmet days just don’t work.

The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation’s second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles G. and David H. Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need,” Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. “With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital,” said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line ‘Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC’, Emily Keech, the committee’s executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. “I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights,” Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. “I don’t want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries,” Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. “It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way,” said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. “And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive.” Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million (Dh3.02 billion. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. “The key to any ballot measure is the right language,” Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Wal-Mart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Virginia. “In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language.” The Republican organisation that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, “The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion,” and then discussed “the importance of ballot initiatives” as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation’s largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organisation, behind the US Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. filed underNewsAmericasUSAUS Elections 2016 Follow us Most Popular ViewedVideosGalleries 01Trump likely to end aid for Syrian rebels 02US Muslim targets Democrat leadership 03Clinton blames FBI director for poll loss 04Trump and Putin to try to mend US-Russia ties 05Trump becomes 45th US President Play Dubai Canal opens with fireworks Nov 09, 2016 Play US expatriates in Dubai on Trump's victory Nov 09, 2016 Play Prince Charles tours Humanitarian City in Dubai Nov 08, 2016 Play Watch: Stunning drone footage of Dubai Canal Nov 03, 2016 24Images Supermoon rises over UAE skyline Nov 14, 2016 19Images Aftershocks rattle New Zealand after big quake Nov 14, 2016 1Image Pakistan, China launch new trade route Nov 14, 2016 22Images Inside the Trump Tower in New York Nov 15, 2016 Newsmakers USA donald trumphillary clintonbill clintonmichelle obamajoe bidenangela merkelbashar al assadkaty perrylady gagabenjamin netanyahutheresa mayabdul fattah al sissijennifer lopezmiley cyrus USA: Weather today today-weatherNew YorkLos Angeles Miami weather-volume Celcius Fahrenheit Country in Focus United States Capital:Washington D.C.

But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. Bloomberg photo by Michael Nagle.   Hugh Son Bloomberg     For almost five years, Gregory Furlong worked 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a Best Buy two miles from his childhood home in Wilmington, Delaware. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So last year, Furlong, 30, enrolled in a three-month coding boot camp that uses HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. This is Wall Street's new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools and people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. And besides, banks need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can't possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is looking in places it never did, turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree -- art majors, graphic designers and chemistry graduates from the University of Delaware like Furlong -- can still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and competitors with names like Codility claim they've essentially increased the world's supply of developers. "This is purely about skill," said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. "Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts." The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. Those methods have been known to perpetuate biases and aren't always predictive of on-the-job success. Goldman Sachs said in June it was overhauling the way it hires junior staff, using resume-screening software and replacing campus interviews with video submissions that are scored. "Finding people through alternate channels, we weren't doing that five years ago," said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan's global technology division. "Now we absolutely do it, because we've seen it work." There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent of them have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart. HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients, as is Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. Finance firms aren't the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. "The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job," said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. "There's a lot left to luck." Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can't show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they've been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers' code. In 2012, they were accepted into Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. For Furlong, who bears a resemblance to Elijah Wood from the "Lord of the Rings" movies, his new life couldn't be more different from his Best Buy days. He's more fulfilled, he says, and he's paid off student loans with pay that's double his previous earnings. He's also replaced a 2003 Volvo with a new Subaru Impreza, which he drives to JPMorgan's year-old Wilmington tech hub, a 335,000-square-foot complex filled with 2,000 developers. "Things have changed so much," Furlong said. "There's much more opportunity for people to break through and change their lives." --- Bloomberg's Dakin Campbell contributed.

Courtesy of KPD Robbery suspect captured Walter Mills Contributed photo: Kauai Police Department First Hawaiian Bank Surveillance First Hawaiian Bank Surveillance Posted: Saturday, November 5, 2016 2:00 am Robbery suspect captured Jenna Carpenter - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 11 comments LIHUE — A man who police say robbed a bank and a pharmacy, stole a truck and hijacked two vehicles and was arrested Friday following an eight-hour manhunt. Walter Mills was found near Kokee Lodge about 4 p.m. after bystanders reported seeing a male subject matching his description sitting in a parked vehicle in that location, according to a release from the Kauai Police Department. He was taken into custody without incident. Police say Mills escaped from Kauai Community Correctional Center Thursday night before robbing a First Hawaiian Bank in Lihue Friday morning about 8:30. Then, about 9:50 a.m., officers responded to the Kmart at Kukui Grove Shopping Center after a man reported that someone matching Mills’ description brandished a weapon then stole his Ford pickup truck. A short time later, Mills, 43, was reported to have left the pickup near Sudz Car Wash on Pahee Street in Lihue, and fled the area on foot. Police believe Mills then entered a county paratransit bus, brandished a weapon, and instructed the male bus driver to take him to Koloa Road. There were no passengers on the bus. About 10:20 a.m., police were notified that Lifeway Pharmacy in Koloa was robbed by a male subject matching Mills’ description. According to a preliminary investigation, the suspect then carjacked two additional cars and was eventually dropped off at Kalawai Park in Kalaheo, where he fled the vehicle on foot shortly after 11 a.m. About 30 police officers and Air 1 joined in the search for Mills, who was believed to be armed. Police warned motorists to lock their doors and people were urged to call 911 if they saw the suspect. Kauai Community College and several schools in the area were locked down. Mills is expected to be charged on multiple offenses relating to escape, robbery, kidnapping and unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle. In 2015, Mills was arrested on theft charges, stemming from two separate incidents. On Aug. 9, Mills was accused of stealing a laptop from Walmart. Then, on Sept. 19, police say he robbed Kapaa Pharmacy, wearing a Halloween mask and was armed with a Colt semiautomatic BB gun. According to court records, Mills demanded Oxycontin, oxycodone, morphine and methadone — in total about 1,900 pills. Mills was arrested four days later after a minor car wreck. After obtaining a search warrant, Kauai police officers found a Colt BB gun, a plastic mask and several Oxycontin pills. Mills was sentenced in July to about six years in federal prison for the robbery, three years of supervised release with conditions including drug testing. He was sentenced to five years in prison in September stemming from the Walmart incident. He will serve sentences concurrently. How Mills escaped from KCCC remains under investigation, said Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii Department of Safety. © 2016 Thegardenisland.com. All rights reserved.

Posts: 143 So, the question on everybody's mind of course is, How did he get from Kalaheo all the way up to Kokee state park, with not a single cop noticing? If it hadn't been for the akamai locals up Kokee, the cops would have continued their futile search in Kalaheo. Why were there no roadblocks or at least a couple of cops stationed at the Hanapepe and Waimea bridges slowing traffic down and monitoring drivers going into town?!! The guy carjacked how many vehicles already, they didn't think he would try it again? It was all a wild goose chase!! It's like he wanted to get caught again, why else go up the mountain and then get high and pass out, all while the cops are looking for you somewhere else... Hmmm. Seems almost orchestrated. Link   My Two Sense posted at 3:10 pm on Sat, Nov 5, 2016. Posts: 8 Kudos to the KPD for apprehending the suspect!! And Bravo to KONG radio for their excellent, ongoing coverage and to the citizens in Kokee who spotted the suspect and took action. But where were the county alerts to the citizens. We had an escaped convict as of Thursday night and not one alert to island residents?? I get calls for every flashflood "watch" but nothing for an escaped convict?? And nothing on Friday when it was known he was armed and in the Koloa/Kalaheo area. I was home alone and saw the helicopters circling when my neighbor called to alert me She learned because of the lockdown at Island School. Neighbors called and checked on neighbors and spread the word. But why did the county fail to alert its citizens when they have the technology is in place. Did any type of warning go out to banks? Businesses? Why wasn't his picture distributed to all businesses as soon as the escape was confirmed. He could have potentially been identified when buying the gun at Kmart. Instead, he continued to terrorize people at gunpoint. Thank God no one was physically harmed. We should be able to count on county for emergency alerts; instead, we had to rely on the coconut wireless. Breathing easy (finally) in Kalaheo. Link   Talon-3 posted at 2:37 pm on Sat, Nov 5, 2016.

So by committing an additional crime, he got to avoid federal prison. That's nuts. Unfortunately that's a pattern- judge Watanabe allows criminals to get off with very little punishment, and as a result we have this guy escaping and causing havoc on our island.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Oct 3rd 2016 2:50PM Seven major retailers are at high risk of going bankrupt within the next two years, according to a Fitch Ratings report. The at-risk companies include: Sears Holdings, Claire's Stores, True Religion Apparel, Nine West Holdings, Rue21, 99 Cents Only Stores, and Nebraska Book Company. If and when the companies named default, it's likely that they will be liquidated, the 114-page report said. Retailers are almost three times as likely to be liquidated after filing for bankruptcy than companies in other industries, according to the study For the report, Fitch Ratings analyzed 30 retail bankruptcies — half of which ended in liquidation.

Chicago - Nov. 15, 2016   Beachwood Politics Our monthly archive. Who We Are Chicago by the numbers. Sausage Links Wiki Daley Wiki Rahm Illinois Channel CAN TV Ralph Martire Doonesbury Government Attic Division Street Indie Political Report The Obameter ProPublica The Intercept SCOTUS Blog American Dream Betrayed U.S. Manufacturing Economy Fails Employers And Workers By Timothy Aeppel/Reuters BREMEN, Indiana - James L. Brown tried to hire a dozen workers for his metal foundry here. Half of them flunked the drug test. Those results are typical, says the president of Bremen Castings, a family-owned employer of 350 workers who make parts for trucks and other equipment. Drug problems are one factor contributing to a labor shortage that delayed filling orders earlier this year. "We've become a recruiting company," Brown said of the relentless struggle to maintain a strong workforce. Bremen Castings illustrates the central tension in U.S. manufacturing: Plant managers complain of a talent shortage, while workers see too few acceptable jobs. The paradox has echoed through the presidential campaign, with both major candidates lamenting the loss of factory jobs - even as unemployment in most industrial regions has dropped to rates usually considered healthy. The jobless rate in the county surrounding the Bremen plant, for instance, is less than 4 percent, according to state data. The national rate is 5 percent. Such statistics, however, obscure the struggles of manufacturers and workers, particularly in the Midwest. Factories in the countryside are distant from pools of unemployed workers in cities. Drug tests are disqualifying more applicants. Low wages discourage others from taking jobs that are available, and employers say tougher immigration enforcement makes it difficult to fill many low-wage jobs. Martin Rangel, a worker at Bremen Castings, pours molten metal into forms on the foundry's production line in Bremen, Indiana. REUTERS/Tim Aeppel The problem boils down to a quality issue on both sides: Employers gripe about workers with little work ethic, while employees decry falling pay for the kind of jobs that once fed families. The logical response to a labor shortage is to raise pay enough to attract a quality staff, but many manufacturers say they can't afford it in an era of rising global competition. Bremen Casting in August raised its starting wage to $14 per hour from $13 - after raising it from 11.50 earlier this year. The company pays up to $27.50 for its top hourly workers. Brown said he's nearing the limit of what he can pay because of pricing pressure from his customers. The upshot is that most factory jobs, in the view of many blue-collar Americans, have been redefined as lower-level work. The average wage on factory floors fell below the average for all U.S. workers in 2006 and now sits at $20.57 per hour. Many make much less. A third of factory floor workers collect some form of public assistance, such as food stamps, according to a study this year by the University of California-Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education. Among temporary manufacturing workers, the portion qualifying for government help jumps to 50 percent - on par with families of fast food workers. Between 2009 and 2013, state and federal governments spent $10.2 billion on assistance for factory workers. Many employers are getting what they pay for, said Ken Jacobs, a co-author of the study. "You can't both complain about a skills shortage and offer compensation that's too low to attract workers," he said. SHUTTERED UNION FACTORIES Since the recession ended in 2009, more U.S. workers are choosing unemployment over the jobs available to them. Among men between 25 and 54 years old, the share of those neither working nor looking for work - 12 percent - has doubled since the 1970s. The rate jumps to 17 percent for men without college degrees, who would be likely candidates for factory jobs. In Manitowoc, Wisconsin, Steven Schenian recently sat across from his human resources manager, Amanda AnSorge, puzzling over recruiting. Schenian owns four small companies in this town overlooking Lake Michigan, including IMF Solutions, a furniture factory. They thought they might get a windfall because The Manitowoc Company - a crane maker and once the town's largest private employer - is shutting its local factory. So is another company, a foundry in nearby Brillion, Wisconsin. But there's been no surge of applicants at Schenian's furniture factory, where the average worker makes about $15 an hour, compared to pay of up to $28 at the unionized factories that are closing, Schenian said. "Our industry just doesn't allow that kind of wages," Schenian said. Workers with specialized skills, such as welding, have seen wages perk up a bit amid the tight labor market. Power Curbers, an equipment maker in Salisbury, North Carolina, pays experienced welders "well over $20 an hour," says CEO Dyke Messinger. With little heavy industry in the area, he tends to have his pick of workers. But he's also noticed more turnover lately. "There are guys with higher skills seeing their talents bid up," he says. "But that does nothing for the guy with average skill." 'HYGIENE ISSUES' Some experts believe the erosion of pay and opportunity in factories has helped create a generation of workers more prone to problems that make them less employable. Many hiring managers say applicants lack a solid work ethic, reflected in what they call "hygiene issues" - chronic tardiness, job-hopping and refusal to work overtime. They also report more drug problems. A manufacturer down the street from Bremen Casting, who didn't want to be named, uses a hair analysis test to catch drug use. The company recently fired one employee after the man shaved every hair on his body before showing up for testing. More permissive social attitudes about drugs, along with marijuana legalization in some states, are complicating the issue for manufacturers, who need drug-free workers to handle dangerous equipment and chemicals. The share of U.S. workers who fail drug tests has hit its highest level in a decade, 4 percent, according to a recent study by Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation's largest testing labs. That's only those who were caught - such tests are better at identifying some drugs than others, and an entire industry has sprung up offering ways to beat them. Some applicants just don't show up after they find out they have to take a drug test, manufacturing employers said. Failure rates trended downward in previous decades, according to Quest's records. The study found use of illicit drugs - from marijuana to heroin to methamphetamines - grew both among the general workforce as well as those in "safety sensitive" jobs like pilots and railroad engineers. In some regions, the surge of opiate addiction has tainted the labor pool. Back in Bremen, Brown says the drug problem has come in waves. First there was marijuana, then cocaine. Now it includes prescription drugs such as Vicodin and OxyContin. And a wider array of workers is failing the tests, he says, including older, white-collar workers applying for accounting and sales jobs. "We used to look at weed and say, 'I hope they're not smoking,'" Brown said. "Now, we hope that's all it is." Beyond drug issues, business leaders have a bleak view of the traditional blue-collar labor pool, according to a steady stream of reports from consulting and industry groups. Accounting firm Deloitte found recently that 84 percent of business executives see a "talent shortage" in U.S. factories. The study was conducted in partnership with the Manufacturing Institute, an employer group. Some labor advocates see a shortage of money instead. Workers accused of lacking performance, ambition or loyalty are reacting predictably to a lack of pay and opportunity, said Catherine Ruckelshaus, program director at the National Employment Law Project. She cited recent raises by Walmart as an example of a corporation recognizing the importance of worker morale and retention. "There's not really a 'skills shortage,'" she said. DITCHING WORK Bremen is a factory town, with a population of about 4,800 and about 2,000 factory jobs, estimated Trend Weldy, Bremen's town manager and Chamber of Commerce president. 👀 Many workers are drawn from the surrounding regions, including some who commute from distant farms and towns in Michigan. Yet recruiting remains a daily struggle for Brown and Bremen Casting. Among his competitors are two big operations in town that paint recreational vehicles, operations that are humming amid strong demand from baby-boomer retirees. Even some longtime workers at Bremen Casting can pose problems, including absenteeism, said Sharon Calahan, the company's director of human resources. Her all-time favorite excuse for ditching work came a few months ago, when a worker told her, "My girlfriend's husband just died - and she's distraught." The company has stopped strictly enforcing its attendance policy. "If we held to it, we wouldn't have those employees," says Stan Hueni, the company's employee relations manager. One problem is that the company has cut itself off from a big source of local labor: Those in the U.S. illegally. As recently as a decade ago, nearly half the workforce of Bremen Castings was Hispanic. But after the company implemented E-Verify - a U.S. government program that identifies workers with legal status - the share of Hispanic workers has gradually declined. Brown made the change after some other companies in his area were hit with government immigration raids. Today, Bremen's workforce is only about 15 percent Hispanic. Brown believes there are plenty of other potential workers on the fringes of the job market, but some aren't particularly motivated. The company recently interviewed a 21-year-old man who had graduated from high school but never attended college or held a job. Brown decided not to give him his first one. A tactic he may try is bringing in workers from local Amish communities in hired vans. That's worked well for some local employers, but Brown has his doubts. Foundry work involves pouring molten metal, and many Amish seem more familiar with other types of wood and metal-working trades. AVOIDING OVERTIME Among Brown's more dependable employees is Steve Humfleet, who started eight years ago on the graveyard shift and moved to day work three years ago. But the 43-year-old has little interest in overtime hours, for the same reason he wanted off the night shift: More time with his wife, Natalie, also 43, and two daughters, Shauna, 21, and Diana, 12. In the past, Brown said, workers would compete for those extra hours, which pay 50 percent more. He thinks this may in part be an impact of the recession, when many younger workers, in particular, appeared to learn how to get by with much less. Humfleet doesn't dispute that assessment. To him, time is more important than money. When not with family, he prefers to spend that time hunting or target-shooting. He tries to keep grocery bills low and routinely tells his two daughters that the family can't buy all the things they want. He and his wife, Natalie - who also works in a local factory - have chosen to build their lives, he said, "on 40-hour paychecks." - Comments welcome.

Robbery suspect now in police custody The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 1 comment LIHUE — A man who police say robbed a bank, stole a truck, hopped a bus and robbed a pharmacy was arrested Friday afternoon, following an eight-hour manhunt. Walter Mills was found near Kokee Lodge after bystanders reported seeing a male subject matching his description sitting in a parked vehicle in that location, according to a release from the Kauai Police Department. He was taken into custody without incident. Police say Mills escaped from Kauai Community Correctional Center Thursday night before robbing a First Hawaiian Bank Friday morning at around 8:30 a.m. Then, at around 9:50 a.m., officers responded to the Kmart at Kukui Grove Shopping Center after a man reported that someone matching Mills’ description brandished a weapon then stole his Ford pickup truck from the parking lot. A short time later, Mills, 43, was reported to have left the pickup near Sudz Car Wash on Pahee Street in Lihue, and fled the area on foot. Police believe Mills then entered a county paratransit bus, brandished a weapon, and then instructed the male bus driver to take him to Koloa Road. There were no passengers on the bus at the time. At approximately 10:20 a.m., police were then notified that Lifeway Pharmacy, in Koloa, was robbed by a male subject matching Mills’ description. According to a preliminary investigation, the suspect then carjacked two additional cars and was eventually dropped off at Kalawai Park in Kalaheo, where he fled the vehicle on foot shortly after 11 a.m. About 30 police officers and Air 1 joined in the search for Mills. Mills is expected to be charged on multiple offenses relating to escape, robbery, kidnapping and unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle. In 2015, Mills was arrested on theft charges, stemming from two separate incidents. On Aug. 9, 2015, Mills is accused of stealing a laptop from Walmart. Then, on Sept. 19, police say he robbed Kapaa Pharmacy, wearing a Halloween mask armed with a Colt semiautomatic BB gun. According to court records, Mills demanded Oxycontin, oxycodone, morphine and methadone — in total about 1,900 pills. Mills was arrested four days later after a minor car wreck. After obtaining a search warrant, officers with the Kauai Police Department found a a Colt BB gun, a plastic mask and several Oxycontin pills. Mills was sentenced in July to about six years in federal prison for the robbery, three years of supervised release with conditions including drug testing. He was sentenced to five years in prison in September, stemming from the Walmart incident. He will serve sentences concurrently. How Mills escaped KCCC continues to be under investigation, said Toni Schwartz, spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Safety. © 2016 Thegardenisland.com. All rights reserved.

This is a career felon with drug, theft and weapon offenses who somehow escaped prison. He robbed a bank and another business, highjacked public transportation, and jacked two or more vehicles in one day. This doesn't happen on Kauai. Schools between Lihue and Waimea were on lockdown to keep kids safe. Don't ask why law abiding residents "need" guns. If this guy has been allowed to operate for at least ten years (and many others like him as seen in Garden Island), and keep getting back to the community, the legal system is not doing its job and people need to look out for their own safety.

The shareholder, among the company’s 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company’s direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited as some key issues Whole Foods’ poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers. Several activist investors, who asked not to be identified, said they are aware of the shareholder’s suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It’s unclear if any has begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas-based company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. “Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders,” Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in an email Friday. “We are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.” The company said Wednesday it will end its long-standing practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger and Walmart Stores, continue to advance on Whole Foods’ organic turf, which is a drag on Whole Foods’ sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Walmart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Tags Whole Foods Market Inc.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Top state elections officials drawing big money print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Top state elections officials drawing big money By Eric Lipton and Robert Faturechi / New York Times News Service Published Nov 5, 2016 at 12:02AM Voter suppression in Oregon? — The official in charge of elections in Oregon said Friday that many voters across the state are receiving automated calls falsely telling them that they’re not registered to vote and that their ballot will not be counted, and she called for an investigation of the “voter suppression.” “We have heard very specific information from a number of counties … all over the state,” Secretary of State Jeanne Atkins said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. She mentioned Crook County, but the clerk there said her office has not received calls from worried voters, but Coos County and Tillamook County had. Some of the calls were automated and others were from real people. “We’ve had calls from voters who have received those calls,” Coos County Clerk Terri Turi said. “It’s been close to 100 within the last two days.” Turi did not hazard a guess on whether it was a concerted effort to affect the outcome of the election. If a person who had not yet sent in a ballot got such a call and believed it, that voter might not bother to send the ballot in. “All I know is it is disturbing our process,” Turi said. In a statement, Atkins assured voters that their ballots will count. “There is simply no circumstance under which an Oregonian who has received a ballot should receive a call challenging their registration status,” Atkins said. “Get your ballot in by 8 p.m. Tuesday, and your vote will be counted.” On the campaign trail — Hillary Clinton dispatched musical and political celebrities across battleground states Friday to try to energize Democrats in what’s become an increasingly competitive race, campaigning with singer Beyonce and her husband, rapper Jay Z, in Cleveland. Donald Trump, meanwhile, defended his go-it-alone approach. “I didn’t have to bring J-Lo or Jay Z,” he told a crowded rally Friday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania. “I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.” — The Associated Press WASHINGTON — Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation’s second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles and David Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need,” Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. “With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital,” said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line “Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC,” Emily Keech, the committee’s executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. “I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights,” Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. “I don’t want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries,” Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. “It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way,” said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. “And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive.” Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. “The key to any ballot measure is the right language,” Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Wal-Mart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Virginia. “In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language.” The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, “The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion,” and then discussed “the importance of ballot initiatives” as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation’s largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. “When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects,” said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, “I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time.” But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum wage ballot initiatives. “As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns,” she said in a statement. Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a “contact list” prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee’s executive director. “I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country,” Keech wrote to Cegavske, referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company’s monopoly over much of the state’s electricity market. Cegavske’s executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. “Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution,” the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April. “What great news!!!!” Keech wrote back. “The Secretaries’ contacts are ALWAYS better than ours.” In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was “categorically false.” Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to Oregon Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Eugene, who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. She was defeated in the primary. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. Bloomberg also donated to Gov. Kate Brown. Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election — published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta — said those groups were prepared to support the effort. “The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives,” the memo said, noting its “pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process.” At the three-day hunt — where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls — there was little discussion of formal election matters. Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. “I was 60 yards away,” Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. “The two that got away,” Kobach said. “We’ll get ’em tomorrow,” said one of the corporate executives. 15524605 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

GAIL WESSON, STAFF Related article » More from this story SLIDE SHOW: Legal challenges slowing planned developments in Banning, Beaumont 4 Photos » Riverside Yellow Pages THINGS TO DO     By GAIL WESSON / STAFF WRITER Published: Nov. 4, 2016 Updated: Nov. 6, 2016 11:11 p.m. SAN GORGONIO PASS PROJECTS A few of the projects that have been approved for the region: Banning Pardee/Butterfield: Up to 4,862 homes, northeast corner Highland Springs Avenue and Wilson Street Diversified Pacific/Rancho San Gorgonio: Up to 3,385 homes south of Westward Avenue between Sunset and San Gorgonio avenues Beaumont Pardee/Sundance: Up to 4,450 homes northwest of Eighth Street and Highland Springs Avenue. Five communities are under construction, with an estimated 1,400 more units planned before buildout. Heartland: Up to 981 homes northwest of the 60 and Potrero Boulevard Fairway Canyon: Located between San Timoteo Canyon Road and I-10, with up to 3,300 homes planned Four Seasons: Up to 1,890 homes, southwest of I-10 and Highland Springs Avenue The Sundance planned community on Beaumont’s eastern edge has one of the few bright spots of building activity in San Gorgonio Pass’ home development front. It likely will be 2018 or later before other big projects start framing in the region. Still trying to rebound from the economic downturn, the area has a number of developments on the books, but legal challenges and other hurdles are slowing construction. In neighboring Banning – where officials said only six residential construction permits have been issued in the past six years – the City Council in September approved the 3,385-home master-planned Rancho San Gorgonio community for the mostly rural south side of I-10. Yet it already is facing obstacles after an environmental group filed a lawsuit challenging the adequacy of environmental review. The Banning City Council will be briefed in a closed-door meeting Monday by the city’s attorney on the suit filed Oct. 27 by the nonprofit SoCal Environmental Justice Alliance. SoCal Environmental’s suit alleges violations of the state’s environmental review laws and notes that “mega development” would increase the city population by one-third. The environmental group is known in the region for filing legal challenges to a massive warehouse development in Moreno Valley and to a Wal-Mart Supercenter construction project in Lake Elsinore. Banning officials are familiar with environmental challenges, having worked through settlement of two cases challenging approval of Pardee’s master-planned Butterfield project of about 4,862 homes across Highland Springs Avenue from Sundance. Lawsuits filed by neighboring Highland Springs Resort and Cherry Valley Pass Acres and Neighbors were settled in 2014, with changes to the project, a reduction from the proposed 5,387 homes, elimination of a golf course and access to some undeveloped acreage from the resort for passive recreation, including hiking. “What we anticipate is starting construction probably sometime in 2018, and we want to start models in the first quarter of 2019,” said Chris Willis, director of project management for Pardee Homes and the Butterfield master plan. Building likely would start first at the southern edge, near Highland Springs Avenue and Wilson Street. In 2017, he expects Pardee will be working on improvement plans, engineering and architecture with the city. Banning city spokesman Philip Southard wrote in an email the city expects Pardee to submit a general land use and specific plan amendments that are part of the settlement agreement in a review process expected to conclude next spring. Across Highland Springs, the Sundance master-planned development started almost 20 years ago. Five communities are in construction with ongoing sales. At the north end, closer to Cherry Valley Boulevard, grading is underway for a 15,000-square-foot community recreation center for an active adult development phase. The long-idled Heartland master plan, which dates to 1993, got a boost last week when the Beaumont City Council gave tentative approval to a development agreement amendment giving more time for the 981-home project. It’s slated for the city’s far west end near the 60 west of Potrero Boulevard.

Great Lakes Foods, a food distribution company located in Menominee, Mich., is a new supplier for the company. First deliveries to stores in Muskegon Township, North Muskegon and Whitehall are expected sometime during the week of Nov. 7, but exact dates and times have not been established, said Jim Nader, Plumb's president. Plumb's supermarkets will close its store on Sherman Boulevard in Norton Shores on Sunday, Nov. 13, Nader said. The company is in negotiations with SpartanNash for distribution at the Newaygo store.  Plumb's plans closure of one grocery store "Our first priority is to get all the products back in the stores and get the stores filled back up for our customers and we'll go from there," Nader said. The partnership with Great Lakes Foods will allow the company to "upscale" its stores with enhanced equipment and decor, he said. "Hopefully this will make an impact in the next week to two weeks so people can see that they're not going out of business," said Tom Kuber, owner of Great Lakes Foods.  This isn't the first time that Great Lakes Foods will take over distribution for a store that was having trouble.   Kuber said he worked with a store in the northern Upper Peninsula that was going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. During a trip to the store before Great Lakes Foods began stocking, he heard one customer say that she had more food in her pantry than the store had on its shelves.  Now, that family-owned store is doing well, he said.  "That's what we hope to be able to do down there with those three stores," Kuber said.  This is the first Lower Peninsula customer for Kuber's company, which normally supplies stores in the Upper Peninsula and northern Wisconsin. The company was founded in 1891 – when deliveries were made with horse and wagon. Kuber purchased it in 2012.  It seems to have been about a month since anything new was put on the shelves at the Plumb's on Colby Street in Whitehall, said long-time customer Jake Lewis, of Whitehall.  Lewis grew up in Whitehall, and has always shopped at Plumb's. He's also a former employee.  "It's really bad," he said on Thursday evening while loading groceries into his SUV. "They don't have half the stuff they had. I have to go to a different store to get butter."  Alternatives in the White Lake area include Save-a-Lot, Dollar General and Montague Foods. A Wal-Mart is under construction about a mile east of Plumb's.  "Prices are jacked up, and they don't have what you need," Lewis said of his recent experiences at Plumb's.  Wendy Waite, of Montague, stopped at Plumb's to pick up a few items on Thursday. She said the shelves were "definitely empty."  She does most of her shopping at Meijer and Wal-Mart, but Plumb's carries certain Spartan-brand meats that her mom likes.  With so many options for grocery shopping, the business has become quite competitive, said Alan Hartline, owner of Kingma's Market in Grand Rapids, and former SpartanNash executive.   Shoppers can choose from clubs like Sam's Club and Cosco; supermarkets such as Plumb's, Leppink's, Family Fare and D&W; supercenters like Wal-Mart and Meijer; dollar stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General; limited assortment stores like Aldi and Save-a-Lot; and specialty retailers like Trader Joe's.  "Everybody is vying for that share of stomach and trying to reinvent themselves," Hartline said. "How you respond to that challenge can determine future success."   Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.
