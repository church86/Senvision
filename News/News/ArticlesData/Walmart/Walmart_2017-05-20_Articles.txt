A high-ranking federal official told the Star his agency has no evidence of “malicious intent” by the eight students. Nevertheless, the purchases reveal what officials say is a potentially troubling vulnerability in federal and Arizona firearms laws, which exempt international students and other nonimmigrant visa holders with hunting licenses from prohibitions on gun ownership. One of the University of Arizona students cited said he was simply intrigued by American gun culture and wanted to have the experience of shooting his own firearm, a common motivation among the cited students, according to the federal official. “It’s totally not possible,” Yifei Gong said of his prospects of ever owning a gun in China, where individual gun ownership is heavily restricted. “You probably won’t have a firearm for your life. That’s why most people want a firearm in China. They can’t buy one; that’s why they want one.” Following advice found online and from fellow international students, Gong went to a Walmart and purchased a resident hunting license in November, according to him and Arizona Game and Fish Department records obtained by the Star. With the license, he said, he went to a gun shop and bought a semi-automatic RAS47, a U.S.-made rifle designed to mimic the Kalashnikov. While self-defense was an element of his desire to purchase a gun, Yifei said it was first and foremost for “fun,” and he took his rifle to local shooting ranges several times. But Gong’s time as an Arizona gun owner was to be short-lived. In the early morning of Dec. 6, a state game and fish officer and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations agents went to Gong’s off-campus Tucson apartment to ask about his license and, ultimately, to seize his firearm, according to a report. Gong was cited by the state officer for fraudulently obtaining a hunting license, a Class 2 misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty and paid a fine. He is facing no other state or federal charges, according to court documents and a federal official. Gong’s experience was not an isolated incident. As of early May, seven other Chinese students at the UA had been similarly cited and had their guns taken, according to court records and Homeland Security Investigations. The citations and seizures are the most recent development in what Scott Brown, the Phoenix HSI special agent in charge, described as a more than yearlong project of the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats, a multiagency group of state and federal agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Despite the ominous sound of the name, Homeland Security Iinvestigations, the lead agency on the matter, does not suspect the eight UA students had any “malicious intent” when they acquired their licenses and guns, Brown said. He did say there are a “very small number” of other cases where there could be such intent, but even with those, Brown clarified, “our concern isn’t necessarily that they themselves pose the direct threat.” “People like to go out in the desert and shoot guns — U.S. citizens and foreign students alike,” he said of what his agency found to be the most common motivation at play. Brown said the cases highlight what he described as a loophole in firearms regulation that “could be exploited by those with malicious intent.” “This is occurring in other states, where there are foreign students, where there are similar state hunting license requirements,” he added. As it stands under federal law, nonimmigrant visa holders, like international students, are generally prohibited from owning guns. However, exemptions are made for those with a valid hunting license or permit, according to the ATF’s website. Arizona law reflects that exemption. To buy a resident Arizona hunting license, applicants must have lived in the state for six months and not claim residency in another state or jurisdiction, according to the Game and Fish Department. One of the requirements of an F-1 student visa is maintaining “a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up,” according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s website. That designation would typically prevent an international student from being able to get a resident hunting license. “The visa paperwork make it very clear that they are not a resident of the United States,” said Gene Elms, law enforcement branch chief with Arizona Game and Fish. “They don’t qualify for a resident license in Arizona.” Nevertheless, Gong said he easily purchased a resident tag at the Walmart on South Houghton Road last November, something Elms said he wasn’t surprised to hear. Other students purchased their resident licenses similarly, though two bought them through AZGFD’s online hunting license portal, according to AZGFD reports. “I went to Walmart and they asked me how long I’ve been here. I’ve been here for at least two years, and they just assumed that I’m a resident of Arizona, and that’s the hunting license they gave me,” Gong said. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed Gong’s purchase. “We have policies and procedures in place to help ensure we comply with applicable laws when issuing hunting licenses,” a statement from the company read. “A customer must provide valid identification at the time of the purchase to confirm residency.” Several local gun shops declined to sell Gong a gun, citing their policy of not selling to international students. However, he said he eventually found one where his hunting license and other documents were enough to buy an RAS47. “I did not know (I was breaking the law) until they seized my firearm. I believe that most of the people who are cited with this charge did not know that,” Gong said. “If there is something wrong with my hunting license, why would they sell it to me?” Nonresident Arizona hunting licenses, while significantly more expensive than resident tags, can be purchased by nonimmigrant visa holders in Arizona. It’s legal for such license holders to buy and own a firearm until the license expires, at which time “they become a prohibited possessor,” said Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Game and Fish Department. No “big hammer” In late 2015, the FBI issued a warning after it received reports of Chinese international students “legally” purchasing guns, according to a Dec. 23 Phoenix ABC 15 story. In one case detailed in the broadcast, a Chinese student was expelled and deported after bringing two AR-15s onto the Arizona State University campus. Brown described that incident as “the most serious” in Arizona involving an armed international student. Then, on Jan. 16, Juang Yue, a 19-year-old Chinese student at ASU, was shot and killed in a road-rage incident, news of which spread quickly in the Chinese student community. In the wake of the tragedy, some Chinese students expressed an interest in buying guns for self-defense, and information on how to acquire them circulated online, as did warnings about the potential dangers of gun ownership. Gong said he was aware of the incident but that it played only a small role in his desire to purchase a gun. It was around the time of the FBI warning and shooting that ASU’s Police Department asked the ATF for assistance with foreign student gun purchases. ATF, in turn, reached out to HSI because of its expertise in immigration-related issues, according to Brown. In late 2016, state game and fish employees also noticed an uptick in students who did not appear to be residents coming to their Tucson office to buy hunting licenses, Elms said. It took time, Brown said, to acquire the records necessary to determine who may have purchased licenses and firearms illegally, as well as what their intent was. The hunting license charges started coming in late 2016, according to court records. But those misdemeanor citations came from the state wildlife agency, not HSI, which could have brought more serious federal firearms charges. “If there’s no malicious intent and we can get the students into compliance, remove the unlawfully obtained firearms ... we don’t need to drop a big hammer,” Brown said about why the state filed the charges. Beyond Gong’s AK-47 lookalike, HSI agents have seized handguns and other rifles from the UA students. “Every person that we’ve talked to, that we’ve seized weapons from, has acknowledged that they were not purchased for the purpose of hunting,” Brown said. “One person did say they were for hunting coyotes. The story was so hideously inaccurate he eventually decided that he didn’t want to stick with that story.” Updates, reform needed There are several efforts underway to make it more difficult for foreign students to improperly purchase guns. While declining to go into details, Brown said the Legislature and Congress may eventually consider legislation that would “close the vulnerabilities.” At the state level, the goal would be to reach “a standardized definition of residency in alignment with the federal definition of residency,” Brown said. When it comes to nonresident hunting licenses, Homeland Security Investigations feels they should enable nonimmigrant visa holders to purchase only guns “specific to hunting/outdoor game sportsmanship,” according to a statement provided by the agency. While he’s sympathetic to the concerns raised by HSI and others, Elms pointed out that many foreign nationals come to Arizona to hunt from around the world and legislative changes could negatively impact their ability to do so. If the department’s commission backs a state legislative change, Elms said the state Game and Fish Department might support it, but at the end of the day, it is federal law “that creates this loophole,” referencing the hunting license exemption for nonimmigrant visa holders purchasing guns. “Our state statute simply points to that federal legislation,” he added. In their statement, HSI agrees that the federal exemptions for nonimmigrant visitors “need to be updated.” “HSI and law enforcement partners have discussed that aliens here for specific hunting and/or professional sporting competition should be the only ones in possession of firearms or granted exemption to purchase firearms,” the statement goes on to say. In the next few years, Game and Fish is switching to an online-only license application process, which could make inappropriately purchasing a resident license less likely. “When you do apply online, you’re prompted with a lot more questions than you would be at the Walmart,” Elms said. Elms and Brown agreed that education could go a long way toward addressing the issue. In the wake of the citations, Brown said HSI and other agencies are working with state universities to make sure such students have a better understanding of gun laws and hunting license requirements. “Life outside of campus can be complicated for all students, domestic and international, and occasionally in upholding all state and federal laws,” a statement from the UA reads, which goes on to say that when situations like this arise, the university’s staff communicates “with relevant legal and law enforcement entities as appropriate.” “Most of the Chinese students here, the problem with them is just their lack of knowledge of the law system,” Gong said. “They know there’s a way you can purchase firearms, but they don’t actually know a lot about the firearms law.” Contact: mwoodhouse@tucson.com or 573-4235.

THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print ARCHBOLD, Ohio — Red Rambler Coffees, a coffee shop in Wauseon that roasts its own blends, faced the ultimate test last week. A team of efficiency experts from the java-loving metropolis of Seattle was arriving Tuesday in nearby Archbold, Ohio, and Kevin Sauder, president and CEO of Sauder Woodworking Co., wasn’t about to play host without a special custom-blended brew to offer his guests. But the experts from Amazon.com weren’t in Fulton County to sip coffee. Kevin Sauder, president and CEO of Sauder Woodworking, shows the volume of the company’s products. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image They were there to help Sauder Woodworking, the North American industry leader in ready-to-assemble furniture, improve its manufacturing techniques, product development, and shipping strategy to better satisfy Amazon, its Seattle-based e-commerce partner. Nationwide, e-commerce is savaging many bricks-and-mortar retailers, forcing them to cut work forces, close stores, cancel expansion plans, and gut many shopping malls and strip centers. But less talked about is what online shopping is doing to companies that produce goods that are bought — the manufacturers. “We’re really now in two businesses,” Mr. Sauder said. “We’re in long production runs [of items] that sell in Wal-Mart retail, Target retail, and Ikea.” And then there is e-commerce, he said, which “really is about more products, more style, more colors, shorter production runs, more emphasis on quick delivery, and finding the best way to get it to the end consumer damage-free.” Sauder Woodworking’s online sales have more than doubled in a few years, to 35 percent now, up from 15 percent a few years ago. The firm’s chief expects those sales to rise to 50 percent of the firm’s revenue in two years. Many of the changes required by e-commerce cannot be automated, meaning that privately owned Sauder Woodworking has needed to add employees. As a result, worker productivity — the Holy Grail of manufacturing — has fallen off at the sprawling furniture-making operations that began in Archbold 83 years ago. “Our production per labor hours has gone down in the last few years because we have to do more handling and shipping of goods,” Mr. Sauder said. The Amazon.com team came to northwest Ohio to scrutinize the company’s operation and, it was hoped, make Sauder more efficient based on the team’s expertise in dealing with other e-commerce partners. Over the last five years, as it has courted e-commerce partners, Sauder Woodworking has made changes in its revenue sources and business model. For decades, Sauder Woodworking’s forte was making bookshelves, entertainment centers, desks, and a variety of other ready-to-assemble furniture pieces that would be sold in stores of business partners such as Kmart, Wal-Mart, Target, and most recently, Ikea. It would make 1,500 units at a time of a particular unit, put them on pallets, and truck them to the retailer’s warehouse to be stocked later in stores. Because Sauder could be guaranteed only a minimum amount of store display and shelf space, as it was competing with rival products, it limited the number of overall products it made to those that sold best. Logan Alvarez prepares to wrap a package for an online order at the Sauder distribution center in Archbold, Ohio. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image “Every item had to be a home run,” Mr. Sauder said. But in 2000, Wal-Mart Stores created Walmart.com and a shortly after began selling Sauder products online. Then, sales from Target.com, Amazon.com, and recently, Wayfair.com have added to the mix. Sauder Woodworking, which employs more than 2,000 workers and is looking to hire 150 more, is grateful for the revenues online sales have opened up. “We’re committed to e-commerce,” Mr. Sauder said. But the new business has brought changes. The manufacturer has changed a packing line in its Erie Sauder Distribution Center to handle better packing to products to be shipped to individual customers. The line is now twice as long to allow workers to pack one product while another is being readied for the task. Because individual employees, instead of forklift drivers, now will be lifting heavy items to ship to consumers under the Amazon or Wayfair label, Sauder is reconfiguring 50,000 square feet of space to add an automated area where it can store products and rapidly retrieve them using robots. “I can’t say how much, but I can tell you the investment is significant,” Mr. Sauder said. The company is trying to group similar items together during the manufacturing phase to save time that is normally wasted. For example, workers would use a drilling machine to make parts needing a hole with a specific size. When finished, they stopped to change drill bits before moving on to make a part needing a different size hole. Whether they made one part or 500, it still takes an hour to change drill bits, Mr. Sauder said. But now the company can take parts that are different, but which all use the same size hole, and produce them together in one long run, saving time.

Individual employees, not forklift drivers, are lifting heavy items to ship to consumers under the Amazon or Wayfair label, while other products will go to retailers like Wal-Mart. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image Errol Denger, the director of commerce strategy at San Francisco-based Adobe Systems Inc., said manufacturers like Sauder are being forced to rewrite their business model because consumers are demanding a better shopping experience and online retailers like Wayfair and others must differentiate themselves from their online and bricks-and-mortar competitors. “Think about why Wayfair wants the extra knobs and other options,” Mr. Denger said. Wayfair knows, he said, that its basic products are likely to be the same or similar to products sold on rival Amazon.com, he said, so extra knobs, colors, and other options on products sold by Wayfair separate its products from others. Mr. Sauder said consumers have become adept at price comparisons while shopping online. “So I know what a 16-ounce bottle of Tide costs, and I’m not going to pay extra for it,” he said. But Wayfair will ask Sauder to add small options and variations to its products, making comparison shopping almost impossible. In the United States, e-commerce is growing at about 15 percent annually and totals about $425 billion a year, Mr. Denger said. “Amazon actually captures 51 percent of all new e-commerce growth in the U.S., and 24 percent of total retail growth,” he said. For a company like Sauder, continual adjustments will be needed for e-commerce orders to keep the process efficient and worth doing, Mr. Denger said. Mr. Sauder said e-commerce is helping Sauder broaden sales. For example, Walmart.com carries higher-end Sauder furniture that Wal-Mart’s stores will not. “People who wouldn’t think of going to Walmart for furniture are willing to look at Walmart.com. ... And suddenly you’re getting a new level of customers you didn’t get before,” Mr. Sauder said. In the future, most furniture will be purchased online, Mr. Sauder said. E-commerce has prompted the company to build a photography studio and add personnel to beef up its digital photography for use on retailer websites. “In the past, with discount retail customers, we would just shoot one or two angles of the product to be available for the carton graphics and catalog sheets,” Mr. Sauder said. “Now, with e-commerce, we probably take over a dozen shots of each item, including a 360-degree video shot, which are then loaded on the e-commerce sites.” Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

But those misdemeanor citations came from the state wildlife agency, not HSI, which could have brought more serious federal firearms charges. “If there’s no malicious intent and we can get the students into compliance, remove the unlawfully obtained firearms ... we don’t need to drop a big hammer,” Brown said about why the state filed the charges. Beyond Gong’s AK-47 lookalike, HSI agents have seized handguns and other rifles from the UA students. “Every person that we’ve talked to, that we’ve seized weapons from, has acknowledged that they were not purchased for the purpose of hunting,” Brown said. “One person did say they were for hunting coyotes. The story was so hideously inaccurate he eventually decided that he didn’t want to stick with that story.” Updates, reform needed There are several efforts underway to make it more difficult for foreign students to improperly purchase guns. While declining to go into details, Brown said the Legislature and Congress may eventually consider legislation that would “close the vulnerabilities.” At the state level, the goal would be to reach “a standardized definition of residency in alignment with the federal definition of residency,” Brown said. When it comes to nonresident hunting licenses, Homeland Security Investigations feels they should enable nonimmigrant visa holders to purchase only guns “specific to hunting/outdoor game sportsmanship,” according to a statement provided by the agency. While he’s sympathetic to the concerns raised by HSI and others, Elms pointed out that many foreign nationals come to Arizona to hunt from around the world and legislative changes could negatively impact their ability to do so. If the department’s commission backs a state legislative change, Elms said the state Game and Fish Department might support it, but at the end of the day, it is federal law “that creates this loophole,” referencing the hunting license exemption for nonimmigrant visa holders purchasing guns. “Our state statute simply points to that federal legislation,” he added. In their statement, HSI agrees that the federal exemptions for nonimmigrant visitors “need to be updated.” “HSI and law enforcement partners have discussed that aliens here for specific hunting and/or professional sporting competition should be the only ones in possession of firearms or granted exemption to purchase firearms,” the statement goes on to say. In the next few years, Game and Fish is switching to an online-only license application process, which could make inappropriately purchasing a resident license less likely. “When you do apply online, you’re prompted with a lot more questions than you would be at the Walmart,” Elms said. Elms and Brown agreed that education could go a long way toward addressing the issue. In the wake of the citations, Brown said HSI and other agencies are working with state universities to make sure such students have a better understanding of gun laws and hunting license requirements. “Life outside of campus can be complicated for all students, domestic and international, and occasionally in upholding all state and federal laws,” a statement from the UA reads, which goes on to say that when situations like this arise, the university’s staff communicates “with relevant legal and law enforcement entities as appropriate.” “Most of the Chinese students here, the problem with them is just their lack of knowledge of the law system,” Gong said. “They know there’s a way you can purchase firearms, but they don’t actually know a lot about the firearms law.” Contact: mwoodhouse@tucson.com or 573-4235.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Wal-Mart have climbed nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months and are up about 9 percent for the year-to-date period.

A high-ranking federal official told the Star his agency has no evidence of “malicious intent” by the eight students. Nevertheless, the purchases reveal what officials say is a potentially troubling vulnerability in federal and Arizona firearms laws, which exempt international students and other nonimmigrant visa holders with hunting licenses from prohibitions on gun ownership. One of the University of Arizona students cited said he was simply intrigued by American gun culture and wanted to have the experience of shooting his own firearm, a common motivation among the cited students, according to the federal official. “It’s totally not possible,” Yifei Gong said of his prospects of ever owning a gun in China, where individual gun ownership is heavily restricted. “You probably won’t have a firearm for your life. That’s why most people want a firearm in China. They can’t buy one; that’s why they want one.” Following advice found online and from fellow international students, Gong went to a Walmart and purchased a resident hunting license in November, according to him and Arizona Game and Fish Department records obtained by the Star. With the license, he said, he went to a gun shop and bought a semi-automatic RAS47, a U.S.-made rifle designed to mimic the Kalashnikov. While self-defense was an element of his desire to purchase a gun, Yifei said it was first and foremost for “fun,” and he took his rifle to local shooting ranges several times. But Gong’s time as an Arizona gun owner was to be short-lived. In the early morning of Dec. 6, a state game and fish officer and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations agents went to Gong’s off-campus Tucson apartment to ask about his license and, ultimately, to seize his firearm, according to a report. Gong was cited by the state officer for fraudulently obtaining a hunting license, a Class 2 misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty and paid a fine. He is facing no other state or federal charges, according to court documents and a federal official. Gong’s experience was not an isolated incident. As of early May, seven other Chinese students at the UA had been similarly cited and had their guns taken, according to court records and Homeland Security Investigations. The citations and seizures are the most recent development in what Scott Brown, the Phoenix HSI special agent in charge, described as a more than yearlong project of the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats, a multiagency group of state and federal agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Despite the ominous sound of the name, Homeland Security Iinvestigations, the lead agency on the matter, does not suspect the eight UA students had any “malicious intent” when they acquired their licenses and guns, Brown said. He did say there are a “very small number” of other cases where there could be such intent, but even with those, Brown clarified, “our concern isn’t necessarily that they themselves pose the direct threat.” “People like to go out in the desert and shoot guns — U.S. citizens and foreign students alike,” he said of what his agency found to be the most common motivation at play. Brown said the cases highlight what he described as a loophole in firearms regulation that “could be exploited by those with malicious intent.” “This is occurring in other states, where there are foreign students, where there are similar state hunting license requirements,” he added. As it stands under federal law, nonimmigrant visa holders, like international students, are generally prohibited from owning guns. However, exemptions are made for those with a valid hunting license or permit, according to the ATF’s website. Arizona law reflects that exemption. To buy a resident Arizona hunting license, applicants must have lived in the state for six months and not claim residency in another state or jurisdiction, according to the Game and Fish Department. One of the requirements of an F-1 student visa is maintaining “a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up,” according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s website. That designation would typically prevent an international student from being able to get a resident hunting license. “The visa paperwork make it very clear that they are not a resident of the United States,” said Gene Elms, law enforcement branch chief with Arizona Game and Fish. “They don’t qualify for a resident license in Arizona.” Nevertheless, Gong said he easily purchased a resident tag at the Walmart on South Houghton Road last November, something Elms said he wasn’t surprised to hear. Other students purchased their resident licenses similarly, though two bought them through AZGFD’s online hunting license portal, according to AZGFD reports. “I went to Walmart and they asked me how long I’ve been here. I’ve been here for at least two years, and they just assumed that I’m a resident of Arizona, and that’s the hunting license they gave me,” Gong said. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed Gong’s purchase. “We have policies and procedures in place to help ensure we comply with applicable laws when issuing hunting licenses,” a statement from the company read. “A customer must provide valid identification at the time of the purchase to confirm residency.” Several local gun shops declined to sell Gong a gun, citing their policy of not selling to international students. However, he said he eventually found one where his hunting license and other documents were enough to buy an RAS47. “I did not know (I was breaking the law) until they seized my firearm. I believe that most of the people who are cited with this charge did not know that,” Gong said. “If there is something wrong with my hunting license, why would they sell it to me?” Nonresident Arizona hunting licenses, while significantly more expensive than resident tags, can be purchased by nonimmigrant visa holders in Arizona. It’s legal for such license holders to buy and own a firearm until the license expires, at which time “they become a prohibited possessor,” said Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Game and Fish Department. No “big hammer” In late 2015, the FBI issued a warning after it received reports of Chinese international students “legally” purchasing guns, according to a Dec. 23 Phoenix ABC 15 story. In one case detailed in the broadcast, a Chinese student was expelled and deported after bringing two AR-15s onto the Arizona State University campus. Brown described that incident as “the most serious” in Arizona involving an armed international student. Then, on Jan. 16, Juang Yue, a 19-year-old Chinese student at ASU, was shot and killed in a road-rage incident, news of which spread quickly in the Chinese student community. In the wake of the tragedy, some Chinese students expressed an interest in buying guns for self-defense, and information on how to acquire them circulated online, as did warnings about the potential dangers of gun ownership. Gong said he was aware of the incident but that it played only a small role in his desire to purchase a gun. It was around the time of the FBI warning and shooting that ASU’s Police Department asked the ATF for assistance with foreign student gun purchases. ATF, in turn, reached out to HSI because of its expertise in immigration-related issues, according to Brown. In late 2016, state game and fish employees also noticed an uptick in students who did not appear to be residents coming to their Tucson office to buy hunting licenses, Elms said. It took time, Brown said, to acquire the records necessary to determine who may have purchased licenses and firearms illegally, as well as what their intent was. The hunting license charges started coming in late 2016, according to court records. But those misdemeanor citations came from the state wildlife agency, not HSI, which could have brought more serious federal firearms charges. “If there’s no malicious intent and we can get the students into compliance, remove the unlawfully obtained firearms ... we don’t need to drop a big hammer,” Brown said about why the state filed the charges. Beyond Gong’s AK-47 lookalike, HSI agents have seized handguns and other rifles from the UA students. “Every person that we’ve talked to, that we’ve seized weapons from, has acknowledged that they were not purchased for the purpose of hunting,” Brown said. “One person did say they were for hunting coyotes. The story was so hideously inaccurate he eventually decided that he didn’t want to stick with that story.” Updates, reform needed There are several efforts underway to make it more difficult for foreign students to improperly purchase guns. While declining to go into details, Brown said the Legislature and Congress may eventually consider legislation that would “close the vulnerabilities.” At the state level, the goal would be to reach “a standardized definition of residency in alignment with the federal definition of residency,” Brown said.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Wal-Mart: Wal-Mart saw online sales surge as it changed up its shipping offers, and also drew more shoppers to its stores in the most recent quarter. The world’s largest retailer said Thursday that sales at established stores rose for the 11th straight quarter, and customer traffic rose for the 10th quarter in a row. That’s a contrast with many rivals that saw both those figures drop. Online sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent, dramatically up from the 29 percent growth in the previous quarter. Though the company has been buying up smaller internet retailers, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Wal-Mart’s shares gained more than 3 percent on Thursday and closed Friday at $78.77.   Foot Locker: Foot Locker Inc. suffered its worst stock decline in more than eight years Friday after first-quarter results missed analysts’ estimates, an outcome the retailer blamed in part on slow income-tax refunds. The shares tumbled 17 percent to close at $58.72, the biggest plunge since the financial crisis was underway in November 2008. Foot Locker was Friday’s biggest decliner in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index by a wide margin. The athletic-shoe chain blamed “unprecedented challenges” last quarter — especially in February, when same-store sales plummeted by a percentage in the low teens. Foot Locker reported first-quarter earnings of $1.36 a share, trailing the $1.38 predicted by analysts.   Campbell Soup Co.: The company’s quarterly sales and profit missed analysts’ estimates, hurt by higher promotions and weak demand for its condensed soups, broths and V8 vegetable juices, and the company warned that its full-year sales could decline. Shares of the company, which also sells Pepperidge Farm snacks and Prego pasta sauce, fell Friday as much as 5 percent then closed down 2 percent at $55.78.

Pricey Housing Discourages Having Kids - 05/19/2017 - Yves Smith 2:00PM Water Cooler 5/19/2017 Posted on May 19, 2017 by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente Trade “As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to make NAFTA ‘much better’ for working people. Today’s notice is markedly vague. But Trump’s NAFTA renegotiation plan that leaked in late March described just what the corporate lobby is demanding: using NAFTA talks to revive parts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), like expanded investor incentives to offshore jobs that could make NAFTA even worse for working people” [Lori Wallach, Public CItizen]. “The obvious measure of whether NAFTA renegotiation is intended to benefit working people is if Trump makes clear he will eliminate NAFTA’s special investor rights that make it easier to offshore American jobs and attack our laws before tribunals of three corporate lawyers who can award the firms unlimited sums of taxpayer money. If corporate elites are allowed to dictate how NAFTA is renegotiated, the agreement could become more damaging for working families and the environment in the three countries. And modest tweaks will not stop NAFTA’s ongoing damage, much less deliver on Trump’s promises for a deal that will create American jobs and raise wages. Already the 500 corporate trade advisers who got us into the TPP have been consulted on NAFTA renegotiations, while the few labor advisers were shut out of that March meeting. And the public and Congress are being left in the dark about negotiating plans and goals.” “Organizations representing grain, produce, dairy and livestock farmers said NAFTA is largely working for their industries, especially the integrated supply chains that allow goods to move freely across borders. Since NAFTA’s implementation in 1994, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have more than quadrupled, growing from $8.9 billion in 1993 to $38.6 billion in 2015, USDA data shows” [Politico]. I’m not sure what the Mexican farmers think about that, though. “Fixing Trade Agreements In Five Simple Steps” [Electronic Frontier Foundation]. “Trade experts agree that without five simple fixes, Americans will continue to reject new trade deals….” No. This is all about process, specifically “transparency,” a favorite neoliberal panacea. Do the experts really think that people won’t reject a transparently bad deal? Politics Policy “While President Trump and Administration officials have not made their intentions clear in regards to the United States remaining in the Paris Agreement, a large faction of well-known companies have made it very clear they want to remain part of it” [Logistics Management], 2020 “Is John Kasich finishing the tour, or just getting started?” [Matt Bai, Yahoo News]. “An enthusiastic, born-again Christian, Kasich criticized an executive order, issued by President Trump the day before, that lifted some restrictions on politicking in places of worship. ‘I don’t believe these religious people ought to be endorsing candidates,’ he said. ”They ought to be figuring out how to clothe the homeless or feed the poor, not all of this political nonsense.'” Especially since government shouldn’t be doing that? 2018 “Paula Swearengin, 42, is an accounting clerk and single mother of four from Coal City, West Virginia. On March 9, she announced that she would challenge Manchin in the Democratic primary. She is a newcomer to politics and an early beneficiary of Brand New Congress, a political action committee founded by former members of Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign” [The New Republic]. Interesting interview: I don’t care if the DNC backs me or not. This is a people-funded campaign. The DNC has failed us in many ways here in West Virginia. They failed us when they nominated one of the biggest-polluting coal barons in West Virginia: Governor Jim Justice, who mines three miles from my house and puts silica dust in my children’s lungs. That’s a failure of the Democratic Party. I hope we rise up and realize that, Democratic or Republican, we all have the same set of values. We all want clean water for our children, clean air for them to breathe, and to not worry about our families getting buried miles deep in a coal mine and suffocating to death. 2017 MT-AL: “In the race for Montana’s at-large House seat, Republican Greg Gianforte led Democratic Rob Quist by six points in a poll conducted by a Democratic super PAC late last month” [Roll Call]. FWIW… MT-AL: “U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ rally Saturday for Rob Quist has been moved to the Adams Center in Missoula, which holds up to 7,500 people” [The Missoulian]. “Quist, the Democratic candidate for Montana’s lone U.S. House seat, was originally set to appear with Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, at the Wilma, which holds 1,400 people with standing-room only.” Health Care “Harkin: O-Care Should Have Been Single-Payer But ‘We Blew It'” [Talking Points Memo (2014)]. “”We had the votes in ’09. We had a huge majority in the House, we had 60 votes in the Senate,” Harkin told The Hill, saying that the first Congress of President Barack Obama’s administration should have passed ‘single-payer right from the get go or at least put a public option (which) would have simplified a lot.'” So when you hear a Democrat loyalist say “We didn’t have the votes” on single payer, you can throw this in their face share this with them. Realignment and Legitimacy “Change Dot Ugh: The Popular Petition Site Profits Off Progressivism” [Paste]. “But the truth is that when you fill out a Change petition, you’re giving your information to a company that sells it to the highest bidder. The popular petition site uses your well-intentioned activism to profile you and sell you sponsored content — and most of its 150 million reported users don’t realize it. Change isn’t interested in change. It’s interested in profit.Billy Penn (DB)]. Stats Watch No Econoday stats today. State Employment and Unemployment Summary: “Unemployment rates were lower in April in 10 states, higher in 1 state, and stable in 39 states and the District of Columbia, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Nineteen states had jobless rate decreases from a year earlier, and 31 states and the District had little or no change. The national unemployment rate, 4.4 percent, was little changed from March but was 0.6 percentage point lower than in April 2016” [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. Rail: If coal and grain are removed from the analysis, rail over the last 6 months been declining around 5% – but this week it IMPROVED 0.6 % (meaning that the predicitive economic elements improved year-over-year). Also consider rail movements are below 2015 levels – even though they are above 2016 levels” [Econintersect], Retail: “While rivals like Target Corp. are reporting sagging sales and declining foot traffic, Wal-Mart’s same-store revenue rose 1.4% in the first quarter…. The gains complement a 63% surge in U.S. e-commerce sales, and indicate that the company’s strategy of investing both in store improvements and online operations is starting to pay off. Those efforts include a campaign to reduce inventory in stores that has placed additional pressures on suppliers. Wal-Mart is also blurring the lines between its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses by encouraging customers to pick up online orders in stores. One problem Wal-Mart hasn’t cracked: how to boost sales without sacrificing margins” [Wall Street Journal]. Retail: “Why predictions of a ‘retail apocalypse’ are overblown” [CNBC]. “Brick-and-mortar is not in fact defunct. Instead, it is evolving, and successful retailers are embracing a shopping experience that blends a variety of platforms and that ultimately creates the engagement necessary for a brand’s success…. As shown by the renewed appeal for showrooming in the apparel retail industry, digital retailing and brick-and-mortar are complementary.” Retail: “How a Lack of Liquidity is Tanking Retail—And Who’s to Blame” [Sourcing Journal]. “The common culprits blamed for the retail flame out are a shift in consumer shopping habits and the rise of e-commerce sales. And while both have done plenty of damage on their own, one additional factor is responsible for making store chains less able to weather the tempest: a glut of leveraged buyouts that too often have become a business distraction and a financial drain….” Real Estate: “Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest private equity fund, told investors to dial back their expectations for property returns as the “great run” of the past five years becomes harder to replicate” [Bloomberg]. Shipping: “Uber Freight finally hits the road by launching brokerage services in Texas” [DC Velocity]. “It chose to formally start in Texas because of the state’s large volume of traffic, according to Eric Berdinis, Uber Freight’s senior product manager.” Really? Not regulatory arbitrage? Shipping: “With Uber Freight, Travis Takes on Trucking” [Wired]. “Travis”? WTF, Wired? “Still, Uber holds an advantage when it comes to software and managing data. But, as in its campaign to topple the taxi industry, it all hinges on pricing. Existing brokerages typically take a 12 percent cut on deals they arrange, Petersen says; Uber isn’t revealing its rate, but it has the cash and expertise to do the same job for far less.” “Cash” is a delicate way of saying “squillionaires playing the ponies,” isn’t it? Shipping: “[Uber] it appears happy to burn through its cash, a model which could allow it to take less than the typical 12% cut that truck brokerages take” [The LoadStar]. “[Uber] says it will determine pricing based on market conditions and experience.” And the cash. As you just said. The Bezzle: “U.S. Startups Fail to Attract Expected Crowd of Small Investors” [Bloomberg]. “It’s been a year since U.S. rules went into effect enabling anyone — not just the ultra-wealthy — to buy a slice of a startup. Turns out, few are interested.” Maybe the marks small investors were’t as stupid as Obama and the investment community thought? The Bezzle: “Riding Shotgun With Uber CEO Travis Kalanick” [Fortune]. Wretched excess in Uber’s new headquarters building. Too much stupid money sloshing about. The Bezzle: “Snap Inc. is being sued by a former employee who claims the company, parent to social media app, Snapchat, inflated growth metrics ahead of its March 2017 initial public offering. According to his complaint, which was initially filed in January in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Anthony Pompliano alleges that he was lured from Facebook in 2015 to Snapchat to focus on user growth and engagement and was fired after he refused to go along with inflated figures to make the company look better” [The Fashion Law]. The Bezzle: “We got one of Apple’s patented round pizza boxes” [The Outline]. “The box is thin and round… Like all Apple products, the proprietary standard of the box makes it incompatible with third-party products…. As Apple watcher John Gruber wrote when Steve Jobs resigned in 2011, ‘The same thought, care, and painstaking attention to detail that Steve Jobs brought to questions like ‘How should a computer work?’, ‘How should a phone work?’, ‘How should we buy music and apps in the digital age?’ he also brought to the most important question: ‘How should a company that creates such things function?'” Here’s what I know: Apple makes the Mac gets incrementally worse with every release. That goes for hardware (no more MagSafe connector, shitty MacBook Pros, stagnant desktops) and software. iOS is a mashed together botch of inconsistent affordances, and OS X gets more like iOS every release (in addition to not fixing long standing horrors, like Apple Store). Then again, to long on the bright side, go long dongles, at least for now. The Bezzle: “Hedge fund-backed pharma company that fed opioid crisis now seeks to profit from treating it” [LittleSis].

Oh, wait… Gaia “Arctic stronghold of world’s seeds flooded after permafrost melts” [Guardian]. “[T]he Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel…. ‘It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,’ said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.” Eesh. “Songlin Fei, a forest ecologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and his colleagues tracked the shifting distributions of 86 types of trees using data collected by the US Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis Program during two periods: from 1980 to 1995 and between 2013 and 2015 for all states. They found more species heading west than north, probably partly because of changing precipitation patterns, the team reported on May 17 in Science Advances1. ‘That was a huge surprise for us,’ says Fei” [Scientific American]. “‘This study suggests that, in the near-term, trees are responding to changes in water availability more than to temperature changes,’ he says.” Class Warfare “Unemployment in the U.S. Is Falling, So Why Isn’t Pay Rising?” [Bloomberg], News of the Wired “Cooking in the Archives: Bringing Early Modern Manuscript Recipes into a Twenty-First-Century Kitche” [Archive Journal]. “Taste is the elusive element that we try to recreate when we cook these historical recipes.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00300 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on May 19, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

They will immediately go “alternative history”. I know because they still try to pull that one on me when I point out that the Public Option was in the House bill and could have been passed with Reconciliation same as the final version of ACA but Obama had already promised the Big Three that no such thing would happen regarding health care and insurance in America. They just get quiet when I start spouting facts and vote counts. Reply ↓ katiebird May 19, 2017 at 2:38 pm Or insist on the lie that there were never 60 votes in the Senate. Or the lie that Obama was helpless without those 60 votes: Obama NEVER went to the Capital to twist arms — vote for HR 676 you MF or I’ll hold up every appropriation for your state/district till you change your mind — or something. The President has a lot of power. But as far as I know the only arm that got twisted was Dennis Kucinich’s Reply ↓ jo6pac May 19, 2017 at 3:21 pm Yes, if obomber would have channeled LBJ it would have happened in the first week Reply ↓ ambrit May 19, 2017 at 8:19 pm That’s predicated on the illusion that the “O” man was a Democrat. (If he had channeled LBJ, he probably would have entered a fugue state and still be there today. I can hear the dissonant chords of the opening crescendo now; “Fugue in Dem. Minor.”) Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 3:31 pm People don’t mention Kucinich as often. He’s one of the very few to speak up against the current Russia hysteria, when other ‘progressives’ are either silent or falling for it. Reply ↓ katiebird May 19, 2017 at 3:39 pm I know, I like him a lot. His treatment was terrible. Reply ↓ Annotherone May 19, 2017 at 3:51 pm Indeed! He’s too good for this nation! The people of the USA simply do not recognise a good thing when it’s right in front of them. He was ridiculed and denigrated, back in 2004 when campaigning for the presidency. I felt thoroughly disgusted by his treatment. Bernie, at least did better with the general public, if not the DNC.

Reply ↓ Arizona Slim May 19, 2017 at 4:27 pm If Obama had twisted arms like, say, LBJ, we’d be wrapping up our first decade under a single payer system. Reply ↓ Mark Anderlik May 20, 2017 at 11:19 am I think this is more wishful thinking than anything. It’s the public option that we might of had for the last decade. And those of us working for this on the ground hoped that the ACA with the public option would help set up the argument for single payer. Even without the public option, we are now seeing a much stronger movement for single payer health than there was before the ACA. Reply ↓ marym May 20, 2017 at 11:58 am It’s retroactive wishful thinking to imagine that not making the case and doing the political work for something good, supported by decades of polling, and sorely needed, is a good way to get it. It’s incredible that after all these years, the coming to pass of all the predicted ACA problems, and its vulnerability, that defenders are still making this excuse. Reply ↓ Mark Anderlik May 20, 2017 at 6:14 pm I don’t know about you, but I have worked on organizing health care insurance reform since before Bill Clinton was President. I was advocating for single payer back then and do so (with just a few quibbles) today. Perhaps your memory of organizing for health care is different than mine, so I would appreciate hearing how single payer was close to becoming a political reality when Obama was elected. The campaigns for hc change we were organizing BEFORE Obama was first elected were difficult to say the least. As I recall most of the thousands of ordinary Montanans we spoke with then and until the ACA was passed were skeptical of government intervention and of the ability to make change in any way. The ACA was not our first choice(or even third choice), but the ineptitude of the Clinton Admin on health care and the campaigning of the hc industry, limited what was possible. Sorry for being so prickly but the work we on the organizing grassroots put in on the ACA clearly and intentionally laid the necessary foundation for single payer. Today I dare say single payer of some sort is a majority opinion in Montana. Or at least close. Reply ↓ marym May 20, 2017 at 7:14 pm I don’t know if it would have been politically possible. I argue that Obama and the Democratic establishment chose not to try, despite the many factors that put them in a strong position to make the case to the public, influence reluctant Congresspersons, and get the job done. They made that choice not because they thought a rube -goldberg expensive, inefficient, inadequate contrivance was what people wanted; or because there’s any evidence on this planet that it’s a way to provide affordable, universal healthcare. They made the choice because it’s what their donors wanted and because they believed, and continue to believe, that a few crumbs dropped from the neoliberal banquet of grift are good enough. It’s interesting that you cite Montanans as objecting to government intervention, as I thought one of the good things the ACA did was to provide Medicare to the people of Libby, Montana. Reply ↓ Mark Anderlik May 20, 2017 at 9:38 pm I agree with your assessment by and large. However whether or not a single payer plan could pass was a critically important question for the short run at the time. What is often overlooked is that there was a huge organized grassroots effort to make even the crumbs from the neoliberals possible. Congress and the president would not likely have even accomplished what they did without this movement. And now there is a new constituency to maintain and expand the ACA. Many people who are fed the neoliberal crumbs now are more confident that there is more bread on the table. As for Libby, in Montana as elsewhere I suspect, there is a profound contradiction in attitudes about government action. The government is viewed with suspicion and disdain, until it comes with money. It is reflected in the attitude that I actually heard a woman say “keep the government hands off of my Medicare” Reply ↓ Kim Kaufman May 19, 2017 at 4:27 pm Kucinich sold out. In return for his vote, the famous arm-twisting from Obama on Air Force 1, his wife got to sit on Michele Obama’s garden commission and some similar trifles. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 5:52 pm Can we find any politicians who voted against Omabacare, but are speaking up against the current Russia hysteria? Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 6:35 pm Purists with no knowledge of political power and how it is exercised are quick to accuse whomever of selling out. How do we know what Kucinich was threatened with on that plane ride? ” Nice wife and daughters you got there Kucinich. Such a shame if something was to happen to them.” I wonder if somebody put a horse’s head in Dennis’s bed. Reply ↓ Kim Kaufman May 19, 2017 at 8:16 pm I didn’t say he was threatened. I said he changed his vote but got nothing of substance – for us the people – in exchange for it. I forgot the few things he got for himself and his wife now but I was told on very good authority. Reply ↓ Procopius May 20, 2017 at 8:48 pm I can agree that the claim “there were never 60 votes in the Senate” is uncertain, it certainly is not a lie. The Democrats never had but 58 party members in the Senate, and that was after Franken was finally certified and before Ted Kennedy died. In normal times they should have been able to count on picking up at least one or two Republican votes to make up for the uncertainty of the vindictive, corrupt, loathsome Weepin’ Joe Lieberman, but the Republicans established a unity never before seen in history. Remember that through the whole process there were a number of Democrats who claimed they would not vote for it “unless …” Louisiana Purchase, anyone? I wish Obama had ignored Rahm Emanuel and tried for it, but he decided the risk was too great, and I think he had a better idea of where the votes were than Tom Harkin. Obama did a number of bad things, and I still think he’s the last moderate Republican, but I can’t be sure he was wrong on finally deciding to drop the Public Option. Reply ↓ RUKidding May 19, 2017 at 3:53 pm Same experience here. The usual excuse I get is that the “Obama tried, but Republicans wouldn’t let it happen.” No, in fact, that’s not the case. It’s entirely possible that the Public Option would not have passed, although I think it stood a chance. That said, Obama went behind closed doors and made a deal (for himself) with the Big Three BigInsurance, and ACA is what we got stuck with. I’m really tired of Democratic voters diefying Obama and making excuses for him. At least try to live in reality most of the time, please. Please note: I used to be a Democrat, but I pretty much gave that up after Bill Clinton and the third way b.s., which basically means: We call ourselves “Democrats” (using their fingers as scare quotes), but we run things Just. Like. Republicans…. except we are a teensy tiny bit more liberalish. Reply ↓ RepubAnon May 20, 2017 at 12:20 am One of those 60 “Democratic Party” votes was Joe Lieberman.

Reply ↓ Darius May 19, 2017 at 2:35 pm Democrats like to whine that the Senate filibuster prevented them from passing better health legislation, conveniently omitting that Bush never got 60 Senate votes for his tax cuts. Republicans know to use budget reconciliation to get around the filibuster. They need only 50 votes plus Pence if they ever can agree on O-care repeal. Democrats act like they never heard of reconciliation to justify their inaction and strengthen their embrace of victimhood at the hands of the evil Republicans. Reply ↓ RepubAnon May 20, 2017 at 12:23 am There’s rules to the reconciliation process. The big one is it must be revenue neutral, or reduce the deficit. Easy for folks who want to fund tax cuts by gutting the social safety net… but a bit harder for Democrats. Reply ↓ Pat May 20, 2017 at 6:50 am And those tax cuts were revenue neutral, not. So put up some bull level numbers of some cuts that will be immediately reinstated and do what the Republicans have done – game that rule. If the owners had wanted it, even the Dems would have figured out a temporary revenue neutral… Oh wait they did with ACA as well. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 19, 2017 at 2:46 pm My parents, country Baptists, were imperfect people but I can’t recall either of them ever telling a lie. Lying was considered a sin. While I’m not religious myself I do wonder if changes in the country’s religious landscape have had some effect on its ethics. It may be that an irrational or, if you will, faith based fear of doing wrong is necessary to counter our deep evolutionary instincts to be selfish and greedy and to say whatever is necessary to further those aims. Or not. But all the scoffing at organized religion–much of it justified–tends to ignore the degree to which religion once formed the basis for most of our citizens’ ethics. To be caught out in a lie was considered a disgrace. Now nobody seems to care unless, of course, your name is Trump and most of his supporters don’t care when he does it either. Reply ↓ local to oakland May 19, 2017 at 3:42 pm Thanks for this. In addition to what you wrote, here is a thought. I don’t know whether it matters whether the ethic be rational or faith based, but there may be a developmental window in a child’s life in which it is important to teach and reinforce practical ethical norms to get responsible ethical adult citizens. In the US, public school and church both, I believe, worked at reinforcing such faith based norms until we became aggressively secular. Also too, so did the competing forms of religious schools created by Roman Catholics and Jews. Freedom from religious conformism at school is I think an important development in our tradition of constitutional rights. However, public schools in my limited experience do not treat ethics at all either theoretically or practically. If they do it comes from the initiative of individual teacher or principals. School rules are functional at best, arbitrary at worst, not touching any larger values. So school can become a Lord of the Flies type environment. And unless fortunate in their parental and other influences, many students graduate with an ad hoc ethic with large aspects of either go along to get along, or success at all costs. It seems to me that one part of child development includes a child absorbing ethical norms from their environment much as they do language. I don’t believe the public schools we have today have been designed or implemented with this in mind. Speaking more generally, as you probably already know, such concerns and complaints about declining traditional morals can also be found in Roman literature as the latin speaking elite struggled with the challenges inherent in becoming a polyglot, multicultural empire and bemoaned the lack of traditional virtue and pietas in their children. I wonder whether certain aspects of these challenges of multiculturalism and moral decline are inherent in the process of becoming a large and powerful empire. Both having power and lacking the experience of hardship or struggle shape character in ways that seem to make the development of virtue more difficult. Also, the personal encounter with competing forms of religion and ethics while broadening and fostering tolerance can also create doubt as to the truth, and the importance of any traditional form of religion, whatever it might happen to be. In short, I agree and I think this is an important issue. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 19, 2017 at 4:31 pm Of course religion has formed the basis for endless misbehavior throughout history and as our society has changed so has religion (“prosperity gospel”). But as you say, teaching children to have a sense of right and wrong is not an arbitrary choice but is, in fact, an entirely rational activity for societies to pursue. Perhaps one reason our white collar crime laws are so weak is that it used to be assumed that wealthy people with a reputation to protect would avoid behavior that might lead to disgrace or accusations of dishonesty. Now it’s let the lawyers sort it out. Those who work the system may even boast about their cleverness. Reply ↓ mk May 19, 2017 at 7:34 pm Think of the children attending Catholic churches and schools who are taught right and wrong and then are molested, raped, beaten by their teachers/priests/nuns. Not just Catholics, but they are a very good example. And this is not something that started happening recently, it’s been going on for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Not much change for this religion.

I’ve been having thoughts on the demise of religion and its effects on society for quite some time now as well. I’ve come to the conclusion that religion has been supplanted by the mass media and modern scientific propaganda techniques as a means for social control. The first nail in the coffin for religion was the invention of the printing press. Folks were finally able to purchase and read the bible in their own language and no longer had to just take the priest’s word for it on Sunday. 200 years and many devastating wars later, the Catholic Church’s monopoly on God was but a memory. The second nail in the coffin was the industrial revolution. All the scientific advances that allowed this event to take place slowly eroded the credibility over time of the church, both Protestant and Catholic. The bible’s stories of creation, once widely regarded as fact were revealed to be nothing more than made up stories. Epidemics were no longer understood to be the wrath of God, but rather the wrath of tiny microbes and curable not by prayer but by man himself. The third and final nail in the coffin was the advent of mass media and Bernaysian propaganda. The invention of radio and television allowed governments and corporations to beam their message into every home in the land every day of the week. The Church, already divided into a thousand pieces and with its credibility in the dumpster never stood a chance; they only had their audience’s ear once a week on Sunday and were stuck with the same ancient propaganda messages written down long ago in the bible. On the other hand, the propagandists crafting the messages broadcast over radio and television had no such restrictions. Their slick, focus grouped propaganda was (and still is) free to appeal the most primal and brutal parts of human nature, and I think that’s where we lost our values. You can see these changes manifest in the relationship between governments and the church now vs the pre-printing press era. Prior to the advent of the printing press, the Church was a high ranking partner of the government that owned vast amounts of land, levied taxes, and even waged war on occasion. Nowadays, government-church collusion is forbidden in the west, and it is the mass media that is government’s social control handmaiden. Proto-propaganda in the form of pamphlets, posters, and whatnot had existed since the dawn of printing, however the mass media really “made their bones” so to speak during WW1 with Eddy Bernays’ Committee on Public Information.

If you observe what they do, not what they say, you will see that everyone around you is lying. And not just in the human world: all animal communication is merely a signal designed to influence behavior; each communication must be considered a manipulation, one to your disadvantage until proven otherwise.

I successfully started 8 year old tomato seeds this year, 10 year old radish seeds last year. 30 years ago 3 year old frozen “beans” would not sprout but a friend started an 18 year old basement stored “bean” last year. Pea seeds seem to be the least amenable to storage. Anybody else have experience/observations to share about seed storage? Reply ↓ Shane May 19, 2017 at 5:02 pm I’m an avid food gardener and I think the attitude that you can just freeze it all for now and worry about what to do with it later is a terrible strategy, as shown by the arctic vault flooding. Likewise the attitude that we can grow millions of acres of the same strain of a crop and stuff what little remains of the genetic diversity that used to exist into vaults and pull it out later if we need it. Crops need to be grown regularly to maintain not just the health of the crop, but also the volume of seed needed to grow it on a meaningful scale, and the skills required to handle each strain’s peculiarities. Putting all your eggs in one freezer is a recipe for failure. Modern crops are bred to be hyper-responsive to fertiliser and often irrigation, making them relatively indifferent to local geology and climate. If/when industrial agriculture fails the lack of access to locally adapted land-race staple crops is likely to make a return to subsistence agriculture an even more difficult process that it would otherwise be. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 19, 2017 at 6:17 pm I’ve found peas to be relatively easy to save too and will be trying some Marfax beans that I saved from last season this year. And a side note: evidently saving the seeds in the ground works too. I had tried planting some lettuce in one patch last year that would not grow no matter how many times I re-seeded it. We had very dry weather and by the end of the summer the patch was pretty much dust, despite repeatedly watering it. Did some edging around that patch yesterday to get the garden ready for planting and noticed little lettuce plants coming up all over the place. Sometimes it seems like all the work I put into my tiny garden is completely wasted and I’d be better off just throwing a bunch of seeds around the yard and see what comes up! Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 6:50 pm There must be a million gardeners in the US. Maybe 100,000 thousand of them are good gardeners. What if each one of those good gardeners each adopted ONE SPECIFIC temperate-zone variety of something to save? That would assure One Hundred Thousand varieties being saved and maintained. What’s another way to keep as many varieties saved and maintained as possible? Buying valuable and useful true-variety seed from seed companies qualified to maintain it for real and at quality year after year after year. And paying more to buy shinola food from shinola growers who pay more to shinola companies for shinola varieties of seed. Both approaches would help. Reply ↓ ratefink May 19, 2017 at 10:38 pm well, Baker Heirloom has had some really fun and delicious ones that I’ve planted, and I’m really not much of a gardener. Also, they are always looking for locally preserved strains. Reply ↓ Shane May 20, 2017 at 12:00 am This is a good idea but has a couple of complications. Firstly many crops are outcrossing (cucurbits, most grains) so each strain needs to be isolated from others to prevent unwanted crossing, plus require large populations to select next years seed from to maintain quality. Traditionally this was achieved by many neighboring farms growing the same basic strain each year, with crossing happening between farms. Most suburban farmers would struggle to grow a hundred pumpkin plants or influence what their neighbors grow. Secondly even for self pollinating crops (most legumes and solanums) accessing the genetic diversity that remains in the seed vaults is difficult. More difficult is figuring out which variety they should be ideally growing in their location. Even with seed vaults lots of genetic diversity has been lost, and just as importantly the know how about how to grow which crop where is also lost. If the industrialised nations ever had to return to subsistence agriculture it would be a rocky road for these reasons. Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 6:46 pm “locally mined coal” . . .

This is why so many good candidates lose—because people who aren’t on the ground where they are decide they aren’t viable and voice that opinion loudly where it can do the most damage. Gerrymandering “works” because the party in power creates the districts so as to encompass as many people who voted for them in the last election in one bunch.

And, whether or not she is “anti-coal mining,” Paula Swearingen seems very much pro-coal miner. Here’s a bit of her stump speech: PAULA SWEARINGEN: I was born in West Virginia, and I was born a coal minert’s daughter, grand-daughter… and in West Virginia, you are told to live, breathe, eat, literally coal. We’re told that coal defines us. So as a little girl I was proud of my coal heritage. I was proud to be the coal miner’s daughter. But as I watched the progression of what coal did to my family, I wasn’t so proud any more. My grandfather spent 45 years in the coal mines, and I watched him suffocate to death. My father served in the military in Korea, and he was a coal miner, and he had cancer and I watched him suffocate. My step father has heart disease. He’s had open heart surgery. And he gets up every morning and he suffers. But that was only the beginning of what I learned about the suffering in Appalachia… Is there any coal mining family that won’t relate to that? Sen. Sanders won all 55 of West Virginia’s counties in the Democratic primary. At that town hall in March in McDowell County, West Virginia, he was cheered by an audience of almost all Trump voters. I would not rule out Paula Swearingen, who is more closely aligned policy-wise with Sanders than with the establishment Democrats, Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 6:59 pm The Swearingen experiment deserves to be run. If certain side-effects of coal mining . . . the disease, the broadacre land destruction, the water destruction . . . are not popular with people who suffer from them, then Swearingen might get some votes from people affected by those certain side-effects of coal mining. Reply ↓ Carla May 19, 2017 at 4:24 pm “That was solid, union member, working class Democrat country. Dems losing it meant the voters stopped seeing them as for the unions and working class.” The failure was not on the part of voters. Here, let me fix the second sentence for you: “Dems losing it meant voters realized the party had abandoned unions and the working class.” That’s what happened. Why not say so?

Reply ↓ Kim Kaufman May 19, 2017 at 4:40 pm Lifted from facebook friend: “Special counsel Robert Mueller was working at a law firm (Wilmer Hale) which represents Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, as well as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. So, despite Mueller’s credibility as well as the fact that he just resigned his law firm position to accept the appointment, doesn’t this STILL seem like a partisan Trump political appointment…. AND don’t we STILL need a truly independent investigation into any Trump campaign ties to the Russians?” The same conflicts of interest will be brought up with Lieberman’s present employer Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman but everyone’s mum on Mueller. Not a great article but details some of the unsavory cases Kasowitz has handled for Trump: http://www.politicususa.com/2017/05/19/employed-donald-trumps-favorite-law-firms-joe-lieberman-run-fbi.html Wtf?

And regarding this – …AND don’t we STILL need a truly independent investigation into any Trump campaign ties to the Russians? Tell your friend that no, we don’t. Multiple intelligence sources have stated on the record that there’s really nothing to see here and no evidence of illegality. It’s all the off the record spooks spreading rumors and insinuations. If they had anything on him, we’d have heard about it by now. Know what I want to know? Whatever happened to all those women who brought accusations of sexual impropriety against Trump just before the election?!!??!?!?!? You’d think all the pussy hats would be screaming about that but it’s been crickets since election day. Makes one wonder if that was all just more Clinton-fabricated bul**hit too.

More likely, though, Trump knows that Flynn could sink his son-in-law. I believe that’s why Trump had to fire Comey in an effort to undercut the Flynn investigation. And Rod Rosenstein, the survivor, just picked a partner from the firm of Kushner and Ivanka’s lawyer Jamie Gorelick, Robert Mueller, to take over the investigation into Flynn. Update: Sure enough, Reuters is reporting that Mueller, by design, may not be able to investigate Kushner or Paul Manafort. Within hours of Mueller’s appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm’s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said. An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Mueller’s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said.” Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 9:03 pm What is the significance of that meeting with a Russian bank executive (presumably not tied to Putin, otherwise, that would have been a major omission by the author)? Because Russian? Or Because bank executive? Reply ↓ Kim Kaufman May 19, 2017 at 10:27 pm I think it’s about the omission of disclosing it, for one thing. Otherwise who knows where this is going and where it will wind up. Reply ↓ gepay May 20, 2017 at 6:58 pm Since the Russian ties are a bogus proposition it doesn’t matter what Mueller does in that regard. what matters is who is he really working for?

I just got rejected for another job after a phone interview … sigh, and I”m thinking there’s no shortage of people – there’s a huge oversupply of people and a shortage of jobs. If there were a shortage of people, employers could not just reject anyone at will. The situation would look like the Golden Age of capitalism or the tech sector in the 1990s where they would have to pay more and take people on even without as much experience as they liked. Employers want a person with years of experience, low ball them, and give them insecure employment. That’s what this is about. I’d be interested to see the decline in job quality in the US and Canada. Is anyone else reading NC struggling to find work? One other note, the jobs are paying significantly less than the jobs that existed before the recession. Real wages appear to be in decline and even nominal wages may be in decline in many sectors. Noticeably absent in the discussion is that the very rich are waging class warfare on the rest of the world. They are trying to enrich themselves at the expense of literally anyone else. The rich are really playing with fire here. The reason why such anti-immigration sentiment exists is because they keep demanding more immigration, when there are job shortages in the existing market. Oh and the Democrats are trying to ride it out. https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/weathering-the-storm-democratic-leadership-is-play.html Oh and Nancy Pelosi opposes universal healthcare. https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/nancy-pelosis-aversion-to-single-payer-may-cost-he.html This is just plain messed up. Reply ↓ cocomaan May 19, 2017 at 5:59 pm Hang in there, friend. You’ll find something. Every single institution I encounter these days seems to have no money. My state? Can’t balance the budget, is cutting all over the place. My workplace? No guarantee of a cost of living adjustment this year. My wife’s institution? Same thing. My brother’s healthcare institution? Riding completely by the seat of their pants. There’s a great big hole in the economy through which all our money is flowing. Marx talked about it: Finally, in the same measure in which the capitalists are compelled, by the movement described above, to exploit the already existing gigantic means of production on an ever-increasing scale, and for this purpose to set in motion all the mainsprings of credit, in the same measure do they increase the industrial earthquakes, in the midst of which the commercial world can preserve itself only by sacrificing a portion of its wealth, its products, and even its forces of production, to the gods of the lower world – in short, the crises increase. They become more frequent and more violent, if for no other reason, than for this alone, that in the same measure in which the mass of products grows, and therefore the needs for extensive markets, in the same measure does the world market shrink ever more, and ever fewer markets remain to be exploited, since every previous crisis has subjected to the commerce of the world a hitherto unconquered or but superficially exploited market. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 19, 2017 at 6:22 pm Thanks for the words of encouragement. Agree with the problem of every institution having no money these days. Apart from the rich, who often pay a lower effective tax rate, fewer people have taxable income these days that governments can raise. By extension there’s no money for everything else funded by taxes. Businesses feel the pinch with the decline in demand. Those collapses in the restaurant industry, auto industry, retail, etc I think are all caused by a fall in aggregate demand. The neoliberal order is its own worst enemy. Even for those who don’t agree with Marx’s solutions, I think that his criticisms of capitalism have a very good point. An Eastern European fellow once noted that only after the collapse of the Soviet Union did they realize that Marx had valid criticisms of capitalism.

I think these stories are complete mularky because of how the labor force is defined. From BLS (https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm): What are the basic concepts of employment and unemployment? The basic concepts involved in identifying the employed and unemployed are quite simple: People with jobs are employed. People who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work are unemployed. The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed. People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force. The labor force only consists of people with jobs or actively looking. We may have a low unemployment rate according to this metric, but it fails to describe the huge reserve army of labor that exists in this country: Just think of all the housewives and househusbands who are filling those roles because they either can’t get a job or can’t get a job that pays good enough to offset the cost of daycare? Or how about the people out in flyover who had the town factory close down who aren’t on a payroll or looking for a formal job but do some odd jobs for cash to make ends meet? Or the legions of petty drug dealers who are eeking out a living selling dime bags and 20 sacks? They’re not in the labor force either but the minute retail pay exceeds petty drug dealer pay (not much: http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/24/opinion/oe-dubner24) they’ll be looking for jobs too? The bottom line is there is no shortage of warm bodies available to work and I think that is definitely a factor in what’s keeping salaries in the toilet and enabling crapification. Furthermore, I think crapification serves to keep the labor force metric artificially small as it encourages folks to say “eff it, I’m done. I’d rather do some handyman crap and sell some pot on the side to pay my rent rather than suffer in the Tesla factory for slightly more $$$.” As of right now I don’t think the squillionaires have anything to fear from a civil disturbance so long as the lights are on, the people are fed, they control the major propaganda organs and the state security apparatus remains loyal. As for the future, things can go very wrong for team squillionaire if they fail in any of these areas, as in 1989-1991 USSR very wrong. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 20, 2017 at 11:59 am I think that Trump’s election is a sign that the elite are starting to finally and at long last lose legitimacy.

Oversupply of applicants and shortage of decent jobs is my impression too. Working class and poor are already well screwed. Seems we’ve moved into territory where many professionals and the highly educated are also disposable; say like the post Soviet Russia era where looting became a genuine art form. Reply ↓ Octopii May 20, 2017 at 11:05 am Three men in my immediate family are unemployed and have not been able to find work for an extended period of time. Six months for my brother, over a year for my brother in law, and my father in law gave up and retired after several years of looking. All these guys are 40+ and they blame ageism. Their wives are employed and are carrying the family load, working long hours, two out of three in positions that pay much less than the men had earned. BIL is working part time retail selling bikes while he tries to start his own business (with no capital, yes, that should end well). Nobody except the oldest guy was able to save much of a cushion, and those cushions are long gone. On the other hand, everyone I know here in DC is working, busting their tail and doing pretty well. I myself just got hired quite easily for a great job and and am shutting the doors on my small business. Cause of death is benefits costs, pure and simple, meaning healthcare. I’m also getting worried about general stability and ageism, and am sacrificing some freedom to get in with a large employer now, hoping to get more current with some of the changes in my industry so as to stay employable.

A 34% decline in real income (Source: Ravi Batra’s “Greenspan’s Fraud”). This is saying something in a country where half the population gets by on $4 or less a day. The only comparable decline in the U.S. was in the Great Depression. Of course nobody migrated then….oh wait! One might figure that shipping a bunch of subsidized corn down south would put lots of Mexican subsistence corn farmers out of business. After all, corn is only arguably the most important food crop in the world, and they were keeping the diversity of the corn genome alive, but they weren’t making any money for Monsanto! NAFTA was so unpopular in Mexico that the Harvard-educated Mexican president who proposed it–Carlos Salinas Gotari–retired to Ireland for a few years so the furor would die down, and presumably to be safe from the pitchforks and tar.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com E-Tail Shipping Price War Escalates for Target, Wal-Mart, Amazon By Anne DInnocenzio PUBLISHED: MAY 20 2017 Target, Wal-Mart and Amazon are engaged in a game of shipping tag, each trying to adjust their free threshold and other shipping strategies to a level that can lure shoppers away from one of the other. Minneapolis-based Target has the furthest to go as it tries to put itself in better competition with Amazon, the undisputed online leader, and Wal-Mart, which has been buying online startups to beef up its own operations. Target has announced plans to put more money into both its online operations and its stores, and saw it online sales rise 22 percent for the first quarter. That was a slowdown from 34 percent in the fourth quarter, though. With shoppers overall less and less willing to wait for their items to arrive, figuring out a shipping strategy that will encourage people to buy more and also drive shoppers to its stores will be a key element for Target. Amazon "has a model of getting shoppers to order and having it show up in two days and is working to make it less than two days," said Tim Laseter, a partner at PwC. "There is no doubt that the general expectation is faster and cheaper." But he noted that Target and Wal-Mart can take advantage of their stores in this game as they increasingly cater to customers. Target has been pushing on a lot of fronts, from readjusting free shipping thresholds to planning to test a new same-day service at a store in Manhattan. "We believe that the future of retail is both digital and physical, and successful retailers will need to provide an outstanding experience in both," Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan told investors on Wednesday. Target had quietly raised its free shipping threshold to $35 from $25 this month, going in the opposite direction of Wal-Mart and Amazon. Asked about that move Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Kathy R. Smith said that very few online orders are below $35. But she said, "We will always evaluate." Wal-Mart had lowered its bar to $35 from $50 earlier this year and scrapped its program called SavingsPass that offered free shipping but had an annual fee. It also cut its shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items, including essentials like diapers and pet food as well as some toys and electronics. Wal-Mart's average shipping time has been three to five days. For Amazon's non-Prime members, the shipping time is five to eight days. Typical Target deliveries arrive in three to six days. The strategy shift was one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when the Bentonville, Arkansas-based chain bought online retailer Jet.com last year. In April, Wal-Mart also began offering discounts on thousands of online-only items when customers elect to have them shipped to one of the company's stores for pickup -- cheaper for the company than delivering to people's homes. Wal-Mart plans to expand the price cuts to more than a million items by the end of June. The company will be reporting its first-quarter results on Thursday. In the fourth quarter, Wal-Mart had a 29 percent increase in online sales, but the growth was on a bigger base of sales. Amazon.com, which had reduced the free shipping threshold for its non-Prime members to $35 from $49 following Wal-Mart's move, has lowered it again to $25. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that on average Amazon customers indicated they spend $800 annually on the site and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than non-Prime members and receive 2.5 times more shipments per year. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said in a recent report, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market compared to Amazon's 3 percent is "reasonable." Target is also testing a program called Restock that would let its REDcard customers order household essentials like laundry detergent, paper towels and peanut butter and have them delivered to their homes the next day. The service, being tested with employees for now, is similar to Amazon Pantry, which charges $5.99 -- but the Amazon delivery is not expedited. Target plans to expand the test to its loyalty card members in Minneapolis this summer. "Target Restock is a great start for Target to regain customers lost to Amazon, but Target may look to expand its efforts within Restock to the category of apparel" because of how important clothing is to Target's focus on style, said Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at the Magid consulting firm. He says it's "a next logical step for an initiative desperately needed at Target." Target is also preparing to launch a same-day delivery service at a store in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan. Customers can choose a delivery window to have their orders delivered to their homes later that day. Amazon says Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive their orders the same day or the next with same-day delivery or one-day shipping, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 major cities can get tens of thousands of items for superfast, one-hour and free two-hour delivery. More than a year ago, Wal-Mart partnered with ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft to test same-day grocery deliveries in Phoenix and Denver. It's also testing same-day delivery service with Deliv at Sam's Club in Miami. Given the competition, CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday that Target will be thinking about new ways to offer different services. Cornell said the company is "working right now to think about the next phase of loyalty and how we continue to leverage the REDcard to build even a stronger relationship with our guests." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Share this article Share 40 shares Who is Alisher Usmanov? Alisher Usmanov is a metals magnate from Uzbekistan, although he has primarily been based in Russia. He was the 37th-richest person in the world as of 2013 and the second richest in the UK circa 2014. His fortune is estimated to be worth $15.1bn (£11.5bn). He owns 60 per cent of USM Holdings, which works in metals, mining, telecommunications, technology and media, along with a stake in Mail.ru, which is the largest internet provider in the Russian speaking world. Usmanov is thought to be a close friend of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Usmanov is a metals magnate from Uzbekistan and is the world's 37th-richest person (in 2013) What about Stan Kroenke?  Stan Kroenke is an American businessman who began his business life by founding the Kroenke Group in 1983, which focused on real estate. It built shopping centres and apartment buildings. In 1974 he married Ann Walton, who is one of the heiresses to the Wal-Mart fortune. In 1995 his wealth increased when they inherited a stake in Wal-Mart Stores when James Walton, the co-founder of the company, passed away. Kroenke then invested in several teams over the next 15 years, buying the St Louis Rams, the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and a series of smaller sides. Majority owner Stan Kroenke is an American businessman who owns several sports teams Who are Arsenal currently owned by? The club are currently split between Usmanov and majority shareholder Kroenke. Kroenke owns 67.05 per cent of Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings PLC, while Usmanov has managed to acquire 30.05 over the past few years. When did Kroenke first invest in Arsenal? His MLS side the Colorado Rapids already had a link-up with Arsenal when he bought 9.9 per cent of the club from Granada Ventures in 2007. Kroenke bought further shares, rising to 12.19 per cent that year. By 2008 he had control of the voting rights after purchasing 18,594 shares (29.9 per cent of the club).  He then reached 62.89 per cent ownership of the north London side by buying the segments of the club owned by Danny Fiszman and Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith. Kroenke's initial investment was when his Colorado Rapids had a link-up with Arsenal in 2007 And when did Usmanov buy into Arsenal?  The Uzbek-businessman bought 14.58 per cent in 2007 along with business partner and now-Everton owner Farhad Moshiri. That segment was sold by former vice-chairman David Dein. They then increased their shareholding to 24 per cent in 2008 and there was speculation that their company Red and White Holdings would attempt to become the club's largest shareholder. But while they increased their stake to 30 per cent - including buying shares from Scottish club Rangers - after Kroenke's own increase, they never made moves to push further until now.  Now-Everton owner Farhad Moshiri (pictured) bought into Arsenal with Usmanov in 2007 also What would a purchase mean for Arsene Wenger? In the eyes of many fans, there is a distinct tie between Kroenke and Wenger remaining in the job. At points it has seemed as though the American is more interested in profit than honours, but sources close to him denied those suggestions and said he was keen to see the side become Premier League winners. Usmanov suggested the 'current politics of the club's management' were responsible for a lack of trophies in 2012 and criticised the sale of Robin van Persie the same year. While it would not necessarily mean the end of Wenger, it would upset the apple cart slightly.  In the eyes of many fans, there is a distinct tie between Kroenke and Wenger staying in the job  Why is the club worth so much money? Because, like every Premier League side, it makes so much money. An offer to buy the entire club in 2011 from Kroenke valued it at £731M. Since then, the value has skyrocketed. This is, in part, due to the Premier League's boosted broadcast revenue and the general increase in the value of clubs across the league. But Arsenal are also no longer burdened by the cost of moving to the Emirates Stadium and are easily one of the most valuable clubs in the league.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SHAWNEE, Kan. – Jesse Rice's job is to sell meat in the grocery department of a Kansas City Wal-Mart store. But ask him what he does and you'll hear him sell himself as well as his employer. He'll tell you how he uses the retailer's "My Productivity" tool to help with cross merchandising — to, say, pull buns from the bread shelves and display them next to the hot dogs and hamburger meat in grilling season, but not at Easter when hams get pride of place. "I strive for excellence," Rice said. "We want the customers to come in and find everything they need. And if they have questions, we want everyone to be there, to be able to help them." Wal-Mart officials insist that Rice wasn't coached to say that. It could well be that there's no faking the enthusiasm of a young man who's a couple of days into the new Wal-Mart Academy, a training program that by the end of 2017 will have reached a quarter million employees of the world's largest retailer. For Rice, the meat department isn't just a low-wage or temporary job. He intends to one day become a store manager and, beyond that, a market manager supervising multiple stores. All of the dozen front-line hourly supervisors or department managers recently grouped around a training table in the back of the Shawnee, Kan., Wal-Mart store may not share Rice's thoughts or goals, but for a few days they were captive to a concentrated Wal-Mart effort, new this year, to infuse consistency across its massive retail landscape. "Retail is changing," said Erica Jones, a Wal-Mart public relations person from the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. "The way customers shop is changing. We need to provide our associates more tools to keep up with the times." While the company slows down store expansion to invest in remodeling and raising employee pay, it also is establishing dedicated training sites in select stores across the country, 100 so far and 200 by the end of the year. Ian Markley, one of 17 trainers at the Shawnee academy, wears a headset and carries an electronic device around the training room. Lesson information is synced onto the trainees' individual screens or projected on a wall-mounted screen. In another room, facilitator Nichole Um­scheid leads a class through a "replenishment cycle" exercise. She reminds them that Wal-Mart's computer systems do 90 percent of inventory ordering automatically, but "you may need to do about 10 percent manually." What if a forecast ice storm depletes the bread aisle or the ice-melt supplies? It's still too early for the company to know if these exercises truly help in motivating or retaining workers. The Wal-Mart Academies debuted in February 2016 for top store managers only. In October, assistant store managers, Wal-Mart's first level of salaried management, began cycling through. There's an incentive for completion: Starting pay is $9 an hour, but it jumps to $10 when the 90-day foundation program is finished. Some of the training includes unabashed cheerleading. There's a yellow and blue graphic on the floor that leads from the training rooms to the retail floor. Walk the path and read: "From this day forward, I solemnly promise & declare that every time a customer comes within 10 feet of me. I will SMILE. LOOK them in the eye. And GREET them. So Help Me, Sam." View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart Stores E-Commerce Sales Surge 63% The retail titan's online growth accelerated sharply in the first quarter. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) May 19, 2017 at 6:14PM Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2018 first-quarter results on May 19. The retail giant's e-commerce strategy is gaining momentum, boosted by recent acquisitions and a renewed focus on its online operations. Wal-Mart Stores results: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $117.542 billion $115.904 billion 1.4% Operating income $5.237 billion $5.275 billion (0.7%) Earnings per share $1.00 $0.98 2% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores Q1 2018 earnings press release. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. What happened with Wal-Mart Stores this quarter? Total revenue rose 1.4% to $117.5 billion, and 2.5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales -- excluding the impact of fuel prices -- edged up 1.4%, driven by a 1.5% increase in traffic. Fueling these results was a staggering 69% surge in Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales. The retailer moved aggressively in August to acquire fast-growing e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and soon after installed Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore as head of its U.S. e-commerce business. Since that time, Wal-Mart has scooped up several other online retailers, including ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and women's apparel seller ModCloth. Wal-Mart is also reportedly in talks to buy e-commerce apparel company Bonobos. Yet CEO Doug McMillon says that these acquisitions have only supplemented Wal-Mart's strong organic e-commerce growth: The acquisitions have received a lot of attention but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. E-commerce sales growth at Walmart U.S. was 63%, the company reported, with the majority organic through Walmart.com. McMillon went on to note that Wal-Mart.com continues to ramp up its selection of goods, and now has 50 million items for consumers to choose from compared to 10 million a year ago. Additionally, Wal-Mart recently introduced free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more, and launched a new service that allows customers to order products online and receive a discount for picking them up at its stores. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers," said McMillon during Wal-Mart's earnings call. Those efforts appear to be succeeding, as evidenced by Wal-Mart's explosive online growth and steady in-store traffic gains. Still, the investments Wal-Mart is making in its digital and store-improvement initiatives are weighing on its margins; first-quarter operating income fell 0.7% year over year to $5.2 billion. Despite the lower profits, Wal-Mart's cash generation remains strong, with the retail titan generating $5.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter. That -- combined with the more than $6.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet -- allowed Wal-Mart to return $3.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Looking forward For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable-store sales growth (excluding fuel) of 1.5% to 2% for its U.S. locations and 1% to 1.5% at its Sam's Club locations. The company also anticipates earnings per share will be between $1.00 and $1.08. "We're encouraged with our start to the year," added McMillon. "We have momentum across the business. We're making progress and we know we're on the right track." Joe Tenebruso has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Plus, why Wal-Mart looks well positioned, and Cisco looks pricey. Securities mentioned in this video CSCO Cisco Systems Inc WMT Wal-Mart Stores Inc TGT Target Corp Related Links Do You Have a Strategy for Volatility? Cisco’s Software Focus Sound; Shares Still Not Cheap Multiyear Transition Underway at Target Jeremy Glaser: Stocks take a midweek dive; retailers report; and Cisco's guidance disappoints. This time on the Morningstar Weekly Wrap. After months of a sometimes eerily calm market, volatility returned with a vengeance on Wednesday, with the biggest decline of the year over political worries. A decline like this is not a time to panic, but as Christine Benz points out in an article this week, it can be a good time for reflection. Is your asset allocation still reasonable? Does your financial plan really have the risk capacity to handle a short- or medium-term decline in equity prices? Do you personally have the tolerance for it? And, of course, always keep in mind that declines in prices also open up attractive entry points for investors, something that's been in short supply recently. Wal-Mart and Target both reported this week, and analyst John Brick gave us his take. John Brick: Wal-Mart and Target both reported earnings which are better than expected this quarter. However, over the coming years, we see diverging storylines, and recommend investors look at Wal-Mart over Target. So, to Target first. We think that they are undergoing necessary changes that capture e-commerce and digital sales, however, a high proportion of their sales are higher margin, which, in this increasingly e-commerce and digital world, have more price transparency. Secondly, we don't think that they are done investing in their business, which will ultimately constrain margins and shareholder returns. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, had a great quarter. We saw them beat numbers, but we also saw a 63% organic e-commerce sales growth which was above our estimate of 30%, and Target's 22% just a day ago. We also think that they are better positioned to withstand the competitive pressures coming into the U.S., as Aldi and Lidl enter the market over the coming years. Glaser: Cisco shares declined after reporting results this week. Analyst Ilya Kundozerov still doesn't see the shares as cheap. Ilya Kundozerov: Cisco reported third-quarter 2017 earnings, roughly in line with our expectations, but the company issued downbeat top-line guidance, expecting 4% to 6% decline over the next quarter. The company's switching business along with the wireless and security business were positive in the quarter, but we think that the company remains challenged in its core hardware business, primarily switching routing and data center. So we think the company's on the right path by building up the portfolio of software products, and we think that's the right strategy for the company, and we expect Cisco to continue on the same path over the next couple of years. With that said, we still see Cisco shares as a little bit overvalued compared to our $28 fair value estimate. Glaser: And in case you missed it on Morningstar.com this week, Ben Johnson looked at how investor returns differ for passive and active funds.

But the market has stalled. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is keeping drone technology bottled up in the U.S. while it continues to move forward in Asia and Europe. The opportunities for drones are real. Oil companies, electric power utilities, and mobile operators are already using drones to inspect vital infrastructure. Companies including Amazon, Domino’s, and Walmart are serious about putting drones into wider use. Everyone agrees that the industry must prove that drones are safe before they are allowed to deliver small packages to homes. But there is reason to believe that it can be done: Every day in the U.S. there are more than 23,000 commercial airline flights carrying well over 1 million passengers. For now, the drone market is in a holding pattern. Several drone makers laid off workers over the last 12 months. The FAA recently reported that drone registrations are averaging about 8,300 per week. However, the forecast cited by the FAA in its 2017 annual report would require average weekly sales of more than 23,000 drones. Many drone companies have tied their fate to a glacial FAA process that could be leading them down a blind alley. While many in the tech press (which moved sharply to the left during the Obama years) blame the layoffs on the growing dominance of Chinese drone maker DJI, Wall Street Journal columnist Gordon Crovitz points out that it was excessive FAA regulation that allowed a Chinese company to run away with the market ("While Amazon Waits, Drones Fly"). The demise of Flytenow offers further evidence that the FAA is an obstacle to innovation. Flytenow operated a flight-sharing website for private pilots, enabling them to offer rides to the public to help defray expenses. The FAA contended that when pilots offer rides online they become common carriers, forcing Flytenow to shut down. Finding a way Forward The biggest challenge confronting the drone industry today isn’t safety -- it’s politics. Apparently, we have become so accustomed to federal agencies riding herd over businesses that no one batted an eye when Congress passed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which appointed the FAA to oversee the emerging drone industry. That action was a mistake for two reasons. First, the FAA primarily manages large manned aircraft that fly long distances and cruise at high altitudes (typically around 30,000 feet). Commercial drones are small and mainly fly short distances at low altitudes (below 500 feet). While the FAA should retain the authority to keep drones at a safe distance from manned aircraft, the FAA has neither the motivation nor the skills to shepherd an emerging tech industry. Second, the FAA’s mission is to ensure safe air travel. Given that most passenger flights are interstate or even international, it makes sense for the FAA to apply one set of rules to the entire country. In contrast, one-size-fits-all rules do not make sense for drones used in environments as diverse as rural Wyoming and New York City. State and local governments -- in consultation with local citizens, users, and businesses -- should determine when and where the benefits of drone use outweigh the risks. Despite the apparent good intentions of Chief Administrator Michael Huerta, who publicly called for his agency to be more flexible and “stop moving at the speed of government,” it took the FAA more than four years to create the first rules for small unmanned aircraft. Up until mid-2016, using drones for business purposes in the U.S. was actually illegal, though the FAA began issuing waivers on a case-by-case basis in 2014. The new Part 107 Rules were supposed to open the floodgates to commercial use of drones. In practice, the rules merely codified the uses that were already being granted waivers. The rules reduced the FAA examiners’ workload, but did almost nothing to spur business use. A quick look at the restrictions contained in the Part 107 Rules reveals why. Drones may not be operated beyond line of sight of the operator, at night, or over people not directly involved in the drone’s operation. That means that drones still can’t be used to examine crop fields on a large farm, patrol a private facility at night looking for intruders, or transport small items between facilities several blocks apart without first obtaining special permission from the FAA. Nor are the restrictions likely to be relaxed anytime soon. None of this is to suggest that the FAA should have no role in the drone industry. The FAA should remain in charge of keeping drones away from restricted areas such as airports. Otherwise, the FAA could serve as a resource to the states rather than as a national gatekeeper, developing airworthiness guidelines, providing operator training, and helping to field-test new solutions. Lately there has been much talk in the tech industry about flying cars and small electric aircraft with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability. Proponents say these new forms of air transportation could help alleviate automobile traffic congestion in and around major cities. That’s precisely the kind of thing that gets inventors and entrepreneurs excited. However, if we are going to allow commercial air taxi service for people by 2025 as proposed by Uber, then shouldn’t we figure out much sooner how to permit drone delivery of small packages?

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

In a Facebook post, now deleted, a mother accused the Walmart-owned supermarket of perpetuating "damaging stereotypes". According to The Independent, the mum wrote that the jumper was problematic because it suggested that men could get away with offensive and misogynistic behaviour, and that it promoted that notion from an early age. OUR ORIGINAL STORY: Do you think this £4 boys' jumper from Asda is offensive? Have your say on our poll The woman started her post by saying: "Quite literally gobsmacked and raging to see this in Asda. She added: "Look, I get it. Most people say this and don't mean any harm by it. But boys having their behaviour excused like this from an early age – this message of being above the rules, it sticks. "It also implies that boys have no impulse control. Boys are perfectly capable of respecting people and property." But many Derby people think her stance demonstrates that "the world's gone mad". They responded in their droves to the story. Hundreds took part in our online poll and the story prompted more than 150 comments on our Facebook page and website. It was clear that the general feeling among most people was that there was nothing wrong with the jumper and the criticism of the slogan was crazy. SHOPPING NEWS: Derby shoppers using Asda, Aldi, Morrisons and Tesco warned of product recalls In our online poll, 48.9% said the whole row was absurd, 46.5% said the jumper was not offensive and 3.6% agreed that the jumper was offensive. Most people's feelings were erphaps best summed up by Ann Everton, who wrote on our Facebook page: "Absolutely sick of all this gender stuff and being politically correct. At the end of the day, a boy is a boy, a girl is a girl, a man is a man and a woman is a woman. "I have no problem if they want to change their gender but leave everything else alone. I am a woman and I am not offended by being called a woman . The world is going mad!" And Stephanie Southwell said the jumpers had been proving popular in Derby. She wrote on our Facebook page: "I work for George and it has sold really well in Sinfin [at the Asda superstore] and nobody's complained about it to me. SHOPPING NEWS: The classy Matalan £45 dress that looks like one worn by stars "It's just a jumper for toddlers. It's up to the parents to buy clothes. If you don't like it, walk past. A small child does not understand the concept sexist or read into it." Nick Fry added: "I'm only offended by people who find it offensive. Ridiculous, I don't know if she noticed but boys are actually different to girls, just a simple physiological difference that no amount of legislation can change." Maureen Hearn had this to say: Oh, for crying out loud, get a life and stop moaning. Are we so pathetic now that we can't say anything as a joke? I was so lucky to be born in the 1940s before political correctness went mad and we had common sense." DREAMING OF A NEW JOB? Check out our brilliant jobs website Roy Whittall added: "It is a sweatshirt. I wonder what would be said if it said girls will be girls?" However one reader had this to say on our website: "It's quite simple folks. The slogan is one which will encourage the male of our species to believe that it's OK to get up to shenanigans and ignore the consequences. "People often post on here about male criminal activity but this sort of thing allows young men and boys to believe that their behaviour is somehow easily excused. And it is not, surely?"

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Image Gallery for Volunteerism on full display during annual Day of Caring Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link POTTSVILLE — It turned out to be a great day to help the community Friday for the annual Capt. Jason B. Jones Memorial Day of Caring. “It was one of the best days that we had. The weather was great,” said Kelly Malone, executive director of Schuylkill United Way, which hosted the event. More than 500 people took part in the event named after Jones, who died June 2, 2014, near Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in a small arms fight. Volunteers worked at 20 sites around Schuylkill County, including the Schuylkill YMCA, Boy Scouts Hawk Mountain Council camp, Avenues, Child Development and the Borough of Orwigsburg, Jones’ hometown. “Jason would be very proud. There were a lot of people who worked very hard,” Malone said. The Day of Caring held Friday was part of a bigger project of volunteerism in the county. Earlier work included painting and landscaping at the Salvation Army by volunteers from Alfred Benesch & Co., and placing flags for Memorial Day at a cemetery in Cressona by elementary students in the Blue Mountain School District. On Friday, students from Pottsville Area High School teamed with employees from Wal-Mart Distribution Center 7030 at Highridge Business Park to clean up at Avenues, a human service organization in Pottsville. Joel Kislan, a maintenance worker at Wal-Mart who lives in Lebanon County, said volunteering was a worthwhile cause. Along with five other volunteers, he completed projects around the extensive grounds, such as removing cracked cement from the first step on the outside building. It had caution tape around it to prevent people from using it. Seth Hayes, a maintenance manager at Wal-Mart, installed a new outside receptacle box. The electrical components were weathered and rusted despite having a cover. Two community service groups from Pottsville Area, Tau Kappa Delta and Alpha Iota Delta, spruced up the inside and outside of Avenues. Ryan Kalinich, 19, of Pottsville, a member of Tau Kappa Delta, was working up a sweat while raking mulch on the playground area. He said giving back was the right thing to do. Sophie Murray, 16, of Pottsville, a member of Alpha Iota Delta, ripped up damaged carpet with the help of fellow students Liliana Golden, Hannah Sponeburg and Hannah Evans, all 17 and of Pottsville. Dorothy “Dottie” Botto, Pottsville councilwoman and manager of children’s services at Avenues, was thankful for the assistance. “This is a great help to all of us,” she said. At the Schuylkill YMCA in Pottsville, volunteers completed a variety of tasks, such as painting, moving furniture and hanging a shelf. Alicia Ellix, program director, said they appreciate the help, as these chores could have taken the YMCA staff weeks to finish. Brad Frank, operations manager at Lowe’s Distribution Center at Highridge Business Park, said everyone was happy to volunteer. “These guys work hard every day,” Frank said about the staff at the YMCA. About 250 third-grade students at John S. Clarke Elementary Center did their part to help out the environment by picking up trash along the JFK Walking Trail near the JFK Pool. The children also wrote letters to service members and veterans. Allie Andrews, director of community relations for Schuylkill United Way, told the children they are making a good impact in their community. Precious Finken, 10, of Pottsville, said she was volunteering to keep the community clean, while Eden Adams, 9, of Pottsville, said he wanted to help so the world didn’t get “too dirty.” Bella Major, 9, of Pottsville, said she was also volunteering to keep Schuylkill County a little cleaner. “It makes me feel good to help,” she said.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Cellairis has stepped up to the challenge, offering fast, affordable repairs on iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices at their many locations across the country. They now have a store in Coventry, in the Walmart on New England Boulevard, giving local residents a convenient place for mobile device and computer repair. In the past, cell phones were often replaced instead of repaired. That has changed with the popularity of smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. According to a Pew Research Center study in 2015, smartphone use by adults has increased 35% since 2011. It is estimated that about two-thirds of adults with cell phones use a smartphone. Many use their smartphones for their only phone, making it vital to get it repaired or replaced when it is damaged. Since the cost of these phones is high, stores like Cellairis that offer iPhone repairs at an affordable price have become a necessity. Taki Skouras, the co-founder and CEO of Cellairis, is not surprised at how quickly the trend of repairing smartphones has increased over the past few years. He points out, “People want a reasonable option to repair instead of replace expensive phones like the iPhone. We can fix their iPhone or iPad in just a quick trip to our store, keeping them connected without the high cost of buying a new phone.” Skouras also says, “We want to make cell phone and tablet repair quick and convenient. That is why we open stores in locations where our customers already shop, like our new store in the Coventry Walmart.” Coventry residents can now have their iPhones and iPads repaired the same day, or bring their PC or Mac in for a fast repair or data transfer. Cellairis also offers a large selection of popular accessories for mobile devices, right at their new location at the Coventry Walmart. For more information about Cellairis and the device repair franchise, or to find out if a Cellairis repair center is coming to your nearest Walmart store, please email mgann(at)cellairis(dot)com or visit cellairis.com.  About Cellairis Cellairis has franchises throughout the United States including multiple franchises in the greater Coventry area. Their device repair centers are committed to providing fast turnaround times and guaranteed repairs on iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy and other electronic devices. In most instances, mobile devices are repaired the same day, while you wait. From premium fashionable cases and accessories to expert device repair services, Cellairis holds a reputation for exceptional customer service and top quality workmanship. Cellairis also buys and sells used iPhones and iPads for cash.

However, these stores might not be the best places to buy groceries on a budget. Instead, your local grocery chain or supermarket might be dishing up the best prices on everything from organic food to alcohol. "If you were to compare the everyday low pricing of Walmart and similar discount stores, their prices are generally lower than a grocery store's regular price," said Stephanie Nelson of CouponMom.com. "However, grocery stores focus on highlighting a select number of sale items in their weekly ads, which may be 50 percent off the regular price." Typically, grocery store sale items last only a few weeks, which is why "strategic shoppers stock up on grocery store sale items during those weeks and know not to pay full price," said Nelson. Click ahead for a closer look at some of the best grocery store deals that beat tend to beat the prices at Target and Walmart: Produce © Aldi If you aren't making it to the farmers market for your weekly roundup of fresh produce, ALDI needs to be on your radar — not Target or Walmart. "ALDI's fruit and vegetables are usually the lowest price compared to other grocers, and they rate as good quality — especially if you shop early mornings when stock is full to choose from," said Brent Shelton of FatWallet.com. In his experience, Shelton has seen ALDI prices that are roughly 10 percent to 20 percent lower than prices at Walmart, Dollar General, Kroger and Save-A-Lot.

Organic Food © Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com You might want to make your way to Trader Joe's for organic fare, since the chain typically has better deals on these items than big-box stores like Target. According to data compiled by Get Healthy U, an online health and fitness resource, a 4.4-ounce tub of organic blueberries will run you $4.99 at Target but only $3.99 at Trader Joe's. Organic baby spinach is $3.49 at Target and only $2.29 at Trader Joe's. And organic peanut butter costs $3.49 at Trader Joe's while Target charges $5.99 for a 16-ounce jar. No matter where you shop, however, make sure you truly are getting the best deals. You can do this by knowing which organic foods are worth the money --and which ones are not. Alcohol  © Aldi Whether you're buying a few bottles of wine or a six-pack of beer, you could save money on alcoholic beverages by sticking with your neighborhood grocery store.  For example, it's hard to beat the $2.99 Charles Shaw "Two Buck Chuck" at Trader Joe's, available in red and white varietals. You can also pick up a bottle of pinot grigio for $5.99 or Lambrusco for $4.99 at Trader Joe's. Meanwhile, Walmart's award-winning malbec retails for just under $7, reports Delish. Many grocery stores also run specials on brand-name beers and new arrivals each week, which means you might get a better deal on six-packs or single bottles without the trip to Walmart or Target. For example (at time of writing), a 24-pack of Budweiser, Miller or Coors is on sale for $17.99 at a Georgia Publix store and a 12-pack of Yuengling beer is just $9.99. Since grocery stores are known to rotate items on sale each week, keep an eye out for coupons and in-store offers at grocery and big-box stores to get the best price. Meat © Aldi Whether you're looking for hamburger meat or chicken, pay attention to weekly sales. Nelson suggested using this smart shopping strategy when buying meat: "Boneless chicken breasts may sell at a grocery store for $4 per pound. Walmart's price may be $3 per pound. However, every other week, major grocery stores like Kroger or Safeway feature a brand of boneless chicken breasts for $2 per pound. Strategic shoppers would stock up on chicken during those weeks and only buy it when it was $2 per pound." Is all that price checking worth the effort? "For my family of four, stocking the freezer with $2 chicken — instead of paying the going rate each week — saves $450 per year," said Nelson. Store Brands © Aldi Although both stores offer generic brands for low prices, Target or Walmart might not be the best place to get store-brand items. For example, a large can of Walmart's Great Value chunk chicken breast costs $2.50 while a premium, flavored variety from Kroger can drop to a sale price of $1.89. And if you're on the hunt for the best prices on gluten-free or organic store brands, head back to ALDI, which is much more budget-friendly than your regular grocery store, said Shelton. In addition to ALDI and Kroger, there are quite a few store brands that can save you money. So before you head out to your local grocery, big-box or even warehouse store, compare your generic options. Baked Goods © Caftor / Shutterstock.com When it comes to cookies, cakes and pies, your sweet indulgences might wreck your diet — but they don't have to empty your wallet. Since freshly baked goods have a short shelf life, your neighborhood grocer might be more likely to mark down items for a quick sale a day or two before their "best by" dates. This saves the stores from throwing the items away. Big-box stores, by contrast, might simply toss outdated items or donate them to a local food bank. Grocery store bakeries also tend to offer more low-priced seasonal goods to meet higher demand and run specials to attract more shoppers. Fourth of July cakes, pumpkin-themed cookies Thanksgiving and Halloween cupcakes are just a few items to keep your eye on during celebration seasons. Check weekly fliers for the latest deals. And, if you're looking for packaged goods, keep this insider's secret in mind: "A good majority of ALDI's pre-packed as private-label products are actually brand products, just repackaged," said Shelton. "So [the] quality is high and [the] price is usually lower than the brands available at regular grocers."

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website five  +   =  fourteen Once again, the hot-button U.S. minimum wage debate is trending across social media platforms. Protesters stage a sit-in protest, blocking the entrance of a Wal-Mart distribution center at a rally for Warehouse Workers Justice, Oct. 1, 2012. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings this morning (May 18) – reminding many that the United States' largest private sector employer is notorious for paying its workers the lowest-possible wage. But what readers need to know about the minimum wage debate – and what you won't hear from the mainstream media – is this: It's irrelevant. Totally… 100%… irrelevant. That's because something far bigger and badder is about to impact minimum wage workers – and no one is talking about it. Why the Minimum Wage Debate Is Obsolete No one, that is, except Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald. He's long followed public discourse on hourly wages and believes the issue, as controversial as it's become, is a red herring. "What people don't understand is the $15 minimum wage argument is irrelevant if a robot has your job," Keith says. According to a January 2017 report from The McKinsey Global Institute entitled "Automation, Employment, and Productivity," the next 20 years are expected to produce a veritable robotics gold rush in America. The report claims the manual labor and customer service industries will be hit especially hard. And because of this shift to workplace robotics, "millions of employees in these sectors could be forced to learn new skills or change career roles entirely over the next two decades," McKinsey claims. Such a shift would wreak havoc on the economy, and Keith predicts that the "robot gold rush" will actually arrive sooner than McKinsey says – much sooner. In fact, one subset of the manual labor sector is already experiencing an automation takeover… The Rise of Big Rig-Driving Robots "Nobody is thinking about all the truck drivers that will be unemployed when there are autonomous trucks," Keith says. "I've been following this information since I've been with Money Map Press. And I think automation-based job losses are only five years away." There's strong evidence to support Keith's robot job-takeover prediction. In fact, the general public saw proof of it last fall… Uber subsidiary Otto’s autonomous driving truck, June 17, 2016. On Oct. 20, 2016, ride-sharing company Uber's subsidiary Otto – a self-driving truck corporation – tested its first-ever autonomous big rig. That day, a driverless semi carried 51,744 cans of Budweiser beer 120 miles across Colorado, from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, reported Trucks.com. The success of this test prompted Daniel Murray, vice president of research at the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), to declare: "On Oct. 19, I was one of the biggest detractors of this technology; [on Oct. 20] I drank the Kool-Aid," according to Trucks.com. Murray went on to explain that, thanks to Otto's successful self-driving truck test, he'd moved his "personal [autonomous truck takeover] timeline" from "15 to 20 years up to five." Murray's prediction matches what Keith's been forecasting. The Tech Industry's Next Great Battleground Unlike Murray, Keith isn't limited to trucking; he's been eyeing the entire tech industry. And the sector is, simply put, on the verge of a profit explosion. The catalysts for this explosion will be what Keith considers "make-or-break" moments for emerging innovation companies. These moments involve "the precise instant in time when [a company] will either become a hero or a zero," he says. For example, the success of Otto's big rig test last October was the company's "make" moment. And as far as tech company "break" moments go, take Lily Robotics – would-be maker of autonomous flying camera drones – as a prime example of an ultimately over-hyped startup's early death… On Feb. 1, Business Insider reported that Lily put the cart before the horse, advertising a product that never really existed. After a year of pushing back the release date, the company closed its doors in January for good. And doing so forced the company to refund $34 million dollars' worth of pre-ordered drones. Ouch. Profiting from the robotics trend means knowing which way the chips will fall – whether a company will have a "make" moment or a "break" one. That's where Keith comes in. He has put together a well-researched positioning plan for investors to follow so that they can cash in on the "robot gold rush" too. Have a look… Editor's Note: "Must-have" companies backed by Unstoppable Trends are a cornerstone of Keith's wealth-building strategy. But there's another type of investment he wants Money Morning Members to know about. It's one of his favorites, a kind of "desert island fund" he'd buy if he had to park his money in one place, "retire" from civilization for 20 years, and come back to a pile of money. Click here to learn more… Follow Money Morning on Twitter @moneymorning, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

(Jodie Aakko / Special to the Times) Jodie Aakko had a fun idea for a spring service project for the students at Lighthouse Seventh-Day Adventist Christian School in Fort Morgan. The principal called it a "Baby Care-a-Thon," and it meant having the students visit local grocery stores and ask customers who were there to purchase items for babies and then donate them to the students as they left. "Our students stood at the doors with smiles to greet customers, hand them a cart, and tell them about our Baby Care-A-Thon," Aakko said. "By the end of just one fast hour, our tables were full with baby items." The students were seeking baby food, pacifiers, diapers, baby toys or any other items babies and their parents might need. They gave the customers at Walmart, Safeway and Edwards Right Price Market a small piece of paper explaining the project, and then were at the door by the checkouts to gather any items people were donating. "We are delivering the items to Rising Up, to be distributed to needy families in our community," stated the paper the store customers got from the students. Students in grades one through eight at Lighthouse SDA Christian School participated in the "Baby Care-a-Thon" on May 10, Aakko said. "The excited students broke-up into three teams" and went to the three grocery stores, she said. Advertisement "One customer was in a hurry, so he gave us $30 to buy the baby food," reported sixth-grader Brayan Orona. "Another customer said that they got some baby food for us because they would feel guilty if they didn't. But we were so excited because we also got to meet a Vietnam veteran at the store." Next, the Lighthouse students went to Rising up to drop off "the mountain of baby items, take a tour of the agency, and assemble 'travel packs,'" Aakko said. After hearing Trish Moreno from Rising Up explain what the nonprofit does to support the community, the students toured the Rising Up facility at the United Methodist Church Annex. They then put the travel bags together assembly-line-style and then placed the other baby items on the pantry shelves. "We planned on how we would like to partner with this agency next school year," Aakko said. "It is true... when you help someone, you receive a blessing knowing that you helped the community." The Lighthouse students concluded the service project outing by walking over to Fort Morgan City Park and picking up "any trash they could spy," she said. "This activity was a homerun."

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website three  −   =  0 It's no secret that the "Retail Ice Age" – led by online giant Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) — has changed the way that people shop. Amazon has been a growing pain in the neck for low-price retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) for some time, but even high-end specialty stores like Ralph Lauren Corp. (NYSE: RL) have struggled now that Amazon has crept into their sector. Now the e-commerce leviathan is tiptoeing into another new arena: healthcare. Amazon Is Setting the Retail Ice Age on U.S. Drugstores Amazon has long invested in the retail healthcare market, offering medical supplies and equipment to its consumers. But according to a May 16 report by CNBC, Amazon has held annual meetings at its Seattle headquarters over the last few years to discuss entering the retail drugstore business… Of course, we don't mean brick-and-mortar pharmacies — we mean drug delivery. Indeed, Amazon often tests new product lines in non-U.S. markets before it assesses whether to roll it out in the domestic market. "A disruptive company like Amazon can turn an industry on its side." So when The Japan Times reported in April that Amazon would be expanding its Prime Now delivery service to include drug sales, U.S. drugstores should have been on high alert. And with the rise of high-deductible plans and more people paying for healthcare, Amazon wants to dive even deeper into the healthcare business than drug delivery. We're talking pharmaceuticals… The Next Market Amazon Could Take Over Indeed, just one month later on May 17, CNBC reported that Amazon is hiring pharmaceutical talent in the United States – a general manager to lead the "consumables" unit and other prospects from the pharmacy sector. Urgent: You could make $1.6 million or more by learning how to extract cash from failing businesses. Find out more… We can't say we're shocked. "There is no such thing as an 'Amazon-Proof' retailer," said Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald – who has long been bullish on AMZN stock – to Members on April 10. "A disruptive company like Amazon can turn an industry on its side." Amazon currently has over 310 million active customer accounts, according to the latest report from Statista. That number is expected to skyrocket as the giant continues to devour competitors and expand into new industries … By 2020, RBC Capital Markets predicts Amazon will have over 500 million active customers, according to CNBC on March 10. Video And the healthcare industry is so very tempting. It currently accounts for nearly 18% of U.S. GDP and could reach 25%, wrote Forbes on May 18. Investors are already seeing the writing on the wall. Shares of potential rivals in the retail pharmacy space were spooked by the news on Wednesday (May 18). Both CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) were down more than 3% in afternoon trading. At the same time, Amazon was up 1.48% on Wednesday and is currently trading up 0.84%. How to Play Amazon Now There are two ways to play this, according to Keith. "Longer term, there's no question you want to own shares of Amazon," said Keith on April 10. "In fact, Amazon may well be the only company in the world today that you can buy today and expect to hold for the rest of your investing lifetime." However, that comes with a hefty price tag. Amazon currently trades at over $900 a share – and its growing steadily. Over the past three months, AMZN stock has risen over 14% — from $845.07 in February to $966.62 today (May 19). As a second option, "Consider buying just a few shares at a time," recommends Keith. "Heck, buy even one if that's what you can afford. Then, throw away the proverbial key." Editor's Note: "Must-have" companies backed by Unstoppable Trends are a cornerstone of Keith's wealth-building strategy. But there's another type of investment he wants Money Morning Members to know about. It's one of his favorites, a kind of "desert island fund" he'd buy if he had to park his money in one place, "retire" from civilization for 20 years, and come back to a pile of money.

Updated 6 hours ago Investors sold off shares of pharmacy giant CVS Health and Walgreens on Wednesday amid renewed speculation that Amazon would enter the business of selling prescription drugs. As the stock market suffered its biggest loss since before the November election, shares of CVS and Walgreens closed down more than 3 percent, to $76.34 and $81.73, respectively. CNBC reported Tuesday that the online retail giant is considering wading into the complicated retail pharmacy market. The news organization reported that Amazon is hiring a general manager to lead a team to explore the idea but hasn't made a final decision. Selling prescription drugs is a big business in the United States — retail pharmacy is a $400 billion industry, according to an analysis by Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting. The top 15 pharmacies — including CVS, Walgreens, Express Scripts and Wal-Mart — accounted for about three-fourths of all prescriptions by revenue in 2016, Fein said. Fein said he could see Amazon most easily entering the market for patients who pay cash, such as for generic drugs or brand-name drugs with discount coupons from manufacturers. Those patients may choose to pay for the drugs themselves because they're uninsured or looking for a better deal than what they would get through their insurer, which could force them to pay the full list price before they hit their deductible. “Prescription drugs is such a big market, and Amazon, I think, looks at every big market and figures out if there's a place for them to play,” Fein said, estimating that the company could capture 5 to 10 percent of the market if it puts enough resources behind the effort. “I think (Amazon) would challenge the economics of the retail pharmacy industry.” The pharmaceutical industry has been criticized for lacking transparency. Drug list prices do not reflect what most people eventually pay for the medicines, and secret rebates and discounts flow between various middlemen in the industry. Many patients who go to fill a prescription have little idea what price they'll be charged at the pharmacy counter or whether they could get that drug cheaper elsewhere. “Having a new competitor in the market would be great. Having a competitor that would potentially be transparent would be potentially even more interesting,” said Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at Duke University who has studied the web of financial relationships between drug companies and patients. Schulman said the most disruptive and profitable opportunity for Amazon would be to partner with health plans offered by employers, because many people with insurance simply use whatever is covered by their plan. Capturing that market would require Amazon to make deals with insurers or employers. He noted that Amazon could face challenges related to government regulations and patient privacy requirements, which differ from typical retail. Knowing what online shoppers have put in their carts or plan to buy can be used to try to sell other items to the consumer. “If Amazon would know that you have diabetes or hypertension, they could do a lot with that data,” Schulman said. “In principle, they could set up a marketplace where they behave differently, with different rules and different privacy practices.” One way for Amazon to access the prescription drug market would be to acquire smaller companies already doing commerce in the space, Fein noted. Doug Hirsch, the co-founder of GoodRx, a website that enables consumers to compare prices of prescription drugs at retail pharmacies and offers coupons, said Amazon's entry has long been rumored and that the shopping site could be a welcome addition. He said his company is seeing business from consumers who are shopping around to pay cash directly without going through their health plan because their deductibles are high. But he echoed Schulman's caution that the regulatory landscape would make disruption more complicated than a typical retail market. “There's been at least a dozen companies popped up trying to be the Amazon of prescriptions,” Hirsch said. “It's a complicated sell. It's not like the traditional consumer buying experience because of the lack of price transparency and the many steps that have to go into the flow of purchasing a prescription.” More Business Stocks, bond yields drop Washington as turmoil rattles markets Banks tighten auto lending as more subprime borrowers fall into default Fracking crew shortage may push oil production surge to 2018 Religious beliefs involved in Oregon pesticide dispute With many social media options, small businesses need focus TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Sign Up Online Newspaper SectionsSubscribe Business Greuling: Plenty still succeeding in tough retail environment By JOHN GREULING - Will County Center for Economic Development11:42 am Caption John Greuling As many of our local municipal leaders and economic development officials wanting to recruit more retail development head off to Las Vegas this week to the annual real estate conference of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), there is a rising concern about the state of the retail business sector in the region and across the country.  We have all been reading about the trials and tribulations of iconic retail giants like Sears and JC Penney. Locally, we have seen our share of retail closings (Sports Authority, K-Mart, HH Gregg, etc.). 2017 is shaping up to be the worst year for retail bankruptcies nationally since the Great Recession. The recent announcement that Joliet-based Central Grocers filed for bankruptcy protection, on the heels of two of their local affiliates, Certified Warehouse Foods and Ultra Foods, closing Joliet stores, is an indicator of major shifts in the sector. Competition from discount groceries, expanding demand for “gourmet” food products and online shopping were the reasons given by the company for the bankruptcy. There has been continued pressure on stores such as Macy’s, Target and even Walmart just to maintain market share, much less grow it. The impact of e-commerce (say “Amazon”) on bricks and mortar stores is hard to deny. In 2016, e-commerce sales represented 11.7 percent of all retail sales, an increase of 1.2 percent over 2015. Amazon alone represents over 3 percent of all retail sales in the country today and has grown by 25 percent annually over the last two years. Amazon’s impact in Will County has been off the charts: Three years ago, Amazon had zero employees in the county. When they open their fourth fulfillment center in Monee this October, they will have 6,000 full-time employees and be the largest employer in Will County by over 3,000 people. But e-commerce isn’t the only culprit. People are spending more money on data services (phone plans, Netflix), travel, entertainment and dining, and education. All of these impact the traditional retail spend. A change in the bankruptcy code itself over a decade ago has had a dramatic impact on Chapter 11 filings for retail concerns.  That change shortened the time a company has to restructure in bankruptcy to 210 days – seven months. Prior to 2005, it was not uncommon for bankruptcies to take 18 months or longer. This change has allowed suppliers, vendors and landlords to force companies into bankruptcy before they have had a chance to restructure. In the case of Central Grocers, it was pressure from their food suppliers to collect delinquent payments that precipitated the bankruptcy. The good news?  Despite some store closings and shifting demand, the retail sector in Will County continues to thrive.  Specialty grocers, furniture, dining, auto service and supply, personal care and fitness, and home improvement retailers catering to the needs of our local population are doing well.  Our regional malls, both in Joliet and Orland Park, are always near or at full occupancy. A new upscale retail/mixed use development, Rock Run Crossing, is being planned at the intersection of I-80 and I-55, the true crossroads of America.  As Will County continues to grow, adding residents and new jobs, we will remain attractive to new retail and commercial enterprises. It may look and feel different (smaller stores, more dining and entertainment) but it will continue to provide gathering places for people to shop and relax. It’s an important element of the quality of life Will County has to offer. • John Greuling is president and CEO of the Will County Center for Economic Development.

Jessica De Leon Bradenton Herald Crime May 20, 2017 2:28 PM Andres “Andy” Avalos Jr. found guilty of three murders — now faces death penalty or life in prison By Jessica De Leon jdeleon@bradenton.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Bradenton Andres “Andy” Avalos has been found guilty of three counts of murder in the Dec. 4, 2014, slayings of his wife Amber Avalos, 33; neighbor Denise Potter, 46; and the Rev. James “Tripp” Battle III, 31. The courtroom was calm after 13 hours of deliberations, and the jury delivered their verdict at 2 p.m. Saturday. Families of the three victims had waited for more than two years for justice. Battle’s wife, widow and other loved ones embraced one another quietly after the verdict was read. Potter’s aunt, Julie Konkol, said she was grateful that justice had been served not only for her niece but for Amber Avalos and Battle. “I pray that his children and the families of Denise and Rev. Potter find some sense of peace now that the jury found him guilty of these three horrendous murders,” she told the Bradenton Herald on Saturday. Avalos was found guilty of two first-degree counts of murder in the deaths of Potter and Battle. He was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amber. He now faces the death penalty or life in prison. Avalos showed no emotion but drummed his fingers as the verdict was read. The jury — comprised of 12 jurors and two alternates — is no longer sequestered and will return at 8:30 a.m. Monday to begin the penalty phase. Amber Avalos returned to the couple’s home in the 1200 block of 67th Street Northwest in Bradenton from dropping off some of their children at school on the morning of Dec. 4, 2014, when the couple began to argue in the kitchen over his being out drinking the night before. Avalos became enraged when she told him that she was not afraid of him or to die. “I have never put my hands on that woman in 16 years,” Avalos later told lead homicide detectives Jeffrey Bliss and John Kenney following his arrest. “When I put my hands on her that was it.” He punched her multiple times and threw her on the floor of the laundry room. Avalos straddled her, kissed her on the forehead, said I love you and then strangled her with a wire before partially suspending her — wanting to “make sure” she was dead. Avalos went to get his .45 caliber pistol and returned to the laundry room — afraid that Amber might be playing dead — and shot her once. The couple’s then 4-year-old son was home playing video games when Amber Avalos and Potter were killed. He asked Avalos where his “mommy” was but saw only her feet when she lay dead in the laundry room. Related stories from the Bradenton Herald Andres "Andy" Avalos Jr. walks into courtroom Avalos told him it was time to go to school and was loading him into the couple’s gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban when Potter showed up because she and Amber were scheduled to go clean a house together. “I knew she was going to call the cops, and I wasn’t ready for the police to come yet,” Avalos said. He followed Potter into the home, leaving his son in the Suburban. Potter, failing to find Amber in the bedroom, was headed down the hallway toward the laundry room, Avalos said. Avalos said he didn’t want Potter to see his dead wife, so he shot her in the hallway. “I don’t know how many times I shot her,” he said. Then Avalos took his son to the Happy Cubs Daycare, making sure to tell him he loved him on the way and becoming sad after saying goodbye to the boy, he said. He then headed out east, making a stop to see his cousins to tell them what he had done and that he loved them, he said. Avalos didn’t know if his cousins had believed him, but they had given him some money. He ended up leaving his vehicle at Walmart, knowing that soon enough law enforcement would be searching for it. “After what I did, I just wanted to sit in the back seat of a cab and relax,” Avalos said. When detectives asked him when he had formulated his plan to kill Battle, Avalos said, “Months,” and chuckled. At one point he said he vomited just outside the taxi cab because he had been drinking the night before. Avalos also admitted to using cocaine the day before the murders and taking a painkiller that morning for his hangover. The taxi dropped Avalos at a shopping center near Bayshore Baptist, and he read passages from his bible. He then waited, watching for Battle to arrive at the church, knowing that the pastor’s car was not there. After some time, however, Avalos decided to go into the church office and speak with Battle’s wife. But first he made a phone call to his uncle, Lt. Joel Perez, with the sheriff’s office. “I said hey, you need to go to my house, get your boys over there. There’s two people laying down over there,” Avalos said. The widow’s short but vivid recollection took the jurors to the grounds of the Bayshore Baptist Church, 6502 14th St. W., Bradenton, where Avalos shot his final victim. Joy Battle was working in the church office at about 12:45 p.m. when Avalos came in, she testified Wednesday. She sat with him as he began to share his suspicions that their spouses were having an affair with one another. During that time, her husband called and asked if everything was OK after learning Avalos was there. She said she didn’t know. Avalos had made the accusations months before that her husband was having an affair with Amber Avalos, Joy Battle said. But she had told him she had no reason to believe it and offered to pray with him. Her husband arrived at the church within minutes of their phone call, and Joy Battle recalled saying, “Andy, Tripp is here so you can talk to him now.” Avalos got up, walked out and closed the door behind him, she testified. Her husband was on the sidewalk as Avalos approached him. “He pulled a gun from behind his back and he shot him three times and he fell to the floor,” Battle’s widow said, her voice trembling. She began to cry. Joy Battle recalled her husband crying out in pain and her own screams, and she said she took a split second to decide whether to run to him or call 911. “I thought the best chance he had at living was if I called 911, so I went to my phone and called 911,” she said. “I was on the phone with 911, and Andy came back and shot him again.” Avalos walked away from the scene, contemplating “doing more things” like stealing a car or “going out with you guys in a blazing glory,” he later told Bliss and Kenney. Avalos decided otherwise and after seeing a deputy pass him along 14th Street, he quickly ducked into a nearby small wooded area where he would hide for the next two days, coming out only to buy Pringles, a soda and a beer. What ensued was a 51-hour manhunt led by the sheriff’s office to find Avalos — considered armed and dangerous at the time. The frantic search included an alert for Avalos’ gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban — later found at the Walmart — and Palma Sola and Miller elementary schools, King Middle School and Manatee High School were locked down as deputies rushed to take custody of the Avalos’ children, fearing for their safety. Early on the morning of Dec. 6, 2014, Andres Avalos Sr. made a public plea at an impromptu press conference at the sheriff’s office. The elder Avalos pleaded that his son turn himself in for the sake of his six children, who were in protective custody at the time. A few hours later, the highly sought suspect walked onto the wooden deck behind a mobile home in the Pine Haven Mobile Home Park, 6320 14th St. W., just a couple of blocks from the Bayshore Baptist Church. At about 1 p.m., Melissa and Jerry Hamilton — who lived in Pine Haven — were singing Christian hymns in preparation for a function at their church that evening. Melissa stood in the kitchen, and Jerry sat in the living room as he began to sing the popular Christian song, “I Can Only Imagine,” she recalled for the jury. Suddenly through the sliding glass door, she saw Avalos walk onto their wooden deck. “Can I help you?” she said to Avalos. They called 911 and left their home as instructed by a dispatcher. News quickly broke that Avalos was captured after a caravan of deputies and detectives screeched down U.S. 41 to the mobile home — a sign many hoped that Avalos had finally been located. Deputies and detectives drew their guns and semiautomatic rifles, held up their shields as residents of the quiet mobile home park watched in shock. Avalos was arrested without resisting. Avalos was quickly taken to the sheriff’s office headquarters. In the hours that followed, he would give Bliss and Kenney his detailed confession which a jury watched for about 90 minutes Tuesday afternoon. On Monday, the state will present testimony and evidence to support their aggravating factors needed as they seek the death penalty. The defense will present their own case in support of their mitigating circumstances in their attempts to get Avalos life in prison.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint   The shift to online shopping once again took a toll on Minnesota’s largest retailers last year. The state’s biggest retailer, Minneapolis-based Target Corp., had a particularly disappointing year, as it finds itself in a fierce battle with Amazon.com and Wal-Mart. Its overall revenue dropped 5.8 percent to $69.5 billion, down from $73.8 billion the year before, a reflection in part of removing pharmacy sales from its books since selling that part of the business to CVS. Meanwhile, Target’s profit dropped nearly 20 percent to $2.7 billion, down from $3.3 billion the year before. The performance threw a major curveball into CEO Brian Cornell’s transformation efforts as Target struggled on a number of fronts including drawing shoppers to its stores and sales in its grocery aisles. The online juggernaut Amazon continues to amass more loyal shoppers through its Prime program, siphoning off business from other retailers such as Target in the process. “More and more of the business is shifting online,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones. “And it all comes at a much higher cost. [Online sales] are lower profit.” Meanwhile, he added, Amazon has been given more license from investors to operate without being too concerned about its profitability as it goes after market share. Twelve retailers and service companies made the list of the Star Tribune’s Top 50 companies. With $146 billion in sales among them, they account for 28 percent of the revenue and 14 percent of profits of the 50 companies. While Target has had a rough go, it hasn’t been hit as hard as department stores such as Macy’s, Kohl’s and J.C. Penney, which have been reporting deeper declines in sales. As they retool their business for the internet age, they have been closing hundreds of stores. Meanwhile, a number of apparel retailers such as the Limited and Wet Seal have also been disappearing, unable to make it in the changing landscape. Target sees an opportunity to capitalize on the void left by those stores. Cornell said last week that he thinks there could be up to $60 billion in sales up for grabs. So his strategy of remodeling stores, opening smaller-format stores, lowering prices, creating new brands and overhauling its supply chain will better position Target to capture some of those sales. Meanwhile, Richfield-based Best Buy is expected to get a boost from the recent demise of HHGregg, a regional competitor. It’s also facing steep competition from Amazon, but has managed to hold its own and stay fairly steady the past couple of years, so much so that CEO Hubert Joly declared his Renew Blue turnaround phase to be completed earlier this year and unveiled a new road map aimed at growth called Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue. Last year, it reported $39.4 billion in sales, slightly lower than $39.5 billion in 2015. Its profits jumped 50 percent to $1.2 billion, up from $807 million.   kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pool Safely and Michael Phelps Foundation Announce Partnership to Help Families Stay Safer In and Around Pools and Spas CHICAGO, May 20, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — At a poolside press event today, hosted at a Boys & Girls Club in Chicago, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) Pool Safely campaign and the Michael Phelps Foundation announced a new partnership focused on addressing a serious public health crisis: child drownings. Pool Safely and the Michael Phelps Foundation will collaborate to promote each other’s efforts to help prevent fatal and non-fatal child drownings in swimming pools and spas across the country. The Michael Phelps Foundation joins more than 1,000 Pool Safely partners that work together to educate individuals and families nationwide about the importance of being safer in and around the water. „CPSC is excited to collaborate with the greatest swimmer in the history of the sport and his Foundation to help educate millions of Americans and their families about the simple water safety steps that can save lives,” said CPSC Commissioner Joseph Mohorovic, who participated in today’s event. „By working together in a public-private partnership, Pool Safely and the Michael Phelps Foundation’s im program will help kids have a safer time in and around the water, this summer and beyond.” (PRNewsfoto/US CPSC)… (PRNewsfoto/US CPSC)… „We are pleased to partner with CPSC’s national drowning prevention campaign and continue to raise awareness for water safety initiatives,” said Michael Phelps, President of the Michael Phelps Foundation. „Our im program reaches thousands of youth and young adults year-round with water safety, wellness and goal-setting programming. The progress we have made to date is very encouraging, but we have more work to do. We are committed to helping people have a better understanding of how to be safer, yet still have fun, in and around the water. Join us – and other Olympic swimmers – in taking the Pool Safely Pledge!” „New data from the Pool Safely campaign shows a 17 percent decline in fatal drownings in pools since 2010 among the most vulnerable population: children younger than five,” said CPSC Acting Chairman Ann Marie Buerkle. „We are making progress, but we need even more kids taking swim lessons, more adults serving as Water Watchers, more fences installed, and more people trained in CPR.  Today’s swimming lesson with Michael and his Foundation serves as a reminder of the importance of all children learning how to swim—no matter where they live or what their circumstance.” At the partnership event, clinic participants received swim instruction, as well as learned about the importance of water safety. Children also took the Pool Safely Pledge, which affirms that they will: never swim alone, ask parents for swimming lessons, and stay away from drains in pools and hot tubs. Since its inception in 2010, the Pool Safely campaign has developed a network of partners that serve as the lifeblood of the campaign. These groups include local safety organizations to national entities, such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Walmart, the American Red Cross, YMCA of the USA, the National Drowning Prevention Alliance and the Boy Scouts of America. Pool Safely partners have played a critical part in the campaign’s effort to increase awareness of water safety and prevent fatal and nonfatal child drownings and drain entrapments in pools and spas. Pool Safely is CPSC’s public education and outreach effort to prevent drownings and entrapments in swimming pools and spas. The campaign provides a number of resources to help parents teach their children about water safety, including a new Kids Corner on the campaign’s newly designed website where parents will find: the Pool Safely Song, written and recorded by children’s performer Laurie Berkner; „The Adventures of Splish and Splash” smartphone app, available for free download on Android and Apple products; and the Pool Safely Pledge, with Pledges specifically designed for kids (adults should take their version as well). About Pool Safely        CPSC’s Pool Safely campaign (www.PoolSafely.gov) is a national public education effort to reduce fatal child drownings, non-fatal drownings and entrapments in swimming pools and spas. The campaign focuses on populations most at risk of drowning: children younger than 5 years old (who represent nearly 75 percent of child drowning fatalities) and African-American and Hispanic children between the ages of 5 and 14, who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drown at higher rates than white children. CPSC reports that annually there are more than 356 pool or spa-related drownings for children younger than 15. Pool Safely, a national public education campaign supporting the requirements of Section 1407 of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, works with partners around the country to reduce child drownings, non-fatal drownings and entrapment incidents in swimming pools and spas. Parents, caregivers, and the media are encouraged to visit: PoolSafely.gov or @PoolSafely on Twitter for vital safety information regarding the prevention of child drownings in and around pools and spas. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. About Michael Phelps Foundation The Michael Phelps Foundation is focused on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthy and active lives, especially for children. Founded in 2008, the Foundation has provided their learn to swim, healthy eating and goal setting curriculum to over 16,000 people around the world by partnering with the Special Olympics and Boys & Girls Club of America. They also support the Level Field Fund – Swimming, because opportunities to pursue excellence in sport should not be limited by an athlete’s financial situation.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 20, 2017 2:50pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Jon Najarian Sees Unusual Options Activity In Wal-Mart Retail's Last Hope: Store Credit Card Profits? Dow Jones Ends the Week ….45% Lower (GuruFocus) Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) shook up the business world after announcing its massive acquisition of Jet.com to boost its e-commerce operations last August. The Quest For Lore The move was more of acqui-hire to secure Jet.com founder Marc Lore and bring his e-commerce expertise to the world’s largest retailer that was seeing significant risks from competitor Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Lore initially focused on 700 zip codes where Amazon did not deliver, eventually building an e-commerce rival to Amazon that got swooped up by Wal-Mart very early into its existence. The acquisition made Lore the highest paid executive in the U.S., higher than that of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook. It appears the risky move is starting to pay off, following the news that Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business grew a remarkable 63 percent in the first quarter. The Strength Of Effective E-Commerce Wal-Mart’s e-commerce strategy looked to expand the number of products online, leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores, according to the New York Times. The company now offers 50 million items online, more than a 500-percent increase from the same quarter last year. A key differentiator is Wal-Mart's online business is its free 2-day shipping that does not require a membership, unlike Amazon’s Prime model. “I think it’s fair to say that Walmart is coming from behind online,” Neil Saunders, the managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail, told the New York Times. “It has underperformed in that area, so what we’re seeing now is really a catch-up to where it needs to be in order to more seriously compete with the likes of Amazon.” Related Links: Walmart Showing Signs Of Life; Analyst Upgrades Amazon Prime A Top Force Driving Retail Disruption ________ Image Credit: By MikeMozartJeepersMedia - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Posted-In: Amazon Apple GlobalData RetailNews Management M&A Tech Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Despite the death of the mall in many parts of the country, it remains a mainstay in some rural areas. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Hair freshly done from the beauty parlor on a recent Friday morning, Ada Clark, 93, and her daughter Carol, 63, met in front of the J.C. Penney in the Pueblo Mall, about 100 miles south of Denver. Their afternoon plan: a walk around the mall, followed by lunch at Red Lobster. When the mall was built in 1976, Pueblo was a booming steel town. The Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. was the city’s largest employer, and a now-empty meatpacking plant also offered good wages. The mall — with its 1,100 retail jobs — has outlasted them both. It’s also the social hub for the city — and for the many small towns east to Kansas and south to New Mexico. “Any time I get out of town to go to the mall and maybe to Sam’s Club, I guarantee that within an hour or so, I’m going to run into someone I know,” said Steve Francis, 60, of Lamar, a town of nearly 8,000 people 120 miles east of Pueblo near the Kansas border. “You take your family, your neighbors, and you make a day of it. The Pueblo Mall isn’t just the only game in town two hours away, it’s the only game in town for three counties.” The Pueblo Mall is an outlier in the age of Amazon.com, when socks and laundry detergent and televisions — nearly anything you can think of — can be delivered to your front stoop within hours. The rise of online shopping has summoned a death knell for some of the old standard-bearers of retail. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) The Pueblo Mall attracts shoppers from hundreds of miles away. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Macy’s and J.C. Penney, for instance, have in recent years reported crippling losses and widespread store closures. When those big anchor stores close, suburban malls find it hard to replace them. Many ’60s- and ’70s-era enclosed malls have been abandoned, razed or reimagined. “With department store closings, many malls will have to get creative with how they utilize space,” said Amy Raskin, who follows urbanization trends as chief investment officer at Chevy Chase Trust. She said many malls nationwide have converted space into multifamily residential units, whereas more rural malls may take on nonstandard anchor tenants, such as a Walmart. Despite Pueblo’s three Walmarts and the arrival of a Dick’s Sporting Goods and an Ulta Beauty store, the Pueblo Mall is bustling. On weekends, its nearly 3,000 outdoor parking spaces fill up. Inside are a few relics of the golden age of American malls: Amy’s Hallmark, Claire’s, Kay Jewelers. And in the food court is an Orange Julius, with its old-school classics and a modern update: smoothies. The mall does not track visitors, according to manager Timothy Schweitzer, but based on sales trends, he says traffic has increased 3 percent to 5 percent in the past year. He said the mall’s average sales per square foot are healthy, holding at around $400 over the past six months. He attributed this to the bigger-name tenants that have opened in recent years, including Bath and Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, Charlotte Russe, Hot Topic and Zumi. It draws kids from all over on the weekends. “It’s still not ­unusual to see out-of-town teams from La Junta [65 miles], Rocky Ford [54 miles] or Walsenburg [53 miles] walk around the mall after soccer or basketball games,” said Carol Clark, who works for the CW Railway and lives 25 miles south in Colorado City. Clark says that when the mall was built, downtown Pueblo suffered and many of its stores closed. The mall became Pueblo’s new town square. The folks who frequent the Pueblo Mall say they go there for the shopping and the socializing. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Now it’s among the city’s main employers, along with two hospitals, including the state-operated Colorado Mental Health Institute. State and federal corrections (there are 13 prisons and the nearby federal Super Max in adjoining counties) also provide jobs, as well as a burgeoning legal marijuana industry that emerged after the passage of Colorado’s Amendment 64. As revenue from online shopping climbs nationally — up 14.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year ago — regional malls like Pueblo’s can compete by tailoring themselves to their consumers, said David Mitroff of Piedmont Avenue Consulting in Oakland, Calif. “People are ordering online, and that changes the whole shopping dynamic,” Mitroff said. “But now the mall has barber shops, gyms, local stores and other things you can’t just buy on Amazon. Or you can go see what they have. You can touch it.” Shoppers like Carol Clark do order online — in her case, ­30-pound bags of specialty dog food that can be obtained cheaper and more conveniently that way than by buying it in Pueblo. “The mall, whether in Pueblo or in Denver where my daughters live, is more social,” she said, “and we may or may not buy something.” Civic pride and tradition also play a part. In some markets with older regional malls, people buy from a traditional anchor store such as a Sears because it’s American, Mitroff said. “It reinforces ‘this is our mall, this is our city, let’s shop there,’ ” he said. “Especially if it’s the same price, why wouldn’t you do that? And if city officials say, ‘Do you understand that when you buy at J.C. Penney here, we actually get tax revenue off of that? But if you buy from Amazon, we don’t.’ ” Two factors working in the Pueblo Mall’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) Shoppers in southern Colorado are often more willing to drive longer distances for their retail purchases, especially for ­durable goods such as refrigerators and other appliances, according to Chris Markuson, director of economic development for Pueblo County. Two other factors work in Pueblo’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. “What this means is that these malls are safe,” said Brian Harper, CEO of New York City-based Rouse Properties, which owns 34 malls in 19 states. “If you’re, say, the third or fourth mall in Cleveland, Ohio, you’ve got to re­invent.” The Farmington Mall in Farmington, N.M., about 300 miles southwest of Pueblo and on the edge of the Navajo Nation Reservation, is a regional focal point. “The Farmington Mall is a perfect example of a mall that will always just be a mall,” Harper said. “A big night out in Farmington, New Mexico — and it’s great — is Red Lobster and a football game afterward — it’s ‘Friday Night Lights.’ Or it’s Red Lobster and the mall or vice versa. So it serves as the hub for Farmington, because there’s no downtown.” The indoor playground is a draw for families. The mall holds community events throughout the year. (Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post) But Harper said that even regional shopping centers miles from major metropolitan centers can adapt and offer something new to consumers. Back at the Pueblo Mall on a Friday afternoon, Bruce and Jennifer Miller watch their 2-year-old son and other kids in a small indoor play area near Sears “When I went to the mall as a kid, it was like ‘Yes!’ and sort of a big deal,” says Bruce Miller, a Pueblo native who works in construction. “But when I was a kid, there was no playground. My son really loves it.” The mall holds community events throughout the year, including a “Walk with a Doc” mall-walking program, health fairs, school concerts and, recently, a Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Day and a “Pueblo’s Got Talent” showcase. In front of the playground is the Boot Barn, a national Western and workwear chain that serves people from the many ranches and farms that dot the counties of southern Colorado. The store even stays open on holidays when the rest of the mall is closed. “We had a good day this past Easter,” store manager Jenni Pacheco said. “You can’t predict when your work boots are going to need to be replaced, even if it’s on a holiday. We have rodeos, fairs [the Colorado State Fair is held each August in Pueblo], concerts and even father-daughter dances that keep us busy all year.” And there are plans for new mall tenants, including entertainment outlets, restaurants, and possibly a grocery store, Schweitzer said. A Planet Fitness has opened, along with the women’s plus-size store Torrid. On a recent Friday afternoon, Toni Brgoch of La Veta, a town of 750 that is 65 miles southwest of Pueblo, stopped by the Clinique counter at Dillard’s. Though she was on her way back from visiting her grandchildren in Denver and could have picked up makeup at one of the larger malls, she preferred to stop in Pueblo, where she has been shopping for 42 years. “When my children were young, we came to Pueblo for doctor’s appointments and the mall — we’d make a day of it,” she said. “Growing up in Walsenburg, we had a J.C. Penney, where my mom worked, and a Montgomery Ward mail-order center. But now there’s just a Safeway. Taking the stores out of these towns hurts them. I hope this mall stays.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

The questioning didn’t last long. Sure, I could have flown to my parents’ Detroit home for the holidays, but the cost of a last-minute plane ticket around Christmas is hardly reasonable, to say nothing of the misery of flying out of LAX in late December. Flying with Benji didn’t sound great either, especially for him. Besides, I first needed to visit my girlfriend, Lauren, in Madison, Wisconsin. And then there was the matter of the two motorcycles I wanted to take back with me to Los Angeles. Clearly, the extended stint behind the wheel of Honda’s 2nd generation pickup was still the smart call. Doubly so given its in-bed trunk, which swallowed up my suitcase and Benji’s dog food, freeing up the cabin for sleep space. A good night’s sleep it wasn’t, but I did get a solid three-hour nap. I wouldn’t have had to do that to myself had I stuck to my original schedule of leaving on Friday afternoon in order to complete the nearly 2,000-mile trek to Madison by Sunday night. Unfortunately for Benji and I, time got away from me and we didn’t hit the road until Saturday evening. The Ridgeline’s 3.5-liter V-6 sang smoothly as the truck ate up seeming endless highway miles. The added power and torque over the previous Ridgeline made passing and merging a breeze and despite being a naturally aspirated engine at altitude, it felt only slightly underpowered through the daunting Rockies. Having spent the prior 10 months under the Southern California sun, I wasn’t entirely prepared for proper wintery conditions. I made extensive use of the Ridgeline’s heated leather seats and heated steering wheel, the combination of which almost made the truck’s main heater unnecessary. I also gained a great appreciation for Honda’s Lane Keep Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control. Both systems worked consistently and effectively on the predominately straight, well-marked highways. It’s far from autonomy though; throw a slight curve into the mix and the truck alert you by vibrating the steering wheel upon touching the centerline or shoulder, before correcting by ping-ponging side-to-side instead of holding a straight line. Regardless, it was a great security blanket for those endless miles of snooze-inducing corn found throughout the Midwest. Due to my delayed departure, my arrival in Madison wouldn’t come until Monday morning — some 21 hours after that three-hour nap in Utah. This was, by far, the longest solo run I’ve ever completed. Despite the marathon drive, I felt alarmingly little fatigue, thanks in part to the adjustability of the seats and the smooth car-like ride. My five-day stint in Madison would subject the Ridgeline to extreme cold, the worst being -23 degrees Fahrenheit with windchill, but the Honda didn’t skip a beat. I made it a point to use the remote start feature from within the warm confines of Lauren’s apartment, which provided me with a toasty and warm truck to jump into every time. Then the weekend came and it was time to get back on the road. The 8-hour drive to Detroit felt like nothing compared to the previous week’s 29-hour sprint — and being welcomed with the biggest hug from my mom made instantly made the journey worth every minute. During the obligatory car showing session, my mom, whose daily driver is a 2016 Ford Escape, loved how big the Honda’s interior felt, while my 2017 Ram 1500-driving step-dad instantly noticed the Ridgeline nice ride, but noted it wouldn’t be able to pull their 5,500-pound camper (the Ridgeline maxes out at 5,000 pounds). Instead of making my way back towards I-70 after a week of family visits, I retraced my steps back to Madison — New Year’s Eve was coming and who better to spend it with than my girlfriend. The bikes I needed to pick up, a pair of vintage Hondas, were in Wisconsin as well, and I needed to stay in the Midwest for work anyway, as the 2017 Detroit Auto Show was just around the corner, a fact that had me driving back to Michigan just a few days later. That second drive to Detroit was my breaking point. I was officially sick of driving. Yet, three days later, the show was over and I was, finally, on my way back to Los Angeles. The first half of that stint is a blur — Michigan smoothly turned into Indiana, Indiana quietly became Illinois, Illinois morphed into Iowa, and Iowa disappeared into Nebraska, which then transformed into Colorado. Then, just as I hit Loveland Ski Area, which sits about 55 miles west of Denver, the freeway came to a halt due to a snowstorm. Three hours went by as I sat in gridlock on I-70, helpless as six inches of snow piled up around me. Despite wearing all-season tires, the Ridgeline offered surprisingly good traction in the white stuff, no doubt aided by the extra weight of the bikes in the bed. However, near-whiteout conditions forced me to exit shortly after the freeway shortly after the road started to get clear. Fortunately, I was able to secure a dog-friendly hotel for the night and didn’t need to repeat my Walmart parking lot experience. Though I was beyond sick of driving by the time I reached AUTOMOBILE HQ the next afternoon, those negative feelings did not extend to the Ridgeline. Turning in the keys after I got the bikes out brought some bittersweet emotions. Though I became far more familiar than I would have liked, just like Benji, who was with me on every leg of the journey, the truck was a steady, reliable companion that kept us warm, safe, and comfortable for nearly three weeks and over 7,600 miles.

By Scutify May 19, 2017 12:12 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. We have a very quiet week for economic reports. The housing data are quite important, but it will be a Tuesday story without legs. The White House drama will be compelling for the media. Whether investors like the idea or not, we should expect another week of news that is mostly political. My mission at WTWA has two parts: Recognize the reality - like it or not. Find the investment implications - however modest. In a light week for data, it will be easy for the punditry to jump on the Comey firing story. Expect everyone to be asking: Is this like Watergate? Should investors be afraid? Last Week Last week the economic news was good, but mostly ignored. Theme Recap In my last WTWA I predicted that a bored punditry, lacking fresh data, would be looking at tea leaves to find a message from the markets. That proved to be my worse forecast of the year! After a day of analyzing Mr. Buffett and the Sohn Conference, President Trump grabbed the spotlight. I hope people benefitted from the discussion, even though it never became the focus for the week. The Story in One Chart I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from Doug Short via Jill Mislinski. She notes the weak Friday trading, the narrow range, and the closeness of the all-time high. Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information. His charts save more than a thousand words! Read the entire post for several more charts providing long-term perspective, including the size and frequency of drawdowns. The News Each week I break down events into good and bad. Often there is an "ugly" and on rare occasion something very positive. My working definition of "good" has two components. The news must be market friendly and better than expectations. I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news - and you should, too! Once again, the economic news last week was good, but there was little market reaction. Of course, there were other considerations. The Good The EIA's energy outlook suggests stable prices. People seem to regard different prices as "good." These levels are fine for consumers. The distress in the oil patch has been mitigated. (EIA). Hotel Occupancy increased again matching a record pace. This chart from Calculated Risk provides a nice comparison. Corporate earnings have been strong on all fronts: improvement over last year, beating expectations on earnings, and beating expectations on revenues. FactSet details this important story for investors, illustrated by the chart below. Brian Gilmartin makes a key point, highlighting the modest revisions in earnings expectations: The question we should ask for readers is what sectors (using the above data listed in 2nd set of bullet points) are seeing the smallest negative revisions as we approach Q2 '17? Real Estate: +3.6% today vs. +3.5% on April 1 '17. Financials: +9.5% today vs. +10.5% on April 1 '17. Industrial's: +1.1% today vs. +1.3% on April 1 '17. Technology: +9.6% today vs. +11.5% on April 1 '17. Health Care: +2.2% vs. +3.3% on April 1 '17 Readers should remember, that Technology, Financials and Health Care - those 3 sectors alone - comprise about 50% of the SP 500 by market cap. Port traffic strength continues at a better rate than the economy. Steven Hansen (GEI) takes his expected deep dive into the data. Initial unemployment claims dropped to 236K. Calculated Risk provides this interesting, long-term chart. It is consistent with the tighter labor market conditions in last week's JOLTS report. The Bad Retail sales disappointed. Core sales increased 0.4%, less than expectations. This was somewhat mitigated by revisions to prior months. The data are not adjusted for inflation, notes Steven Hansen (GEI), so the picture is a bit worse. Retail same store sales also disappointed. The entire sector is challenged. (MarketWatch). J.C. Penney hit a record low and big-name department stores were also hit. The Ugly Some stories do not die, perhaps illustrating why they qualify for the "ugly" category. This week a major ransomware meltdown occurred. Wired asks whether it might be the long-awaited "big one." North Korean nuclear and missile development is another regular concern in this section. As I write, there is news of another missile launch, but few details. The Silver Bullet I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause, doing the real work to demonstrate the facts. No award this week, but I welcome nominations. The investment world is full of misleading information and bogus conclusions. The Week Ahead We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance. Good luck with that! Second best is planning what to look for and how to react. That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead. You can make your own predictions in the comments. The Calendar We have a normal week for economic data, but with few important reports. The "A" List Housing starts and building permits (T). Continuing strength expected in the April data. Leading indicators (Th). Popular economic summary remains in solid growth range. Initial jobless claims (Th). Continues with record low levels. The "B" List Industrial production (T). Will the rebound continue? Philly Fed (Th). Moves markets, perhaps because it is the earliest read on a new month. Crude inventories (W). Recently showing even more impact on oil prices. Rightly or wrongly, that spills over to stocks. FedSpeak is down a little after last week's heavy schedule. I don't care much about the Empire State index. There are still some earnings reports, including Wal-Mart. Next Week's Theme As I noted last week, when there is not much important news, it creates a vacuum. It does not change the need to fill on-air minutes or column space. If nature abhors a vacuum, the punditry hates it even more! I was right about that, but wrong about what the news would be! The Comey firing, the suggestion of recordings of Oval Office conversations, and the Kissinger picture have fueled plenty of speculation. Everyone is asking: Is this like Watergate? Financial media might also ask: Do events increase risk for investors? What does it mean? Expect to be bombarded with speculation, beginning with the Sunday shows. Some will emphasize Watergate parallels, while others will cite differences. I have a list of such sources, but the arguments are mostly political. The investment implications are much more difficult to follow. The early theme is that the controversy will derail the Trump agenda. Since recent market gains assume Trump tax cuts, etc. the stock rally is threatened. This is certainly a big story, but it is not yet a market story. The Comey firing is "more of a political story than a markets story...Implications directly for the market are pretty muted," Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners, told MarketWatch. (William Watts). As usual, I'll have more in my Final Thought. Quant Corner We follow some regular featured sources and the best other quant news from the week. Risk Analysis Whether you are a trader or an investor, you need to understand risk. Think first about your risk. Only then should you consider possible rewards. I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update. The Indicator Snapshot The Featured Sources: Bob Dieli: The "C Score" which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread (the most accurate real-time recession forecasting method over the last few decades). His subscribers get Monthly reports including both an economic overview of the economy and employment. Holmes: Our cautious and clever watchdog, who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective, but emphasizes guarding assets. RecessionAlert: Many strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis. While we feature his recession analysis, Dwaine also has several interesting approaches to asset allocation. Try out his new public Twitter Feed. Georg Vrba: The Business Cycle Indicator and much more. Check out his site for an array of interesting methods. Georgregularly analyzes Bob Dieli's enhanced aggregate spread, considering when it might first give a recession signal. His interpretation suggests the probability creeping higher, but still after nine months. Brian Gilmartin: Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies. Doug Short: The World Markets Weekend Update (and much more). His Big Four chart is the single best method to monitor the key indicators used by the National Bureau of Economic Research in recession dating. Eddy Elfenbein has his inimitable take on the VIX - clear, common sense, and accurate: I have a slightly heterodox view on the VIX. You'll often hear the VIX discussed on the financial news as if it's the market's heart rate. It's not. In fact, the VIX is largely tied to what the market is doing. When the market is up, volatility drops. When the market falls, volatility rises. Ploutos has another analysis of Selling in May. Returns are lower, but still positive - as I think readers know. He also comments on the possible reasons for how this persists in the face of arbitrage. Peter F. Way provides a careful explanation and a good example of how to use market maker hedging data to find solid stock values. Even if you do not accept the market makers as the "smart money," this is interesting information about the perceptions of big players. Here is an interesting example: And an application to the overall market. Read the entire post carefully for an overview of the methodology. This is an aggressive, market-timing approach. How to Use WTWA (especially important for new readers) In this series, I share my preparation for the coming week. I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients. Most readers can just "listen in." If you are unhappy with your current investment approach, we will be happy to talk with you. I start with a specific assessment of your personal situation. There is no rush. Each client is different, so I have eight different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs. A key question: Are you preserving wealth, or like most of us, do you need to create more wealth? Most of my readers are not clients. While I write as if I were speaking personally to one of them, my objective is to help everyone. I provide several free resources. Just write to info at newarc dot com for our current report package. We never share your email address with others, and send only what you seek. (Like you, we hate spam!) Best Advice for the Week Ahead The right move often depends on your time horizon. Are you a trader or an investor? Insight for Traders We consider both our models and the top sources we follow. Felix, Holmes, and Friends We continue with a strongly bullish market forecast. Most of our models are fully invested. RoadRunner is fussy about entry criteria. The group meets weekly for a discussion they call the "Stock Exchange." In each post I include a trading theme, ideas from each of our five technical experts, and some rebuttal from a fundamental analyst. If you followed my recommendation last week, you had a chance to evaluate the unusual agreement among our models (Four Thumbs Up for Nvidia!) and with guest expert Cody Willard. I hope that some readers (after doing their own research) could join in the post-earnings gains. This week was much different - no consensus at all among our experts in their discussion of some big-name stocks. We try to have fun, but there are always fresh ideas. RoadRunner plays upward trending channels and likes Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). Top Trading Advice Brett Steenbarger is required reading for traders, posting many great ideas almost daily. He has two posts this week that are required reading: What should you do if you have lost your edge? Brett has great practical advice, explaining how to be open to fresh ideas and how to leverage your strengths. He also explains why traders should always be updating their methods - and provides a fresh idea. The other post is of special interest for me and my colleagues: Will Quant Blow Up? He distinguishes between successful approaches and pseudo-quants. His experience lets him identify the imposters easily. There is a solution: The answer to the limitations of pseudo-quant strategies is not to abandon mathematics altogether, but rather to employ rigor in the application of mathematics. Just as medicine has evolved from a discipline dominated by village doctors to more of an evidence-based science, finance is doing the same. As a bonus, he also cites MAFFIA. There is plenty of information for identifying the pseudo-quants, and a respectful refutation of the Jason Zweig article that sparked the discussion. Insight for Investors Investors have a longer time horizon. The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility! Best of the Week If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be the collection of ideas from this year's Buffett fest. The topics cover a wide range, including both methods and specific stock ideas. Plan to take some time and enjoy these. Stock Ideas Bad luck for Blue Harbinger, writing a great post within a few days of Warren Buffett's big week. Mark's analysis of Frontier Communications (FTR) is excellent. It covers the fundamental analysis and the stock history, but that is just a start. Should you consider the stock, the bonds, or the options? These are important questions which investors rarely consider. It is a first-rate article. Barron's recommends buying Europe and emerging markets, providing a list of ETFs. I'm not so sure, but it is worth a look. (I get exposure to these markets through stocks trading in the U.S. and following accounting rules). Dana Lyons also takes a look. The Sohn Conference raises money for charity by featuring big-name hedge fund managers to present their ideas. The audience pays five grand for a ticket (nearly all of it going to charity) and trades from their smartphones during the presentation. The speakers talk their books. Barron's has a nice discussion of how it works and the volatile stock movements during a presentation. With that background, readers might wish to consider some of the ideas. (Diana Britton, Wealth Management) has a video and slideshow. Our Stock Exchange always has some fresh ideas. There are ideas from five different approaches. To my surprise, Felix (our long-term investor proxy) likes Valeant. (VRX). Personal Finance Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years. If you are a serious investor managing your own account, this is a must-read. Even the more casual long-term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday. Tadas always has first-rate links for investors in his weekly special edition. As usual, investors will find value in several of them, but my favorite is about retiring early. It raises several interesting questions - not just financial calculations. Watch out for... Whole Foods (WFM). Stone Fox Capital and Barron's both raise questions. Stone Fox also raises warnings about ConocoPhillips (COP). TV pitches for questionable IPO's. Dan Bobkoff and Rachael Levy (BI) highlight a Seinfeld actor pitching this one under the latest SEC rules. For the record, every stock idea I have ever seen on TV or heard on the radio has been a disaster. These pitches raise my blood pressure, since good, working people are the targets. Final Thoughts The Watergate analogy makes a good story, but the similarities are superficial - so far. I do not see a great downside risk, but the hoped-for growth from tax cuts has a lower probability. The key differences from Watergate include the state of the economy (especially pressure on prices), turmoil over the Vietnam war, and the VP controversy regarding Spiro Agnew. Investors must get past the political theater and ask how much this matters to the economy and their investments. So far, not much. There are many sources, but let us highlight something old and something new. Warren Buffett notes that his investments do not depend upon who is President. He does not call them. He does not send messages. Josh Brown cites the "fake Trump trade," a theme familiar to WTWA readers, and also opines that the market would rally if Trump resigned. Morgan Housel emphasizes the story that investors would be watching, were it not for the sideshow - housing. He shows this chart and then writes as follows: We're still near a level associated with previous bottoms. The only other times since World War II that housing investment has been as low as it is now was during or near recessions. And that's not because we've declined to these low levels, but because the rebound since 2009 has been so meager. Which is promising. It's a humble suggestion that we're not as close to the top of this nine-year expansion as you might think. I see daily evidence in my own contacts; other wealth managers make similar reports. People are sitting on cash, out of the market, chasing yield, or turning to real estate and gold. Many expect a violent end to the current slow and long-term economic expansion - just as they did three or four years ago. It is a time when investors can expect a reward for careful analysis instead of blind fear. The Fear and Greed Trader calls it a market in search of a catalyst. Maybe so, but catalysts are not always easy to predict. This article was written by Jeff Miller for on . This article published in collaboration with Scutify, the best app for traders and investors.

Opinion Last Word Last Word on W&M president, May 20 School lunch As a mother with children in three different schools, I can tell you that Michelle Obama's idea for healthy lunches sounds good, but in all reality, kids hate them. Most kids throw their lunches away; therefore, not eating anything. My children would rather spend the time packing their own lunches that I oversee than to eat the lunches that are supposedly healthy for them. W&M president I hope that the search committee for a new president for William and Mary will notice that James Comey is available. The W&M Presidential Search Committee should give serious consideration to recruiting former FBI Director Jim Comey. A man of impeccable integrity, a fine leader and a W&M graduate — there could not be a better choice. Photos in Williamsburg submitted by readers.

Closing Martin's It is inconceivable to anyone who shops at Martin's Grocery as to why this store is soon to close its doors. No number of explanations can justify closing this establishment. Many feel this is a move prompted by the big grocery chains to gain even more control of this area, and of course, greed does enter the conversation. To the "powers to be," have you lost your minds? Can anyone find out what the status is for the impending huge vacancy in the Monticello Shopping Center when Martin's vacates? The employees are all in the dark and have been told that everyone will be terminated and will have to reapply to work with whoever is taking over. Inquiring minds want to know! We definitely need another grocery store to fill that space. We would have to travel a considerable distance to another full service grocery. Wal-Mart Market doesn't have the variety, and no one else carries Ukrop's items! Gotta have my Ukrop's bread pudding! The Martin's employees I feel bad for as the store closes are those who have been there since 1998 when it opened as Ukrop's. They have spent almost 19 years of their lives in that store. Although Martin's has continued to pay them their Ukrop's wages, it has not been the same as working for Ukrop's. Martin's has offered the old Ukrop's employees a buyout before, which a few took. The rest have to stay until closing on July 10 if they want severance. People who just started to work at Martin's part-time the last few years can go out and get another grocery store job with little problem, as some are hiring. It is the longtime full-time former Ukrop's associates who will have a harder time replacing their full-time grocery jobs, and I sympathize. A great time Just wanted to say what a great event the Williamsburg Beer Festival was. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves despite the heat. Our favorite was The O'Connor brewers. They not only had a great IPA but although he was in disguise, they had the official El Guapo serving the beer. This really added to the fun and experience. Colonial Williamsburg So Forbes says CW is second best among travel and leisure businesses in making employees feel "happy, inspired and well-compensated." So did they just survey the employees in the Goodwin Building? Looking for ... Looking for someone who wants to come out, make a difference coaching and teaching youth football in this area. Practice 3-4 nights a week with games on Saturday throughout the Peninsula. Preferably someone with experience, but it is not mandatory; volunteer position. Background check required. If you would like to make a difference, please email me at kitron@yahoo.com. Looking for recommendations for a bathroom renovation contractor and someone to install new toilets and linoleum. Please provide recommendation name and telephone number. Thank you. Is there a business in the Williamsburg area that sells items for customers on eBay in return for a commission? If you do this, please leave your address on Last Word so that those of us who are interested can contact you. Thank you. I saw the item about collecting Betty Crocker points. I'm very interested in that. I would like to have the person's number. My number is 220-0933. Thank you. To the person looking for someone to buy coins and jewelry: Give Dan a call at 757-585-3145. He has helped us and others to sell coins, precious metals and other valuables. He is honest and reliable. Looking for a tile man to cut and replace a few tiles in a bathroom. Call 757-564-6470 any evening. Looking for groups for seniors that meet anytime on Mondays or Tuesdays or early Wednesdays in Williamsburg. Anything from Bible studies to general get-together activities to have a social life with other seniors. I'm thinking of riding my bike and am wondering how the people who ride on rural roads deal with dogs that may give chase. Anyone have any input? Affordable housing While I think the conversion of the remaining motel rooms at Quarterpath Inn to apartments is a good idea, they are not exactly affordable for "workforce" employees. If a person makes $10 per hour (a typical hourly wage for hospitality workers) and works 32 hours a week (so the employer doesn't have to pay health care benefits), that would be $1,280 a month before taxes. The studio apartment at The Flats is listed at "from $695/month" — over half of that $1,280 — leaving, after taxes, a little over $100 per week for everything else. Good luck! A studio is a little small for a roommate, but that is what you'd have to do! Great concert Flute Frenzy presented an outstanding concert Friday evening. Founded in 2003, the ensembles included elementary, middle school and high school students. The program now includes an adult choir, Fantasia Flutes. Thank you, Flute Frenzy and the Fantasia Flute Choir. Hot weather Fellow Animal Lovers: On warm or hot days, please leave your dog at home! A car's inside temperature can rise by 40 degrees, even with the windows cracked. When it's 72 degrees outside, it can rocket to 116 degrees inside a car in an hour; most of the temperature rise takes place in the first 15-30 minutes. Dogs left in hot cars have only minutes before their body temperatures rise, and they can suffer severe illness, damage to their organs and death. Leaving pets in a vehicle on a warm day is against the law. If you truly love your pets, please leave them at home. Good reading The Curmudgeon Report is a delight! Thank you, Virginia Gazette, for adding this feature for our reading pleasure. Brings chuckles and smiles to my face. Well done Backstage Theatre Productions did an amazing job with "Shrek: The Musical." It was hilarious! The talent and energy that they brought to the stage was phenomenal. The young man playing Donkey did especially well. Everyone involved should feel very proud of themselves. Response needed I'm very disappointed with Rep. Scott Taylor. I've sent three recent comments to him on his website. I only get back general canned replies that would apply whether I am asking for help with a traffic ticket or addressing the new health care bill. Certainly he doesn't have time to address each one himself, but at least his staff could return a reply with his position on the issue I have sent him. Not at all good enough. Angels in disguise I would like to thank the people who run our JCC Recreation Center. My husband has dementia and cannot go to his class by himself. I put together a plan to observe him. We discovered he needed guidance and help. My thanks go out to Rebecca Williamson, Kelly Herbert, Tracy Newsom and Rebecca (front desk) and some lifeguards, who made my plan work. Now with the help of a friend, Jim Willis, my husband is attending his classes. I am delighted and my thank-you goes out JCC Rec. Center and all the great people who work there. You are my "angels in disguise." Black Lives Matter The recent contribution to Last Word explaining the meaning of Black Lives Matter was, indeed, helpful. But it's not the words that people find offensive. It's the behavior of the group that stands behind those words. They are often obnoxious, offensive, hostile to police and frequently anti-American. If they want that phrase to matter, they need to clean up their act because at the moment, their rude behavior is speaking far louder than their words. The Black Lives Matter movement might have had good intentions when it was created. However, once it became associated with violence and illegal protests, it failed in its mission. We, as a nation based on laws, should never legitimize any movement whose intention is to break those very laws. Free to you I have four cardboard wardrobe boxes suitable for storage, or if you are moving, they are ideal to use for transporting your clothes. They are free to you if you will pick them up. Call 757-229-4660. Thank you. Free packing boxes! All sizes, packing paper and bubble wrap. Call 757-293-8746 for pick-up. Free moving boxes. Call 508-0519. Solar farm Do the people who oppose the Norge solar farm due to the "noise" realize that if they don't build a quiet solar farm, they could have who knows how many houses there instead? Yup, I would put up with short-term construction traffic then quiet any day to the housing construction traffic and then daily traffic forever! I continue to be amazed at what people will complain about. Health insurance I was reading the May 10 Last Word and was disturbed by one of the commenters regarding the new health care. This is not about the merits or lack of merits of the health care program; it was the comment it's even better for the poor people. Everyone is a human being and deserves the dignity and equality of health care. That comment was not only insensitive but puts us back about 100 years. "Poor People." Really? It's 2017, not 1917! Recommended While en route to Williamsburg on a recent Friday, a lens to my prescription sunglasses came loose and I needed a professional to set it back in place. I scoped for optometrists in the area on my phone and landed at Eastern Eye Associates. They had just closed the office for the day. Nevertheless, Debbie Hall saw me at the door, let me in, got the pesky old lens back in place and had me on my way in about three minutes, no charge. As a former Williamsburg resident, this is the type of customer service that used to be commonplace. My wife and I were pleased to note that such is still the case. Thanks, and a big shoutout to Debbie and Eastern Eye. If you need to have trees removed we highly recommend you contact Monson Tree Service (757-566-0600). Greg and his crew were prompt, quickly handled the task and cleaned up, all for a very fair price. We couldn't be more pleased with their work, and should we need any more work done, we will definitely use them again. To the person needing to replace a retaining wall in a pool area: I highly recommend Dan Hall, owner of Hydracrete Services, Inc., 757-636-7652. He has done work for me and does outstanding work for a fair price. He has been in business for 17 years and specializes in both small and big jobs. We live in Indigo Park on a wooded lot. We purchased a Channel Master Extreme 80 antenna last year. We contacted Danny Bragg from C & D Audio/ Video, 757-784-2081, to install it. He used an up-grade pole to mount it and connected the antenna to our pre-existing TV/cable wiring. We have a picture that is clearer than the cable, both of our TVs use the same antenna, and this morning I counted 37 stations that we receive. We love it, and we have never looked back. Wasted efforts Williamsburg Indivisible Group has wasted their time and money on their ridiculous advertisement on May 13 against President Trump. They cannot prove any of their accusations. Furthermore, our Justice Department and FBI have been working for months to find any such illegal entanglement with Russia or other criminal nations and have found nothing illegal against President Trump and all the administration people mentioned in the ad. WIG needs to accept the fact that they lost the 2016 election. The full page scurrilous and accusatory anti-Trump spread in the May 13 Gazette ("What a Web They Weave") contains not one scintilla of fact or evidence that our president colludes with the Russians. This Russian conspiracy narrative is totally fabricated by the left and will be a historical footnote in due course. The group that sponsored the ad, Williamsburg Indivisible Group, is a recently formed PAC totally comprised of area progressives and Democrats and, according to a recent news article (Daily Press, Feb. 18) has only about 50 active members. Ho-hum. Road worries VDOT needs to look into the traffic congestion at the Colonial Heritage main entrance. With 900-plus homes with cars using that intersection daily, there have been several accidents and many near-misses happening. Also, there is the problem with aggressive U-turns. The two traffic signals at the Pottery are not always used due to low customer traffic. This is a serious traffic situation for the residents living there. VDOT, please remove the yellow blinking left-turn signals now installed at numerous intersections. Many drivers unfortunately react to a yellow signal by accelerating through the intersection before a light goes red. In this case, these yellow arrows create a great danger of collision with oncoming, opposite-direction traffic. Thank you My 18-month-old granddaughter lost her pewter bracelet while at Kidsburg on Sunday. Thank you so much to person who found it and turned it into the office at Veterans Park. You made our day! Thank you to the gentleman at the 7-11 on Olde Towne Road who paid for my Sunday newspaper and wished me a "Happy Mother's Day." Up in Washington The general rule in the prosecution of criminal conspiracy cases is the member of the conspiracy who flips first gets immunity. The question is: Which member of the president's inner circle is going to flip and rat out the rest of them? As amusing as I find the hysteria and hypocrisy running wild with Democrats in reference to the firing of Comey, the reality is that Comey was way past due to be fired by either President Obama or in this case President Trump. Acting FBI Director McCabe, an Obama political appointee, testified that the departure of Comey has not had and will not have any impact upon the ongoing investigation of Russian interference. As a reminder, the FBI is not conducting a criminal investigation and after 10 months of intense investigation by the FBI, NSA and CIA, no evidence of collusion or illegal activity has been discovered involving any member of the Trump campaign, Trump administration or President Trump. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect yours. Just tell me why you say Trump is not above the law? Can you prove he has done anything to jeopardize the welfare of our country? Hillary Clinton has yet to be held accountable for hanging our soldiers out to dry in Benghazi and helping destroy security of the American people by ignoring illegal aliens. So you are telling us that she is above the law. How are Americans sitting idly by while Trump trashes our country? He fired Comey because he was getting too close to the truth about his connection with the Russians. He met the Russian delegation behind closed doors; let the Russian press in but kept out the U.S. press. Let a Russian photographer in the Oval Office. Where is the outrage? Where are our representatives? Oh, that's right, they are busy destroying access to health care and designing tax cuts for the very rich. Those criticizing President Trump regarding repealing and replacing Obamacare do not appear to understand what is going on. President Trump is providing leadership and with Congress, hopefully will come up with a sustainable plan. Health care is very sophisticated and will never be cheap. All should be happy that something is being done, but it is not easy, folks. No free lunch. If Hillary Clinton had won the election in November, today nobody would be talking about the Russian involvement. Here we go with Trumpgate. Not since Nixon have I heard so many different versions of an event come from an administration! One of the most memorable days in my life was graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. President Eisenhower was the speaker and gave us all a dignified and uplifting message. Contrast that with Trump's speech to the Coast Guard Academy graduates this week, in which he instead whined about his well-deserved negative press coverage. How sad.

Today it bears the face of Jeffrey Bezos and the name Amazon.com, the internet-based retailer Bezos founded in 1994 that changed the way America shops, and even lives.

Read: Boy, 4, Is Fatally Struck by Van After Wandering From Florida Hotel While Parents Slept A video shows the hilarious efforts by Alicia Johnson to wake her 13-year-old daughter, Savannah, after she fell asleep inside her car during a recent trip to a Walmart in Lindon. Johnson had left her daughter in the car with the keys so the teen could listen to music while she shopped inside. When mom came back she found her daughter out like a light with the door locked. She tried everything from knocking on the window to getting people to blare car horns, and even called police. For 30 solid minutes, Savannah was totally oblivious to what was happening. Read: Cops Discover Man Asleep in a Clothes Dryer During a Raid An officer used a special tool to get the door open and Savannah finally woke up. “I was like 'what happened? Did somebody break in?'” she told Inside Edition. Savannah seems to have a history of falling asleep at awkward moments as family photos suggest. She once even dozed off eating a bag of Cheetos.

This balance and interest suddenly appeared on our credit report without any written notification. We talked with 6 people at the bank over a 2 week period who essentially called us deadbeats and told us we were thieves. We were more than willing to pay the principle but not the penalties and interest since it was their fault that they didn't transfer the charges that were then current over to the new card, which we didn't catch. We contacted the CFPB and had an agreement with the bank to pay the principle balance with no interest or fees within a week. This agency is their to help the consumer and should not be abolished.

Unsuspecting Walmart customer takes down startled deer May 19, 2017 Updated May 19, 2017 (…) Courtesy of Stephanie L Kolionen Tom Grasswick, a customer at a Walmart store in Wadena, holds onto a confused white-tailed deer that wandered into the store. Grasswick and others managed to remove the animal and set it free outdoors. WADENA, Minn. — A confused white-tailed deer that wandered into a Walmart store in Minnesota ran into a startled customer who tackled the animal to the ground. Shoppers at the store in Wadena, speculated that the young animal was searching for a snack Tuesday when it entered the store through the garden center doors. Tom Grasswick, who happens to live in Deer Creek, said he felt like someone had slugged him when the deer slammed into him. Grasswick said his first instinct was to tackle the animal, bringing it down on a pallet of dog food. "I figured I was bigger than the deer so I'd win that wrestling match," Grasswick said. Grasswick covered the deer's eyes to calm it down, and he and others took the animal outside and set it free. After consulting with local law enforcement it appears Walmart has made some adjustments in its garden center door policies. It appears the deer won't become a repeat customer. What's your reaction?

Josh Chapin, KHOU 10:46 PM. CDT May 19, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON - A local Constable's own wife almost fell victim to a shopping scam. Jennifer Rosen thought she was signing up for a legitimate mystery shopping experience but the instructions she received were not legitimate. In the mail on Friday, she got a check for nearly $3,000 as well as instructions with what to do with that check. "The packaging looks pretty real," said Rosen, wife of Constable Alan Rosen of Harris County Precinct One. "I love to shop so I got kind of curious and I sent my name and address; that's all it requires." Rosen believed she was enrolling in a behind-the-scenes program for WalMart, where the company would pay her to go into a store and then evaluate it on a customer service level before giving them feedback. "I keep getting these emails you know so I thought I'm just going to see what it is, so now I know," she said. She believed the scammers would expect her to take the check, put it into her bank account and transfer money as instructed to various different people. She told her husband, Constable Alan Rosen, about it. "When people receive things that look legitimate and everything looks okay, you have to go the extra mile to verify things," Constable Rosen said. Just to be 100 percent certain, the Rosen family went to a local BBVA Friday to try and cash the check. A teller at the bank told them the check wasn't real. Now, the couple wants to put the word out to warn others.  "No one is sending you a check in the mail that you really didn't know was coming without there being some type of a hook," Constable Rosen said. There are legitimate companies that do mystery shopping but most experts say most legitimate ones ask you to register as an evaluator first. Constable Rosen said he's going to try and track down whoever is responsible for this. He urges everyone to report something like this to law enforcement as soon as possible. © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Officer accused of dismissing tickets in exchange for teen's nude photos The Drug Whisperer Constable's wife nearly falls victim to scam VERIFY: Will toll road fees ever go away?

Fidget spinners are just the latest dull, mind-numbing toy—a trend caused by economic forces, with consequences for kids Adrian Lee May 4, 2017 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Fidget spinners. (Revo Toys) Children’s toys are typically not so exciting; they’re often riffs off the latest big movie or TV show, or gussied-up versions of old reliable games and toys. But the latest toy fad might just leave your head spinning. Fidget spinners—a tripartite ball bearing studded with three weights that reels around with a flick of the finger, intended as tools offering relief to those with ADHD—have been co-opted as the latest toy trend, found pinched in the hands of kids around the world. In the last few months, they’ve become ubiquitous among the younger set regardless of attention span, turned into toys as videos of fidget spinner tricks and Reddit communities gain fans in the thousands; they’ve been banned in swaths of schools; studies have been issued and rebutted over whether kids without ADHD playing with fidget spinners are actually productive in increasing focus in classrooms. As of the time of publishing, 19 of the 20 most popular toys on Amazon are fidget toys. FROM TODAY’S PARENT: Why teachers hate fidget toys Let it first be said that the retroactive justifications from parents and scientists that the spinner may improve focus for all kids—that somehow giving a child a toy helps them do one thing easier—feels like someone endorsing weeks-old takeout, just because it didn’t give you food poisoning last time. Let it also be said that trusting kids in their claims that toys help them focus is a child-pushed argument that’s so brazen that 12-year-old me—who would lay out my case to my parents that buying Pokemon cards was actually some kind of fiduciary investment with the potential for high returns on the resale market—can’t help but stand and applaud. But its role as a focus-stealer isn’t the fidget spinner’s true sin. It’s that they are mind-numbingly boring. Ball-bearing tools have been around since ancient Rome. They’re in your boring computers; they’re in your boring engines; they’re in your boring bikes, and your boring kitchen appliances. If we’re co-opting basic tools as toys, we might as well just rebrand them into Riveting Rivets and Ronnie the Wrench so kids can get to work in literal Fun Factories. Even the argument that they are effective productivity devices actually hinges on the idea that they are boring—the physical equivalent of a white noise machine. Here is an adult man, in one of the more popular YouTube videos about fidget spinners, forlornly considering what went wrong with his life to get him to this place. But fidget spinners are really just the latest in a long line of boring toy trends to dominate kids’ minds. Before the spinning whirr came the incessant kerplunk of kids trying to flip plastic bottles with a little water in them so they landed upright; though the bottles were half-full, the spirit of the activity was surely half-empty. Before that, there were hoverboards—massive deceptions, given that they were just non-hovering segways made more dangerous by the deletion of a support pole—and, of course, Hatchimals, lauded by the industry, with awards like the 2017 Innovative Toy Of The Year award at the prestigious New York Toy Fair. But even they were just a massive coup of rebranding, a more irritating Kinder Surprise without any of the pleasures of eating chocolate that basically becomes a Furby. And once it’s born, the Hatchimal just makes needy demands that require disproportionate time and energy. Where’s the fun in that? (On this, parents might feel some common ground.) MORE: The lessons for investors in the hype and fall of Hatchimals But there’s more here than the mere fact that I, an ostensible adult, can’t get behind toys for kids these days. There’s a greater potential cost—one that’s much less an indictment of our children, and says more about the lack of innovation and creativity in the industries helping to shape their young minds. After all, a vast array of studies show that playing—an act that will invariably involve toys—fosters social and cognitive skills, while cultivating creativity and imagination among younger children. And according to a report from Sarah M. Fine, of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, “intellectual playfulness” remains a valuable thing to cultivate for high-school aged students, often the ones playing with water bottles and spinners. “Playful learning in adolescence is certainly not the same thing as playful learning in early childhood … But this does not mean that it is any less important,” she writes. “To the contrary, finding ways to support adolescent learners in learning playfully is more critical because it is less intuitive.” Kids’ toys should meet these needs—to encourage creativity, to focus on play value, to be better. “When I was designing toys, I would either go for something that was emotionally endearing to a child, or have play value—and ideally, I always wanted to have my toys teach kids something,” says Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm, whose own creations include the popular Beauty and the Beast Magic Mirror and who was a leading marketer of Crazy Bones. “Do these spinners teach kids anything? I’m not sure.” The fact that current toys aren’t doing that is a reflection of ongoing shifts in the toy industry, he says. Physical toys are appealing to a narrower slice of children as iPads and apps are introduced to younger and younger kids, says Fromm: “They outgrow the concept of having a physical toy earlier.” That trend hasn’t spurred significant changes to how toys are sold, either; a small concentration of toy creators and distributors is actually working to staunch true toy innovation to meet these evolving terms, much in the way that major movie studios are content to produce sequel after sequel, loath to try new things when comfortable profits are at stake. “I’ve created many toys, and I would take them to the executive panel of Toys R’ Us and Walmart, and if they weren’t going to buy that product, that product wasn’t going to get made—there was no point,” says Fromm. “Doesn’t mean the toy wasn’t good, it just means the big-box stores weren’t going to support it, and now everything has to be vetted by all the big players—Hasbro, Mattel, Spinmaster.” And so, with the industry centralizing into a few massive leaders—a 2013 report found that the top five U.S. toy companies hold more than 50 per cent of the market—companies producing physical toys are now leaning more than ever on the success of a strong few. When Mattel reported declining revenues in 2014, its CEO was clear about why: “We just didn’t sell enough Barbie dolls.” Kelly Ingram reacts while receiving a Hatchimal, a top toy of the season, at Walmart’s Black Friday event in Bentonville, AR on Nov. 24, 2016. (Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images for Walmart) Indeed, the fact that the market remains loaded with toys that are specific to boys and girls—homemaking toys and princess dolls advertised to girls, cars and industrious construction toys for boys—is tied into the forces behind the innovation drain. Despite studies suggesting that targeted toys helps hem boys and girls into prescribed gender roles by influencing career choices, those big-box stores are only now seeing the capitalist value of challenging those stereotypes. Indeed, the first offerings from Debbie Stirling, the founder of GoldieBlox—now one of the industry’s hottest names, selling toys aimed at inspiring an affection for sciences among girls—were rebuffed by bigwigs at the New York Toy Fair, the make-or-break hub and haven for the latest in toy trends. “They said girls don’t like engineering. Girls don’t like building. That’s a boy play pattern. Girls want to be princesses, they want to play fashion. Go look at the pink aisle,” she said in an interview with Public Radio International. There is one upside, perhaps, to at least the fidget spinner and the water-bottle flipping: it seems bad toys are forcing kids to find fun in other ways, like finding water (or in this case, flipped water bottles) in the desert. It feels like an active outgrowth of actual toys failing to make a mark on youth, causing kids to make do with what they have around—empty bottles, cheap ball-bearings—rather than the staid items being marketed at them. And it might be something the toy industry should consider as a warning sign; while toy sales continue to grow—Canada’s sales rose six per cent, to just over $2 billion—the actually number of toys sold are roughly flat, a quiet sign of a deteriorating market. It represents a disruption to the field that could loosen the grip of those big-box retail stores—and make innovation easier to achieve. After all, a non-toy improvisation was the initial inspiration for the original fidget spinner, created by a Florida inventor who was injured while caring for her young daughter. “I couldn’t pick up her toys or play with her much at all, so I started throwing things together with newspaper and tape then other stuff,” she said in The Guardian. “It wasn’t really even prototyping, it was some semblance of something, she’d start playing with it in a different way, I’d repurpose it.” Maybe that’s the best way to spin this latest trend—that children, failed by an unadventurous toy industry, have turned tchotchkes into playthings, so they can play on anyway. And good for them. After all, we must move forward, not backward; upward, and always twirling, twirling, twirling toward innovation.

CAse's President, Tom Dolan, was on hand Friday night at ARM & HAMMER Park to celebrate Pork Roll Night, and announce the River Fest. The annual event, which will be held on September 30 from 12-5 p.m., will feature the Case's Pork Roll Eating Championship, won by Joey Chestnut the last two years. The Thunder and Case's Pork Roll have seen their partnership grow stronger each year. The 2018 season, which will see the Thunder host the Eastern League All-Star Game and Case's sponsor the Home Run Derby, will be a time for both businesses (and the city of Trenton) to shine. "It means the world to us to partner up with such a great organization," Dolan said. "They have been a mainstay here for 24 years. Mayor (Eric) Jackson has just been tremendous with us. Anything we need, he has always been there to help us. "We love Trenton, and we want to stay in Trenton." Mayor Jackson was on hand as well Friday night, and he spoke glowingly about two jewels of the capital city. "Certainly, Case's Pork Roll is critically important to Trenton," Jackson said. "Just today, I had a few young entrepreneurs in the city. I was telling them about the great history of Trenton, how long they have been here, and what they mean to the economic engine of our city. "How they are now continuing to grow and expand, and the work that they do to support the children of our city, similar to the Trenton Thunder. This partnership that they have here continues to do the same. "What Tom is doing, not only to help the city of Trenton, but he is partnering with the Thunder. He is making a difference in the community. We do a Pork Roll Festival in the city, and it is amazing for the people that have not been introduced to pork roll. "But equal to that is the Pork Roll Eating Contest that they have here. I came out last year, and it was phenomenal to see the contestants, but also the number of people that came out to enjoy that event. It goes hand in hand. "They are great partners together. Certainly the city of Trenton is glad to partner with Case's Pork Roll, not only to have that outstanding business in our city, but they help generate additional economic activity in our city, and development as well." Dolan has been involved on the local baseball scene for more than two decades. He was an assistant coach for Nottingham High School, and also with the Bordentown Post 26 American Legion team that broke the stranglehold of Hamilton Post 31 in the Mercer County American Legion League. So becoming so involved with the Thunder was optimal. "It is definitely top of the list," Dolan said. "We have been growing with them, with our sponsorship. It has been a good fit for both Case's Pork Roll and the Trenton Thunder. "The 2018 All-Star game is going to be a showcase event, for Trenton and for Case's Pork Roll too. It is going to be huge to be a part of that, and we are really excited to partner up with the Trenton Thunder. It is going to be great." Mike Ford heads to Triple A Scranton; 5 reasons for the Thunder's hot start Ronald Herrera did not have his best stuff of the season Thursday night, but it was enough to power the Thunder (24-14) to a three-game road sweep of New Hampshire. Herrera (4-0 with a 1.14 ERA on the season in four starts) worked through the 90-plus degree temperatures to go 5.1 innings, before he left the game in the 9-2 Thunder victory. Trenton manager Bobby Mitchell spoke about his fight to get as far into the contest as he could without his best stuff. "He wasn't as sharp as he normally is," Mitchell said. "His breaking ball wasn't as sharp, but he gets by because he is able to command the ball and not walk anybody. So he gave up a two-run homer. "I think he got tired, too, because it was 94. He started to feel the heat a little bit, not pitching as much as the other guys have. Then he just let a curveball get away from him and gave up a two-run homer. "He was a little up in the zone. But he makes adjustments well, and throws strikes. He lets his defense work, and we did. He only gave up the two runs, which is good." *** Friday night, Domingo Acevedo made his Double A debut, as the Thunder hosted Portland in the first of a three-game set. The number 12 prospect in the New York Yankees system has a devastating fastball, which sits anywhere from the upper-90's to 100 miles per hour.  Contact Sean Miller at seanmillertrentontimes@gmail.com. Follow him on Twitter @TheProdigalSean View Comments nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters Frequently Asked Questions More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

So, I began. The first newsletter I read from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) would almost have me on the verge of tears. I'm not the one in my family who cries easily. My older sister does, but the EDF article "Trial by fire" brought me very close to angry tears. On a day that usually makes Americans proud and happy, too many of us weren't. - Advertisement - On this day--January 20, 2017--Donald Trump became our president. If that wasn't bad enough, on this same day at high noon, EPA's climate website went dark. What a terrible way to start a presidency by showing contempt for an environmental agency. EDF staffers had been alerted to this happening, and their legal team kicked into gear. They filed a request with the EPA under the Freedom of Information Act to restore public access to data. The Trump administration's attempt to conceal the truth was thwarted by their timely action. This set in motion a legal process to ensure the preservation of health and air-pollution data. General Counsel Vickie Patton observed: "During these extraordinary times, the law is our strongest ally." Then, four days later, rumors spread that there was a plan to permanently take down all climate-related material from the EPA's website. But EDF attorneys Peter Zalzal and Martha Roberts put together a team of over a dozen young attorneys and legal fellows to address this fear. Together they huddled around their laptops in EDF offices in Boulder, CO, and Washington, D.C. They managed to download data sets to ensure that climate information compiled over the years wasn't lost. I believe we owe this group a debt of gratitude. Zalzal observed "This scientific data is the foundation for sound environment and health policy. To eliminate it would be unprecedented." Thankfully, because of their timely work and the work of others, the administration backed off. - Advertisement - It is good to know that we have these environmental lawyers defending the public interest. They oppose any retreat from the Paris Climate Agreement. They even have managed to convince companies like Walmart that environmental protection pays. Walmart has been an EDF partner for more than ten years, and they have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by one billion tons by 2030. The EDF has also done considerable environmental work in some states. With their help, Illinois passed a law that will double the state's renewable energy by 2030 and cut power-sector carbon pollution by more than half. In Ohio they have succeeded in urging Governor John Kasich to veto a bill that would have gutted energy efficiency and renewable investments in the state and cost at least 80,000 jobs. In New York they helped win approval of a new rate plan for its major electric utility, which will increase energy-efficiency funding and other incentives for electric vehicles. California enacted the clean cars law in 2002 with backing from EDF. In 2006 they passed landmark legislation co-sponsored by EDF that is lowering emissions even as the state's economy flourishes. Yes, my coffee table is still groaning under the weight of too much mail and reading material, but I'm glad that I took the time to learn about the wonderful, needful work of EDF. God bless their endeavors. I know that they will keep a vigilant eye on the Trump administration and hopefully will thwart them in any way that is destructive to our environment. - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - View Ratings | Rate It I have been concerned about animal suffering ever since I received my first puppy Peaches in 1975.

Suburbs Post-Tribune Post-Tribune News Whiting's Garage Mahal brings out sellers and bargain-hunters Jim Karczewski/Post-Tribune Fred Serrano, left, and Rossanne Oroczo sell an array of items Saturday during the city Whiting's annual Garage Mahal. Fred Serrano, left, and Rossanne Oroczo sell an array of items Saturday during the city Whiting's annual Garage Mahal. (Jim Karczewski/Post-Tribune) Michelle L. QuinnPost-Tribune Privacy Policy For a brief second, a bug distracted Melody Vasquez from her job of raking in the cash. The 6-year-old bent over the table set up by her mom, Rossanne Oroszco, during the city of Whiting's Garage Mahal Saturday afternoon, inspecting the flying creature that landed between bottles of shampoo and shaving cream. It was an interesting diversion from working on padding the bank account she just opened a month ago. "I'm selling my toys because I don't use them anymore," Melody said. She wasn't sure if she was going to use her windfall to save for something big or sock it away for a "rainy day," but she knows her family has done well by participating in the annual event. Her mom use the citywide garage sale to sell off her vast stash of personal hygiene products, which she accumulates over the course of the year. She's a couponer, so she ends up with a lot of surplus, Rossanne Oroszco said. "I can't hold all this in my house," she said, laughing. "It's how I circulate my stuff." Her dad, Fred Serrano, does the same thing with movies. The ones he doesn't sell in a year, he brings back the following year. At 25 cents a pop, the hundreds of DVDs he had were priced to sell. And Mallory Santucci, of Chicago's Hegewisch neighborhood, came ready to buy; she walked out with at least 10 movies she's never seen. "Why not? I'd go buy them at Walmart for $3 or $5, and these are a quarter," Santucci said. "All right, I have to get out of this town before I spend all my money." There was plenty of opportunity to lighten the wallet. With more than 150 houses cleaning out their trash/treasures, one would be hard-pressed to not find something. Serrano said he'd like to see to see the Whiting/Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce have two or three Garage Mahals over the course of the year. Mary Hassen, meanwhile, plans to be a "one and done" seller during the giant sale. The only reason she opened her garage was because her son, Ryan Knazur, just bought his own house and was cleaning out his stuff. "I told him I'd give him whatever money we made, so he can have all $23," Hassen said. "I sold a table, proving to the guy it was waterproof as the rain beaded up on it." "And I told her, 'I'm not going through your crap when you die,'" Knazur said, smiling. One buyer took a box of old Atari and Nintendo cartridges off Hassen's and Knazur's hands, Hassen said. Had Jordan Roberts and Joe Pranaitis, both of Whiting, gotten there a bit earlier, they would've scooped them right up. "I'm an aficionado, and the old stuff is worth a lot more," Roberts said. "But I did get the first two 'Jackass' movies -- unrated versions, even -- but the 'Jackass 3' T-shirt was sold. "Why does all the bad stuff happen to me?" If it weren't for a friend's birthday Saturday, Pranaitis wouldn't have been out at all. "I avoid Garage Mahal day like the plague," he said. Michelle L.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Costco to report fiscal Q3 numbers May 25 Shutterstock photo What’s Happening Retailer Costco ( COST ) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on May 25. Analysts forecast the company to post earnings of $1.31 per share, up from $1.24 during the same period last year. The stock has been trending higher, with shares up 7.3% on the year. Technical Analysis COST was recently trading at $171.37, down $11.81 from its 12-month high and $29.95 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for COST are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $169.00 and recent resistance below $175.00. Of the 18 analysts who cover the stock, 11 rate it a „strong buy”, one rates it a „buy”, and six rate it a „hold”. The stock receives S&P Capital IQ’s 3 STARS „Hold” ranking. Analyst’s Thoughts When Costco’s relationship with American Express ( AXP ) ended in 2016, the Street feared that it would have a material impact on the company’s bottom line, but those fears have subsided, and Wall Street came back into the stock in the latter part of 2016, and shares have steadily appreciated through the current year. Earnings and sales did disappoint last quarter, which initially drove the stock lower before traders came back and drove shares to a new all-time high at the beginning of May. The stock’s valuation is a bit high, with a P/E of 31.7, but analysts see earnings rising by 5.8% in 2017 and 13.3% in 2018. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.31, but the street has a slightly higher whisper number of $1.33, which is the number the market will really need to see for shares to move higher. It has not be the best earnings season for retailers in general, but so far it has been mall-based retailers that felt the most pain, with retailers such as Wal-Mart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) enjoying nice gains following their reports. In both cases, e-commerce growth played a role, an area where Costco has lagged its competitors. Costco started putting more focus on its online business last year, and Wall Street will pay close attention to whether or not the company is starting to see online sales rise. Watch not only for the company’s quarterly numbers, but also any sign as to the health of the company’s e-commerce growth. Stock Only Trade If you’re looking to establish a long stock position in COST, consider buying the stock under $171.25. Sell if it falls below $154.50 or take profits if it gets to $197.00. Bullish Trade If you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on COST, consider an October 140/145 bull-put credit spread for a 30-cent credit. That’s a potential 6.4% return (15.1% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 15.2% to cause a problem. Bearish Trade If you would prefer to take a bearish stance on COST at this time, consider an October 190/195 bear-call credit spread for a $0.50 credit. That’s a potential 11.1% return (26.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 11.2% to cause a problem. Covered Call Trade If you are upbeat on the stock, but would prefer to build in some protection in the event of an earnings miss, consider an October $173 covered call. Buy COST shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the October $173.00 call for a debit of $165.00 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 4.8%, and a target annualized return of 11.5% (for comparison purposes only).

But some people are earning their names for being capable of launching thriving businesses in succession. They are called "serial entrepreneurs." According to the Oxford English Dictionary, serial entrepreneur refers to "an entrepreneur who starts up or runs multiple successive businesses, especially one who moves on as soon as the challenge or thrill of making a venture profitable is over." The word was added to the dictionary in 2013, reflecting blooming startup entrepreneurship worldwide. In Korea, Kakao's founder Kim Beom-su, and Chang Byung-gyu, who currently is leading game development company Bluehole, are among the most popular Korean serial entrepreneurs. Born in 1966, Kim studied industrial engineering at Seoul National University. His trail of serial entrepreneurship started when he left Samsung SDS in 1998 and launched an internet cafe franchise, Mission No. 1. In 1999, Kim founded a web-based online game portal Hangame Communication. The business thrived on the back of the explosive spread of the high-speed internet in Korea. In 2000, he successfully led the merger of Hangame and Naver. He worked at the merged company, which was renamed NHN in 2001, until 2007 when he left his own company again. In December 2006, even before Kim left NHN, he founded a startup called IWILAB in the United States. This startup later developed and launched Kakao Talk, which has now become Korea's most-used mobile instant messenger. As the messenger drew over 1 million users, the startup changed its name to Kakao in 2010. In 2012, Kim established the venture capital firm K Cube Ventures aimed at fostering promising startups in mobile services, games and future technology. Currently, Kim is the chairman of Kakao and the CEO of Kakao Brain, a subsidiary dedicated to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Chang Byung-gyuChang was born in 1973 and studied computer science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for his doctoral degree. In 1997, Jang established internet service company Neowiz as one of eight co-founders. While he worked as the CTO and internet business head at Neowiz, he contributed to the success of the online chat service Sayclub. As Neowiz started to turn to the online game portal business, Chang left the company in 2005 and founded the startup First Snow and developed a namesake search engine. Chang and his company sold the search engine technology to NHN for 35 billion won ($31 million) a year later. At that time, Chang distributed 30 percent of his own shares in the company, worth an estimated 10.5 billion won, to about 60 employees. In 2007, he established game development company Bluehole. The company released an online computer game called Tera in 2011. The game, in which some 40 billion won was invested for development, has been provided both in Korea and in overseas markets. Like the Kakao founder, Chang also started a venture capital company named Bon Angels in 2012. It mainly seeks for angel investment in startups in their early stages. Overseas cases In the U.S., Tesla founder Elon Musk is considered as one of the most popular serial entrepreneurs. Born in the Republic of South Africa in 1971, Musk founded the software company Global Link Information Network in California in 1995 together with his brother Kimbal. The company changed its named to Zip2 a year later and has provided online city guide software to media companies including The New York Times. Upon the expansion of the company, Musk sold it to Compaq computers for over $300 million in 1999. He also participated in the founding of online financial service firm X.com and internet payment service PayPal, which was later sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded the space business company SpaceX and struck a $1.6 billion deal with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 2008 to join a program to privatize national space delivery systems. A year later, he famously established electric vehicle maker Tesla. Musk has not stopped and is working on the Hyperloop high-speed transportation system project, a not-for-profit AI research firm OpenAI and neurotechnology startup Neuralink. Another example is Marc Lore, who currently heads Walmart's e-commerce business in the U.S. Lore used to work in banking before starting a sports card trading business called the Pit. It was sold to U.S. memorabilia company Topps in 2001. In 2005, Lore launched an online diaper delivery company called Diapers.com. The company and its affiliates, Soap.com and Wag.com, gained popularity from young parents and was sold to Amazon for $545 million in 2011. He established e-commerce company Jet in 2014, which was acquired by Walmart two years later for over $3 billion. "The success of serial entrepreneurs is based on their bold spirit for challenge and sheer pursuit of innovation, not profit," an industry source said. "To keep the IT industry active and innovative, we need more serial entrepreneurs who don't settle for easy gains at hand." yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter 'Human spider' successfully scales 555-meter skyscraper with bare hands [PHOTOS] A glimpse of Seoul's first overpass-turned-park [PHOTOS] 25 Koreans arrested in Philippines over alleged fraud, illegal gambling Roy Kim seeks to 'Blossom' again with new album First lady's surprising way to help husband: cooking for politicians Activists condemn lax probe of sex tourism suspects Remains found in Sewol confirmed as student's Korean TV station under fire for 'Go to Hell, Mr Roh' image Moon pledges to revise Constitution Moon, Trump doing 'Gangnam Style' together First day Last day as governor Last day as PM Minor contender's appeal Korea Defense Veterans Association Cooling off Race to presidency Getting campaign ready Marine Corps change of command Foal Eagle exercise Park's impeachment About Korea Times CEO Message Times History Contents Distribution Media Kit Contact Us Location Privacy Statement Ombudsman Mobile Service PDF Service RSS Service

Published 3 hours ago With all the racism still going on today, it’s nice to hear a story about true love and sacrifice. That’s what Aaron and Rachel Halbert, a young white married couple did when they not only adopted two dark-skinned children (one boy, one girl), but also delivered three other black children via embryos that were frozen for 15 years. This story is so miraculous for a number of reasons. First, Rachel had been having complications conceiving children of her own. Second, the couple was only expecting to have two children as only two embryos had been implanted into her. One had apparently split into two and therefore she birthed Ryley, Anne Waverly and Whitley. The Aaron and Rachel says they’ve been a targets of disapproving looks from both white and black people. "We knew, especially in the South, that a white couple with non-white children would draw a myriad of different reactions,” Aaron told the Washington Post. “There will always be the older white woman in Walmart who stared at us with sheer disgust, or the African-American mother who looked at us and just shook her head." Regardless, the couple chose to actually back up the true principles of their evangelical faith and embrace all humanity, while providing homes to children who may not otherwise have one. Their family has reportedly been super supportive of their decisions so far. "It’s been heartening to see virtually all of our friends and family express overwhelming support for our family and the unusual ways we’ve built it,” Aaron says. “In our minds, we are just living out our dream. A dream that may not look like the average family, but one that we are thankful could come true in light of our country’s history.” See pics of the full family below (via Facebook).

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Andy Musliner was sitting on the floor playing cars with his then-3-year-old son when it occurred to him that the cars needed roads. "It's an obvious pairing — toy cars go with toy roads," Musliner said. "If you have a toy car, it needs a road to drive on, yet the toy industry had not created an opportunity for kids to make roads." That idea led the Baltimore area resident on a quest to start a toy company and ultimately create a new category — tape as toy. Musliner started InRoad Toys, which makes PlayTape, rolls of tape printed to resemble roads fit for tiny vehicles. The tape sticks to walls, floors, tables or any flat surface, and pulls up without damaging surfaces. It appears to have filled a need, meeting demand from parents who want to encourage creativity and from retailers looking for something new in the toy category. It's also a twist on the consumer tape industry's growing decorative and crafting segment. When PlayTape was introduced three years ago, it was sold at a few small toy stores. Now it's sold in 35 countries. Wal-Mart sells it at 3,500 stores and online. It's also available online at Toys 'R' Us, select Target stores and O'Reilly's Auto Parts. "Vehicle play is an evergreen category that kids have naturally gravitated toward for generations," said Joe Contrino, a spokesman for Toys 'R' Us. PlayTape "takes a simple, but unique spin on the category." InRoad projects sales this year of between $2.5 million and $5 million. "PlayTape is the world's simplest toy," and therein lies its appeal, said Musliner, InRoad's CEO. "Kids who play with toy cars can make a road anywhere they want. Parents are really interested in enabling their kids to use their imaginations and enabling them to develop their motor skills, to really play and get off the screens." "My kids love it," said Christy Barbaran, a Baltimore mother of boys 5 years and 21 months old. "We went on a road trip in March, and that saved us a few times. They created elaborate tracks over wood floors in the hotel and entertained themselves. They run their Hot Wheels over it for hours and hours."

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Anne Kelly, founder and president of JunoActive in Mendota Heights, describes her company as a niche of a niche. It offers plus-size activewear for women at higher-than-average prices. The former catalog business, now online, sells swimwear, activewear, intimates and athletic shoes for women size 14 to 6x. Dresses, suitcoats and blouses have never been part of the mix, despite customers’ requests. Since she started the company in 1995, Kelly has resisted opening a retail store because the profit margins were better online. But more than a week ago, she opened Juno’s first foray into bricks and mortar at Mall of America. It’s on the first floor in the athleisure wing that includes Athleta, Lululemon and Fabletics. Kelly, 64, talked to the Star Tribune about why she decided to open her first retail store when so many apparel stores are closing and even athleisure star Lululemon appears to be lagging. Q: Why venture into retail when bricks and mortar is so beleaguered? A: Growth in e-commerce is getting more and more expensive. We wanted another channel to be less dependent on e-commerce. As a small company we think to be contrarian is a huge opportunity.   Q: What appealed to you about Mall of America? A: There’s more people aware of our brand at Mall of America. About 98 percent of our customers live outside of Minnesota, and we wanted a place with as many tourists as Mall of America. We’re in a beautiful spot in the heart of the fashion front. We’re close to the Apple and Microsoft stores too, so we’re hoping for good traffic counts. The mall can expand our visibility and reach.   Q: The store has been open only 10 days, but what have you already learned? A: Customers coming into the store give very specific advice. They tell us they want more stomach control in active pants and more high-control sport bras. We’re small enough that we can get our director of merchandise and sales on it within three days.   Q: How long of a lease did you sign? A: It’s a 12-month lease, part of the mall’s temporary leasing program.   Q: What should plus-size women unfamiliar with JunoActive know about the brand? A: We pay a lot of attention to fit. We spend a lot of time shaping arm holes and determining the neckline on a swimsuit and making sure the back is cute and sexy. We want women to enjoy wearing our clothes and collect compliments. We use really good fabrics because we want the clothes to last.   Q: Many of your items have a high-tech element. A: We take a functional approach, so we’ll look at the same fabrics that marathoners use. Fabrics that stretch, reduce chafing and reduce moisture. Our SoftWik collection is very popular. The fabric is so yummy you just want to pet it. We make leggings, capris and T-shirts out of it. QuikWik is a heavier fabric that’s made domestically. We make bottoms and bra tops out of it. We’re working with an Italian swimwear company on a fabric they use for competitive swimmers. I keep an eye on the high-tech market.   Q: I’m guessing these are not inexpensive fabrics. A: We’re upper moderate. Women can always find a cheaper legging, but I challenge them to find one that lasts as long and feels as good. There are a lot of plus-size women out there, but not all of them are looking for quality at a higher price point. We’re not Wal-Mart or Target.   Q: Shoes are a recent addition. What’s your thinking about shoes? A: We brought in Altra shoes from Icon that focus on the runner’s market. They have a wider toe box and no raised heel. They’re extremely comfortable. I don’t think anyone else at the mall sells them.   Q: Your company went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012. What happened? A: After the recession our customers just quit buying. The plus-size customer cut back even more. She puts herself last. We did a reorganization not because of the fundamentals, but mostly because an old warehouse partner threatened a large lawsuit.   Q: You don’t mail out catalogs anymore. How has it affected the business to be strictly e-commerce? A: Revenues used to be much higher with the catalog, about $12 million in 2001-2002. We’re in the $3 million to $5 million range after we stopped selling national brands like Danskin, but with control of our own label, profits are much better. With the catalog, we had to have a ton of stuff in the warehouse, but with e-commerce we can bring things in more slowly. We’re seeing growth in the 5 to 15 percent range in the past two years.   Q: Your company was originally called Junonia. In 2012, you renamed it JunoActive. Why did you choose Juno, the Roman goddess of love? A: From the beginning, it was a way to name the company after a woman who’s powerful and supreme. In art, she’s always represented as a large woman but one who’s also body positive.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Blessing the community: Students donate special bags to help the homeless Saturday May 20, 2017 at 12:06 PM May 20, 2017 at 12:06 PM By Joselyn Villalobos Staff Writer HESPERIA — As members of the Community Ambassadors, two fourth-grader took their title as serious as can be when they got the idea to create “blessing bags” for the homeless. During passion week at Mesquite Trails Elementary School, Giana Anaya and Aislyn Trujillo had a number of topics to chose from but chose to stay a team in improving the town. “There were many other activities they could have chosen but they decided they wanted to give back,” Mesquite Trails Elementary Speech Therapist Marilee Henderson said. Mesquite Trails Elementary School holds Passion Week each year, allowing teachers to express their passion by offering the students a variety of programs to join. Henderson is the teacher behind the Community Ambassadors and together the trio created a number of “blessing bags” containing a book, blanket, stuffed animal and pair of pajamas. Aislyn and Giana brought a few books and stuffed animals from home to fill the bags. They also received donations from the Wal-Mart in Hesperia, according to Henderson. “I got emotional to be honest. I was so impressed that they were thinking of others who were less fortunate than them,” Henderson said. “I am proud of them for being so driven to make a difference for others they haven't ever met.” Although Aislyn and Giana are the only students in the program, Henderson plans to bring the Community Ambassadors back for passion week next year and hopes to make it a club that operates all year long. “I am so blessed to have been part of these girls' vision, Aislyn and Giana made me so proud and I can't wait to see what we can do in the future,” Henderson said. Aislyn and Giana were not able to physically hand the bags out to the children at the High Desert Homeless Services, but they received pictures of the process once the bags were distributed. “They were excited to make the donation but sad that they couldn't hand them out personally. I hope that next time we donate that they will be able to meet the kids they are helping,” Henderson said. For more information on the program, call Mesquite Trails Elementary School at 760-949-8149.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A furious pace of store closings and bankruptcies has drummed up fears that U.S. retail is collapsing. Not so fast: Many indicators suggest that retail employment is unlikely to shrivel and the economy will withstand any shock from the sector’s rout. Granted, the industry’s current woes can’t be ignored. Retail sales account for almost half of consumer spending, which in turn makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Retailers employ 15.9 million people, or about one in every 10 U.S. workers, and positions at certain types of stores may become harder to find. For starters, the broad trend in retail purchases is moving higher: Excluding auto dealers and gas stations, sales were up an annualized 4.6 percent over the past three months. Even with recent job losses, retail headcount is close to its 12-month average. Such figures suggest the industry is hardly about to shrink or fade away. Even with the “eye-catching headlines about store closings” and other recent struggles in retail, “we don’t see much of an effect on retail employment and therefore on consumer spending,” said Robert Sockin, an economist at UBS Securities LLC, which issued research last week titled “Reports of Retail’s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated”. “As long as there’s demand for workers and the consumer stays healthy, that will keep the retail sector buoyant.” It’s true that store closings are already outpacing those of 2008, when the U.S. was in a deep recession, according to an April 6 report from Credit Suisse. About 2,880 announcements so far this year exceed the 1,153 over the same period of 2016, the investment bank said. Macy’s Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. are shutting hundreds of locations combined, and shoe chain Payless Inc. recently joined the list of retailers filing for bankruptcy.   Driving the doom and gloom are pockets of weakness such as department stores and clothing chains that are casualties in the battle between brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. While that has led to consolidation and a shift of market share from traditional and mall-based locations to more agile online businesses, the latter’s share of total retail sales remains below 10 percent.  Employment data reflect the pain -- general-merchandise stores lost jobs in five of the past six months while nonstore retailers are expanding payrolls, though not at a fast enough pace to make up for the shortfall. Still, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire more than 30,000 part-time workers over the next year, in addition to 100,000 full-time positions, for its growing network of warehouses around the country. With the industry in a so-called overbuilt situation, a real-estate shakeout is not uncommon every few years, and the rise of online retailers is worsening the distress this time. Underneath the hubbub is the news that some companies are actually expanding their selling space and realizing the need to have a strong presence both physically and online. Ulta Beauty Inc. plans to add 100 stores a year, with a goal of eventually having 1,700 U.S. locations. Amazon is opening bookstores and online eyeglasses-retailer Warby Parker is setting up more stores. Adding to the mix, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, is intensifying its e-commerce push, while Kenneth Cole Productions plans to shutter stores in favor of selling on the Internet.  Malls and their stores, while not as much of a destination as they were in their heyday, aren’t about to vanish completely. A report from Cowen & Co. shows most customers still prefer to shop in physical stores 75 percent of the time. Stores open and close all the time, so what really matters are net closings and net employment dictated by companies’ expansion and contraction rather than just store closings, according to UBS. Based on historical patterns, Sockin expects net retail jobs to rise in 2017. At 4.2 percent, the retail unemployment rate is below the nation’s 4.4 percent, and the industry’s job openings and quits -- a measure of confidence in being able to find another job -- each posted the second-best March in more than 15 years. And the American shopper, the pillar of the household spending-driven economy, remains on solid ground amid robust job growth, improving finances, and low borrowing costs. Even as department stores lose traffic, consumers are spending on services and shopping at sellers of health and beauty products, electronics, furniture. Their purchasing power is the best bet against the misplaced fear that the ailing retail industry is heading to the graveyard. As Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, put it, “while we’ve seen these headlines, the consumer hasn’t gone away.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

The catch is, the series will focus on the 364 days a year when the Purge doesn’t take place. The Purge TV show will be Purge-less. Honestly, it will probably be fine. It might even be good. But we’re still going to have fun with it anyway. ********** A young married couple, Brent and Sarah, has been planning a vacation. Sarah bounds into the living room with good news. SARAH: Great news, I just booked our Italian vacation. BRENT: Oh, nice. SARAH: Our flight leaves on March 17 and we come back on the 31st. I called the hotel and they said th-… what’s wrong? You’re making a face. BRENT: It’s just… if we’re in Italy on the 21st… SARAH: Oh God. Is this about the stupid Purge? BRENT: I don’t wanna miss it! Me and the guys were gonna go to Best Buy and purge new big screen TVs. SARAH: Ugh, why don’t you just buy a new TV? You make $250,000 a year at the law firm. You don’t have to steal one. BRENT: [muttering] It’s not the same. SARAH: Well, I’m sorry, but the vacation has been booked. We’ll be in Italy. You’ll just have to take one year off of purging. BRENT: [still muttering] Well then maybe I’ll just purge myself some gelato while we’re there. SARAH: What was that? BRENT: Nothing. ********** Getty Image A man, Henry, rushes into Wal-Mart the night before the Purge. The shelves are mostly empty. Henry is panicked. He tracks down an employee. HENRY: Hey, do you have anything I can use in the Purge tomorrow? Like, weapons? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Isn’t it a little late to be Purge shopping, sir? HENRY: I know, I know. I was just so busy. Do you guys have any guns left? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Nope, outta guns. HENRY: Hunting knives? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Outta them, too. HENRY: Regular knives, like for the kitchen? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Nope. HENRY: Baseball bats? Hockey sticks? Golf clubs? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Just sold my last set of clubs not 20 minutes ago. HENRY: Well, do you have anything I can use? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: I got a rake. HENRY: A rake? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Yup. HENRY: How am I supposed to purge with a rake? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: I’ve seen people purge with a rake. HENRY: I… is it at least a metal rake? Or does it have a wooden shaft I can sharpen into a spear? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Nope. Plastic. It’s one of those little children’s rakes. HENRY: Hold on. You’re telling me the only thing even resembling a weapon in this entire store is a plastic children’s rake? WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: Yes, sir. HENRY: But you can’t kill someone with a plastic children’s rake. WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: I suppose not. Seems to be the point, actually. Can’t have kids getting hurt and all. HENRY: Ugh. Okay, fine. Give me the rake. I’ll figure something out. Lemme just go grab some Sour Patch Kids and I’ll meet you at the register. WAL-MART EMPLOYEE: We’re out of Sour Patch Kids. HENRY: Dammit!

It was just after 1 a.m. on Thursday and Archie, a mother of two from Jackson, had left the Toyota Camry running and the doors apparently unlocked. She was buying medicine, her family said, and Kingston had asked to stay in the car. In just a few hours, Kingston was scheduled to graduate from kindergarten. Instead, he was driven away by carjackers. After nine hours, police found his mother’s stolen vehicle abandoned on a dead-end road. Kingston was in the back seat, fatally shot in the head. Authorities later arrested three teenagers. Capital murder charges are pending, authorities said. “This is a 6-year-old that’s gone,” Kingston’s cousin, Kolby Irby, told reporters at the crime scene as the boy’s anguished family wept nearby. “His mother has to deal with it. That’s her baby.” At several news conferences Thursday, visibly emotional authorities offered few details to equally unnerved reporters about why the suspects killed Kingston rather than let him out of the car. It’s unclear if they knew the boy was in the Camry at the time it was stolen. Security footage from the Jackson Kroger showed two men in a two-door Honda Civic pull up beside Archie’s parked Toyota Camry shortly after she entered the store, authorities said. The passenger jumped out of the Civic and into the Camry, where Kingston slept. Both vehicles sped away. Authorities offered conflicting timetables of the early hours of their investigation. A spokesman for the Madison County Sheriff’s Office told the New York Times that Archie left her son in the car at about 1:15 a.m. and that the Camry was stolen during the 10 to 15 minute window during which she was inside the store. But at an afternoon news conference, Hinds County Sheriff Victor Mason said a deputy stationed at the Kroger saw Archie exit the store at about 2:30 a.m. She approached the deputy and said her car was missing, but did not initially report that her son was inside, Mason said. What began as an auto-theft investigation became a kidnapping case, and at 4:30 a.m. the Mississippi Department of Public Safety issued an Amber Alert, reported the Clarion-Ledger. Later in the morning, law enforcement and family pleaded with Kingston’s kidnappers to bring the boy home. “We’re just asking, regardless of who you are, what you are and where you are, if you could just return the child,” the child’s uncle, David Archie, told the Clarion-Ledger. “Leave him somewhere, find a way to get him to a store, to a gas station, to a restaurant, Walmart, anywhere people are and just drop him off.” “He doesn’t even know what was going on,” David Archie added. Just before 10 a.m., authorities canceled the Amber Alert. During another news conference about 30 minutes later they announced that a man in Madison County had discovered the missing Camry. The body of the boy was inside. Apparently unaware of the horrible news, some of the boy’s family members arrived at the crime scene during the news conference – and that’s how they found out that Kingston was gone forever. A family member screamed “No!” and “He was a baby!” Authorities cut short their update. Across town, at the district attorney’s office, another heart-wrenching scene unfolded as the rest of Kingston’s family, including his mother, learned he had died. They had been misinformed that the child was safe, reported the Clarion-Ledger, but cries rang out as one by one they absorbed the truth. Ebony Archie, barefoot and crying, was almost catatonic. A cousin carried her limp body from the office building, according to the Clarion-Ledger. “Kingston?” she asked. “Where is Kingston?” Police there wiped tears from their eyes, the newspaper reported. By Thursday night, all three suspects were in custody at the Madison County Jail. Two were 17 years old. The age of the third was unavailable. All are being held without bond pending formal charges. If convicted they could be subject to the death penalty. One of the juveniles in custody is a senior at Ridgeland High School, a football player until he was dismissed from the team last year, Superintendent Ronnie McGehee told the Clarion-Ledger. “Everyone that was praying for us, that we would find Kingston alive, we want to thank everybody for that, but this is, really, this is, it’s hard to know that people out there are evil, that would kill a child. That’s evil,” the boy’s great aunt, Velma Eddington, told the Clarion-Ledger. “That baby hadn’t done anything to him. That baby hadn’t done nothing. They could have left that child on that back seat, asleep. They didn’t have to kill him. Those people are evil. Evil.” Family members described Kingston as a warm, fun-loving child who loved to be spoiled by his uncles and “aunties.” “Even if I was mad at the world, I couldn’t do this to a 6-year-old,” David Archie told the Clarion-Ledger. “To me, it’s hatred. There is nothing out there worth taking a 6-year-old’s life.” Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber said that his city needed to make clear there was “no tolerance on any level for acts of violence against children.” In a statement on Facebook, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant called Kingston’s death “senseless.” “There are no words to express the anger and sadness over the loss of Kingston Frazier,” Bryant said. “The innocence and life of a six-year-old child have been taken by a horrific crime. It is time this senseless violence end.” At school on Thursday, the kindergarten graduation ceremony in which Kingston was meant to participate went on without him. “He was everybody’s baby,” the school’s principal, Kimberly Smith, told MS News Now. “He was a sweet child to be around. He was Kingston.”   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Mark Zuckerberg vacationing in rural Maine; spotted dining Friday night in Bangor 1-year-old killed in Alton Elementary car accident identified LePage refuses to put up National Monument road signs Route 11 in Belgrade closed after officer-involved shooting Search and rescue group using drone to find missing Maine dog The EPA asked which rules should be repealed.

Hot Topics: 3 dead in Erie home Operation Crystal Stiletto Planned Parenthood closing Colo. 66 St. Vrain teacher of the year News tips Longmont man in 'Operation Crystal Stiletto' grand jury indictment said he isn't a 'dope dealer' By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   05/19/2017 05:34:52 PM MDT Updated:   05/19/2017 10:30:50 PM MDT Lucas Trujillo (Courtesy photo) When Lucas Trujillo isn't cutting a friend's hair in his old-school barbershop at his Gunbarrel town house, he said he's outside building decks or remodeling rooms as a handyman. "I've come a long way from where I was," he said. But that's now on hold. Trujillo, 37, last week was charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in a Boulder County grand jury indictment alleging that he and at least eight others were involved in an enterprise of trading pounds of methamphetamine and heroin across the Front Range. "I've never even seen a pound of meth in my life," he said. In an interview at the Boulder County Jail on Friday, Trujillo said the accusations are false, and though he's made mistakes, he's a good man who provides for his children and fiancée. Since the news of his arrest, he said family and friends have believed the allegations of the case dubbed "Operation Crystal Stiletto" before he even had his chance to share his side of the story — a motivation for reaching out to the Times-Call. "I feel like I'm getting absolutely torn down before I even enter the courtroom," he said. Advertisement On May 10, Trujillo and others in handcuffs and orange jumpsuits appeared in a courtroom of the Boulder County Justice Center, where they were handed copies of indictments. He said it was the first time he had ever met the others involved, other than his best friend, Michael Montez, and his older brother, Jason, who is also charged in the case and faces the same allegations. According to Trujillo's indictment, police believe on April 27 Montez spoke over the phone with Lucas Trujillo and his brother, Jason, about attempting to get money from the two for drugs. "Lucas stated he had split one with his brother Jason Trujillo and that his brother owed $2,200," the document reads. "Montez complained he did not have the money to cover more product." The indictment said that later that day, Montez was seen by police driving his Audi to a house in the 6600 block of Kalua Road in Boulder to meet the Trujillo brothers for money. The indictment said he then left to meet Ricardo Cordova, another man charged in the suspected drug enterprise. Trujillo said they weren't talking about drugs, but rather a transaction for two Cadillac wheels. He said he spends a lot of time with Montez, and "just because we went to Walmart together doesn't mean it's drug related." He admitted that he has used methamphetamine at the gram level. He said he would share his personal-use stash with friends at times, never charging them more than $10 and $20. "I'm not guilty of being a major, huge dope dealer in a big ring," he said. "That's not me at all. I've never ripped profit off it or anything like that." According to Colorado court records, Trujillo has a lengthy criminal record of at least 11 misdemeanors and at least four felonies, with the most recent being a 2010 felony conviction for attempting to escape from prison for a felony pawnbroking conviction. Trujillo said he grew up in Longmont and graduated from Niwot High School. He said he's proud of his barbershop and his woodworking projects, such as a deck in his backyard. "I want the opportunity to still be able to do that," he said. Short of bond by about $700, Trujillo said he is hopeful he'll be out of jail soon. He said he has sold his DVD players, television and surround sound system to afford 10 percent of the $50,000 total bond. "I need to be out with my family right now before I go ahead with these court proceedings," he said. "I'm not going to run. I've always been a man that's faced my problems head-on." His fiancée, Jessica LaSalle, said her soon-to-be-husband isn't concerned with himself right now, but is worried about how to provide for her and her two young children that he calls his own. She said it has been difficult to watch everyone turn their back on him before he has a chance at fair trial. "This man is my world and right now it doesn't work without him," she said in an email.

Richard Jensen, 39, showed up at a Fairway Avenue house uninvited around 2:05 a.m., talked to the homeowner for about a minute and then stated “I gotta go” and quickly left the house, according to a police report. The complainant then noticed his wallet — which contained a $100 bill, his license and a credit card — had disappeared from the couch. At this time Mr. Jensen was backing out of the driveway, officials said. Police searched the area, but Mr. Jensen was not found. Southold Town police were also notified, officials said. Riverhead police later located Mr. Jensen and charged him with felony fourth-degree grand larceny. • A Riverhead man was arrested for petit larceny in Riverhead last Wednesday. Wesley Shedrick, 44, was apprehended by Target store security around 7:15 p.m. after removing assorted soaps and personal care products from the store, officials said. He was charged with misdemeanor petit larceny. • Police arrested a Riverhead woman last Wednesday for a theft that occurred earlier this year. Alexis Fields, 41, allegedly removed an air mattress from Walmart around 11:30 p.m. Jan. 12 without paying for it, officials said. An investigation ensued and police reviewed store surveillance footage on March 3, which identified Ms. Fields. Ms. Fields was charged with misdemeanor petit larceny. • Police arrested Jorge Canel, 38, around 2:15 p.m. Saturday on Court Street for driving while intoxicated with a previous conviction and first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, both felonies. • A Flanders man was arrested for criminal possession of a forged instrument Friday.

The bump has resulted from investors who thought the new president would quickly deliver four pro-growth measures: tax cuts, health care reform, an infrastructure program, and deregulation. Time to rethink. 6:15 AM, May 20, 2017 | By Irwin M. Stelzer The Weekly Standard Sorry, you've reached the limit on the articles you can view. Trader Gregory Rowe works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photo credit: AP Photo/Richard Drew. I leave it to others to sort out who said what to whom about Russia, loyalty oaths, secrets, and other matters now roiling Washington. Instead, here is an attempt to sort out the economic consequences of the doings of our political class. If your portfolio is built on a belief that the Trump bump in share prices will endure and increase, you might want to have a rethink. That bump has been the result of a belief by investors that their new president would quickly deliver four pro-growth measures: tax cuts, health care reform, an infrastructure program, and deregulation. With the exception of the latter, which is moving along, none of these gifts is likely to be delivered in time for Christmas, if ever. A restructuring of the tax code was promised within the first 100 days, later amended to August by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as he attempted to cope with the fact that the president's math didn't add up. Trump's proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate from the statutory level of 35 percent to 15 percent, and large cuts in personal and small business taxes, with no offsetting revenue enhancements, would blow a hole in the federal budget large enough to induce either runaway inflation or a growth-crippling rise in interest rates. Or both. Republicans in Congress were having none of it, and came up with their own plan, with more moderate tax cuts and changes in the tax code aimed at filling the revenue gap the cuts create. Those reforms, which included an end to the deductibility of interest on business loans—beloved of highly indebted property developers, one of whom shuttles between the White House and Mar-a-Lago—did not attract the president's enthusiasm. And the House Republicans' plan to levy a VAT-like tax on imports met with snorts of derision from senators representing states loaded with Wal-Mart employees, not eager to see sales fall as off as the prices of imported sneakers, gadgets and T-shirts increase. Everyone, back to their respective drawing boards, with Mnuchin trying to figure out how large and unrealistic a growth rate he has to pencil in, and which budget cuts that he knows Congress will reject, to produce a budget that does not increase the deficit. Best guess is that sometime early in 2018 the president and Congress will agree on tax cuts but no significant reform of the tax code. When? Here's a clue: Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee has abandoned his practice of setting monthly progress goals for his members. The second source of the Trump bump was the belief that the president and his party would be able to follow through on their seven-year-long promise to "repeal and replace Obamacare". That feat would, investors believed, save the government $1 trillion over 10 years, to be used to offset revenue losses from cutting taxes. And it would drive down business costs, further enhancing profits and share values. It turns out "repeal" would be easy, "replace" somewhere between difficult and impossible. Trump's plan, which relieved high earners of the special investment tax on capital gains and dividends, also included less generous treatment of the poor and those with pre-existing medical conditions. That sounded more attractive to the president, who does not have to stand again until 2020, than it did to congressmen who will face the electorate next year. So back again to the drawing boards, with the Senate treating the House version as a series of political death traps to be avoided at all costs. The third factor underlying the optimism of investor-fans of Trump's program was the prospect of a "yuge" infrastructure package. That now seems even more remote than a tax cut or health care reform, as the president's ability to bring anti-spending Republicans along has been diminished by the reduced political clout resulting from presidential gaffes and an acute case of foot-in-mouth disease. On May 9 Trump fired James Comey, the director of the FBI, which he had every reason and right to do. Unfortunately, only a few months earlier he had conferred privately with Comey—Trump required others at the meeting to leave the room—and, according to what the New York Times claims are Comey's contemporaneous notes, asked the director to back down on some aspect(s) of the bureau's investigation of Russian involvement in the U.S. election. Worse, he demanded that the FBI director pledge loyalty to himself, in the manner of Marlon Brando's Godfather. Comey refused. Trump denies all of this, and sees the attendant fallout as part of "a witch hunt." One day later the president added another diversion of congressional attention from his economic program. He met with Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and its ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, with Russia's Tass photographer but no American press present. The topics quite properly included cooperation in defeating ISIS and how to prevent on-board computers from turning into deadly weapons on airplanes, as one did to bring down a Russian plane over Egypt. But there was more: It seems that the president revealed previously classified information—he has the power to declassify information, so his telling was not illegal—to the consternation of the Israeli intelligence services that provided it to their American counterparts, and the spooks in other countries who have been cooperating with us. President Vladimir Putin, ever helpful in such matters, has offered to resolve conflicting tales of what happened at the meeting by providing a transcript to the White House and Congress: He generally backs Trump's version of events. The Russian president's offer will almost certainly be accepted by Mueller, the widely respected former FBI director who was named special counsel to oversee the investigation of Russian influence on our election. For now, It is Trump and Putin claiming that they have not colluded to influence the election and that no secrets were passed to the Russians, vs. Comey, who is champing at the bit to bring his contemporaneous notes of meetings before the myriad congressional committees seeking the publicity his appearance would bring. And perhaps, but only perhaps, the truth. The significance of these presidential missteps cannot be overstated. For one thing, they prompt congressional Republicans to keep their distance, making them less subject to presidential pressure and cajoling when he tries to rally support for legislation. For another, they consume time that would otherwise be available for considering legislation. Lyndon Johnson once said of an opposition politician that he could not chew gum and walk at the same time (sanitized version). Congress cannot cope with Trump and legislate at the same time. Mac Thornberry, Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told an interviewer that "the political drama will drain the energy away from real accomplishments." To which Republican West Virginia senator Shelley Moore-Capito adds, "When you're not sure what's going to happen from the morning to the evening, to definitely takes your eye off the ball." John McCain, ever eager to make life difficult for a man who declared the Arizona senator not a war hero because he allowed himself to be captured, carried the commentary one step further, "We've seen this movie before. I think it's reaching the point where it's of Watergate size and scale." Meaning, let's start thinking about impeachment. Not a serious thought yet. But a bit of uncertainty to add to doubts about the durability of the Trump bump. Web Link: http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/2008139 Next Page Article TagsDonald Trump, tax reform, Irwin M.

Instead, here is an attempt to sort out the economic consequences of the doings of our political class. If your portfolio is built on a belief that the Trump bump in share prices will endure and increase, you might want to have a rethink. That bump has been the result of a belief by investors that their new president would quickly deliver four pro-growth measures: tax cuts, health care reform, an infrastructure program, and deregulation. With the exception of the latter, which is moving along, none of these gifts is likely to be delivered in time for Christmas, if ever. A restructuring of the tax code was promised within the first 100 days, later amended to August by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as he attempted to cope with the fact that the president's math didn't add up. Trump's proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate from the statutory level of 35 percent to 15 percent, and large cuts in personal and small business taxes, with no offsetting revenue enhancements, would blow a hole in the federal budget large enough to induce either runaway inflation or a growth-crippling rise in interest rates. Or both. Donald Trump, tax reform, Irwin M.

Amato-McCoy Automation may be mission-critical to operational longevity in the retail industry, but it could be creating a significant pool of “stranded workers.” Six million to 7.5 million retail jobs likely will be automated out of existence in the coming years, leaving a large portion of the retail workforce at risk of becoming “stranded workers.” Retail cashiers are at highest risk for automation technologies, and women hold 73% of these positions. That’s according to a new report, “Retail Automation: Stranded Workers? Opportunities and Risks for Labor and Automation,” conducted by Cornerstone Capital Group and commissioned by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. The report identifies the structural factors catalyzing change in the retail industry. The report details the technologies retailers are deploying, looks at the drivers of automation, and provides a framework to analyze the automation strategies of 30 large retail companies. In some cases, technology is complementing labor by freeing workers from mundane tasks and facilitating a more personalized customer experience. In others, technology has the potential to automate a significant part of the sales process and render a range of jobs redundant. Taken together, store closures and technology have the potential to dramatically alter the employment landscape in America. When it comes to adopting in-store technology, most of the surveyed companies are considering solutions such as mobile devices, self-checkout, digital kiosks and proximity beacons. In addition, sensor-based checkouts and smart shelves are a growing technology, as found in Amazon Go stores. What many people don’t realize is that 36% of retail workers currently receive some form of public assistance, and the average retail worker is 38 years old. Contrary to perceptions, 71% of retail workers are full-time employees. The study also indicates that Walmart and other large retailers have greater market share in communities with less than 500,000 people. If employment trends correlate to market share location, retail automation by retailers could disproportionately impact these smaller communities. “The retail landscape is changing rapidly and investors need to understand the social and governance issues impacting valuations for public companies in this sector,” said Erica Karp, Cornerstone founder and CEO. “Retailers are facing a perfect storm: they need to balance demand for wage increases with the negative optics of future job losses. The winners in retail will be companies that provide recruitment, retention and training for workers and innovate with forward-thinking future store strategies.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Lowe's acquires maintenance products distributor for $512 million Slide show: National Hardware Show gets going HDW expounds on move to Texas Ace gains on income with minimal movement on revenue Thoughts from retail's Top Guns Readers Respond: Bad looks on Canadian lumber deal HBSDealer Stock Watch: LL gets a double-digit boost Do it Best springs into action in Indy Ace rolls out new financing program NRF: Consumption tax system would cause retail spending, jobs to fall Poll Poll Businesses are increasingly under attack by hackers and cyber criminals.

Johnson Special to the Democrat-Gazette This article was published May 20, 2017 at 2:14 a.m. Comments (2) aAFont Size This year Arkansas witnessed a flurry of legislative activity, which, in itself, is not extraordinary. But this session, we received nationwide attention for the sheer volume of anti-LGBTQ proposals our lawmakers raised. Eleven anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced, up from two in the Legislature's previous session. These bills ran the gamut from legislation aimed at restricting facility access for transgender Arkansans to measures attempting to strip away the hard-won marriage rights of same-sex couples. Even though many of these anti-LGBTQ bills pushed different policy outcomes, they all had one thing in common: They targeted the LGBTQ community in Arkansas for discrimination. For a few disturbing weeks, it looked as if Arkansas was poised to pass the largest number of anti-LGBTQ bills in the country. Discriminatory proposals were flying through committees and legislative chambers. They included anti-trans measures, and others that would allow health-care providers a license to discriminate based on religious beliefs--basically allowing providers to turn away LGBTQ patients because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, or because of their HIV status or reproductive health needs. Thankfully, they all failed to become law. Despite a Republican supermajority in both chambers, our community was able to form a bipartisan coalition to successfully oppose these harmful measures. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were able to beat back these offensive, unnecessary bills and stop attacks on the LGBTQ community. Additionally, Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared early on in the session that anti-LGBTQ bills were not needed in Arkansas. He recognized the chaos and turmoil that flowed from the passage of the discriminatory HB2 law in North Carolina, and clearly had no interest in taking Arkansas down that road. This helped set the tone of his party's priorities this session, allowing space for Republican lawmakers to speak out against bills targeting the LGBTQ community. The hospitality industry also forcefully expressed its opposition to North Carolina-style anti-transgender measures, citing the catastrophic damage HB2 inflicted on their sector. Our success hinged on the strong coalition we forged with partner organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Arkansas Transgender Equality Coalition (ArTEC) and Stonewall Democrats, to name a few. We were thrilled to work with them, and to join lawmakers--both Republican and Democrat--who also worked alongside the Human Rights Campaign. This could also not have been possible without the efforts of businesses in Arkansas, including Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods, which have made equality part of their business models--something with which lawmakers are becoming more familiar. Arkansas has a troubled past when it comes to discrimination--a past that many do not want to repeat. Know this: The LGBTQ community appreciates the work our partner organizations, legislators and businesses undertook in this difficult year to ensure that Arkansas would not move backward when it comes to LGBTQ rights. We now continue our work to pass legislation to provide greater protections and dignity for LGBTQ Arkansans. We still are the only state in the nation that does not allow married same-sex couples who conceive through insemination or surrogacy to have both their names listed on birth certificates. And we still lack statewide nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people. That means a same-sex couple could get married on Saturday and be fired on Monday, simply for being LGBTQ. A transgender woman could be denied housing at an apartment complex because of her gender identity. And if a lesbian couple were assaulted because they dared to hold hands in public, they would not be protected under the state's existing hate-crimes laws. These are real problems that affect the lives of LGBTQ Arkansans, not fabricated like the "issues" anti-LGBTQ lawmakers raise. This legislative session, we stopped an assault on the rights and dignity of LGBTQ Arkansans. In the future, we must be allowed to pursue our fundamental freedom and the promise of fairness. And to move forward, we have to stop fighting the battles of our past. ------------v------------ Kendra R. Johnson is the state director for the Human Rights Campaign in Arkansas.

May 20, 2017 at 8:51 a.m. So thankful for the strong leadership of LGBTQ organizations and the rational leaders of our legislature and our governor for standing in the gap against the wave of discrimination mounted by some conservative legislators. We are more fortunate that some states like Texas where the Lt. Governor is calling for a special session, you read right, to pass a bathroom bill. Special sessions are usually for emergency issues that a state must address, not for state-sponsored discrimination. ... While our state weathered this storm of bigotry, the battle is not over. Legislators like Rapert, Ballinger, and Collins-Smith will continue to file their bills, all in the name of God and oppression. In their opinion, LGBTQ individuals are second class citizens not worthy of the same rights of others. These legislators rail against a nanny state while they push to create one of their own views. ... Just as race relations continues to improve decade after decade, so will the rights based on sexual identity continue to progress. What should be understood is that generations in the future will look back at these legislators, not with pride but with disgust. They are writing their own history, just like those who opposed the integration of Central High School. ( permalink | suggest removal ) JakeTidmore says... May 20, 2017 at 10:20 a.m. And what has Trump and his admin done regarding LGBTQ community? ** LGBTQ Turned a blind eye to illegal anti-transgender discrimination in schools. The Trump administration revoked Title IX guidance issued by the Department of Education clarifying schools’ long-standing obligations under federal civil rights law to treat transgender students equally and with dignity. Nearly 1 in 6 out transgender K-12 students have been forced to leave school because of this harassment. Erased LGBTQ people from federal surveys, making it impossible to know if government programs serve them fairly. Now they cannot ensure LGBTQ people have equal access to key government services such as Meals on Wheels. The administration also appears to have included—but then gone back and omitted—questions about LGBTQ people from the American Community Survey, an annual survey that gathers information about Americans’ educational attainment, housing, and health coverage. Appointed longtime opponents of LGBTQ rights—including members of anti-LGBTQ hate groups—to key administration positions. Many of President Trump’s appointees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, made their careers standing in the way of LGBTQ rights—and now, they’re in charge of agencies that enforce those very rights. The appointments get even more disturbing the closer you look: Trump tapped Ken Blackwell, a former fellow at an anti-LGBTQ hate group, as a domestic policy adviser; selected leaders of the hate group C-FAM for the president’s delegation to the United Nations; and appointed Roger Severino, a longtime opponent of transgender civil rights, to run the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights. Proposed slashing funding for research to cure HIV/AIDS. President Trump has proposed devastating cuts to health research, including $6 billion in cuts to the National Institutes of Health in the budget and a $50 million cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s HIV research and prevention programs. The administration has also pushed a $300 million cut to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Barred refugees and asylum seekers fleeing anti-LGBTQ persecution from protection in the United States. President Trump’s refugee suspension blocked LGBTQ Syrian and Iraqi refugees from finding protection in the United States, leaving them stranded in countries where they are persecuted. His policy of detaining all immigrants who enter at the southern border and expanding the populations targeted for deportation traps LGBTQ asylum seekers in dangerous immigrant detention facilities and increases the risk that they will be wrongly deported to countries where their lives are at risk. The administration also decided to close the only dedicated transgender immigrant detention pod in the country, leaving transgender immigrants in detention at risk.

SHARE Get to know your native plants at program Chainpod Townsend’s daisy Perky Sue Mormon tea Longleaf phlox Indian paintbrush Hopi blanketflower Globemallow Cushion buckwheat QUICKREAD JOIN THE PROGRAM The Native Plant Master Program is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Though the Colorado National Monument class dates have already passed, you can still sign up for other classes on Grand Mesa and at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in June and July, if you do so as soon as possible. The courses cost $50 per location with a volunteer commitment or $75 without volunteer hours.

A Native Plant open house also will be held from 9–11 a.m. June 10 at the Ute Learning Garden at the Colorado State University Extension office at the Mesa County Fairgrounds. It is free and open to the public. By Erin McIntyre Friday, May 19, 2017 Mother Nature is an incredible gardener. And if you’ve ever wondered about the hardy fauna of the high desert and wanted to be that person who knows the name of that pretty yellow flower blooming over there, there’s a way to become a master. A Native Plant Master, that is. Think of it as a training to help you become that cool person who knows all the names of the flowers on the hikes, so your companions can be awed when you point out a cluster of orange globemallow or educate them on the uses of four-winged saltbush or piñon pine. In Colorado, you can become a Master Gardener with training and completing required volunteer hours helping the public with gardening issues and questions. But you can also become a Native Plant Master with informative on-site classes with the outdoors as your learning lab, and you commit to spreading the knowledge you learn to a certain number of people each year. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the program, which has a goal of helping people get to know native plants and educate them about sustainable landscapes and weed management. And here in western Colorado, participants get to have Grand Mesa, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and Colorado National Monument as their classrooms. Mike Calabro of Grand Junction is one of the instructors, and he helps teach Grand Mesa classes on three weekend days in July. He took the course himself in 2010, and then returned to help others acquire knowledge about native plants. Each of the locations includes information about at least 60 plants, and participants learn how to identify them, their possible uses, and whether they’re native plants or were introduced to the area. For Calabro, being a Native Plant Master is about the history of the plants and their place in the environment where they interact with animals and humans. He’s especially fascinated by how Native Americans used plants, as he also volunteers at the museum and loves history. “I’m not a botanist,” he said. “I like the stories that the plants tell.” Sometimes, the stories are like that of the yucca, a prolific native plant with many uses. “You learn that it was kind of like the Wal-Mart for the Native Americans — it had everything,” he said. “You really learn to appreciate it, after you know they used the roots to make shampoo and they ate the blossoms and used the fiber.” His favorite plant in the program is a little hard to find: a rose-colored plant called prairie smoke found on Grand Mesa that he loves sharing with others. From mountain mahogany to Indian paintbrush, participants learn about native plants’ many uses and interesting facts about how they fit into the ecology of the area. Overall, Calabro said the classes taught him to appreciate the value of all plants and their place in the environment, and he found it rewarding enough to want to share with others. “I used to tend to overlook small plants,” he said. “You start noticing the smaller things and the details and the bugs and the different animals that use them. It just makes it so much more enjoyable.” ■ Erin McIntyre is an advanced master gardener and journalist.

Not so fast: Many indicators suggest that retail employment is unlikely to shrivel and the economy will withstand any shock from the sector’s rout. Granted, the industry’s current woes can’t be ignored. Retail sales account for almost half of consumer spending, which in turn makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Retailers employ 15.9 million people, or about one in every 10 U.S. workers, and positions at certain types of stores may become harder to find. For starters, the broad trend in retail purchases is moving higher: Excluding auto dealers and gas stations, sales were up an annualized 4.6 percent over the past three months. Even with recent job losses, retail headcount is close to its 12-month average. Such figures suggest the industry is hardly about to shrink or fade away. Even with the “eye-catching headlines about store closings” and other recent struggles in retail, “we don’t see much of an effect on retail employment and therefore on consumer spending,” said Robert Sockin, an economist at UBS Securities LLC, which issued research last week titled “Reports of Retail’s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated”. “As long as there’s demand for workers and the consumer stays healthy, that will keep the retail sector buoyant.” It’s true that store closings are already outpacing those of 2008, when the U.S. was in a deep recession, according to an April 6 report from Credit Suisse. About 2,880 announcements so far this year exceed the 1,153 over the same period of 2016, the investment bank said. Macy’s Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. are shutting hundreds of locations combined, and shoe chain Payless Inc. recently joined the list of retailers filing for bankruptcy.   Driving the doom and gloom are pockets of weakness such as department stores and clothing chains that are casualties in the battle between brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. While that has led to consolidation and a shift of market share from traditional and mall-based locations to more agile online businesses, the latter’s share of total retail sales remains below 10 percent.  The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Employment data reflect the pain -- general-merchandise stores lost jobs in five of the past six months while nonstore retailers are expanding payrolls, though not at a fast enough pace to make up for the shortfall. Still, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire more than 30,000 part-time workers over the next year, in addition to 100,000 full-time positions, for its growing network of warehouses around the country. With the industry in a so-called overbuilt situation, a real-estate shakeout is not uncommon every few years, and the rise of online retailers is worsening the distress this time. Underneath the hubbub is the news that some companies are actually expanding their selling space and realizing the need to have a strong presence both physically and online. Ulta Beauty Inc. plans to add 100 stores a year, with a goal of eventually having 1,700 U.S. locations. Amazon is opening bookstores and online eyeglasses-retailer Warby Parker is setting up more stores. Adding to the mix, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, is intensifying its e-commerce push, while Kenneth Cole Productions plans to shutter stores in favor of selling on the Internet.  Malls and their stores, while not as much of a destination as they were in their heyday, aren’t about to vanish completely. A report from Cowen & Co. shows most customers still prefer to shop in physical stores 75 percent of the time. Stores open and close all the time, so what really matters are net closings and net employment dictated by companies’ expansion and contraction rather than just store closings, according to UBS. Based on historical patterns, Sockin expects net retail jobs to rise in 2017. At 4.2 percent, the retail unemployment rate is below the nation’s 4.4 percent, and the industry’s job openings and quits -- a measure of confidence in being able to find another job -- each posted the second-best March in more than 15 years. And the American shopper, the pillar of the household spending-driven economy, remains on solid ground amid robust job growth, improving finances, and low borrowing costs. Even as department stores lose traffic, consumers are spending on services and shopping at sellers of health and beauty products, electronics, furniture. Their purchasing power is the best bet against the misplaced fear that the ailing retail industry is heading to the graveyard. As Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, put it, “while we’ve seen these headlines, the consumer hasn’t gone away.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said she has mailed an apology for her “terrible lapse in judgment.” The apology from Council Member Melissa Maher comes after a recent dust-up on social media over a comment she made earlier this month on Emmer’s Facebook page. Maher posted the comment, which has since been deleted, about the congressman’s visit to a Wright County alfalfa farm. She wrote: “If I were you Emmer, I’d avoid people who have a lot of deadly objects at hand. Selling us all out was not a good plan for your future. You’re a coward and a party whore.” Maher, a lawyer, said she wrote in anger over Emmer’s vote for the American Health Care Act, a House GOP measure designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Emmer’s staff immediately called upon Maher to apologize, and some on social media suggested she resign from the council. Maher, who said she has no plans to resign, mailed the apology on May 9 and has also apologized to Lino Lakes city leaders. In a separate letter to the general public, Maher wrote that she is “embarrassed and ashamed of [her] conduct.” Hannah Covington BAYTOWN TOWNSHIP County Fair officials want indoor horse arena Fortunes are changing for one of the last county fairgrounds in Minnesota without an indoor horse arena. The Washington County Board agreed last week to provide $50,000 to the county’s Agricultural Society toward the cost of designing and building an indoor arena at the fairgrounds in Baytown Township. Dan Dolan, president of the Agricultural Society, requested the funding to support horse-related activities during the county fair and at other events throughout the year. “The kids, time and time again, have got rained out there,” Dolan told commissioners. Some horses were hurt in the mud at the outdoor arena, he said. Last summer, the fair drew 51,000 visitors. An indoor arena will draw even more, Dolan said. Commissioners said contributing to the fair’s financial success benefits the entire county. “I appreciate the economic development portion of this,” said Gary Kriesel. Kevin Giles Roseville City to host ceremony for ‘newest Americans’ Amid tensions around immigration, Roseville is inviting residents to a ceremony honoring “our newest American citizens.” The city will host a naturalization ceremony at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, May 24, at its Skating Center, 2661 Civic Center Drive. The city’s Human Rights Commission will coordinate the event with federal court officials to welcome about 50 people taking the oath of citizenship. David Peterson Blaine City leaders hoping to lure upscale grocery Blaine is casting its nets for a high-end grocery store, with Hy-Vee emerging as a lead prospect. City leaders cite residents’ growing appetite for something more upscale than its existing Cub Foods, Wal-Mart, Target or Aldi stores. The north metro suburb of 63,000 recently became Anoka County’s biggest city, surpassing Coon Rapids. “This area wants high-end,” Council Member Dave Clark said at a recent work session. “If we approved an Aldi, they would come in here with pitchforks.” Council members heard an update this month on efforts to gauge the interest of potential stores. City staffers reached out to officials with Hy-Vee, Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme, Kowalski’s, Lunds & Byerlys and Trader Joe’s about opening a Blaine location. Only Hy-Vee is actively searching for a site, according to Erik Thorvig, the city’s economic development coordinator. Council members told staffers to keep courting the other chains as well, in case they later decide to enter Blaine’s market. Thorvig said he plans to contact Whole Foods again and offer the company’s real estate broker a tour of the city. Hannah Covington ROSEVILLE Olson named assistant city manager Rebecca Olson, who held the same job in Shoreview and Blaine, has been named Roseville’s new assistant city manager, the city’s first since 2002. Olson arrives with 18 years of state and municipal government experience, including three years as assistant to the city manager in Shoreview and about a decade as assistant to the city manager in Blaine. She will oversee day-to-day operations and services of administration in Roseville, including City Council and commission support, communications, volunteer coordination, human resources, city clerk functions and elections.

The 4-year-old boy was found by motorists along U.S. 25 at about 6 p.m. Wednesday, WKYT-TV reported. Williamsburg Police Chief Wayne Bird said it was the third time in recent months that police have had to rescue the child after he wandered off. In one instance, Bird said he found the boy wearing only a diaper. And a week and a half ago, he said a deputy jailer was able to retrieve the boy and help get him into his grandfather’s car after the child ran into traffic. On previous occasions, Bird said his office had called social services but had not charged the mother, Barbara Vanderpool. On Wednesday, he said, “we felt like we didn’t have a choice.” Bird said Vanderpool had left the child in the care of his great-grandparents, who were not able to keep up with him. He said responding officers found the boy on the sidewalk at least a quarter of a mile from the home. He told them “he hadn’t had anything to eat all day” and was walking to Wal-Mart to get some cookies or chips. Bird said he was several miles from the Williamsburg Wal-Mart. Vanderpool, 24, was arrested Wednesday and charged with endangering the welfare of a minor. She was taken to the Whitley County Detention Center. She was released Thursday on a $1,000 surety bond.

Eleven of the 15 rings taken from Gold & Gems Fine Jewelry last week remain missing after Anthony Michael Verastegui, 25, allegedly stole a jewelry display while Kelli N. O'Neil, 22, and Jonathon Andres Collins, 24, created a diversion. Each ring was valued greater than $1,000, and the lot's value totaled $61,000, according to documents filed by Ashland police. On May 10, store surveillance allegedly captured Verastegui reaching behind a counter and taking the display from a glass case while O'Neil and Collins caused the distraction, an affidavit shows.  Later that day, Verastegui allegedly conspired with another suspect, who sold one of the stolen rings to Rogue Valley Coin and Jewelry for $150. The fourth suspect has not been charged in the crime, court documents show, but Verastegui reportedly told police he enlisted the person to sell it because he, O'Neil and Collins lacked identification needed to sell the ring. Police seized the ring sold to Rogue Valley Coin and Jewelry, along with three others in Verastegui's possession, when Medford police arrested him Saturday, May 13, on unrelated burglary, theft, robbery and heroin possession charges. The unrelated charges stem from an residential burglary and a thwarted shoplift attempt at the south Medford Walmart Saturday in which he allegedly resisted arrest. Verastegui earlier this week entered not guilty pleas on felony charges of first-degree burglary and first-degree theft in the burglary case. He remained lodged in the Jackson County Jail Friday on $65,000 bail, records show. Verastegui, Collins and O'Neil each have appearances in Jackson County Circuit Court Friday afternoon on a felony count of aggravated first-degree theft. Collins and O'Neil remained lodged Friday on respective bails of $10,000 and $5,000. Neither has a prior criminal history in Jackson County, records show. — Reach reporter Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or nmorgan@mailtribune.com. Follow him on Twitter at @MTCrimeBeat.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pool Safely and Michael Phelps Foundation Announce Partnership to Help Families Stay Safer In and Around Pools and Spas Michael Phelps announces Phelps Foundation partnership with Pool Safely Michael Phelps takes his Pool Safely Pledge selfie Group photo with Michael Phelps at the Pool Safely Safer Summer Swimming event Michael Phelps announces Phelps Foundation partnership with Pool Safely Michael Phelps takes his Pool Safely Pledge selfie Group photo with Michael Phelps at the Pool Safely Safer Summer Swimming event CHICAGO – At a poolside press event today, hosted at a Boys & Girls Club in Chicago, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) Pool Safely campaign and the Michael Phelps Foundation announced a new partnership focused on addressing a serious public health crisis: child drownings. Pool Safely and the Michael Phelps Foundation will collaborate to promote each other’s efforts to help prevent fatal and non-fatal child drownings in swimming pools and spas across the country. The Michael Phelps Foundation joins more than 1,000 Pool Safely partners that work together to educate individuals and families nationwide about the importance of being safer in and around the water. “CPSC is excited to collaborate with the greatest swimmer in the history of the sport and his Foundation to help educate millions of Americans and their families about the simple water safety steps that can save lives,” said CPSC Commissioner Joseph Mohorovic, who participated in today’s event. “By working together in a public-private partnership, Pool Safely and the Michael Phelps Foundation’s im program will help kids have a safer time in and around the water, this summer and beyond.” “We are pleased to partner with CPSC’s national drowning prevention campaign and continue to raise awareness for water safety initiatives,” said Michael Phelps, President of the Michael Phelps Foundation. “Our im program reaches thousands of youth and young adults year-round with water safety, wellness and goal-setting programming. The progress we have made to date is very encouraging, but we have more work to do. We are committed to helping people have a better understanding of how to be safer, yet still have fun, in and around the water. Join us – and other Olympic swimmers – in taking the Pool Safely Pledge!” “New data from the Pool Safely campaign shows a 17 percent decline in fatal drownings in pools since 2010 among the most vulnerable population: children younger than five,” said CPSC Acting Chairman Ann Marie Buerkle. “We are making progress, but we need even more kids taking swim lessons, more adults serving as Water Watchers, more fences installed, and more people trained in CPR.  Today’s swimming lesson with Michael and his Foundation serves as a reminder of the importance of all children learning how to swim—no matter where they live or what their circumstance.” At the partnership event, clinic participants received swim instruction, as well as learned about the importance of water safety. Children also took the Pool Safely Pledge, which affirms that they will: never swim alone, ask parents for swimming lessons, and stay away from drains in pools and hot tubs. Since its inception in 2010, the Pool Safely campaign has developed a network of partners that serve as the lifeblood of the campaign. These groups include local safety organizations to national entities, such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Walmart, the American Red Cross, YMCA of the USA, the National Drowning Prevention Alliance and the Boy Scouts of America. Pool Safely partners have played a critical part in the campaign’s effort to increase awareness of water safety and prevent fatal and nonfatal child drownings and drain entrapments in pools and spas. Pool Safely is CPSC’s public education and outreach effort to prevent drownings and entrapments in swimming pools and spas. The campaign provides a number of resources to help parents teach their children about water safety, including a new Kids Corner on the campaign’s newly designed website where parents will find: the Pool Safely Song, written and recorded by children’s performer Laurie Berkner; “The Adventures of Splish and Splash” smartphone app, available for free download on Android and Apple products; and the Pool Safely Pledge, with Pledges specifically designed for kids (adults should take their version as well). About Pool Safely        CPSC’s Pool Safely campaign (www.PoolSafely.gov) is a national public education effort to reduce fatal child drownings, non-fatal drownings and entrapments in swimming pools and spas. The campaign focuses on populations most at risk of drowning: children younger than 5 years old (who represent nearly 75 percent of child drowning fatalities) and African-American and Hispanic children between the ages of 5 and 14, who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drown at higher rates than white children. CPSC reports that annually there are more than 356 pool or spa-related drownings for children younger than 15. Pool Safely, a national public education campaign supporting the requirements of Section 1407 of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, works with partners around the country to reduce child drownings, non-fatal drownings and entrapment incidents in swimming pools and spas. Parents, caregivers, and the media are encouraged to visit: PoolSafely.gov or on Twitter for vital safety information regarding the prevention of child drownings in and around pools and spas. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. About Michael Phelps Foundation The Michael Phelps Foundation is focused on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthy and active lives, especially for children. Founded in 2008, the Foundation has provided their learn to swim, healthy eating and goal setting curriculum to over 16,000 people around the world by partnering with the Special Olympics and Boys & Girls Club of America. They also support the Level Field Fund – Swimming, because opportunities to pursue excellence in sport should not be limited by an athlete’s financial situation.

Next up could be jobs at your local stores. Between 6 million to 7.5 million existing jobs are at risk of being replaced over the course of the next 10 years by some form of automation, according to a new study this week from by financial services firm Cornerstone Capital Group. That represents at least 38% of the current retail work force, which consists of 16 million workers. Retail could actually lose a greater proportion of jobs to automation than manufacturing has, according to the study. That doesn’t mean that robots will be roving the aisles of your local department store chatting with customers. Instead, expect to see more automated checkout lines instead of cashiers. This shift alone will likely eliminate millions of jobs. “Cashiers are considered one of the most easily automatable jobs in the economy,” said the report. And these job losses will hit women particularly hard, since about 73% of cashiers are women. There will also be fewer sales jobs, as more and more consumers use in-store smartphones and touchscreen computers to find what they need, said John Wilson, head of research at Cornerstone. There will still be some sales people on the floor, but just not as many of them. Stocking shelves and inventory control, a labor intensive job function today, will also be made far more efficient with automation, he said. “You’re not going to see a robot stocking shelves, at least in the near term,” Wilson said. “But technology would reduce the need for as many people to do so. More efficiency means fewer things for people to do.” The retail industry is already undergoing cataclysmic changes, with about 3,300 store closings announced so far this year, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology, a retail think tank. But automation will drive more job losses than store closings in the next decade, Wilson said. “Store closings have to do with overbuilding and e-commerce,” Wilson said. “But going forward, job losses will really be about automation.” Rising wages are also helping to drive automation, as state and city governments hike their minimum wages. Additionally, several major retailers including Walmart, the nation’s largest employer, have increased wages in order to find and retain the workers they need. The increased competition from e-commerce is also a factor, since it requires retailers to be as efficient as possible in order to compete. Amazon already uses tons of robotics in its fulfillment centers so that its workers spend very little time on each order. 40.712784 -74.005941 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
